Troubled US teens left traumatised by tough love camps,"As one of the most famous faces of the 2000s, people think they know the story of Paris Hilton. So, when the 40-year-old released a YouTube documentary about her life last year, many were shocked to learn about her decades-long struggle with trauma. Hilton tearfully recounted how she was woken up by strangers in her bedroom in the middle of the night as a teenager and forcibly taken across the country. She said her unanswered cries for help repeatedly play out in nightmares which make it difficult to sleep. Her story, though shocking, is not unique. Hilton is one of thousands of American children sent every year by their parents into a private network of ""tough love"" residential programmes and schools marketed at reforming their behaviour. No-one knows how many for sure, because nobody is keeping track. ""My parents got me kidnapped and dropped off in the middle of the mountains,"" 21-year-old Daniel says in a TikTok video watched more than a million times. As a teenager, Daniel suffered anxiety and depression. He was 15 and had recently come out as gay when he self-harmed so severely that he required hospital care. It was in hospital that he was shaken awake in the middle of the night by two men. They told him the process could be easy or hard - depending on how much he resisted. With little fight left in him, Daniel went with the pair. But when he asked a stranger if he could use a telephone to call his parents on a brief stop for food, he says the escorts threatened him with handcuffs. Daniel was sent to a wilderness programme in Georgia where he spent 77 days living outdoors, hiking miles a day on rations. He vividly remembers feeling cold, hungry and dirty for weeks on end and witnessing others attempt to run away and try to take their own lives. Like many others sent to wilderness programmes, he was then enrolled directly into a long-term facility - this time in Montana - where he would spend another 15 months. The Troubled Teen Industry (TTI) has become an umbrella term for a wide scope of private residential programmes like these aimed at modifying adolescent behaviour. From boot camps to boarding schools, these facilities are marketed as treatment for a broad range of behavioural and mental health issues including eating disorders, drug use and defiance. The people who took Hilton and Daniel were from companies specially marketed to families concerned about how their children might react to being enrolled in a programme. These youth transportation services are well-advertised and often come recommended, with parents typically paying a few thousand dollars to have their children taken from their beds and securely dropped off across the country. Parents are sometimes referred to the industry by third parties after feeling they have exhausted other means of getting their children help. Programmes sell themselves on high levels of anecdotal success, with testimonials from families and students on their marketing materials and in online reviews describing them as transformative and even life-saving. But for years, other former residents have been painting a very different picture of their time within these facilities, including in lawsuits and criminal complaints, alleging emotional and physical abuse. The BBC has spoken to 20 people who identify as troubled teen survivors, aged from 20 to their late 40s, about their experiences within the industry over the last few decades. Although their individual backgrounds and reasons for being sent away differ, patterns emerge across their accounts and the hundreds more shared in TTI survivor support networks online. The size of the industry and its yearly turnover of teenagers across the US remains elusive because there is no federal regulator monitoring it. The US Government Accountability Office was tasked with investigating allegations of neglect and abuse across the industry in 2007, but found it difficult to grasp the national picture due to irregular licensing rules at the state level and ambiguity surrounding the labels facilities use to describe themselves - like boot camps or therapeutic boarding schools. Their investigators found thousands of allegations of abuse and examined a number of deaths at behavioural programmes across the US and in American-owned businesses operating abroad. Their reports raised concerns about the level of training required of staff as well as what they described as deceptive and questionable marketing practices aimed at parents. Subsequent hearings in Congress saw parents whose children died within the industry testify. Cynthia Clark Harvey was one of them. Her daughter Erica was just 15 when she died of heatstroke and dehydration on her first full day in a wilderness programme in Nevada in 2002. Cynthia remembers her daughter as a bright, thoughtful and athletic young girl who had always done well academically until she began suffering from mental health problems aged 14. Her struggles led her to become suicidal and begin experimenting with illegal drugs. When Erica was admitted to hospital and excluded from school, the family felt frightened and out of their depth. At the time, the situation felt drastic. Erica had been doing better but her psychiatrist recommended that residential treatment could help her path to recovery. The programme her family chose was well-known and accredited. They felt reassured Erica was in safe hands and would grow from the experience. After weeks of deliberation and planning, they travelled to Nevada under the guise of a family trip with her younger sister. When the deception was revealed, Erica became scared and angry and refused to get out of the car. After a turbulent hours-long group therapy session with other families, she and the other children were taken away. This was the last time Cynthia and her husband ever saw their daughter alive. By the time they got back home to Arizona the following evening, there was already a message waiting on their answering phone telling them to call. They were told Erica had an accident and staff were performing CPR. ""I don't remember the time frame, but at that point she probably had been dead already for quite some time,"" Cynthia says. Erica's obituary could only say that she died hiking in Nevada. Her parents would not find out her cause of death for weeks - and it took years and a lawsuit for them to get records and find out the truth of what happened that day. Cynthia says they eventually settled with the programme for an undisclosed amount on the condition they could speak freely about the circumstances of their daughter's death. She learned Erica had been pushed to keep hiking as her condition worsened throughout the day. She later testified to Congress about how her daughter's distress had been mistaken for teenage belligerence by staff. Even after Erica fell off the trail into brush and rocks, she did not receive medical help for almost an hour. The remote location of the trek and a series of blunders in calling help to their location meant it took hours more for an emergency helicopter to arrive and take her to hospital where she was officially declared dead, long past the point her life could have been saved. Cynthia continues to grapple with regret and grief over what happened and came to connect with other parents who found themselves in the same unimaginable position. No criminal charges were ever filed over her daughter's death but 19 years on, Cynthia continues to speak publicly in favour of industry-wide reform. The National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs (Natsap) - the largest membership association of its kind - appeared on behalf of the industry in the congressional hearings, where it was grilled by lawmakers about the protections and checks in place. Natsap's website today says it and the industry have changed over time. It emphasises that it has ethical standards in place and requires members to be licensed by their appropriate state agency or a national accrediting body and have therapeutic services overseen by a qualified clinician, though it does not accredit facilities themselves. Campaigners argue that current levels of oversight are not enough. They say the lack of cohesive national monitoring has allowed bad actors to move around the industry and can enable facilities to rebrand under new names and distance themselves from complaints. In online networks they have built, people who identify as survivors of the industry connect and offer support across the country - pooling information and resources to track alleged abuses and a revolving door of programmes and staff. One Reddit forum on the topic has more than 20,000 members alone. While a number of the more controversial programmes and organisations have closed down in recent years, allegations continue to plague the industry. A lot of the stories and experiences former residents recounted to the BBC had a lot in common - whether they got out decades ago or within the last couple of years. Many described arrival processes that left them feeling degraded and dehumanised. Those taken by transport companies described the process as disorienting and frightening. Some, including sex abuse victims, complained of invasive strip searches and examinations. One person, who was sent due to struggles with depression stemming from gender dysphoria, recounted undergoing a smear test as a virgin aged 14. Others described having their heads shaved and having blood and drugs testing despite having no history of substance abuse themselves. Some claim to have witnessed and experienced practices like isolation and restraint and say they were also expected to punish and restrain others. Many of the systems they described were based on levels where active participation, including in ""attack therapy"" sessions where group members are expected to confront and criticise one another, was required to progress and gain basic privileges. Others described arbitrary physical labour, collective punishments and periods of mandated silence which could last weeks. They all described repressive environments with extreme limits and censorship of their contact with the outside world. Many believe their parents were misled about the reality of the programmes they enrolled them in, and describe rules that seeded mistrust between them and their families. Some recounted ongoing damage to relationships and enduring fears of opening up about their experiences, even after leaving, for fear of being sent back or not being believed. Some told the BBC they witnessed physical violence, self-harm and suicide attempts and many know other residents who took their own lives after leaving. Others have subsequently been diagnosed with conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and say they continue to suffer long-term social difficulties, including in trusting in others, because of their experience. In 2006, journalist Maia Szalavitz wrote a book that urged parents to seek evidence-based treatment for children instead of resorting to behavioural modification facilities. Her book traces the origins of many of the methods used in the industry, including confrontational group therapy, to controversial and discredited programmes from decades ago. Advocates for change say the teenage ""tough love"" industry, which first began to take off in the 1980s, has been able to endure decades of controversy in part because of social stigma surrounding the issues why parents seek help. It is not uncommon for teenagers to spend years within the system and monthly tuition, sometimes in the thousands, can mount up fast. Many, including Szalavitz, believe those referring families can exploit or exaggerate fears children will end up dead or incarcerated because of issues like drug abuse. Both she and Dr Kate Truitt, a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist who works with former residents, say the trauma experienced at these facilities can actually perpetuate or lead to long-term battles with addiction and abusive relationships. Many ex-residents, including some the BBC spoke to, say they initially viewed their treatment as justified and even advocated for others to send their children. Some took years to change their opinion of their programme after they reflected on their experiences. Dr Truitt compares the trauma she has seen in some former residents to that experienced by former members of cults or prisoners of war. She points out that their experiences can be particularly damaging as adolescence is such a critical time for development. ""And because of the type of specific trauma they've endured, most survivors don't feel safe seeking out treatment, because the people who were the treatment providers are the perpetrators,"" she tells the BBC. Paris Hilton revealed she had already run away from a number of other placements before she was taken to Provo Canyon in Utah and kept for almost a year before she turned 18. The documentary This is Paris shows her reuniting with classmates as they go public with their ongoing trauma from alleged experiences of emotional and physical abuse there, including allegations of punishments like solitary confinement. Provo Canyon remains open. A statement pinned to the top of their website says it was sold to new owners in 2000 and it cannot comment on operations or patient experiences before this time. They also say they do not use methods like seclusion or mechanical restraint now. Hilton's documentary has been watched almost 30 million times and she has continued vocal advocacy since its release. This role marks a drastic departure from the persona she built her celebrity brand and business empire around. Although her teenage history was already known among those who went through the same systems, they say having someone as high-profile come forward has helped bring credibility and awareness to the issue. People within the community say the documentary has empowered some to speak out about their experience for the first time or has been useful to help others, including parents, understand what they went through. Some former residents have united under the idea of #BreakingCodeSilence, in reference to the periods of mandated social isolation used as a punishment and as a method of control in some facilities. ""One of the rules in many of these programmes is that you couldn't take anyone's phone number or name when you left. So, we were never meant to connect,"" Katherine McNamara, who went to Provo with Hilton, says about the groups that have emerged on social media. She and some others are now working together on a non-profit to help raise awareness, support those who identify as survivors and advocate for change. Other celebrities, including Paris Jackson and tattoo artist Kat von D, have been inspired by the documentary to come forward. Rapper Bhad Bhabie, real name Danielle Bregoli, has called for television personality Dr Phil to apologise for sending her and other teenagers to troubled teen facilities on his popular US show. It came after another former guest filed a lawsuit alleging she had been punished for reporting an alleged sexual assault by a staff member at the same therapeutic boarding ranch Bregoli was sent to. The facility, which the BBC contacted for a response, has previously denied the allegations against it and disputed their accounts. Phil McGraw said in an interview he was sad to hear of Bregoli's alleged bad experience but distanced himself and his show from her claims. Younger people, once isolated from their teenage peers because of their experience, are using social media to try and break the stigma. Some have gained huge followings on platforms like TikTok from telling their stories. But none of this is without personal risk - the BBC has seen legal letters sent to one content creator after they spoke publicly. Daniel has gained more than 240,000 followers and millions of likes since he started telling his and other people's stories last year. He now gets dozens of messages every day from others who went through similar situations and has had parents contact him to say they've reconsidered plans to send their children away after seeing his videos. ""If my 15-year-old self knew that people were out there fighting for me, I would have felt so relieved,"" he says about the movement. In some cases, social media has been a tool for tangible change. One woman, Amanda Householder, used TikTok to spread awareness of allegations surrounding her parents' treatment of girls at a religious boarding ranch they were running in Missouri. Millions viewed her videos and eventually officials closed the school. Prosecutors later filed more than 100 charges of physical and sexual abuse against the pair, which they have denied. All this attention has coincided with a cascade of state-level legislative reform. Householder testified to end religious exemptions in the state of Missouri that stopped even basic oversight of conditions at private religious facilities like the one her parents ran. She described the experience to the BBC as ""very catharticâ¦ knowing that maybe in the future kids won't have to go through what we went through"" and says she hopes to give evidence in their criminal case. Hilton was part of a group who spoke at a hearing to convince lawmakers to introduce better protections in Utah - the state thought to have the biggest density of troubled teen facilities in the US. ""I don't know if my nightmares will ever go away, but I do know that there are hundreds of thousands of kids going through this, and maybe if I stop their nightmares, it will help me stop mine,"" she testified. But for her and others, the real end goal is national change. Previous attempts to push for federal oversight and regulation have repeatedly faltered in Congress. But a spokesperson for Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff's office confirmed to the BBC that he is working to update and re-introduce legislation aimed at prohibiting and ending abuse at residential treatment centres and increasing national oversight of such facilities. Today, Erica Harvey should be in her mid-30s. ""It doesn't get better as the years go on, because it's just more milestones that go by,"" Cynthia reflects. It's been well over a decade since she took part in hearings pushing for federal regulation. But against all odds, she remains hopeful. Cynthia has been emboldened by the momentum building over the last year as more and more have come forward. ""When I first started doing my work after Erica's death, there were survivors out there, but they were not being listened to. And now they're starting to get listened to.""

Crowds celebrate Scotland's 0-0 draw with EnglandThere was a large police presence in London's Leicester Square and George Square in Glasgow.Scotland,"A crowd of football supporters gathered in George Square Crowds gathered in London's Leicester Square and George Square in Glasgow following Scotland's 0-0 draw with England. Scotland fans have been celebrating the result, which keeps alive hopes they could still qualify for the next round of the Euro 2020 tournament. There was large police presence in both cities, and in London 30 people were arrested, the Met Police said. Most arrests were made in central London and near Wembley Stadium. The force said offences included violence and disorder, possession of drugs, possession of an offensive weapon, racial aggravation, drunk and disorderly behaviour and assault of a police officer, who suffered minor injuries. When a ""large"" crowd gathered in Leicester Square, flares were set off as fans, many wearing kilts and draped in Scotland flags, sang Flower of Scotland and chanted ""No Scotland, no party"". Scotland frustrate England at Wembley Live: Reaction to the the England v Scotland result In pictures: Scotland fans celebrate England result The Met Police said at 00:45 BST officers encouraged people still in Leicester Square to leave, finally clearing the area by 01:15 BST. TV coverage of the game drew an average audience of 13.1 million, a peak of 20 million and a 79% audience share across ITV and STV. The match set a new streaming record for the channel with 4.8 million streams across ITV Hub and STV Player. It also becomes the most-watched football match in terms of peak viewing numbers since ITV's coverage of England's World Cup semi-final against Croatia in 2018, which earned 27.5 million viewers. Thousands of supporters travelled south for the matchdespite being urged not to unless they had a ticket or had organised somewhere to watch the game. Earlier adispersal order was issued for central London, giving police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress. There was no indication of disorder in George Square but unauthorised large gatherings are prohibited in Scotland under Covid rules. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had urged fans to ""be respectful to our hosts"" in London and not to behave in any way that was going to make the Covid problem worse. This video can not be played Supporters at Glasgow fan zone react to Scotland's draw with England The 3,000 strong crowd of supporters watching the match at Glasgow's fan zone erupted into huge cheers when the final whistle went on the 0-0 draw. And at Wembley the Scotland players lapped up the applause of the Tartan Army who stayed behind to celebrate the result as the England fans left. A fan zone in Trafalgar Square - where Scotland fans traditionally congregate when their team faces the Auld Enemy - was reserved for 750 key workers. Malcolm Gillespie, from Falkirk but living in London, was one of those who managed to secure a space in the area. He said the draw was an ""amazing"" result for Scotland. The 41-year-old, who attended with his son Santiago, eight, said: ""I'm happy but I definitely think we could have edged a win. They've played really well. ""It's been fantastic, a really nice atmosphere. I spoke to some English fans who were really friendly. We've loved every minute of it."" Supporters gathered in Glasgow's George Square And in Glasgow's George Square, police kept an eye on supporters who had gathered to celebrate Mark Cumberworth, 58 and from Essex, said he was disappointed with the result, adding: ""It's almost like we've settled for a draw, which isn't the worst result in the world. ""Scotland have played well. England have no chance [of winning the Euros] playing like this."" The Scotland National Team tweeted that it had been a ""monumental"" effort from ""every one"" of the team. And Mrs Sturgeon tweeted: ""Yes, sir, you all boogied."" It was a reference to a video of ecstatic Scotland players dancing to the 1970s disco classic that went viral when they clinched qualification for the tournament by defeating Serbia on penalties in November.

Spice Girls and mad cows: Scotland v England in 1996 The result comes off the back of Scotland's 2-0 loss to the Czech Republic on Monday and England defeating Croatia 1-0 the previous day. Scotland will face Croatia at Hampden at 20:00 BST on 22 June, while England will play the Czech Republic at Wembley at the same time. Wembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Scotland's men have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. Wembley was open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry. The Tartan Army were allocated only about 2,600 tickets for Wembley, due to Covid rules. Scotland fans gathered in Leicester Square and put a cone on a Shakespeare statue Throughout the day crowds gathered in Leicester Square In the absence of access to the stadium or official fan zones, many supporters instead booked to watch the match from pubs and bars across London. Some gathered in Hyde Park and Leicester Square throughout the day, with police moving Scotland fans on from the square during the second half of the match. It is understood it came after an opposing group tried to approach the visiting fans.

Scotland frustrate England at Wembley,"This video can not be played Highlights: Both teams frustrated as iconic fixture ends in a goalless draw England and Scotland played out a goalless draw at Wembley to leave both countries with their hopes of reaching Euro 2020's knockout stage very much alive. The first meeting between the men's teams in a major tournament since Euro 96 was played out in a typically raucous atmosphere despite only 22,500 fans in attendance - and both sides had big opportunities to win. Most of the honours must go to Scotland, however, who bounced back from their opening defeat by the Czech Republic at Hampden Park with real resilience and character to fully deserve this important point. It was The Tartan Army who were elated at the final whistle while England's players heard the sound of loud jeering from their supporters. England, who were sluggish and disappointing, should have taken the lead early on when John Stones headed Mason Mount's corner against the woodwork. As Scotland settled and improved, England were grateful to Jordan Pickford's superb save from Stephen O'Donnell and a goal-line clearance from Reece James to divert Lyndon Dykes' goal-bound shot after the break. Gareth Southgate's side, with a win over Croatia in the bag, now have a chance to overtake the Czech Republic and win Group D in their final game while Scotland will chase victory against Croatia at Hampden Park. England one step closer to last 16 - Kane Scotland must build on draw - Robertson How 'Scotland's Kante' Gilmour shone at Wembley How social media reacted to nervy night of action Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played O'Donnell does everything right there' - dangerous volley saved by Pickford Scotland's players punched the air with delight when the final whistle sounded and they had secured a point that keeps them in the mix going into their final game. Manager Steve Clarke had his team well-drilled and, once they had survived an uncertain start, they gave as good as they got. The heroes' welcome they received when they went to thank the rain-sodden Tartan Army at the final whistle was thoroughly deserved. England had plenty of possession in the second half but this must never be portrayed as a Scottish rearguard action. It was anything but. Yes, they were forced back for periods but were always positive, on the lookout to attack and it needed that crucial intervention from James to deny Dykes a winner. And in 20-year-old Billy Gilmour, on his first Scotland start, they had the game's outstanding performer, the Chelsea's midfielder showing his class on the ball and a real fighting spirit in the physical challenges. It was an outstanding, mature display. Arsenal's Kieran Tierney also showed how much he was missed in that Czech defeat with a powerhouse performance that must give Scotland real hope against Croatia. Clarke got it right tactically but England counterpart Southgate has questions to ponder. There is no doubt who will be the happier manager. Czech Republic on verge of last 16 after draw with Croatia Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played Marshall rooted to the spot as Stones hits post from corner England were efficient rather than spectacular in victory against Croatia on Sunday but it was very much a case of job done to set the platform to face the old enemy in a repeat of that Euro 96 encounter. Instead, England faded badly after a bright start although Raheem Sterling was furious when Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz ignored his pleas for a second-half penalty when he tangled with Andy Robertson. England did not deserve victory but they are still in a very healthy position going into their final game. That does not mean Southgate can be satisfied after what was a very disappointing night - especially as he faces a dilemma he could not have been contemplating before this tournament started. Captain Harry Kane was poor before his substitution against Croatia on Sunday and was equally anonymous here. He looked sluggish, off the pace and short on threat. It was no surprise when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford with 16 minutes left, even though England were desperately chasing a winner. In his defence, Kane has been starved of good service. To suggest his place is in question is unthinkable but there can be no doubt Southgate wants and needs a lot more from his world-class captain. And Aston Villa's Jack Grealish may now also player a bigger part in the equation, although he could not alter the pattern of this game after he replaced Phil Foden. England's fans have made Grealish very much the people's champion and were chanting his name long before he eventually came on. Will Southgate bow to their demands and start him against the Czech Republic after an England display so lacking in spark? England are still in a very good position - but they will need to be so much better than this. This video can not be played 'England were too frantic' - Southgate In their 115th meeting in all competitions, England and Scotland shared a goalless draw for only the fourth time, also doing so in 1872, 1970 and 1987, although this was the first time in a game at Wembley in the 33rd meeting there. This was England's 17th goalless draw at a major tournament (Euros + World Cup), two more than any other team in the history of those competitions. England have kept 14 clean sheets in their last 18 matches in all competitions (W14 D2 L2) since losing 2-1 to the Czech Republic in a European Championship qualifier in October 2019. Scotland have failed to score in eight of their last 12 matches at major tournaments (W2 D3 L7), and are one of only two teams to have played twice at Euro 2020 and failed to score, along with Turkey. Since the new Wembley opened in 2007, this was only England's second ever goalless draw there in a competitive fixture, also drawing 0-0 in October 2010 against Montenegro in a European Championships qualifier under Fabio Capello. This was Luke Shaw's first appearance for England at a major tournament since June 2014 against Costa Rica in the World Cup, 2,551 days ago. The only two players with longer gaps between tournament appearances for the Three Lions are Martin Keown (2,917 days, 1992-2000) and Tony Adams (2,912 days, 1988-96). Jack Grealish came off the bench and won four fouls, the most by a substitute at Euro 2020 and the most by a sub in a Euros match since Eder won five for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final vs France. At 25 years and 31 days, England named their youngest ever starting XI at a major tournament, with the previous youngest their XI against Belgium in the 2018 World Cup third-place play-off match (25y 175d). Tonight was England's 32nd consecutive international match naming a unique starting XI, England's longest run of naming an XI for the first time since a run of 56 games between 1990 and 1996.

England one step closer to last 16 - Kane Scotland must build on draw - Robertson How 'Scotland's Kante' Gilmour shone at Wembley How social media reacted to nervy night of action Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played O'Donnell does everything right there' - dangerous volley saved by Pickford Scotland's players punched the air with delight when the final whistle sounded and they had secured a point that keeps them in the mix going into their final game. Manager Steve Clarke had his team well-drilled and, once they had survived an uncertain start, they gave as good as they got. The heroes' welcome they received when they went to thank the rain-sodden Tartan Army at the final whistle was thoroughly deserved. England had plenty of possession in the second half but this must never be portrayed as a Scottish rearguard action. It was anything but. Yes, they were forced back for periods but were always positive, on the lookout to attack and it needed that crucial intervention from James to deny Dykes a winner. And in 20-year-old Billy Gilmour, on his first Scotland start, they had the game's outstanding performer, the Chelsea's midfielder showing his class on the ball and a real fighting spirit in the physical challenges. It was an outstanding, mature display. Arsenal's Kieran Tierney also showed how much he was missed in that Czech defeat with a powerhouse performance that must give Scotland real hope against Croatia. Clarke got it right tactically but England counterpart Southgate has questions to ponder. There is no doubt who will be the happier manager. Czech Republic on verge of last 16 after draw with Croatia Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played Marshall rooted to the spot as Stones hits post from corner England were efficient rather than spectacular in victory against Croatia on Sunday but it was very much a case of job done to set the platform to face the old enemy in a repeat of that Euro 96 encounter. Instead, England faded badly after a bright start although Raheem Sterling was furious when Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz ignored his pleas for a second-half penalty when he tangled with Andy Robertson. England did not deserve victory but they are still in a very healthy position going into their final game. That does not mean Southgate can be satisfied after what was a very disappointing night - especially as he faces a dilemma he could not have been contemplating before this tournament started. Captain Harry Kane was poor before his substitution against Croatia on Sunday and was equally anonymous here. He looked sluggish, off the pace and short on threat. It was no surprise when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford with 16 minutes left, even though England were desperately chasing a winner. In his defence, Kane has been starved of good service. To suggest his place is in question is unthinkable but there can be no doubt Southgate wants and needs a lot more from his world-class captain. And Aston Villa's Jack Grealish may now also player a bigger part in the equation, although he could not alter the pattern of this game after he replaced Phil Foden. England's fans have made Grealish very much the people's champion and were chanting his name long before he eventually came on. Will Southgate bow to their demands and start him against the Czech Republic after an England display so lacking in spark? England are still in a very good position - but they will need to be so much better than this. This video can not be played 'England were too frantic' - Southgate In their 115th meeting in all competitions, England and Scotland shared a goalless draw for only the fourth time, also doing so in 1872, 1970 and 1987, although this was the first time in a game at Wembley in the 33rd meeting there. This was England's 17th goalless draw at a major tournament (Euros + World Cup), two more than any other team in the history of those competitions. England have kept 14 clean sheets in their last 18 matches in all competitions (W14 D2 L2) since losing 2-1 to the Czech Republic in a European Championship qualifier in October 2019. Scotland have failed to score in eight of their last 12 matches at major tournaments (W2 D3 L7), and are one of only two teams to have played twice at Euro 2020 and failed to score, along with Turkey. Since the new Wembley opened in 2007, this was only England's second ever goalless draw there in a competitive fixture, also drawing 0-0 in October 2010 against Montenegro in a European Championships qualifier under Fabio Capello. This was Luke Shaw's first appearance for England at a major tournament since June 2014 against Costa Rica in the World Cup, 2,551 days ago. The only two players with longer gaps between tournament appearances for the Three Lions are Martin Keown (2,917 days, 1992-2000) and Tony Adams (2,912 days, 1988-96). Jack Grealish came off the bench and won four fouls, the most by a substitute at Euro 2020 and the most by a sub in a Euros match since Eder won five for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final vs France. At 25 years and 31 days, England named their youngest ever starting XI at a major tournament, with the previous youngest their XI against Belgium in the 2018 World Cup third-place play-off match (25y 175d). Tonight was England's 32nd consecutive international match naming a unique starting XI, England's longest run of naming an XI for the first time since a run of 56 games between 1990 and 1996. This video can not be played England scramble in dying minutes but Scotland able to clear danger Group D plays to a conclusion on Tuesday, with England hosting the Czech Republic at Wembley and Scotland facing Croatia at Hampden Park. Both games are at 20:00 BST and all four team can still qualify for the last 16.

Lloyd Webber rejects PM's full-capacity offerThe impresario had said he'd be willing to be arrested if Cinderella couldn't open to a full house.,"Andrew Lloyd Webber is the owner of seven London theatres Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer to add his new musical Cinderella to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events. The PMsaid earlier this weekhe was in talks with the theatre impresario. But Lord Lloyd-Webber said on Friday the theatre industry had been treated as ""an afterthought and undervalued"". Last week, he said he was determined to open his show to a full house on 25 June, even if he risked being arrested. However, he has now rowed back on that. On Monday, the government confirmed that it would not lift all Covid restrictions until at least 19 July. After rejecting the option to be one of the official pilot events, Lord Lloyd-Webber confirmed the show would open next week with a 50% capacity, the current legal limit. Lloyd Webber 'ready for arrest' over open theatres Reopening delay a hammer blow - live event sector If he did open with a full theatre, it ""would be very likely that every member of my cast, crew and orchestra, the front and backstage staff, plus our loyal audience members, could be individually fined Â£500, which I couldn't possibly risk"", he said. ""If it were just me, I would happily risk arrest and fines to make a stand and lead the live music and theatre industry back to the full capacities we so desperately need."" He said would go ahead with a socially-distanced audience at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London's West End because he was not able to look his ""young cast and crew in the eyes to tell them we were delaying or closing down"".

He said he had turned down the pilot because the offer was not open to other performances. ""I have made it crystal clear that I would only be able to participate if others were involved and the rest of the industry - theatre and music - were treated equally,"" he said. ""This has not been confirmed to me."" He continued: ""It has become clear that, while sporting events like Wimbledon had obviously been working with the government for some time on this pilot, and were even able to start selling tickets yesterday, the theatre industry and its audiences is, once again, an afterthought and undervalued."" A defiant announcement was put on the front of the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London The government said it was ""disappointed"" that he had decided not to take part in the official pilot events, which would have allowed him to have the venue 75% full, rising to 100%. ""We are disappointed that Lord Lloyd Webber has decided not to take part in the Events Research Programme, having engaged with his team on exactly the same basis as a wide range of other cultural and sporting events,"" a spokesperson said. ""We will be setting out details of the next stage of the programme very shortly, once all public health considerations have been finalised, and this will include a number of other theatres. This research will build on successful pilot events in the arts, music and sport sectors."" The government pointed out that events including outdoor gigs, club nights, the Brit Awards as well as the Crucible theatre had already been part of the scheme. Last year, Lord Lloyd Webber said it was economically ""impossible"" to run theatres with social distancing. Reacting to his latest comments, Greg Parmley, chief executive of live music trade association Live, said: ""The live music industry has spent months participating and paying for pilot events so we could reopen at full capacity safety. ""These events were a huge success and show, alongside every other international pilot, that with the right mitigations full capacity live events are safe. ""Despite this the government has refused to publish this data, forced us to remain closed and then tried to hand-pick a number of high profile events to go ahead whilst the rest of our industries are devastated.""

Impressive Scotland frustrate England at WembleyThe goalless draw at Wembley leaves both teams with hopes of reaching Euro 2020's knockout stage.,"This video can not be played Highlights: Both teams frustrated as iconic fixture ends in a goalless draw England and Scotland played out a goalless draw at Wembley to leave both countries with their hopes of reaching Euro 2020's knockout stage very much alive. The first meeting between the men's teams in a major tournament since Euro 96 was played out in a typically raucous atmosphere despite only 22,500 fans in attendance - and both sides had big opportunities to win. Most of the honours must go to Scotland, however, who bounced back from their opening defeat by the Czech Republic at Hampden Park with real resilience and character to fully deserve this important point. It was The Tartan Army who were elated at the final whistle while England's players heard the sound of loud jeering from their supporters. England, who were sluggish and disappointing, should have taken the lead early on when John Stones headed Mason Mount's corner against the woodwork. As Scotland settled and improved, England were grateful to Jordan Pickford's superb save from Stephen O'Donnell and a goal-line clearance from Reece James to divert Lyndon Dykes' goal-bound shot after the break. Gareth Southgate's side, with a win over Croatia in the bag, now have a chance to overtake the Czech Republic and win Group D in their final game while Scotland will chase victory against Croatia at Hampden Park. England one step closer to last 16 - Kane Scotland must build on draw - Robertson How 'Scotland's Kante' Gilmour shone at Wembley How social media reacted to nervy night of action Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played O'Donnell does everything right there' - dangerous volley saved by Pickford Scotland's players punched the air with delight when the final whistle sounded and they had secured a point that keeps them in the mix going into their final game. Manager Steve Clarke had his team well-drilled and, once they had survived an uncertain start, they gave as good as they got. The heroes' welcome they received when they went to thank the rain-sodden Tartan Army at the final whistle was thoroughly deserved. England had plenty of possession in the second half but this must never be portrayed as a Scottish rearguard action. It was anything but. Yes, they were forced back for periods but were always positive, on the lookout to attack and it needed that crucial intervention from James to deny Dykes a winner. And in 20-year-old Billy Gilmour, on his first Scotland start, they had the game's outstanding performer, the Chelsea's midfielder showing his class on the ball and a real fighting spirit in the physical challenges. It was an outstanding, mature display. Arsenal's Kieran Tierney also showed how much he was missed in that Czech defeat with a powerhouse performance that must give Scotland real hope against Croatia. Clarke got it right tactically but England counterpart Southgate has questions to ponder. There is no doubt who will be the happier manager. Czech Republic on verge of last 16 after draw with Croatia Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played Marshall rooted to the spot as Stones hits post from corner England were efficient rather than spectacular in victory against Croatia on Sunday but it was very much a case of job done to set the platform to face the old enemy in a repeat of that Euro 96 encounter. Instead, England faded badly after a bright start although Raheem Sterling was furious when Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz ignored his pleas for a second-half penalty when he tangled with Andy Robertson. England did not deserve victory but they are still in a very healthy position going into their final game. That does not mean Southgate can be satisfied after what was a very disappointing night - especially as he faces a dilemma he could not have been contemplating before this tournament started. Captain Harry Kane was poor before his substitution against Croatia on Sunday and was equally anonymous here. He looked sluggish, off the pace and short on threat. It was no surprise when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford with 16 minutes left, even though England were desperately chasing a winner. In his defence, Kane has been starved of good service. To suggest his place is in question is unthinkable but there can be no doubt Southgate wants and needs a lot more from his world-class captain. And Aston Villa's Jack Grealish may now also player a bigger part in the equation, although he could not alter the pattern of this game after he replaced Phil Foden. England's fans have made Grealish very much the people's champion and were chanting his name long before he eventually came on. Will Southgate bow to their demands and start him against the Czech Republic after an England display so lacking in spark? England are still in a very good position - but they will need to be so much better than this. This video can not be played 'England were too frantic' - Southgate In their 115th meeting in all competitions, England and Scotland shared a goalless draw for only the fourth time, also doing so in 1872, 1970 and 1987, although this was the first time in a game at Wembley in the 33rd meeting there. This was England's 17th goalless draw at a major tournament (Euros + World Cup), two more than any other team in the history of those competitions. England have kept 14 clean sheets in their last 18 matches in all competitions (W14 D2 L2) since losing 2-1 to the Czech Republic in a European Championship qualifier in October 2019. Scotland have failed to score in eight of their last 12 matches at major tournaments (W2 D3 L7), and are one of only two teams to have played twice at Euro 2020 and failed to score, along with Turkey. Since the new Wembley opened in 2007, this was only England's second ever goalless draw there in a competitive fixture, also drawing 0-0 in October 2010 against Montenegro in a European Championships qualifier under Fabio Capello. This was Luke Shaw's first appearance for England at a major tournament since June 2014 against Costa Rica in the World Cup, 2,551 days ago. The only two players with longer gaps between tournament appearances for the Three Lions are Martin Keown (2,917 days, 1992-2000) and Tony Adams (2,912 days, 1988-96). Jack Grealish came off the bench and won four fouls, the most by a substitute at Euro 2020 and the most by a sub in a Euros match since Eder won five for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final vs France. At 25 years and 31 days, England named their youngest ever starting XI at a major tournament, with the previous youngest their XI against Belgium in the 2018 World Cup third-place play-off match (25y 175d). Tonight was England's 32nd consecutive international match naming a unique starting XI, England's longest run of naming an XI for the first time since a run of 56 games between 1990 and 1996.

Thousands of Scotland fans gather in central London,"This video can not be played A large crowd of fans has gathered in Leicester Square ahead of the match Thousands of Scotland fans have gathered in central London to watch the team's Euro 2020 match with England. Many fans travelled despite warnings they should not go to London unless they have a match ticket, or a safe place to watch the game. Those who gathered in Leicester Square were moved on by police shortly after half-time. The Tartan Army were allocated only about 2,600 tickets for Wembley, due to Covid rules. The final score was 0-0. A fan zone in Trafalgar Square was reserved for 750 key workers. Scotland fans who had gathered in Leicester Square were moved on by police Groups of supporters wearing kilts, Scotland shirts and flags have been chanting, singing and playing bagpipes gathered at Leicester Square, King's Cross and Hyde Park. A large number of officers moved in on Scotland fans congregated in Leicester Square shortly before half time, after it is understood an opposing group tried to approach the visiting fans who remained at the central London location after kick off. Officers moved in and placed a cordon around the group of Scots who were later moved out of the square. Live: England vs Scotland coverage Why do Scotland fans sing Yes Sir, I Can Boogie? In pictures: Scotland fans descend on London Spice Girls and mad cows: Scotland v England in 1996 Earlier adispersal order was issuedfor central London, giving the police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress. There have been no reports of any significant disorder - although there have been videos on social media that appeared to show some fans singing offensive anti-English songs. Estimates that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel south for the match have been been described as ""very conservative"" by a London Assembly member. Ahead of the match, fans gathered in Leicester Square wearing kilts and Scotland shirts waved flags and set off blue smoke bombs while chanting, singing and playing the bagpipes. Some England fans were also seen in the square wearing team shirts and draped in England's flag. People were seen climbing into the fountain of William Shakespeare in the square and splashing around in the water. Others climbed on top of the statue and put a cone on its head. Scotland fans gathered in Leicester Square and put a cone on a Shakespeare statue First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged fans to ""be respectful to our hosts"" in London, and said they should not behave in a way that was going to make the Covid problem worse. She also said she would ""abhor and condemn unreservedly"" any anti-English behaviour. Ali Brawley, 55, from Galston in East Ayrshire, said he had arrived with a group of friends in London at midnight on Wednesday, and had spent the time since ""sightseeing"" around the city's pubs. Mr Brawley and his friends will be watching the game from a pub which they booked, but he believes it would have been easier for fans - and the police - if there had been a dedicated fan zone for the Tartan Army.

He added: ""We had our first train cancelled, our hotel closed last week for refurbishment - we had to rebook the hotel. We just thought we weren't getting to get here. ""The organisation has been horrendous because of Covid, it's been tough to try and get somewhere to watch the football. ""I do believe they should have had big screens, herd us all together so we're all in the one place but now all the Scots are going to be everywhere."" Scotland fan Michael McLean, from Inverness, told BBC Scotland he had decided to travel after booking travel and accommodation several months ago. ""It's an amazing atmosphere so far. I think it seems that they've underestimated how many would travel down for the game,"" he said. ""It feels like a normal football occasion. It doesn't feel like there's a pandemic on, which I don't think is good in a way, but it's definitely good to enjoy an occasion after a year-and-a-half."" Mr McLean said the trains had been packed on the way down, with crowds of Scottish fans gathering and chanting outside King's Cross station on Thursday afternoon. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimehe had heard London Mayor Sadiq Khan's pleas for fans to stay away, but said much of the travel he had booked was non-refundable. ""Â£600 in total for all of us would be a lot to lose just to decide not to go down. Fair enough if it was refundable - but I don't want to lose the money."" One Scot who lives in London said it was ""inevitable"" that crowds of fans would travel south. Gary, a 30-year-old consultant, said: ""It was inevitable, regardless of restrictions in place. You can't stop the masses coming down to celebrate a once in a generation event."" Of the Scotland-England rivalry, he added that ""99%"" would be friendly. ""It'll be a laugh,"" he said. The Met Police's football chief, Ch Insp Joseph Stokoe, said officers had been reminding fans that some Londoners are ""still living under the fear of the pandemic"". He added: ""It's a shame, it feels like there aren't enough places for the fans to enjoy themselves, but that's why the message has always been - if you don't have a ticket, don't travel. ""Enjoy the match, enjoy the event locally, in a safer event. Don't come here, because unfortunately because of what's gone on across the world, we've been unable to provide the amount of fan zones you might expect in normal times."" Emma Best, a member of the London Assembly and the Conservative group's spokeswoman on health, said she believed an estimate that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel might turn out to be a ""very conservative"" estimate. But Ms Best added that the Tartan Army had been creating a ""really good-natured atmosphere"" throughout the city. ""The Boogie songis being played everywhere I've been walking. It's a lovely atmosphere and you could be forgiven for thinking we are not still in the midst of a pandemic, and I think that sums it up. ""What a shame that we can't have this match in normal times and really enjoy this occasion, but we are where we are and I do hope it's as safe as it can be."" These fans arrived at King's Cross Station in London on Friday Wembley is open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry. Pubs and bars in London were also expected to limit numbers allowed in. The much-anticipated match, the 115th in international football's oldest rivalry, is the first time the two sides have met in a major tournament since Euro 96, when Paul Gascoigne's famous goal sealed a 2-0 win for England. How do Scotland defeat England? Scotland lost their first game of the tournament2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday, while England defeated Croatia 1-0 the previous day. Wembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Scotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. After the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil. Where are you watching the Euros this evening? Have you set up camp at home or away?

Scotland fans' delight as Euro hopes still alive,"A crowd of football supporters gathered in George Square Crowds gathered in London's Leicester Square and George Square in Glasgow following Scotland's 0-0 draw with England. Scotland fans have been celebrating the result, which keeps alive hopes they could still qualify for the next round of the Euro 2020 tournament. There was large police presence in both cities, and in London 30 people were arrested, the Met Police said. Most arrests were made in central London and near Wembley Stadium. The force said offences included violence and disorder, possession of drugs, possession of an offensive weapon, racial aggravation, drunk and disorderly behaviour and assault of a police officer, who suffered minor injuries. When a ""large"" crowd gathered in Leicester Square, flares were set off as fans, many wearing kilts and draped in Scotland flags, sang Flower of Scotland and chanted ""No Scotland, no party"". Scotland frustrate England at Wembley Live: Reaction to the the England v Scotland result In pictures: Scotland fans celebrate England result The Met Police said at 00:45 BST officers encouraged people still in Leicester Square to leave, finally clearing the area by 01:15 BST. TV coverage of the game drew an average audience of 13.1 million, a peak of 20 million and a 79% audience share across ITV and STV. The match set a new streaming record for the channel with 4.8 million streams across ITV Hub and STV Player. It also becomes the most-watched football match in terms of peak viewing numbers since ITV's coverage of England's World Cup semi-final against Croatia in 2018, which earned 27.5 million viewers. Thousands of supporters travelled south for the matchdespite being urged not to unless they had a ticket or had organised somewhere to watch the game. Earlier adispersal order was issued for central London, giving police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress. There was no indication of disorder in George Square but unauthorised large gatherings are prohibited in Scotland under Covid rules. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had urged fans to ""be respectful to our hosts"" in London and not to behave in any way that was going to make the Covid problem worse.

And at Wembley the Scotland players lapped up the applause of the Tartan Army who stayed behind to celebrate the result as the England fans left. A fan zone in Trafalgar Square - where Scotland fans traditionally congregate when their team faces the Auld Enemy - was reserved for 750 key workers. Malcolm Gillespie, from Falkirk but living in London, was one of those who managed to secure a space in the area. He said the draw was an ""amazing"" result for Scotland. The 41-year-old, who attended with his son Santiago, eight, said: ""I'm happy but I definitely think we could have edged a win. They've played really well. ""It's been fantastic, a really nice atmosphere. I spoke to some English fans who were really friendly. We've loved every minute of it."" Supporters gathered in Glasgow's George Square And in Glasgow's George Square, police kept an eye on supporters who had gathered to celebrate Mark Cumberworth, 58 and from Essex, said he was disappointed with the result, adding: ""It's almost like we've settled for a draw, which isn't the worst result in the world. ""Scotland have played well. England have no chance [of winning the Euros] playing like this."" The Scotland National Team tweeted that it had been a ""monumental"" effort from ""every one"" of the team. And Mrs Sturgeon tweeted: ""Yes, sir, you all boogied."" It was a reference to a video of ecstatic Scotland players dancing to the 1970s disco classic that went viral when they clinched qualification for the tournament by defeating Serbia on penalties in November.

Number of wedding guests to depend on venue size,"This video can not be played Covid weddings: ""We're having to choose between grandparents"" Rules covering wedding and civil partnerships receptions and wakes in Wales are to change from Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford said there would no longer be limits on numbers at weddings. Following a risk assessment by venues, numbers will be based on how many can be ""safely accommodated,"" he said. However, Mr Drakeford also announced afour-week pause to further lifting of lockdown rulesamid concerns over the Delta variant. ""We are once again facing a serious public health situation,"" he said. At a briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford alsowarned a third wave of coronavirushas already started to spread widely across Wales. What are the latest rules for weddings? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? 'No light at end of tunnel' for wedding businesses Currently, as many people as a venue can accommodate safely can attend wedding ceremonies, but only30 people can attend indoor wedding receptions. There are other rules, such as the first dance must only involve the bride and groom. Mr Drakeford said changes meant venues would move away from having a notional number, adding: ""If those can safely accommodate over 100 people, that's what they'll do."" He added it would mean ""at quite a number of venues across Wales, the number able to be at a wedding will be higher than it is now"". Among the ""small technical amendments"" being made to the lockdown rules are: The number of people who can attend a wedding or civil partnership reception or wake, organised by a business in an indoors regulated premise, such as a hotel, will be determined by the size of the venue and a risk assessment Small grassroots music and comedy venues will be able to operate on the same basis as hospitality venues, like pubs and cafes Primary school children in the same school contact group or bubble will be able to stay overnight in a residential outdoor education centre Pilot events in theatre, sport and other sectors will also continue throughout June and July Lockdown rules in Wales will be reviewed again on 15 July. Lewys Williams and Ms Harris were supposed to get married in August of last year but have had to reschedule twice. On one occasion this was because their venue was being turned into a mass vaccination centre. In a letter, also signed by brides-to-be other than Ms Harris and some wedding suppliers, the couple ask Mr Drakeford for a roadmap for weddings. And they have asked if lateral flow tests could be given to guests before they arrive. Lewys Williams and Ms Harris are planning their wedding for the third time ""We need clarity,"" Ms Harris said. ""We need a roadmap and we need to consider why on earth we are allowing sporting events of up to 10,000 people to go ahead, when we can't have our closest family and friends at our wedding. ""The level of worry, anxiety, mental health worries that this has caused. ""It sounds dramatic. But it really is every minute of every day, there some kind of worry going around my head at the moment. ""We don't know whether we go ahead and pay these suppliers, who within the next few weeks or so, are due the best part of six grand from us."" Crug Gas Country House, near St David's in Pembrokeshire, usually it hosts about 60 weddings a year - but because of the Covid lockdown rules, there have been three this year so far. ""At weddings here it's table service-only and only the bride and groom are allowed to dance - it's really sad,"" Crug Glas' wedding coordinator Sandra Vaughantold BBC Radio Cymru. ""It's quite hard to see people out enjoying the football in the pubs, but nobody can come here to have a nice wedding. It's not the same product we sold to them."" Fans were at a fan zone near Cardiff for Wales' victory against Turkey Welsh government officials are talking to councils about the possibility of fan zones for Wales' remaining Euro 2020 games, Mr Drakeford said. Hundreds gathered at one indoor venue near Cardiff forWales' 2-0 victory over Turkey, with hopes larger outdoor facilities will be opened. However, Mr Drakeford said conversations were taking place with experts and police about the viability of accommodating the ""large numbers of people"" fan zones would attract. The announcement comes as Wales' overall case rate has continued to climb since late May. There are close to 500 cases of the Delta variant, which originated in India, accounting for four out of every five new cases in Wales, latest figures show, with Mr Drakeford saying it is ""seeded in every part of Wales"". He believes it could be a fortnight before the impact of this is seen in hospital admissions and people falling ill. ""Across the border in Scotland and England, they are about two weeks ahead of us on all of this,"" he added. ""We are already seeing hospital numbers rising, particularly amongst people in their forties and fifties. ""That's why we will use the next four weeks to accelerate or vaccination programme."" How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Welsh NHS under substantial pressure, says chief How many people have died with Covid in Wales? More than 500,000 doses of the Covid vaccine will be distributed across Wales in a bid to speed up the number of people receiving second jabs. So far 1,454,066 people have been fully vaccinated. Mr Drakeford said restrictions could be eased following the four-week pause even if there is not conclusive evidence that vaccinations have broken the link between rising infections and hospital admissions. He told the PA news agency: ""I agree that you cannot, in the end, delay everything in the search for perfection in terms of data. ""But what we are quite clearly told by our scientific advisers as well as others is that this four weeks will allow us to get a sufficiently good handle on the extent to which a relationship between falling ill and needing hospitalisation has been modified by the vaccine. ""Then we will make a calculation about how much headroom we have, as we always do, to take further steps."" Responding to the announcement, Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Many in hospitality are still feeling the pinch from the unexplained gap in funding in April of this year."" He said, while clarity on wedding venues would be welcome, he called on the Welsh government to ""provide leadership and support at a time when many have genuine fears for the future"". Welsh Conservatives Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies wants the move to be scrutinised in the Welsh Parliament. He added: ""In light of the ongoing restrictions, Welsh businesses will require more financial support and I hope the first minister makes clear what additional funding his government will provide to protect Welsh jobs.""

"Lib Dems seize Tory seat in by-election upsetLeader Ed Davey says his party is now the main threat to Tory ""blue wall"" constituencies across the UK.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Sir Ed Davey celebrates his party's win in the Chesham and Amersham while breaking down a model blue wall The Liberal Democrats have pulled off a stunning by-election victory, overturning a 16,000 majority in a seat that has always voted Conservative. Leader Sir Ed Davey celebrated by knocking over a wall of blue bricks, claiming his party was now the ""main threat"" to the Tories in many areas. The party's candidate Sarah Green won by 8,028 votes from the Tories, with the Green Party in third place. Labour had the worst by-election result in the party's history, with 622 votes. The result is a major boost for the Liberal Democrats after their poor performance at the 2019 general election and brings their total number of MPs at Westminster to 12. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the result for his party as ""disappointing"". Kuenssberg: Defeat will fuel Tory 'brand Boris' fears Voters say result means 'a different voice for us' Lib Dems to make most of new MP Appearing alongside Ms Green at a victory rally in the Buckinghamshire constituency, Sir Ed said: ""This is a great result, a huge swing to us. There are many Conservatives across the country who are now worried. ""People have been talking about a red wall, well after Chesham and Amersham and Sarah Green's victory they'll be talking about a blue wall, and how the Lib Dems are the main threat to the Conservatives. ""People here felt ignored and taken for granted, and we listened. Sarah Green is going to take these concerns to Parliament and hold this appalling Tory government to account."" In her victory speech in the early hours of Friday, Ms Green said: ""Tonight the voice of Chesham and Amersham is unmistakable. Together we have said, 'enough is enough, we will be heard and this government will listen'."" This video can not be played Lib Dem Sarah Green vows to ""hold the government to account"" Local opposition to the HS2 rail line, which is being built through the constituency, and the government's planning reforms, which could see more homes being built in rural areas, were major factors in the poll. Mr Johnson attributed the defeat to local issues and insisted the government was focused on ""uniting and levelling up within regions across the whole country"". Responding to suggestions his party's house building plans had led to defeat, he said there had been a ""wilful misunderstanding about the planning reforms"" adding that the government wanted to develop brownfield sites rather than ""build all over the countryside"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says by-election was âdisappointing resultâ Speaking to the BBC, Conservative candidate Peter Fleet warned against reading ""too much"" into his defeat arguing that the result was caused by ""very local circumstances"". But Bob Seely - Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight - told the BBC the government ""badly need to think again about planning"". ""This entire system feeds the over-development of the south and the under-development of other areas. It needs to change."" Polling Expert Prof Sir John Curtice said ""in remain-voting middle class seats in the south of England, the Conservative coalition has been weakened to some degree in the wake of Brexit - the Liberal Democrats are best placed to profit from that."" Why a political battle looms over planning rules Will Tories worry about 'Blue Wall' losses? For the Liberal Democrats, this will be a legendary victory to rank alongside famous by-election upsets of the past. We may be seeing the return of classic Lib Dem ""pavement politics"" - relentlessly campaigning on local issues such as HS2, which the party supports nationally, but opposed locally. More worrying for the Conservatives, is the apparent backlash against the government's planning reforms. But are there bigger conclusions to be drawn? The Lib Dems claim the political geography of the UK is changing. The party made inroads in some traditional Conservative areas - many of which had majorities for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum -  in the recent local elections in England. Some Conservative councillors worried that their party's emphasis on ""levelling up"" and on former Labour seats in northern England could be making some voters in the south feel left behind. But, so far, the Conservatives have been gaining more ground in the north than they have been losing in the south. As for Labour at Chesham and Amersham, their vote collapsed. It's clear that there was tactical voting to oust the Conservatives. What might be more concerning to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is the sheer extent of this - and that the party's vote was as solid as quicksand. The by-election was caused by the death in April of former Welsh Secretary Dame Cheryl Gillan. In 2019, she retained the seat with more than half of the vote. But the Conservative majority has been steadily decreasing since the 2015 General Election, when it was 23,920, with UKIP coming second.

Scotland frustrate England at WembleyA goalless draw at Wembley leaves both countries with hopes of reaching Euro 2020's knockout stage alive.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Highlights: Both teams frustrated as iconic fixture ends in a goalless draw England and Scotland played out a goalless draw at Wembley to leave both countries with their hopes of reaching Euro 2020's knockout stage very much alive. The first meeting between the men's teams in a major tournament since Euro 96 was played out in a typically raucous atmosphere despite only 22,500 fans in attendance - and both sides had big opportunities to win. Most of the honours must go to Scotland, however, who bounced back from their opening defeat by the Czech Republic at Hampden Park with real resilience and character to fully deserve this important point. It was The Tartan Army who were elated at the final whistle while England's players heard the sound of loud jeering from their supporters. England, who were sluggish and disappointing, should have taken the lead early on when John Stones headed Mason Mount's corner against the woodwork. As Scotland settled and improved, England were grateful to Jordan Pickford's superb save from Stephen O'Donnell and a goal-line clearance from Reece James to divert Lyndon Dykes' goal-bound shot after the break. Gareth Southgate's side, with a win over Croatia in the bag, now have a chance to overtake the Czech Republic and win Group D in their final game while Scotland will chase victory against Croatia at Hampden Park. England one step closer to last 16 - Kane Scotland must build on draw - Robertson How 'Scotland's Kante' Gilmour shone at Wembley How social media reacted to nervy night of action Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played O'Donnell does everything right there' - dangerous volley saved by Pickford Scotland's players punched the air with delight when the final whistle sounded and they had secured a point that keeps them in the mix going into their final game. Manager Steve Clarke had his team well-drilled and, once they had survived an uncertain start, they gave as good as they got. The heroes' welcome they received when they went to thank the rain-sodden Tartan Army at the final whistle was thoroughly deserved. England had plenty of possession in the second half but this must never be portrayed as a Scottish rearguard action. It was anything but. Yes, they were forced back for periods but were always positive, on the lookout to attack and it needed that crucial intervention from James to deny Dykes a winner. And in 20-year-old Billy Gilmour, on his first Scotland start, they had the game's outstanding performer, the Chelsea's midfielder showing his class on the ball and a real fighting spirit in the physical challenges. It was an outstanding, mature display. Arsenal's Kieran Tierney also showed how much he was missed in that Czech defeat with a powerhouse performance that must give Scotland real hope against Croatia. Clarke got it right tactically but England counterpart Southgate has questions to ponder. There is no doubt who will be the happier manager. Czech Republic on verge of last 16 after draw with Croatia Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played Marshall rooted to the spot as Stones hits post from corner England were efficient rather than spectacular in victory against Croatia on Sunday but it was very much a case of job done to set the platform to face the old enemy in a repeat of that Euro 96 encounter. Instead, England faded badly after a bright start although Raheem Sterling was furious when Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz ignored his pleas for a second-half penalty when he tangled with Andy Robertson. England did not deserve victory but they are still in a very healthy position going into their final game. That does not mean Southgate can be satisfied after what was a very disappointing night - especially as he faces a dilemma he could not have been contemplating before this tournament started. Captain Harry Kane was poor before his substitution against Croatia on Sunday and was equally anonymous here. He looked sluggish, off the pace and short on threat. It was no surprise when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford with 16 minutes left, even though England were desperately chasing a winner. In his defence, Kane has been starved of good service. To suggest his place is in question is unthinkable but there can be no doubt Southgate wants and needs a lot more from his world-class captain. And Aston Villa's Jack Grealish may now also player a bigger part in the equation, although he could not alter the pattern of this game after he replaced Phil Foden. England's fans have made Grealish very much the people's champion and were chanting his name long before he eventually came on. Will Southgate bow to their demands and start him against the Czech Republic after an England display so lacking in spark? England are still in a very good position - but they will need to be so much better than this. This video can not be played 'England were too frantic' - Southgate In their 115th meeting in all competitions, England and Scotland shared a goalless draw for only the fourth time, also doing so in 1872, 1970 and 1987, although this was the first time in a game at Wembley in the 33rd meeting there. This was England's 17th goalless draw at a major tournament (Euros + World Cup), two more than any other team in the history of those competitions. England have kept 14 clean sheets in their last 18 matches in all competitions (W14 D2 L2) since losing 2-1 to the Czech Republic in a European Championship qualifier in October 2019. Scotland have failed to score in eight of their last 12 matches at major tournaments (W2 D3 L7), and are one of only two teams to have played twice at Euro 2020 and failed to score, along with Turkey. Since the new Wembley opened in 2007, this was only England's second ever goalless draw there in a competitive fixture, also drawing 0-0 in October 2010 against Montenegro in a European Championships qualifier under Fabio Capello. This was Luke Shaw's first appearance for England at a major tournament since June 2014 against Costa Rica in the World Cup, 2,551 days ago. The only two players with longer gaps between tournament appearances for the Three Lions are Martin Keown (2,917 days, 1992-2000) and Tony Adams (2,912 days, 1988-96). Jack Grealish came off the bench and won four fouls, the most by a substitute at Euro 2020 and the most by a sub in a Euros match since Eder won five for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final vs France. At 25 years and 31 days, England named their youngest ever starting XI at a major tournament, with the previous youngest their XI against Belgium in the 2018 World Cup third-place play-off match (25y 175d). Tonight was England's 32nd consecutive international match naming a unique starting XI, England's longest run of naming an XI for the first time since a run of 56 games between 1990 and 1996. This video can not be played England scramble in dying minutes but Scotland able to clear danger Group D plays to a conclusion on Tuesday, with England hosting the Czech Republic at Wembley and Scotland facing Croatia at Hampden Park. Both games are at 20:00 BST and all four team can still qualify for the last 16.

Thousands of Scotland fans gather in central LondonLarge crowds of Tartan Army supporters congregate to watch the Euro 2020 match against England.Scotland,"This video can not be played A large crowd of fans has gathered in Leicester Square ahead of the match Thousands of Scotland fans have gathered in central London to watch the team's Euro 2020 match with England. Many fans travelled despite warnings they should not go to London unless they have a match ticket, or a safe place to watch the game. Those who gathered in Leicester Square were moved on by police shortly after half-time. The Tartan Army were allocated only about 2,600 tickets for Wembley, due to Covid rules. The final score was 0-0. A fan zone in Trafalgar Square was reserved for 750 key workers. Scotland fans who had gathered in Leicester Square were moved on by police Groups of supporters wearing kilts, Scotland shirts and flags have been chanting, singing and playing bagpipes gathered at Leicester Square, King's Cross and Hyde Park. A large number of officers moved in on Scotland fans congregated in Leicester Square shortly before half time, after it is understood an opposing group tried to approach the visiting fans who remained at the central London location after kick off. Officers moved in and placed a cordon around the group of Scots who were later moved out of the square. Live: England vs Scotland coverage Why do Scotland fans sing Yes Sir, I Can Boogie? In pictures: Scotland fans descend on London Spice Girls and mad cows: Scotland v England in 1996 Earlier adispersal order was issuedfor central London, giving the police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress. There have been no reports of any significant disorder - although there have been videos on social media that appeared to show some fans singing offensive anti-English songs. Estimates that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel south for the match have been been described as ""very conservative"" by a London Assembly member. Ahead of the match, fans gathered in Leicester Square wearing kilts and Scotland shirts waved flags and set off blue smoke bombs while chanting, singing and playing the bagpipes. Some England fans were also seen in the square wearing team shirts and draped in England's flag. People were seen climbing into the fountain of William Shakespeare in the square and splashing around in the water. Others climbed on top of the statue and put a cone on its head. Scotland fans gathered in Leicester Square and put a cone on a Shakespeare statue First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged fans to ""be respectful to our hosts"" in London, and said they should not behave in a way that was going to make the Covid problem worse. She also said she would ""abhor and condemn unreservedly"" any anti-English behaviour. Ali Brawley, 55, from Galston in East Ayrshire, said he had arrived with a group of friends in London at midnight on Wednesday, and had spent the time since ""sightseeing"" around the city's pubs. Mr Brawley and his friends will be watching the game from a pub which they booked, but he believes it would have been easier for fans - and the police - if there had been a dedicated fan zone for the Tartan Army.

He added: ""We had our first train cancelled, our hotel closed last week for refurbishment - we had to rebook the hotel. We just thought we weren't getting to get here. ""The organisation has been horrendous because of Covid, it's been tough to try and get somewhere to watch the football. ""I do believe they should have had big screens, herd us all together so we're all in the one place but now all the Scots are going to be everywhere."" Scotland fan Michael McLean, from Inverness, told BBC Scotland he had decided to travel after booking travel and accommodation several months ago. ""It's an amazing atmosphere so far. I think it seems that they've underestimated how many would travel down for the game,"" he said. ""It feels like a normal football occasion. It doesn't feel like there's a pandemic on, which I don't think is good in a way, but it's definitely good to enjoy an occasion after a year-and-a-half."" Mr McLean said the trains had been packed on the way down, with crowds of Scottish fans gathering and chanting outside King's Cross station on Thursday afternoon. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimehe had heard London Mayor Sadiq Khan's pleas for fans to stay away, but said much of the travel he had booked was non-refundable. ""Â£600 in total for all of us would be a lot to lose just to decide not to go down. Fair enough if it was refundable - but I don't want to lose the money."" One Scot who lives in London said it was ""inevitable"" that crowds of fans would travel south. Gary, a 30-year-old consultant, said: ""It was inevitable, regardless of restrictions in place. You can't stop the masses coming down to celebrate a once in a generation event."" Of the Scotland-England rivalry, he added that ""99%"" would be friendly. ""It'll be a laugh,"" he said. The Met Police's football chief, Ch Insp Joseph Stokoe, said officers had been reminding fans that some Londoners are ""still living under the fear of the pandemic"". He added: ""It's a shame, it feels like there aren't enough places for the fans to enjoy themselves, but that's why the message has always been - if you don't have a ticket, don't travel. ""Enjoy the match, enjoy the event locally, in a safer event. Don't come here, because unfortunately because of what's gone on across the world, we've been unable to provide the amount of fan zones you might expect in normal times."" Emma Best, a member of the London Assembly and the Conservative group's spokeswoman on health, said she believed an estimate that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel might turn out to be a ""very conservative"" estimate. But Ms Best added that the Tartan Army had been creating a ""really good-natured atmosphere"" throughout the city. ""The Boogie songis being played everywhere I've been walking. It's a lovely atmosphere and you could be forgiven for thinking we are not still in the midst of a pandemic, and I think that sums it up. ""What a shame that we can't have this match in normal times and really enjoy this occasion, but we are where we are and I do hope it's as safe as it can be."" These fans arrived at King's Cross Station in London on Friday Wembley is open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry. Pubs and bars in London were also expected to limit numbers allowed in. The much-anticipated match, the 115th in international football's oldest rivalry, is the first time the two sides have met in a major tournament since Euro 96, when Paul Gascoigne's famous goal sealed a 2-0 win for England. How do Scotland defeat England? Scotland lost their first game of the tournament2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday, while England defeated Croatia 1-0 the previous day. Wembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Scotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. After the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil. Where are you watching the Euros this evening? Have you set up camp at home or away?

Lib Dems seize Tory seat in by-election upset,"This video can not be played Sir Ed Davey celebrates his party's win in the Chesham and Amersham while breaking down a model blue wall The Liberal Democrats have pulled off a stunning by-election victory, overturning a 16,000 majority in a seat that has always voted Conservative. Leader Sir Ed Davey celebrated by knocking over a wall of blue bricks, claiming his party was now the ""main threat"" to the Tories in many areas. The party's candidate Sarah Green won by 8,028 votes from the Tories, with the Green Party in third place. Labour had the worst by-election result in the party's history, with 622 votes. The result is a major boost for the Liberal Democrats after their poor performance at the 2019 general election and brings their total number of MPs at Westminster to 12. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the result for his party as ""disappointing"". Kuenssberg: Defeat will fuel Tory 'brand Boris' fears Voters say result means 'a different voice for us' Lib Dems to make most of new MP Appearing alongside Ms Green at a victory rally in the Buckinghamshire constituency, Sir Ed said: ""This is a great result, a huge swing to us. There are many Conservatives across the country who are now worried. ""People have been talking about a red wall, well after Chesham and Amersham and Sarah Green's victory they'll be talking about a blue wall, and how the Lib Dems are the main threat to the Conservatives. ""People here felt ignored and taken for granted, and we listened. Sarah Green is going to take these concerns to Parliament and hold this appalling Tory government to account."" In her victory speech in the early hours of Friday, Ms Green said: ""Tonight the voice of Chesham and Amersham is unmistakable. Together we have said, 'enough is enough, we will be heard and this government will listen'."" This video can not be played Lib Dem Sarah Green vows to ""hold the government to account"" Local opposition to the HS2 rail line, which is being built through the constituency, and the government's planning reforms, which could see more homes being built in rural areas, were major factors in the poll. Mr Johnson attributed the defeat to local issues and insisted the government was focused on ""uniting and levelling up within regions across the whole country"". Responding to suggestions his party's house building plans had led to defeat, he said there had been a ""wilful misunderstanding about the planning reforms"" adding that the government wanted to develop brownfield sites rather than ""build all over the countryside"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says by-election was âdisappointing resultâ Speaking to the BBC, Conservative candidate Peter Fleet warned against reading ""too much"" into his defeat arguing that the result was caused by ""very local circumstances"". But Bob Seely - Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight - told the BBC the government ""badly need to think again about planning"". ""This entire system feeds the over-development of the south and the under-development of other areas. It needs to change."" Polling Expert Prof Sir John Curtice said ""in remain-voting middle class seats in the south of England, the Conservative coalition has been weakened to some degree in the wake of Brexit - the Liberal Democrats are best placed to profit from that."" Why a political battle looms over planning rules Will Tories worry about 'Blue Wall' losses? For the Liberal Democrats, this will be a legendary victory to rank alongside famous by-election upsets of the past. We may be seeing the return of classic Lib Dem ""pavement politics"" - relentlessly campaigning on local issues such as HS2, which the party supports nationally, but opposed locally. More worrying for the Conservatives, is the apparent backlash against the government's planning reforms. But are there bigger conclusions to be drawn? The Lib Dems claim the political geography of the UK is changing. The party made inroads in some traditional Conservative areas - many of which had majorities for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum -  in the recent local elections in England. Some Conservative councillors worried that their party's emphasis on ""levelling up"" and on former Labour seats in northern England could be making some voters in the south feel left behind. But, so far, the Conservatives have been gaining more ground in the north than they have been losing in the south. As for Labour at Chesham and Amersham, their vote collapsed. It's clear that there was tactical voting to oust the Conservatives. What might be more concerning to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is the sheer extent of this - and that the party's vote was as solid as quicksand. The by-election was caused by the death in April of former Welsh Secretary Dame Cheryl Gillan. In 2019, she retained the seat with more than half of the vote. But the Conservative majority has been steadily decreasing since the 2015 General Election, when it was 23,920, with UKIP coming second. In 2017, it was 22,140 with Labour second with 11,374, and in 2019the Liberal Democrats got the second-highest number of votes, picking up 13% more than they did in 2017. Following the by-election, Ben Nunn - director of communications for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - stepped down from his role. He told the BBC it was a ""personal decision"".

Emma Best, a member of the London Assembly and the Conservative group's spokeswoman on health, said she believed an estimate that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel might turn out to be a ""very conservative"" estimate. But Ms Best added that the Tartan Army had been creating a ""really good-natured atmosphere"" throughout the city. ""The Boogie songis being played everywhere I've been walking. It's a lovely atmosphere and you could be forgiven for thinking we are not still in the midst of a pandemic, and I think that sums it up. ""What a shame that we can't have this match in normal times and really enjoy this occasion, but we are where we are and I do hope it's as safe as it can be."" These fans arrived at King's Cross Station in London on Friday Wembley is open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry. Pubs and bars in London were also expected to limit numbers allowed in. The much-anticipated match, the 115th in international football's oldest rivalry, is the first time the two sides have met in a major tournament since Euro 96, when Paul Gascoigne's famous goal sealed a 2-0 win for England. How do Scotland defeat England? Scotland lost their first game of the tournament2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday, while England defeated Croatia 1-0 the previous day. Wembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Scotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. After the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil. Where are you watching the Euros this evening? Have you set up camp at home or away?

Video 3 minutes 58 seconds'I was told I didnât look like somebody who'd been raped'One woman speaks about her experience of reporting sexual assault as a review into low convictions rates is released.UK,"This video can not be played The government has released its review of rape prosecutions and convictions. The review outlines plans to focus more on the suspect's behaviour - not the accuser's, and make sure phones taken away for evidence-gathering are returned within a day. Robert Buckland, the Justice Secretary,told the BBC that the governmentwill be making the ânecessary investmentâ to ensure that the experience for victims going through the criminal justice system improves. But Katherine Araniello, a survivor of rape whose case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service, said the governmentâs apology was âworth nothingâ to her unless âthey were actually going to changeâ.

Today's live page has been brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jo Couzens, Paul Gribben and James Clarke. It's been a busy day, but it's time to say goodbye. Here's a summary of what's gone on during the day: As England opens up first doses of vaccines to everyone aged 18 and older, over-40s and people with underlying health conditions are being contacted to bring their second doses forward. The initial advice across the whole of the UK was to offer jabs 12 weeks apart in order to give as many people as possible a first dose. Now those who haven't yet had their second dose in some priority groups can have it after eight weeks. You can rearrange an appointment yourself, but you must first cancel your original bookingonline,external, or by calling 119.

InNorthern Ireland,the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks,externalfor appointments scheduled after 14 June. InWales, the government saysvaccination clinics ""are accelerating second doses"",external, and that people will be contacted by their local health board in due course. Here's everything you need to know about going for your jabs. Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer to add his new musical Cinderella to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events. The PM said earlier this week he was in talks with the theatre impresario about including the show in the scheme. But Lord Lloyd Webber says the theatre industry has been treated as ""an afterthought and undervalued"" and he would only take part in the scheme if others in the trade were treated equally. On Monday, the government confirmed it would not lift all Covid restrictions until at least 19 July - delayed from the proposed date of 21 June. Last week, Lord Lloyd Webber said he was determined to open his show to a full house on 25 June, even if he risked being arrested. However, after rejecting the option to be one of the official pilot events, he has rowed back on his threat to go to jail and confirmed the show will go ahead with a 50% capacity, the current legal limit.

The total infections have crossed the five million mark and at least seven African countries have run out of vaccines. Africa remains an area of concern, even though it accounts for only about 5% of new global infections and 2% of deaths, WHO officials say. New cases in Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Rwanda have
doubled in the past week, WHO emergencies programme head Mike
Ryan is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. ""It's a trajectory that is very, very concerning,"" he has told reporters at the organisation's headquarters in Geneva. ""The brutal reality is that in an era of multiple
variants, with increased transmissibility, we have left vast
swathes of the population, the vulnerable population of Africa,
unprotected by vaccines."" South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Egypt have recorded the most virus cases in the continent. Uganda and Namibia are experiencing a deadly third wave, with dozens of fatalities recorded daily. A total of 136,030 people have succumbed to the virus in different African countries, according to the WHO. The Delta variant is in 14 African countries while the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa, is in 25 countries. The WHO says there's no clear timeline on when more vaccines will be available, but there is an urgent need for them. UK music fans are sitting on hundreds of thousands of tickets for postponed concerts rather than returning them. The latest four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions has pushed an additional 5,000 gigs into doubt. Artists such as Rag'n'Bone Man, Olly Murs and Rudimental had scheduled shows between 21 June and 19 July and face a choice of postponing or scrapping gigs. Industry body Live estimates the events scheduled for the next four weeks are worth Â£500m to the struggling sector. It also means fans remain out of pocket to see shows they forked out for many months ago. Read BBC business reporter Rebecca Wearn's full reporthere. And a guide to the rules for gigs and festivals ishere. Most existing Covid restrictions in the UK are staying in place for the moment, because of concerns over the Delta variant. The government had hoped to""remove all legal limits on social contact"",externalin England from 21 June. It's now been put back until 19 July.

Wembley hosted 22,500 fans - 25% of its capacity - for England's Group D fixture against Croatia Uefa says it is ""confident"" the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 will be held at Wembley as planned - but has a contingency plan amid concerns around England's coronavirus restrictions. The Times reported the games could be moved from London to Budapest if VIPs are not given an exemption to England's strict quarantine rules. The UK government has postponed lifting all restrictions until 19 July - the final of the tournament is due to take place on 11 July. Most countries in Euro 2020 are on the UK government's amber or red list. Wembley's capacity is reduced to 22,500 for group fixtures at Euro 2020, but that is set to be expanded to 45,000 - about 50% of full capacity - for games in the knockout stages. The matches are being treated as fan pilot events and so are exempt from strict capacity limits. Read more on this storyhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Cases are rising in every
region and nation of the UK. The numbers of people going into hospital are rising in Scotland and every region of England. The epidemic is without a
doubt growing, and so we should expect to see ever higher numbers of cases and
people going into hospital for a while. But the case numbers are not
growing as quickly as they have been in recent weeks. Todayâs figure of just over
10,000 is nearly 30% higher than last Fridayâs which was, in turn about 30%
higher than the week before. But the two weeks before that
saw numbers rising by nearly 50% each week. Slower rises are still rises,
and weâll have to wait and see how this plays through into hospitalisations. But any potential slowdown is
a hopeful sign â before reversing, you need to hit the brakes. BBC Newsbeat Like many others, Enter Shikari frontman Rou Reynolds says the past 18 months have been strange. Last year, Covid-19 wiped out the UK's summer festival season, and this yearonly a handful are still taking place. This weekend, the band will be back on stage at Download Festival in Donnington Park, Leicestershire. ""Can you believe it? We've been spending the last three weeks trying to work out how to be a live band again,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I remember saying halfway through the pandemic, it sort of feels like we're experiencing what the death of a band would be like, by just not being able to play."" Read the full storyhere. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The recent surge in Covid numbers in Russia may be an example
of how careless talk costs lives. For months, Russians had been told by officials and
Kremlin-controlled media how successful their country had been at battling the
coronavirus, while the West was described as failing miserably. People in Europe, for instance, were said to be confused and
angry because of endless lockdowns. There were reports on Russian TV of
violence, rioting and vaccine shortages in the West. Time and again, Russian TV
described Western vaccines as part of the problem, and claimed that they were
causing more deaths. No evidence was offered to back up these claims. Meanwhile in Russia, state TV would say, things were getting
better: restrictions were being lifted, shopping centres and museums were
reopening, students were going back to universities, and vaccination was proceeding apace. Only little mention was made of how many Russians exactly had
been vaccinated, or how many had died because of the virus - it had been all
but defeated, supposedly. Now the rhetoric has changed. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry
Peskov on Friday blamed a record number of daily Covid infections in the capital, Moscow, on
""nihilism"", and state TV is alarmed and broadcasting pro-vaccination
appeals. But given the past behaviour by both officials and the
media, it should perhaps come as no surprise if many in Russia are complacent
and distrustful of vaccines.  Nearly 470,000 UK
adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine yesterday. The latest government
data shows 243,978 first doses were given, taking the total
number of people to have received their initial jab to 42,460,632. A total of 223,260 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 30,898,467, or 58.7% of adults, have now had both jabs. There have been a
further 10,476 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another 11 deaths
within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were
8,125 cases and 17 deaths reported. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier,Israel has said it is to send at least a million doses of Covid vaccine to the Palestinian Authorityin return for receiving a similar amount back later in the year. The deal means Israel will not waste doses that are about to expire, while the Palestinians can accelerate their vaccination programme. This appears to be a win-win arrangement for Israelis and Palestinians. The first batches have already been received by the Palestinian health ministry. It says they will be used in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and that vaccination centres will now open seven days a week with extended hours. Israel, which has led the world with its rapid rollout of Covid vaccines, has faced criticism for not doing more to ensure Palestinians have access. It denies having responsibility under international law - but Israeli health officials say thereâs a benefit to helping Palestinians get immunised because of mixing of the populations. Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury has said vaccines will be compulsory for its staff returning to the office when it reopens. Many firms are having to weigh up the necessity of workforce vaccinations. The government has announced care home workers in England will be required to have a vaccination or risk losing their jobs. Bloomsbury toldThe Bookseller,externalmagazine, which first reported the company's decision, that it had taken both ""medical and scientific advice"". ""The simple fact is that this virus is still extremely dangerous."" The publisher is due to reopen on 19 July and made employees aware of the policy in an email ahead of the second May Bank Holiday weekend. Read more on this storyhere. Katie PrescottToday business presenter Some passengers due to set sail with cruise company MSC are having their trips cancelled because the delay to easing Covid restrictions means the ships have been overbooked. Cruise ships are allowed to hold up to 1,000 guests under the current guidelines. But MSC oversold tickets for cruises after 21 June, saying it ""had fully expected that most restrictions would be removed"". Customers who had their trips cancelled yesterday are complaining on social media about the lack of information and about being out of pocket for things such as parking, travel to the ports and hotels. One woman told me she paid Â£1,4000 for her elderly mother to go into respite care for the week. Andy Hunt from Essex was due to set sail from Southampton. He says: ""Now they've had my money, we had the suitcases out of the garage, got the week booked off, my wife has the week booked off, the dogs are booked into kennels. I'm really, really frustrated it could have been handled so much better."" MSC says the first 1,000 passengers who booked get priority boarding and those left will be able to rebook or get a refund.

Italy hasbrought in a five-day quarantine requirementalong with a mandatory Covid test for all arrivals from the UK, amid growing concerns about the spread of the Delta variant. Italy is on the amber list for UK travel and had, until today, not required quarantine on arrival as long as visitors presented anegative Covid test result,externaltaken in the previous 48 hours. Italy reported 37 coronavirus-related deaths yesterday against 52 on Wednesday, while the daily number of new infections fell to 1,325 from 1,400, the health ministry says. In contrast, the UK reported 11,007 new cases yesterday. Euro 2020 sees Wales due to play Italy in Rome on Sundayso some fans from the UK may already be in the country. For others who have bought tickets quarantining on arrival could mean they'd miss the match. The travel rules and no official fan zones mean most of the ""Red Wall"" willfollow Euro 2020at home or in the pub.Meet the Wales fans who will be swapping the stadium for the sofa this year. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Rates of coronavirus infection in England are highest in the North West, the Office for National Statistics estimates. About 0.55% of people are testing positive there, with the next closest Yorkshire & the Humber at 0.25%. No other English region has rates above 0.2%. There are possible signs of a decrease in the percentage of children testing positive in school years 7 to 11. The highest rates are in the group between school year 12 (16-year-olds) and those aged 24, which sees 0.5% testing positive, and among 25 to 34-year-olds - at 0.4%. About 0.2% of younger children would test positive and about 0.1% of older adults would test positive, the ONS says. This video can not be played Smaller cities around the US are offering incentives, sometimes up to $15,000 (Â£10,800), for young talent to move there. And with remote work on the rise during the pandemic, people are freer to relocate. Nearly one in four Americans is expected to be a fully remote worker in a few years. Vaccinating children is routine and widely accepted - measles, mumps, polio, diphtheria, rotavirus, multiple strains of meningitis, whooping coughâ¦ the list goes on. All this starts from just a few weeks old. So, what about Covid-19? Some countries are cracking on. The US is immunising children between 12 and 15. It expects to have enough safety data to go even younger next year. But in the UK -the BBC has been told- a decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-olds is unlikely to be recommended by UK experts any time soon. There is a scientific question - will vaccinating children save lives? - which is complex as the answer may vary from country to country. There is also a moral and ethical dimension if doses destined for children would save more lives if they were given to health workers and vulnerable adults in other countries.

number of people to have received their initial jab to 42,460,632. A total of 223,260 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 30,898,467, or 58.7% of adults, have now had both jabs. There have been a
further 10,476 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another 11 deaths
within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were
8,125 cases and 17 deaths reported. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier,Israel has said it is to send at least a million doses of Covid vaccine to the Palestinian Authorityin return for receiving a similar amount back later in the year. The deal means Israel will not waste doses that are about to expire, while the Palestinians can accelerate their vaccination programme. This appears to be a win-win arrangement for Israelis and Palestinians. The first batches have already been received by the Palestinian health ministry. It says they will be used in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and that vaccination centres will now open seven days a week with extended hours. Israel, which has led the world with its rapid rollout of Covid vaccines, has faced criticism for not doing more to ensure Palestinians have access. It denies having responsibility under international law - but Israeli health officials say thereâs a benefit to helping Palestinians get immunised because of mixing of the populations. Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury has said vaccines will be compulsory for its staff returning to the office when it reopens. Many firms are having to weigh up the necessity of workforce vaccinations. The government has announced care home workers in England will be required to have a vaccination or risk losing their jobs. Bloomsbury toldThe Bookseller,externalmagazine, which first reported the company's decision, that it had taken both ""medical and scientific advice"". ""The simple fact is that this virus is still extremely dangerous.""

Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Rates of coronavirus infection in England are highest in the North West, the Office for National Statistics estimates. About 0.55% of people are testing positive there, with the next closest Yorkshire & the Humber at 0.25%. No other English region has rates above 0.2%. There are possible signs of a decrease in the percentage of children testing positive in school years 7 to 11. The highest rates are in the group between school year 12 (16-year-olds) and those aged 24, which sees 0.5% testing positive, and among 25 to 34-year-olds - at 0.4%. About 0.2% of younger children would test positive and about 0.1% of older adults would test positive, the ONS says.

Lloyd Webber rejects PM's full-capacity offer,"Andrew Lloyd Webber is the owner of seven London theatres Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer to add his new musical Cinderella to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events. The PMsaid earlier this weekhe was in talks with the theatre impresario. But Lord Lloyd-Webber said on Friday the theatre industry had been treated as ""an afterthought and undervalued"". Last week, he said he was determined to open his show to a full house on 25 June, even if he risked being arrested. However, he has now rowed back on that. On Monday, the government confirmed that it would not lift all Covid restrictions until at least 19 July. After rejecting the option to be one of the official pilot events, Lord Lloyd-Webber confirmed the show would open next week with a 50% capacity, the current legal limit. Lloyd Webber 'ready for arrest' over open theatres Reopening delay a hammer blow - live event sector If he did open with a full theatre, it ""would be very likely that every member of my cast, crew and orchestra, the front and backstage staff, plus our loyal audience members, could be individually fined Â£500, which I couldn't possibly risk"", he said. ""If it were just me, I would happily risk arrest and fines to make a stand and lead the live music and theatre industry back to the full capacities we so desperately need."" He said would go ahead with a socially-distanced audience at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London's West End because he was not able to look his ""young cast and crew in the eyes to tell them we were delaying or closing down"".

He said he had turned down the pilot because the offer was not open to other performances. ""I have made it crystal clear that I would only be able to participate if others were involved and the rest of the industry - theatre and music - were treated equally,"" he said. ""This has not been confirmed to me."" He continued: ""It has become clear that, while sporting events like Wimbledon had obviously been working with the government for some time on this pilot, and were even able to start selling tickets yesterday, the theatre industry and its audiences is, once again, an afterthought and undervalued."" A defiant announcement was put on the front of the Gillian Lynne Theatre in London The government said it was ""disappointed"" that he had decided not to take part in the official pilot events, which would have allowed him to have the venue 75% full, rising to 100%. ""We are disappointed that Lord Lloyd Webber has decided not to take part in the Events Research Programme, having engaged with his team on exactly the same basis as a wide range of other cultural and sporting events,"" a spokesperson said. ""We will be setting out details of the next stage of the programme very shortly, once all public health considerations have been finalised, and this will include a number of other theatres. This research will build on successful pilot events in the arts, music and sport sectors."" The government pointed out that events including outdoor gigs, club nights, the Brit Awards as well as the Crucible theatre had already been part of the scheme. Last year, Lord Lloyd Webber said it was economically ""impossible"" to run theatres with social distancing. Reacting to his latest comments, Greg Parmley, chief executive of live music trade association Live, said: ""The live music industry has spent months participating and paying for pilot events so we could reopen at full capacity safety. ""These events were a huge success and show, alongside every other international pilot, that with the right mitigations full capacity live events are safe. ""Despite this the government has refused to publish this data, forced us to remain closed and then tried to hand-pick a number of high profile events to go ahead whilst the rest of our industries are devastated.""

Today's live page has been brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jo Couzens, Paul Gribben and James Clarke. It's been a busy day, but it's time to say goodbye. Here's a summary of what's gone on during the day: As England opens up first doses of vaccines to everyone aged 18 and older, over-40s and people with underlying health conditions are being contacted to bring their second doses forward. The initial advice across the whole of the UK was to offer jabs 12 weeks apart in order to give as many people as possible a first dose. Now those who haven't yet had their second dose in some priority groups can have it after eight weeks. You can rearrange an appointment yourself, but you must first cancel your original bookingonline,external, or by calling 119. Second doses are also beingbrought forward,externalinScotlandto eight weeks and appointments can be rebooked viathe NHS Inform website,external. InNorthern Ireland,the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks,externalfor appointments scheduled after 14 June. InWales, the government saysvaccination clinics ""are accelerating second doses"",external, and that people will be contacted by their local health board in due course. Here's everything you need to know about going for your jabs. Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer to add his new musical Cinderella to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events. The PM said earlier this week he was in talks with the theatre impresario about including the show in the scheme. But Lord Lloyd Webber says the theatre industry has been treated as ""an afterthought and undervalued"" and he would only take part in the scheme if others in the trade were treated equally. On Monday, the government confirmed it would not lift all Covid restrictions until at least 19 July - delayed from the proposed date of 21 June.

The total infections have crossed the five million mark and at least seven African countries have run out of vaccines. Africa remains an area of concern, even though it accounts for only about 5% of new global infections and 2% of deaths, WHO officials say. New cases in Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Rwanda have
doubled in the past week, WHO emergencies programme head Mike
Ryan is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. ""It's a trajectory that is very, very concerning,"" he has told reporters at the organisation's headquarters in Geneva. ""The brutal reality is that in an era of multiple
variants, with increased transmissibility, we have left vast
swathes of the population, the vulnerable population of Africa,
unprotected by vaccines."" South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Egypt have recorded the most virus cases in the continent. Uganda and Namibia are experiencing a deadly third wave, with dozens of fatalities recorded daily. A total of 136,030 people have succumbed to the virus in different African countries, according to the WHO. The Delta variant is in 14 African countries while the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa, is in 25 countries. The WHO says there's no clear timeline on when more vaccines will be available, but there is an urgent need for them. UK music fans are sitting on hundreds of thousands of tickets for postponed concerts rather than returning them. The latest four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions has pushed an additional 5,000 gigs into doubt. Artists such as Rag'n'Bone Man, Olly Murs and Rudimental had scheduled shows between 21 June and 19 July and face a choice of postponing or scrapping gigs. Industry body Live estimates the events scheduled for the next four weeks are worth Â£500m to the struggling sector. It also means fans remain out of pocket to see shows they forked out for many months ago. Read BBC business reporter Rebecca Wearn's full reporthere. And a guide to the rules for gigs and festivals ishere. Most existing Covid restrictions in the UK are staying in place for the moment, because of concerns over the Delta variant. The government had hoped to""remove all legal limits on social contact"",externalin England from 21 June. It's now been put back until 19 July. Wales announced earlier it is pausing itsprogramme of lockdown-easingfor four weeks. In Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictions has beenpushed back to at least 5 July.

Wembley hosted 22,500 fans - 25% of its capacity - for England's Group D fixture against Croatia Uefa says it is ""confident"" the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 will be held at Wembley as planned - but has a contingency plan amid concerns around England's coronavirus restrictions. The Times reported the games could be moved from London to Budapest if VIPs are not given an exemption to England's strict quarantine rules. The UK government has postponed lifting all restrictions until 19 July - the final of the tournament is due to take place on 11 July. Most countries in Euro 2020 are on the UK government's amber or red list. Wembley's capacity is reduced to 22,500 for group fixtures at Euro 2020, but that is set to be expanded to 45,000 - about 50% of full capacity - for games in the knockout stages. The matches are being treated as fan pilot events and so are exempt from strict capacity limits. Read more on this storyhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Cases are rising in every
region and nation of the UK. The numbers of people going into hospital are rising in Scotland and every region of England. The epidemic is without a
doubt growing, and so we should expect to see ever higher numbers of cases and
people going into hospital for a while. But the case numbers are not
growing as quickly as they have been in recent weeks. Todayâs figure of just over
10,000 is nearly 30% higher than last Fridayâs which was, in turn about 30%
higher than the week before. But the two weeks before that
saw numbers rising by nearly 50% each week. Slower rises are still rises,
and weâll have to wait and see how this plays through into hospitalisations. But any potential slowdown is
a hopeful sign â before reversing, you need to hit the brakes. BBC Newsbeat Like many others, Enter Shikari frontman Rou Reynolds says the past 18 months have been strange. Last year, Covid-19 wiped out the UK's summer festival season, and this yearonly a handful are still taking place. This weekend, the band will be back on stage at Download Festival in Donnington Park, Leicestershire. ""Can you believe it? We've been spending the last three weeks trying to work out how to be a live band again,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I remember saying halfway through the pandemic, it sort of feels like we're experiencing what the death of a band would be like, by just not being able to play."" Read the full storyhere. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The recent surge in Covid numbers in Russia may be an example
of how careless talk costs lives. For months, Russians had been told by officials and
Kremlin-controlled media how successful their country had been at battling the
coronavirus, while the West was described as failing miserably. People in Europe, for instance, were said to be confused and
angry because of endless lockdowns. There were reports on Russian TV of
violence, rioting and vaccine shortages in the West. Time and again, Russian TV
described Western vaccines as part of the problem, and claimed that they were
causing more deaths. No evidence was offered to back up these claims. Meanwhile in Russia, state TV would say, things were getting
better: restrictions were being lifted, shopping centres and museums were
reopening, students were going back to universities, and vaccination was proceeding apace. Only little mention was made of how many Russians exactly had
been vaccinated, or how many had died because of the virus - it had been all
but defeated, supposedly. Now the rhetoric has changed. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry
Peskov on Friday blamed a record number of daily Covid infections in the capital, Moscow, on
""nihilism"", and state TV is alarmed and broadcasting pro-vaccination
appeals. But given the past behaviour by both officials and the
media, it should perhaps come as no surprise if many in Russia are complacent
and distrustful of vaccines.  Nearly 470,000 UK
adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine yesterday. The latest government
data shows 243,978 first doses were given, taking the total
number of people to have received their initial jab to 42,460,632. A total of 223,260 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 30,898,467, or 58.7% of adults, have now had both jabs. There have been a

Rush to buy Apple Daily after Hong Kong police raid,"Hong Kongers snapped up copies of Apple Daily, a day after police raided its newsroom People in Hong Kong have queued up to buy copies of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily a day after its newsroom was raided by police. The front page carried a message of defiance, reading: ""We must press on."" The paper typically prints about 80,000 copies but increased that to 500,000 to meet demand. Some news stands sold out. The raid on the newspaper came as two of its executives were charged under Hong Kong's controversial new national security law. A total of five executives were arrested. Editor-in-chief Ryan Law and chief executive officer Cheung Kim-hung were the two charged. The other three, Chief Operating Officer Chow Tat-kuen, Deputy Chief Editor Chan Pui-man and Chief Executive Editor Cheung Chi-wai remain under investigation, police said. Ms Chan was released on bail late on Friday. She told reporters outside the police station she was saddened by the charges against two of her colleagues and said she was proud of staff for publishing the newspaper earlier that day. Mr Chow and Mr Cheung remain in police custody. Apple Daily: The Hong Kong paper that pushed the boundary China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Apple Daily, a tabloid, is known for its bold criticism of the mainland Chinese leadership. Its billionaire owner Jimmy Lai, a high-profile supporter of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, isalready in jail on a string of controversial charges, including allegedly participating in an unauthorised assembly in 2019. Mr Lai is one of dozens of prominent activists arrested since Beijing introduced the national security law last year. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai in 2021: The Hong Kong billionaire becomes emotional as he faces prison About 500 police officers descended on the Apple Daily newsroom on Thursday, carrying away computers and hard-drives. Police also froze HK$18m ($2.3m; Â£1.64m) of assets owned by three companies linked to the paper. The paper broadcast live footage of the raid on its Facebook account. Police were seen sitting at desks accessing reporters' computers. In a media briefing, police said that since 2019, Apple Daily had published more than 30 articles calling on countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and mainland China. The push to complete Friday's edition became a news story itself, with rival media outlets looking on as editors worked. The front page headline ""we must press on"" were the words Mr Cheung told staff as he was led away in handcuffs. A proof reader at work on the day of the raid, documented by members of other media organisations The front page of Friday's paper carried pictures of the five arrested staff members In Mongkok district, Hong Kongers queued in the early hours for the first edition. ""Usually we sell around 60 copies but tonight, we just sold 1,800,"" one news stand owner told AFP news agency. Apple Daily reported that ""some bought 10 or 100 copies at one go,externalto show their support, taking the stacks of papers with them using a trolley or a car"". Customer Steven Chow, who bought three copies, observed: ""There is no perfect media, but it [Apple Daily] is a unique voice in Hong Kong. You may not like it, but I think you need to let them have their voice and survive, it is important."" WATCH: Why China is bent on crushing Hong Kong dissent Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice It is unclear how long the paper can keep running after the latest asset freeze. The UN's chief human rights spokesperson, Rupert Colville, said on Friday that the newsroom raid sent ""a further chilling message for media freedom"". ""We call on Hong Kong authorities to respect their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in line with the Basic Law, in particular freedom of expression,"" he said. Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, in Hong Kong ""I had Apple for breakfast,"" an Instagram friend of mine wrote in a post. ""Ate one early in the morning,"" wrote another. Young people here showed off their copies of the edition. News stand agents told me a lot of young people had come to buy the paper - not their usual customers. And the older generation did it their way. A pensioner who lives in the Yuen Long district bought 10 copies from a news stand and gave them out to passers-by. ""I want to support Apple Daily, and then to support Hong Kong's press freedom,"" she told me. Cheung Kim-hung, Apple Daily's chief executive, has told his reporters to ""press on"". But as the government freezes its bank accounts, the paper will find it hard to trade. They might eventually find it a problem just to collect money from newsagents. In the longer run, Apple Daily could be disbanded if it is found guilty on charges against it and its two executives under controversial new national security law. A reporter on Thursday asked Hong Kong's secretary for security, John Lee if the government would make sure Apple Daily can no longer publish by 1 July - the anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China. ""If the law gives us authority to do whatever things, and it's effective and legal, we would do so,"" said Mr Lee, pledging to tackle any perceived threats to national security ""with the strictest measures"".

"Rush to buy Apple Daily after Hong Kong police raidThe pro-democracy newspaper printed a bumper 500,000 copies after police arrested five senior staff.","Hong Kongers snapped up copies of Apple Daily, a day after police raided its newsroom People in Hong Kong have queued up to buy copies of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily a day after its newsroom was raided by police. The front page carried a message of defiance, reading: ""We must press on."" The paper typically prints about 80,000 copies but increased that to 500,000 to meet demand. Some news stands sold out. The raid on the newspaper came as two of its executives were charged under Hong Kong's controversial new national security law. A total of five executives were arrested. Editor-in-chief Ryan Law and chief executive officer Cheung Kim-hung were the two charged. The other three, Chief Operating Officer Chow Tat-kuen, Deputy Chief Editor Chan Pui-man and Chief Executive Editor Cheung Chi-wai remain under investigation, police said. Ms Chan was released on bail late on Friday. She told reporters outside the police station she was saddened by the charges against two of her colleagues and said she was proud of staff for publishing the newspaper earlier that day. Mr Chow and Mr Cheung remain in police custody. Apple Daily: The Hong Kong paper that pushed the boundary China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Apple Daily, a tabloid, is known for its bold criticism of the mainland Chinese leadership. Its billionaire owner Jimmy Lai, a high-profile supporter of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, isalready in jail on a string of controversial charges, including allegedly participating in an unauthorised assembly in 2019. Mr Lai is one of dozens of prominent activists arrested since Beijing introduced the national security law last year. This video can not be played Jimmy Lai in 2021: The Hong Kong billionaire becomes emotional as he faces prison About 500 police officers descended on the Apple Daily newsroom on Thursday, carrying away computers and hard-drives. Police also froze HK$18m ($2.3m; Â£1.64m) of assets owned by three companies linked to the paper. The paper broadcast live footage of the raid on its Facebook account. Police were seen sitting at desks accessing reporters' computers. In a media briefing, police said that since 2019, Apple Daily had published more than 30 articles calling on countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and mainland China. The push to complete Friday's edition became a news story itself, with rival media outlets looking on as editors worked. The front page headline ""we must press on"" were the words Mr Cheung told staff as he was led away in handcuffs. A proof reader at work on the day of the raid, documented by members of other media organisations The front page of Friday's paper carried pictures of the five arrested staff members In Mongkok district, Hong Kongers queued in the early hours for the first edition. ""Usually we sell around 60 copies but tonight, we just sold 1,800,"" one news stand owner told AFP news agency. Apple Daily reported that ""some bought 10 or 100 copies at one go,externalto show their support, taking the stacks of papers with them using a trolley or a car"". Customer Steven Chow, who bought three copies, observed: ""There is no perfect media, but it [Apple Daily] is a unique voice in Hong Kong. You may not like it, but I think you need to let them have their voice and survive, it is important."" WATCH: Why China is bent on crushing Hong Kong dissent Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice It is unclear how long the paper can keep running after the latest asset freeze. The UN's chief human rights spokesperson, Rupert Colville, said on Friday that the newsroom raid sent ""a further chilling message for media freedom"". ""We call on Hong Kong authorities to respect their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in line with the Basic Law, in particular freedom of expression,"" he said. Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, in Hong Kong ""I had Apple for breakfast,"" an Instagram friend of mine wrote in a post. ""Ate one early in the morning,"" wrote another. Young people here showed off their copies of the edition. News stand agents told me a lot of young people had come to buy the paper - not their usual customers. And the older generation did it their way. A pensioner who lives in the Yuen Long district bought 10 copies from a news stand and gave them out to passers-by. ""I want to support Apple Daily, and then to support Hong Kong's press freedom,"" she told me. Cheung Kim-hung, Apple Daily's chief executive, has told his reporters to ""press on"". But as the government freezes its bank accounts, the paper will find it hard to trade. They might eventually find it a problem just to collect money from newsagents. In the longer run, Apple Daily could be disbanded if it is found guilty on charges against it and its two executives under controversial new national security law. A reporter on Thursday asked Hong Kong's secretary for security, John Lee if the government would make sure Apple Daily can no longer publish by 1 July - the anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China. ""If the law gives us authority to do whatever things, and it's effective and legal, we would do so,"" said Mr Lee, pledging to tackle any perceived threats to national security ""with the strictest measures"".

Today's live page has been brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jo Couzens, Paul Gribben and James Clarke. It's been a busy day, but it's time to say goodbye. Here's a summary of what's gone on during the day: As England opens up first doses of vaccines to everyone aged 18 and older, over-40s and people with underlying health conditions are being contacted to bring their second doses forward. The initial advice across the whole of the UK was to offer jabs 12 weeks apart in order to give as many people as possible a first dose. Now those who haven't yet had their second dose in some priority groups can have it after eight weeks. You can rearrange an appointment yourself, but you must first cancel your original bookingonline,external, or by calling 119. Second doses are also beingbrought forward,externalinScotlandto eight weeks and appointments can be rebooked viathe NHS Inform website,external. InNorthern Ireland,the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks,externalfor appointments scheduled after 14 June. InWales, the government saysvaccination clinics ""are accelerating second doses"",external, and that people will be contacted by their local health board in due course. Here's everything you need to know about going for your jabs. Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer to add his new musical Cinderella to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events. The PM said earlier this week he was in talks with the theatre impresario about including the show in the scheme. But Lord Lloyd Webber says the theatre industry has been treated as ""an afterthought and undervalued"" and he would only take part in the scheme if others in the trade were treated equally. On Monday, the government confirmed it would not lift all Covid restrictions until at least 19 July - delayed from the proposed date of 21 June. Last week, Lord Lloyd Webber said he was determined to open his show to a full house on 25 June, even if he risked being arrested. However, after rejecting the option to be one of the official pilot events, he has rowed back on his threat to go to jail and confirmed the show will go ahead with a 50% capacity, the current legal limit.

The total infections have crossed the five million mark and at least seven African countries have run out of vaccines. Africa remains an area of concern, even though it accounts for only about 5% of new global infections and 2% of deaths, WHO officials say. New cases in Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Rwanda have
doubled in the past week, WHO emergencies programme head Mike
Ryan is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. ""It's a trajectory that is very, very concerning,"" he has told reporters at the organisation's headquarters in Geneva. ""The brutal reality is that in an era of multiple
variants, with increased transmissibility, we have left vast
swathes of the population, the vulnerable population of Africa,
unprotected by vaccines."" South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Egypt have recorded the most virus cases in the continent. Uganda and Namibia are experiencing a deadly third wave, with dozens of fatalities recorded daily. A total of 136,030 people have succumbed to the virus in different African countries, according to the WHO. The Delta variant is in 14 African countries while the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa, is in 25 countries. The WHO says there's no clear timeline on when more vaccines will be available, but there is an urgent need for them. UK music fans are sitting on hundreds of thousands of tickets for postponed concerts rather than returning them. The latest four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions has pushed an additional 5,000 gigs into doubt. Artists such as Rag'n'Bone Man, Olly Murs and Rudimental had scheduled shows between 21 June and 19 July and face a choice of postponing or scrapping gigs. Industry body Live estimates the events scheduled for the next four weeks are worth Â£500m to the struggling sector. It also means fans remain out of pocket to see shows they forked out for many months ago. Read BBC business reporter Rebecca Wearn's full reporthere. And a guide to the rules for gigs and festivals ishere. Most existing Covid restrictions in the UK are staying in place for the moment, because of concerns over the Delta variant. The government had hoped to""remove all legal limits on social contact"",externalin England from 21 June. It's now been put back until 19 July. Wales announced earlier it is pausing itsprogramme of lockdown-easingfor four weeks. In Northern Ireland, a planned easing of restrictions has beenpushed back to at least 5 July. And in Scotland, the current rules are expected to be extendeduntil mid-July. Find a full guide to the restrictionshere, while an explanation of the latest rules for weddings ishere. Wembley hosted 22,500 fans - 25% of its capacity - for England's Group D fixture against Croatia Uefa says it is ""confident"" the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 will be held at Wembley as planned - but has a contingency plan amid concerns around England's coronavirus restrictions. The Times reported the games could be moved from London to Budapest if VIPs are not given an exemption to England's strict quarantine rules. The UK government has postponed lifting all restrictions until 19 July - the final of the tournament is due to take place on 11 July. Most countries in Euro 2020 are on the UK government's amber or red list. Wembley's capacity is reduced to 22,500 for group fixtures at Euro 2020, but that is set to be expanded to 45,000 - about 50% of full capacity - for games in the knockout stages. The matches are being treated as fan pilot events and so are exempt from strict capacity limits. Read more on this storyhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Cases are rising in every
region and nation of the UK. The numbers of people going into hospital are rising in Scotland and every region of England. The epidemic is without a
doubt growing, and so we should expect to see ever higher numbers of cases and
people going into hospital for a while. But the case numbers are not
growing as quickly as they have been in recent weeks. Todayâs figure of just over
10,000 is nearly 30% higher than last Fridayâs which was, in turn about 30%
higher than the week before. But the two weeks before that
saw numbers rising by nearly 50% each week. Slower rises are still rises,
and weâll have to wait and see how this plays through into hospitalisations. But any potential slowdown is
a hopeful sign â before reversing, you need to hit the brakes. BBC Newsbeat Like many others, Enter Shikari frontman Rou Reynolds says the past 18 months have been strange. Last year, Covid-19 wiped out the UK's summer festival season, and this yearonly a handful are still taking place. This weekend, the band will be back on stage at Download Festival in Donnington Park, Leicestershire. ""Can you believe it? We've been spending the last three weeks trying to work out how to be a live band again,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I remember saying halfway through the pandemic, it sort of feels like we're experiencing what the death of a band would be like, by just not being able to play."" Read the full storyhere. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The recent surge in Covid numbers in Russia may be an example
of how careless talk costs lives. For months, Russians had been told by officials and
Kremlin-controlled media how successful their country had been at battling the
coronavirus, while the West was described as failing miserably. People in Europe, for instance, were said to be confused and
angry because of endless lockdowns. There were reports on Russian TV of
violence, rioting and vaccine shortages in the West. Time and again, Russian TV
described Western vaccines as part of the problem, and claimed that they were
causing more deaths. No evidence was offered to back up these claims. Meanwhile in Russia, state TV would say, things were getting
better: restrictions were being lifted, shopping centres and museums were
reopening, students were going back to universities, and vaccination was proceeding apace. Only little mention was made of how many Russians exactly had
been vaccinated, or how many had died because of the virus - it had been all
but defeated, supposedly. Now the rhetoric has changed. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry
Peskov on Friday blamed a record number of daily Covid infections in the capital, Moscow, on
""nihilism"", and state TV is alarmed and broadcasting pro-vaccination
appeals. But given the past behaviour by both officials and the
media, it should perhaps come as no surprise if many in Russia are complacent
and distrustful of vaccines.  Nearly 470,000 UK
adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine yesterday. The latest government
data shows 243,978 first doses were given, taking the total
number of people to have received their initial jab to 42,460,632. A total of 223,260 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 30,898,467, or 58.7% of adults, have now had both jabs. There have been a
further 10,476 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another 11 deaths
within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were
8,125 cases and 17 deaths reported. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier,Israel has said it is to send at least a million doses of Covid vaccine to the Palestinian Authorityin return for receiving a similar amount back later in the year. The deal means Israel will not waste doses that are about to expire, while the Palestinians can accelerate their vaccination programme. This appears to be a win-win arrangement for Israelis and Palestinians. The first batches have already been received by the Palestinian health ministry. It says they will be used in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and that vaccination centres will now open seven days a week with extended hours. Israel, which has led the world with its rapid rollout of Covid vaccines, has faced criticism for not doing more to ensure Palestinians have access. It denies having responsibility under international law - but Israeli health officials say thereâs a benefit to helping Palestinians get immunised because of mixing of the populations. Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury has said vaccines will be compulsory for its staff returning to the office when it reopens. Many firms are having to weigh up the necessity of workforce vaccinations. The government has announced care home workers in England will be required to have a vaccination or risk losing their jobs. Bloomsbury toldThe Bookseller,externalmagazine, which first reported the company's decision, that it had taken both ""medical and scientific advice"". ""The simple fact is that this virus is still extremely dangerous."" The publisher is due to reopen on 19 July and made employees aware of the policy in an email ahead of the second May Bank Holiday weekend. Read more on this storyhere. Katie PrescottToday business presenter Some passengers due to set sail with cruise company MSC are having their trips cancelled because the delay to easing Covid restrictions means the ships have been overbooked. Cruise ships are allowed to hold up to 1,000 guests under the current guidelines. But MSC oversold tickets for cruises after 21 June, saying it ""had fully expected that most restrictions would be removed"". Customers who had their trips cancelled yesterday are complaining on social media about the lack of information and about being out of pocket for things such as parking, travel to the ports and hotels. One woman told me she paid Â£1,4000 for her elderly mother to go into respite care for the week. Andy Hunt from Essex was due to set sail from Southampton. He says: ""Now they've had my money, we had the suitcases out of the garage, got the week booked off, my wife has the week booked off, the dogs are booked into kennels. I'm really, really frustrated it could have been handled so much better."" MSC says the first 1,000 passengers who booked get priority boarding and those left will be able to rebook or get a refund.

Italy hasbrought in a five-day quarantine requirementalong with a mandatory Covid test for all arrivals from the UK, amid growing concerns about the spread of the Delta variant. Italy is on the amber list for UK travel and had, until today, not required quarantine on arrival as long as visitors presented anegative Covid test result,externaltaken in the previous 48 hours. Italy reported 37 coronavirus-related deaths yesterday against 52 on Wednesday, while the daily number of new infections fell to 1,325 from 1,400, the health ministry says. In contrast, the UK reported 11,007 new cases yesterday. Euro 2020 sees Wales due to play Italy in Rome on Sundayso some fans from the UK may already be in the country. For others who have bought tickets quarantining on arrival could mean they'd miss the match. The travel rules and no official fan zones mean most of the ""Red Wall"" willfollow Euro 2020at home or in the pub.Meet the Wales fans who will be swapping the stadium for the sofa this year. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Rates of coronavirus infection in England are highest in the North West, the Office for National Statistics estimates. About 0.55% of people are testing positive there, with the next closest Yorkshire & the Humber at 0.25%. No other English region has rates above 0.2%. There are possible signs of a decrease in the percentage of children testing positive in school years 7 to 11. The highest rates are in the group between school year 12 (16-year-olds) and those aged 24, which sees 0.5% testing positive, and among 25 to 34-year-olds - at 0.4%. About 0.2% of younger children would test positive and about 0.1% of older adults would test positive, the ONS says. This video can not be played Smaller cities around the US are offering incentives, sometimes up to $15,000 (Â£10,800), for young talent to move there. And with remote work on the rise during the pandemic, people are freer to relocate. Nearly one in four Americans is expected to be a fully remote worker in a few years. Vaccinating children is routine and widely accepted - measles, mumps, polio, diphtheria, rotavirus, multiple strains of meningitis, whooping coughâ¦ the list goes on. All this starts from just a few weeks old. So, what about Covid-19? Some countries are cracking on. The US is immunising children between 12 and 15. It expects to have enough safety data to go even younger next year. But in the UK -the BBC has been told- a decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-olds is unlikely to be recommended by UK experts any time soon. There is a scientific question - will vaccinating children save lives? - which is complex as the answer may vary from country to country. There is also a moral and ethical dimension if doses destined for children would save more lives if they were given to health workers and vulnerable adults in other countries.

Beckett drops out of Unite leadership contest,"Howard Beckett is backing Steve Turner in the contest Howard Beckett - one of the candidates in the Unite union race to succeed Len McCluskey as general secretary - has pulled out of the contest. Mr Beckett - the union's assistant general secretary - says he will support fellow left-wing candidate Steve Turner. His decision means there are now three remaining candidates - Mr Turner, Sharon Graham and Gerard Coyne. Voting starts next month, with the result to be announced in August. In a joint statement, Mr Beckett and Mr Turner say they will work to implement a ""blended manifesto"", taking ideas from both of their campaigns. Three-way battle to be left's Unite candidate Row over leaked Unite emails about Labour MPs ""Our programme recognises the central importance of organising and leverage to winning for members in struggle and building the union. We will also put greater resources into ensuring a bigger role for women and black members in the union and greater support in the workplace,"" they say. The statement also suggests that Ms Graham would be an important member of Mr Turner's team too, were he to win. Gerard Coyne was narrowly defeated for the top post of general secretary by Mr McCluskey in 2017, and he is seen as the candidate closest to the Labour leadership under Sir Keir Starmer. Efforts had been under way to agree a single candidate from the left to take him on in the contest. The Labour leadership will be relieved that Howard Beckett is out of the running. But Mr Beckett was also under huge pressure to step aside from many on the Left - not least Len McCluskey. The outgoing Unite boss hosted a series of ""behind-closed-doors"" negotiations with the three Left candidates - Steve Turner, Sharon Graham and Mr Beckett. He believed a ""split vote"" on the Left would give his former opponent for the top Unite post, Gerard Coyne, a much better chance of victory. Read Iain's full analysis In a statement, Mr Coyne said Mr Beckett's decision to pull out of the race and endorse Steve Turner is an attempt to prevent cultural change at Unite. He said he was ""happy to be the mainstream candidate"". He added: ""I am the only candidate who would change the culture of the union, make its financial affairs transparent, improve its internal democracy and end the ill-judged attempts to drive the Labour Party from the back seat. ""Previously, I was up against three full time officers of Unite who represented continuity and were opposed to change. Now their number is reduced to two. It makes no difference"".

NHS trust fined for failures over baby boy's death,"The NHS trust admitted failing Sarah Richford and baby Harry An NHS trust has been fined Â£733,000 for failures in the case of a baby boy who died seven days after an emergency hospital delivery. East Kent Hospitals had admitted failing to provide safe care and treatment for mother Sarah Richford and her son, Harry, in Margate in 2017. The case followed an inquest that found Harry's death was ""wholly avoidable"". The total Â£1.1m fine was reduced to Â£733,000 due to the guilty plea. The trust apologised to the family. The trust was also told to pay legal costs of Â£28,000, following the Care Quality Commission (CQC) prosecution. At Folkestone Magistrates' Court, district judge Justin Barron told Mrs Richford and her husband Tom: ""The trust fell far short of the appropriate standards of care and treatment in dealing with you."" He said the failures led to ""the greatest harm imaginable"". He added the trust was ""very much under the spotlight"" and it was important it took action to restore confidence in its standard of care. Outside court, the Richfords said they had ""needed to shine a light on the failings"" In court, Philip Cave, finance director for the trust and a member of the board, acknowledged a series of failures at East Kent Hospitals and apologised to Mr and Mrs Richford. He said: ""I wish to emphasise that the trust does have insight into the failures that led to baby Harry's death and the psychological injury caused to Mrs Richford."" In April, lawyers for the trust admitted one count of failing to provide safe care and treatment, resulting in avoidable harm to Harry and Sarah Richford. In a statement following the sentencing, the Richford family said: ""Having our lives thrown into the public eye is not what anybody wants to do but sadly this was needed to shine a light on the failings which led to Harry's death in 2017."" The hospital failings that led to baby deaths Scale of hospital baby deaths 'not clear-cut' Baby death parentsâ agony over hospital errors More preventable baby deaths at hospital trust The family said while they welcomed the sanction, they were unsure if the system was suitable for public-funded organisations. They said: ""Taking money away from a financially-challenged resource does seem counterintuitive and we would encourage policymakers to consider any alternative options."" The family also vowed to support future investigations into maternity safety to ensure ""long-lasting change"". The case led to an independent review into maternity services at the trust By Mark Norman Health correspondent, BBC South East In every conversation I have had with the Richford family in the past two years they have spoken about three things. Their concern was initially about finding the truth - until they realised Harry's death might have been avoided if the trust had learned from previous incidents. Then, increasingly, the family sought systemic change in the East Kent maternity department so no-one else would experience what they had gone through. For the trust, which successfully cares for hundreds of thousands of patients every year, the Richford case is about reputational damage, and it still isn't over. Dr Bill Kirkup's investigation into almost 200 births at the trust is not due to report until late in 2022. Part of his remit will be to reveal whether or not he believes East Kent Hospitals NHS has learned from this case and potentially hundreds more like it. East Kent Hospitals Trust is being investigated over a number of maternity deaths The inquest last year into baby Harry's death prompted a review after it emerged the trustmay have had up to 15 preventable baby deaths. During the inquest, more than a dozen areas of concern were highlighted over the care of Harry and his mother, including failings in the way an ""inexperienced"" doctor carried out the delivery, followed by delays in resuscitation. Coroner Christopher Sutton-Mattocks was told Harry was born not crying, pale, and with no movement in an operating room ""full of panicking people"" at the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital (QEQM). He found Harry's death wascontributed to by neglect. When Harry was less than nine hours old he was transferred to a neo-natal intensive care unit in Ashford where he survived for a week with the aid of life support, the inquest heard. Mrs Richford told the BBC she and her husband were unable to hold him ""until the day that he died"". Harry Richford died a week after he was born at Margate's Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital in 2017 After the sentencing, Nigel Acheson, the CQC's deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said: ""The trust's acceptance of responsibility for the errors in Harry and Sarah's care is welcome, but the fact remains that the series of events which led up to Harry's death could and should have been avoided."" He said: ""In most cases pregnancy and birth are a positive and safe experience for women and their families. But the death or injury of even one new baby or mother is one too many."" Speaking outside court, Niall Dickson, chairman of the trust, said: ""Harry's parents expected that they would return home with a healthy baby and we failed them.

As it happened: Welsh government lockdown updateDetails and reaction as First Minister Mark Drakeford explains why major changes are being delayed.Wales,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh government update on coronavirus Wales is at the start of a third wave of the pandemic, he says Substantial easing of lockdown rules is on hold for four weeks due to concern about the Delta variant The 30-guest limit for wedding receptions and wakes is being lifted with numbers to depend on how many the venue can safely accommodate Vaccinations will not be made compulsory for care workers in Wales, the first minister has confirmed Disruption to surgery due to the pandemic will continue to affect millions of patients for many years, researchers say John Arkless and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us today for our live coverage of the latest Welsh government coronavirus briefing. Here's a recap of what First Minister Mark Drakeford told us:  You can keep up to date with the latest developments via the BBC News website and social media channels. Have a good weekend, and stay safe.  Swimmers in Aberystwyth will be able tobook a dip at a university poolwhile a leisure centre remains out of bounds after being turned into a Covid field hospital. Ceredigion council said slots will be made available from 28 June at Aberystwyth University while Plascrug Leisure Centre remains closed. The council said work to decommission the field hospital at Plascrug was ""far more than initially anticipated"". Most pools and leisure centres in Wales reopened on 3 May. Last month, there were complaintschildren were ""missing out""due to the continued closure of the leisure centre. The council said it was ""extremely grateful"" to the university and was committed to reopening the public pool as soon as possible. Covid-19
hasnow dropped to becoming the 31st highest cause of death in Wales, latest
mortality analysis shows. For
six of the previous 14 months, Covid-19 was the biggest cause of death in
Wales. There
were 15 deaths due to Covid in May - 0.6% of all deaths, Office for National
Statistics (ONS) figures showed. The
monthly Covid mortality rate of 5.2 deaths per 100,000 was the lowest since the
pandemic began. Covid was the 18th highest cause of death in Wales in April. Plaid Cymru said the pause of easing lockdown restrictions in Wales âmakes senseâ, but called for greater support for those directly affected. Sian Gwenllian, the partyâs deputy leader in the Senedd,
said: âWe donât know how much pressure this will put on our hospitals, so
keeping the status quo for a further four weeks does make complete sense, as
does the focus on vaccination to maximise protection. âBut I do think we need clarity from Welsh government on
support measures - for businesses, for those needing to self-isolate, and for
the track-and-trace work of local authorities.â The hospitality sector in particular needed additional
support, Ms Gwenllian said. The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system, said it was right to remain ""cautious"" at a ""critical juncture"" of the pandemic. Its director, Darren Hughes, said: âWhilst the number of Covid patients in hospitals remains low, the NHS is experiencing incredibly high levels of demand across the service, particularly in emergency care and GP practices. ""Delivery of the vaccination programme in Wales has been phenomenal and couldnât have been done without the hard work and commitment of staff, as well as the willingness of the Welsh public to protect themselves, their loved ones and their communities. âThe rise in cases of the Delta variant in Wales means itâs more important than ever that we vaccinate as many people as possible so we can maximise the protection this offers.""  The Conservatives have called on the first minister to give more
clarity on when lockdown restrictions would be eased further. James Evans, the Welsh Tory spokesman for mental health and
wellbeing, said: âWe do have to be cautious with the Delta variant spreading
across Wales and the UK. ""However I would like some light at the end of
the tunnel from the first minister. âIf you look at the data hospitalisations are 95% lower than
their previous peak, deaths are 99% lower then their previous peak. ""Eighty percent have antibodies, 96% of those of the over-65s and in the vulnerable groups have
antibodies, and I think in Wales we do need to have some idea of freedom day. ""The vaccine programme is working - we just need a bit of light at the end of the
tunnel.â First Minister Mark Drakeford says it's a âprofessional obligationâ for anyone who works in the care or health sector to get vaccinated, but he was ânot persuadedâ to make it compulsory. He was responding to a question about whether he would introduce compulsory measures, following an announcement in England that Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes. Mr Drakeford said while the Welsh government encouraged vaccination in the sector, he was ânot persuaded by shifting to compulsionâ. âOur conclusion has been that if we can make the progress we need to make by persuasion, by conversation, by giving people the evidence that we think is there to prove that vaccination is safe and effective, that that is a preferable way of doing itâ, he said. Wales' vaccination programme will ""switch into a new emphasis on double doses"" over the next four weeks, First Minister Mark Drakeford says. He said the focus would be on people in their 50s and 60s, as full vaccination rates for people even older was now high. Mr Drakeford said health boards would be targeting parts of their areas where there were infection hotspots. The other ""big task"", he said, was to get better information on the extent to which vaccination prevents hospitalisation. ""The detail on that is not sufficiently strong for us to be able to plan confidently for what the health service may have to deal with, and the extent to which we might still be able to lift restrictions, beyond the next four weeks,"" the first minister said. ""We'll be gathering data from England and Scotland on that because they are further down this course of time than than we are."" Wales has seen a ""sustained, week-on-week increase"" in the rate of Covid-19 across the country due to the Delta variant, according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said cases had been increasing since the end of May, with a ""particularly sharp rise"" in those involving people aged under 25. He noted the incidence rate was less than 10 cases per 100,000 people in Wales two weeks ago but was now 23.6 cases per 100,000 people, with the positivity rate more than doubling to 2.4%. Two weeks ago, there were 97 confirmed cases in Wales and most of those were linked to clusters in the north and the south-east of Wales, Mr Drakeford said. ""Yesterday, that figure had risen to just under 490 reported cases and that number will be higher again today."" Asked whether it was possible another lockdown would be imposed in in the future, the first minister said Wales is ""nowhere near"" needing to reverse any rule changes. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh government was ""pausing"" the relaxation of restrictions ""because we don't want to add fresh risk in to what has become a more risky context"". However, he added: ""Things are different this time to the way they were back in March of last year and over the Christmas and new year period, primarily because of vaccination. ""Now, what we're not clear about is the full extent to which vaccination has altered the link between falling ill with coronavirus and needing hospital treatment. ""The more people we can vaccinate, the stronger the defence will be - and the more certain we will become that we don't need to put anything in reverse and indeed will be able to move even further forward."" The Welsh government is looking at whether rules on face
masks in schools could be relaxed. The current
rule in Wales is that face coverings should be worn in all areas, including the
classroom, by everyone except children in primary school. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: âThere will be no
immediate change, but we will work with schools, local authorities and teaching
unions to find ways for the future that they do not need to be worn in every
classroom, every day.â First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed changes to coronavirus restrictions on wedding receptions. He said: ""From Monday, the size of the venue and a risk assessment will determine how many people can attend an indoor wedding or civil partnership reception or wake."" The maximum number permitted at present is 30. Mr Drakeford added that residential outdoor education centres will start to reopen, starting with primary school age children, while regulations will be amended to ""bring grassroots music and comedy venues into line with the rules for hospitality"". Pilot events will also continue to run through June and July, while a statement will also be published about the use of face coverings in schools. This video can not be played Covid weddings: Bride-to-be asks 'how is this fair?' over rules One bride-to-be has questioned whether current wedding rules in Wales are fair, limiting the number of guests for an indoor receptions to 30. From Monday, the number of people able to attend wedding receptions will be determined by the size of the venue. A third wave of the Covid pandemic is already under way, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. It leaves Wales facing a ""serious public health situation,"" he added. Although case numbers in Wales are lower per head of population than in England and Scotland, Mr Drakeford said Wales was likely to be âtwo or three weeks behindâ in terms of rising case numbers. âOur scientific advisers believe the UK is now in the pre-peak stage of a third wave of the pandemic,â he told Friday's Covid briefing. âIn the last week, the First Minister of Scotland and the Prime Minister have both paused their plans to relax coronavirus restrictions because of concern about the Delta variant. âAnd today, I have to announce, we will be doing the same here in Wales.â Covid vaccines for care workerswill not be compulsory in Wales, the first minister has confirmed. Mark Drakeford said he preferred an approach of convincing care home workers by ""argument and persuasion"". One care home manager in Llandrindod Wells, Powys, said being willing to be vaccinated was a condition of her staff's employment. In England, care workers face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially lose their job if they refuse to have the jab. First Minister Mark Drakeford is about to give a Welsh government update on the pandemic. We'll post the highlights here - you can also watch it live on BBC One Wales, theBBC iPlayer, onS4C, and via the Coronavirus Update video link at the top of this page.  Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies has welcomed the move to ease restrictions on weddings, saying it will provide ""welcome relief to couples planning their big day"". However, with other restrictions set to continue for another four weeks, he called for more financial support for businesses and criticised the manner of the announcement. ""Given the continued impact on livelihoods, such
announcements shouldnât bypass the Senedd,"" Mr Davies said. ""Earlier this week, the Commons
speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, summoned ministers to Parliament so the lockdown
announcement [for England]  could be scrutinised - and he was right to do so. âFor the Senedd to do its job effectively and be relevant, these
announcements should be scrutinised in a timely fashion, not days after
implementation.â There have not been any new deaths with coronavirus reported in the latest Public Health Wales (PHW) figures. The number of new cases reported on Friday is 163. The overall case rate in Wales - that's the number of cases per 100,000 people over the most recent seven-day period - has risen again to 23.6.

Castle Street, which was one of the most polluted roads in Wales, closed to private cars last year during the first lockdown and was turned into an outdoor dining area last summer. Air pollution has been at the centre of the argument, with the Welsh government expressing disappointment at the decision. Cardiff Council leader Huw Thomas, said closing the road had moved pollution to other parts of the city. One of the few changes to Covid rules in Wales being announced today isthe lifting of the 30-person limit on guests at wedding receptions, with attendance decided on venue size instead. First Minister Mark Drakeford said if venues ""can safely accommodate over 100 people, that's what they'll do"". The changes also apply to wakes and will come into force from Monday. Â© 2025 BBC.

Ministers 'deeply ashamed' of rape conviction rates,"This video can not be played Robert Buckland says ""sorry.. we have to do a lot better"" for victims of sexual offences Ministers have said they feel ""deeply ashamed"" of low conviction rates for rape cases in England and Wales. Speaking to the BBC, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland apologised to victims and promised to ""do a lot better"". He also admitted budget cuts were partly to blame for convictions falling to a record low in recent years. The government says it is now considering allowing victims to pre-record their evidence to spare them the trauma of a courtroom trial. Its review also outlined plans,externalto focus more on the suspect's behaviour - not the accuser's, and make sure phones taken away for evidence-gathering were returned within a day. The review was met with mixed responses, with one rape charity saying it was a missed opportunity and failed to identify any big commitments that would radically and swiftly improve rape victims' experience. Labour said the government had ""failed victims of rape on every front"" and its recommendations did not go far enough. Laura Kuenssberg: Apology to rape victims matters, but actions count Why are rape prosecutions falling? Calls for rape victims to pre-record evidence Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Buckland said the report revealed ""at all stages of the criminal justice process frankly a failure to deal with complaints made by many thousands of victims"". ""The first thing I think I need to say is, sorry - it's not good enough."" In a foreword to the review, Mr Buckland, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Attorney General Michael Ellis, said: ""The vast majority of victims do not see the crime against them charged and reach a court - one in two victims withdraw from rape investigations. ""These are trends of which we are deeply ashamed,"" they wrote. ""Victims of rape are being failed."" They went on to say that most rapes were carried out by people known to the victim, making investigations very personal and intrusive for the victim. The trauma and their experience afterwards led many to disengage from the criminal justice process, they said. ""We are not prepared to accept that rape is just 'too difficult' a crime to prosecute. We can, and must, do better,"" they added. This video can not be played Katherine: ""I feel really sad that it's taken this for them to listen"" Katherine Araniello says she felt she wanted to take her own life after her rape case was dropped ""practically on the eve of the trial"" by the Crown Prosecution Service. She says she was given an explanation as to why her case was dropped but it was only ""very vague"". ""They didn't call me in to iron out any issues they might have at their end."" She says she felt like ""it was my character"" the Crown Prosecution Service were judging, not that of the alleged perpetrator, and her treatment by the CPS ""really stung, and it still stings to this day"". ""That lack of acknowledgment from the CPS on how to treat victims, highly traumatised victims as well, has left me really angry with the system,"" she says. ""They haven't learned their lessons."" Each year there are about 128,000 victims of rape and attempted rape but fewer than 20% of them report the crime to the police, according to the report. And just 1.6% of rapes result in someone being charged. Emily Hunt, an independent adviser to the review and herself a rape victim, said the low prosecution rate was not because people made false allegations. She cited Home Office research showing up to 3% of rape allegations could be false, which meant 97% of them were not. ""The reality is, in almost all cases, if someone says they've been raped, they have not made it up which makes the current situation all the more shocking and unacceptable,"" she said in the report. Plans set out in the report include: Introducing better data extraction technology to reduce the time that victims are without their phones - with an aim to have them returned by police within 24 hours. Currently this process can take months causing distress for victims left phoneless at a time when they most need support from friends and family Putting greater emphasis on understanding a suspect's behaviour rather than focusing on a victim's credibility Sparing victims the trauma of attending a courtroom trial by videoing their cross-examination earlier in the process and away from the courtroom. A pilot will be trialled in several courts, with a wider rollout considered. This measure is already used for children and vulnerable victims and witnesses The report - commissioned in March 2019 - also said the volume of cases going to court should return to ""at least 2016 levels"" and that regular ""scorecards"" would be published to monitor progress. The Law Commission will also begin a review into ""rape myths"" and examine the use of a victims' sexual history as evidence. There are many possible factors behind the fall in prosecutions. The report argued it was due to ""a strained relationship"" between different parts of the system, lack of support for the victims and ""an increase in invasive requests for their personal data"". Asked in his BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Robert Buckland replied: ""Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case."" He said the government was now ""seeking to make the necessary investment"" but also insisted ""it's about more than just money, it's about culture."" He argued that ""for too long"" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence. ""If your house is burgled people don't start asking 'why did you go out?'â¦ all those assumptions I'm afraid are far too often not applied when it comes to sexual offences,"" he said. In rape investigations, there has also been an increase in the amount of evidence to consider, often from phones and social media, making them more difficult for police, prosecutors and, potentially, victims. Victims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird has said,externalsome victims withdraw their complaints because ""they cannot face the unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into their privacy"". There have also been suggestions a secret conviction rate target, set by the CPS, led to prosecutors dropping weaker or more challenging cases. In November 2019, it was revealed the CPS had introduced a target in 2016 that 60% of rape cases should end in a conviction. The victims' commissioner welcomed the review's proposals but said the government ""has a mountain to climb if it is to restore victims' confidence"". Dame Vera said it was ""disheartening"" that the pre-recording of video evidence was not being introduced more widely. Labour's shadow solicitor general Ellie Reeves said the government's review had missed a ""real opportunity"" to improve the justice system, and accused the government of failing victims of rape ""on every front âby pushing the justice system to the brink of collapse through a decade of cuts to police, courts and the CPS"". She said ""piecemeal pilots"" and ""âtinkering"" would not be enough to fix the failures. Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the current system was ""in disarray"". She said it was welcome the government had admitted women have been failed, but women's groups felt ""frustration and disappointment"" over how long the measures in the review would take to be rolled out. ""Waiting a further two years to see some of these recommendations come to fruition is too long,"" she added. Amelia Handy, policy lead for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said the review was ""a missed opportunity"". ""While there are individual elements of the government's report that are encouraging, it's hard to identify any big commitments that will radically and swiftly improve the experience of the justice system for victims and survivors,"" she said. She called for ""independent research into who does and doesn't report sexual offences to the police"" and an urgent review into governance of the Crown Prosecution Service. Sumanta Roy from Imkaan - an organisation tackling violence against women from ethnic minorities - called for ring-fenced funding ""to address the historical under-funding of specialist independent support services for black, minoritised women"".

Beckett drops out of Unite leadership contestThe union's assistant general secretary backs fellow left-winger in the race to succeed Len McCluskey.,"Howard Beckett is backing Steve Turner in the contest Howard Beckett - one of the candidates in the Unite union race to succeed Len McCluskey as general secretary - has pulled out of the contest. Mr Beckett - the union's assistant general secretary - says he will support fellow left-wing candidate Steve Turner. His decision means there are now three remaining candidates - Mr Turner, Sharon Graham and Gerard Coyne. Voting starts next month, with the result to be announced in August. In a joint statement, Mr Beckett and Mr Turner say they will work to implement a ""blended manifesto"", taking ideas from both of their campaigns. Three-way battle to be left's Unite candidate Row over leaked Unite emails about Labour MPs ""Our programme recognises the central importance of organising and leverage to winning for members in struggle and building the union. We will also put greater resources into ensuring a bigger role for women and black members in the union and greater support in the workplace,"" they say. The statement also suggests that Ms Graham would be an important member of Mr Turner's team too, were he to win. Gerard Coyne was narrowly defeated for the top post of general secretary by Mr McCluskey in 2017, and he is seen as the candidate closest to the Labour leadership under Sir Keir Starmer. Efforts had been under way to agree a single candidate from the left to take him on in the contest. The Labour leadership will be relieved that Howard Beckett is out of the running. But Mr Beckett was also under huge pressure to step aside from many on the Left - not least Len McCluskey. The outgoing Unite boss hosted a series of ""behind-closed-doors"" negotiations with the three Left candidates - Steve Turner, Sharon Graham and Mr Beckett. He believed a ""split vote"" on the Left would give his former opponent for the top Unite post, Gerard Coyne, a much better chance of victory. Read Iain's full analysis In a statement, Mr Coyne said Mr Beckett's decision to pull out of the race and endorse Steve Turner is an attempt to prevent cultural change at Unite. He said he was ""happy to be the mainstream candidate"". He added: ""I am the only candidate who would change the culture of the union, make its financial affairs transparent, improve its internal democracy and end the ill-judged attempts to drive the Labour Party from the back seat. ""Previously, I was up against three full time officers of Unite who represented continuity and were opposed to change. Now their number is reduced to two. It makes no difference"".

Here's a summary of what's gone on during the day: As England opens up first doses of vaccines to everyone aged 18 and older, over-40s and people with underlying health conditions are being contacted to bring their second doses forward. The initial advice across the whole of the UK was to offer jabs 12 weeks apart in order to give as many people as possible a first dose. Now those who haven't yet had their second dose in some priority groups can have it after eight weeks. You can rearrange an appointment yourself, but you must first cancel your original bookingonline,external, or by calling 119.

InNorthern Ireland,the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks,externalfor appointments scheduled after 14 June. InWales, the government saysvaccination clinics ""are accelerating second doses"",external, and that people will be contacted by their local health board in due course. Here's everything you need to know about going for your jabs. Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer to add his new musical Cinderella to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events. The PM said earlier this week he was in talks with the theatre impresario about including the show in the scheme. But Lord Lloyd Webber says the theatre industry has been treated as ""an afterthought and undervalued"" and he would only take part in the scheme if others in the trade were treated equally. On Monday, the government confirmed it would not lift all Covid restrictions until at least 19 July - delayed from the proposed date of 21 June. Last week, Lord Lloyd Webber said he was determined to open his show to a full house on 25 June, even if he risked being arrested. However, after rejecting the option to be one of the official pilot events, he has rowed back on his threat to go to jail and confirmed the show will go ahead with a 50% capacity, the current legal limit.

The total infections have crossed the five million mark and at least seven African countries have run out of vaccines. Africa remains an area of concern, even though it accounts for only about 5% of new global infections and 2% of deaths, WHO officials say. New cases in Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Rwanda have
doubled in the past week, WHO emergencies programme head Mike
Ryan is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. ""It's a trajectory that is very, very concerning,"" he has told reporters at the organisation's headquarters in Geneva. ""The brutal reality is that in an era of multiple
variants, with increased transmissibility, we have left vast
swathes of the population, the vulnerable population of Africa,
unprotected by vaccines."" South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Egypt have recorded the most virus cases in the continent. Uganda and Namibia are experiencing a deadly third wave, with dozens of fatalities recorded daily. A total of 136,030 people have succumbed to the virus in different African countries, according to the WHO. The Delta variant is in 14 African countries while the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa, is in 25 countries. The WHO says there's no clear timeline on when more vaccines will be available, but there is an urgent need for them.

Wembley hosted 22,500 fans - 25% of its capacity - for England's Group D fixture against Croatia Uefa says it is ""confident"" the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 will be held at Wembley as planned - but has a contingency plan amid concerns around England's coronavirus restrictions. The Times reported the games could be moved from London to Budapest if VIPs are not given an exemption to England's strict quarantine rules. The UK government has postponed lifting all restrictions until 19 July - the final of the tournament is due to take place on 11 July. Most countries in Euro 2020 are on the UK government's amber or red list. Wembley's capacity is reduced to 22,500 for group fixtures at Euro 2020, but that is set to be expanded to 45,000 - about 50% of full capacity - for games in the knockout stages. The matches are being treated as fan pilot events and so are exempt from strict capacity limits. Read more on this storyhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Cases are rising in every
region and nation of the UK. The numbers of people going into hospital are rising in Scotland and every region of England. The epidemic is without a
doubt growing, and so we should expect to see ever higher numbers of cases and
people going into hospital for a while. But the case numbers are not
growing as quickly as they have been in recent weeks. Todayâs figure of just over
10,000 is nearly 30% higher than last Fridayâs which was, in turn about 30%
higher than the week before. But the two weeks before that
saw numbers rising by nearly 50% each week. Slower rises are still rises,
and weâll have to wait and see how this plays through into hospitalisations. But any potential slowdown is
a hopeful sign â before reversing, you need to hit the brakes. BBC Newsbeat Like many others, Enter Shikari frontman Rou Reynolds says the past 18 months have been strange. Last year, Covid-19 wiped out the UK's summer festival season, and this yearonly a handful are still taking place. This weekend, the band will be back on stage at Download Festival in Donnington Park, Leicestershire. ""Can you believe it? We've been spending the last three weeks trying to work out how to be a live band again,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I remember saying halfway through the pandemic, it sort of feels like we're experiencing what the death of a band would be like, by just not being able to play."" Read the full storyhere. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The recent surge in Covid numbers in Russia may be an example
of how careless talk costs lives. For months, Russians had been told by officials and
Kremlin-controlled media how successful their country had been at battling the
coronavirus, while the West was described as failing miserably. People in Europe, for instance, were said to be confused and
angry because of endless lockdowns. There were reports on Russian TV of
violence, rioting and vaccine shortages in the West. Time and again, Russian TV
described Western vaccines as part of the problem, and claimed that they were
causing more deaths. No evidence was offered to back up these claims. Meanwhile in Russia, state TV would say, things were getting
better: restrictions were being lifted, shopping centres and museums were
reopening, students were going back to universities, and vaccination was proceeding apace. Only little mention was made of how many Russians exactly had
been vaccinated, or how many had died because of the virus - it had been all
but defeated, supposedly. Now the rhetoric has changed. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry
Peskov on Friday blamed a record number of daily Covid infections in the capital, Moscow, on
""nihilism"", and state TV is alarmed and broadcasting pro-vaccination
appeals. But given the past behaviour by both officials and the
media, it should perhaps come as no surprise if many in Russia are complacent
and distrustful of vaccines.  Nearly 470,000 UK
adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine yesterday. The latest government
data shows 243,978 first doses were given, taking the total
number of people to have received their initial jab to 42,460,632. A total of 223,260 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 30,898,467, or 58.7% of adults, have now had both jabs. There have been a
further 10,476 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another 11 deaths
within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were
8,125 cases and 17 deaths reported. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier,Israel has said it is to send at least a million doses of Covid vaccine to the Palestinian Authorityin return for receiving a similar amount back later in the year. The deal means Israel will not waste doses that are about to expire, while the Palestinians can accelerate their vaccination programme. This appears to be a win-win arrangement for Israelis and Palestinians. The first batches have already been received by the Palestinian health ministry. It says they will be used in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and that vaccination centres will now open seven days a week with extended hours. Israel, which has led the world with its rapid rollout of Covid vaccines, has faced criticism for not doing more to ensure Palestinians have access. It denies having responsibility under international law - but Israeli health officials say thereâs a benefit to helping Palestinians get immunised because of mixing of the populations. Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury has said vaccines will be compulsory for its staff returning to the office when it reopens. Many firms are having to weigh up the necessity of workforce vaccinations. The government has announced care home workers in England will be required to have a vaccination or risk losing their jobs. Bloomsbury toldThe Bookseller,externalmagazine, which first reported the company's decision, that it had taken both ""medical and scientific advice"". ""The simple fact is that this virus is still extremely dangerous."" The publisher is due to reopen on 19 July and made employees aware of the policy in an email ahead of the second May Bank Holiday weekend. Read more on this storyhere. Katie PrescottToday business presenter Some passengers due to set sail with cruise company MSC are having their trips cancelled because the delay to easing Covid restrictions means the ships have been overbooked. Cruise ships are allowed to hold up to 1,000 guests under the current guidelines. But MSC oversold tickets for cruises after 21 June, saying it ""had fully expected that most restrictions would be removed"". Customers who had their trips cancelled yesterday are complaining on social media about the lack of information and about being out of pocket for things such as parking, travel to the ports and hotels. One woman told me she paid Â£1,4000 for her elderly mother to go into respite care for the week. Andy Hunt from Essex was due to set sail from Southampton. He says: ""Now they've had my money, we had the suitcases out of the garage, got the week booked off, my wife has the week booked off, the dogs are booked into kennels. I'm really, really frustrated it could have been handled so much better."" MSC says the first 1,000 passengers who booked get priority boarding and those left will be able to rebook or get a refund.

Italy hasbrought in a five-day quarantine requirementalong with a mandatory Covid test for all arrivals from the UK, amid growing concerns about the spread of the Delta variant. Italy is on the amber list for UK travel and had, until today, not required quarantine on arrival as long as visitors presented anegative Covid test result,externaltaken in the previous 48 hours. Italy reported 37 coronavirus-related deaths yesterday against 52 on Wednesday, while the daily number of new infections fell to 1,325 from 1,400, the health ministry says. In contrast, the UK reported 11,007 new cases yesterday. Euro 2020 sees Wales due to play Italy in Rome on Sundayso some fans from the UK may already be in the country. For others who have bought tickets quarantining on arrival could mean they'd miss the match. The travel rules and no official fan zones mean most of the ""Red Wall"" willfollow Euro 2020at home or in the pub.Meet the Wales fans who will be swapping the stadium for the sofa this year. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Rates of coronavirus infection in England are highest in the North West, the Office for National Statistics estimates. About 0.55% of people are testing positive there, with the next closest Yorkshire & the Humber at 0.25%. No other English region has rates above 0.2%. There are possible signs of a decrease in the percentage of children testing positive in school years 7 to 11. The highest rates are in the group between school year 12 (16-year-olds) and those aged 24, which sees 0.5% testing positive, and among 25 to 34-year-olds - at 0.4%. About 0.2% of younger children would test positive and about 0.1% of older adults would test positive, the ONS says. This video can not be played Smaller cities around the US are offering incentives, sometimes up to $15,000 (Â£10,800), for young talent to move there. And with remote work on the rise during the pandemic, people are freer to relocate. Nearly one in four Americans is expected to be a fully remote worker in a few years. Vaccinating children is routine and widely accepted - measles, mumps, polio, diphtheria, rotavirus, multiple strains of meningitis, whooping coughâ¦ the list goes on. All this starts from just a few weeks old. So, what about Covid-19? Some countries are cracking on. The US is immunising children between 12 and 15. It expects to have enough safety data to go even younger next year. But in the UK -the BBC has been told- a decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-olds is unlikely to be recommended by UK experts any time soon. There is a scientific question - will vaccinating children save lives? - which is complex as the answer may vary from country to country. There is also a moral and ethical dimension if doses destined for children would save more lives if they were given to health workers and vulnerable adults in other countries.

Here's a summary of what's gone on during the day: As England opens up first doses of vaccines to everyone aged 18 and older, over-40s and people with underlying health conditions are being contacted to bring their second doses forward. The initial advice across the whole of the UK was to offer jabs 12 weeks apart in order to give as many people as possible a first dose. Now those who haven't yet had their second dose in some priority groups can have it after eight weeks. You can rearrange an appointment yourself, but you must first cancel your original bookingonline,external, or by calling 119.

InWales, the government saysvaccination clinics ""are accelerating second doses"",external, and that people will be contacted by their local health board in due course. Here's everything you need to know about going for your jabs. Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer to add his new musical Cinderella to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events. The PM said earlier this week he was in talks with the theatre impresario about including the show in the scheme. But Lord Lloyd Webber says the theatre industry has been treated as ""an afterthought and undervalued"" and he would only take part in the scheme if others in the trade were treated equally. On Monday, the government confirmed it would not lift all Covid restrictions until at least 19 July - delayed from the proposed date of 21 June. Last week, Lord Lloyd Webber said he was determined to open his show to a full house on 25 June, even if he risked being arrested. However, after rejecting the option to be one of the official pilot events, he has rowed back on his threat to go to jail and confirmed the show will go ahead with a 50% capacity, the current legal limit.

The total infections have crossed the five million mark and at least seven African countries have run out of vaccines. Africa remains an area of concern, even though it accounts for only about 5% of new global infections and 2% of deaths, WHO officials say. New cases in Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Rwanda have
doubled in the past week, WHO emergencies programme head Mike
Ryan is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. ""It's a trajectory that is very, very concerning,"" he has told reporters at the organisation's headquarters in Geneva. ""The brutal reality is that in an era of multiple
variants, with increased transmissibility, we have left vast
swathes of the population, the vulnerable population of Africa,
unprotected by vaccines."" South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Egypt have recorded the most virus cases in the continent. Uganda and Namibia are experiencing a deadly third wave, with dozens of fatalities recorded daily. A total of 136,030 people have succumbed to the virus in different African countries, according to the WHO. The Delta variant is in 14 African countries while the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa, is in 25 countries. The WHO says there's no clear timeline on when more vaccines will be available, but there is an urgent need for them. UK music fans are sitting on hundreds of thousands of tickets for postponed concerts rather than returning them. The latest four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions has pushed an additional 5,000 gigs into doubt.

LiveLiveWelsh government lockdown update2 minutes ago,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh government update on coronavirus Wales is at the start of a third wave of the pandemic, he says Substantial easing of lockdown rules is on hold for four weeks due to concern about the Delta variant The 30-guest limit for wedding receptions and wakes is being lifted with numbers to depend on how many the venue can safely accommodate Vaccinations will not be made compulsory for care workers in Wales, the first minister has confirmed Disruption to surgery due to the pandemic will continue to affect millions of patients for many years, researchers say John Arkless and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us today for our live coverage of the latest Welsh government coronavirus briefing. Here's a recap of what First Minister Mark Drakeford told us:  You can keep up to date with the latest developments via the BBC News website and social media channels. Have a good weekend, and stay safe.  Swimmers in Aberystwyth will be able tobook a dip at a university poolwhile a leisure centre remains out of bounds after being turned into a Covid field hospital. Ceredigion council said slots will be made available from 28 June at Aberystwyth University while Plascrug Leisure Centre remains closed. The council said work to decommission the field hospital at Plascrug was ""far more than initially anticipated"". Most pools and leisure centres in Wales reopened on 3 May. Last month, there were complaintschildren were ""missing out""due to the continued closure of the leisure centre. The council said it was ""extremely grateful"" to the university and was committed to reopening the public pool as soon as possible. Covid-19
hasnow dropped to becoming the 31st highest cause of death in Wales, latest
mortality analysis shows. For
six of the previous 14 months, Covid-19 was the biggest cause of death in
Wales. There
were 15 deaths due to Covid in May - 0.6% of all deaths, Office for National
Statistics (ONS) figures showed. The
monthly Covid mortality rate of 5.2 deaths per 100,000 was the lowest since the
pandemic began. Covid was the 18th highest cause of death in Wales in April. Plaid Cymru said the pause of easing lockdown restrictions in Wales âmakes senseâ, but called for greater support for those directly affected. Sian Gwenllian, the partyâs deputy leader in the Senedd,
said: âWe donât know how much pressure this will put on our hospitals, so
keeping the status quo for a further four weeks does make complete sense, as
does the focus on vaccination to maximise protection. âBut I do think we need clarity from Welsh government on
support measures - for businesses, for those needing to self-isolate, and for
the track-and-trace work of local authorities.â The hospitality sector in particular needed additional
support, Ms Gwenllian said. The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system, said it was right to remain ""cautious"" at a ""critical juncture"" of the pandemic. Its director, Darren Hughes, said: âWhilst the number of Covid patients in hospitals remains low, the NHS is experiencing incredibly high levels of demand across the service, particularly in emergency care and GP practices. ""Delivery of the vaccination programme in Wales has been phenomenal and couldnât have been done without the hard work and commitment of staff, as well as the willingness of the Welsh public to protect themselves, their loved ones and their communities. âThe rise in cases of the Delta variant in Wales means itâs more important than ever that we vaccinate as many people as possible so we can maximise the protection this offers.""  The Conservatives have called on the first minister to give more
clarity on when lockdown restrictions would be eased further. James Evans, the Welsh Tory spokesman for mental health and
wellbeing, said: âWe do have to be cautious with the Delta variant spreading
across Wales and the UK. ""However I would like some light at the end of
the tunnel from the first minister. âIf you look at the data hospitalisations are 95% lower than
their previous peak, deaths are 99% lower then their previous peak. ""Eighty percent have antibodies, 96% of those of the over-65s and in the vulnerable groups have
antibodies, and I think in Wales we do need to have some idea of freedom day. ""The vaccine programme is working - we just need a bit of light at the end of the
tunnel.â First Minister Mark Drakeford says it's a âprofessional obligationâ for anyone who works in the care or health sector to get vaccinated, but he was ânot persuadedâ to make it compulsory. He was responding to a question about whether he would introduce compulsory measures, following an announcement in England that Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes. Mr Drakeford said while the Welsh government encouraged vaccination in the sector, he was ânot persuaded by shifting to compulsionâ. âOur conclusion has been that if we can make the progress we need to make by persuasion, by conversation, by giving people the evidence that we think is there to prove that vaccination is safe and effective, that that is a preferable way of doing itâ, he said. Wales' vaccination programme will ""switch into a new emphasis on double doses"" over the next four weeks, First Minister Mark Drakeford says. He said the focus would be on people in their 50s and 60s, as full vaccination rates for people even older was now high. Mr Drakeford said health boards would be targeting parts of their areas where there were infection hotspots. The other ""big task"", he said, was to get better information on the extent to which vaccination prevents hospitalisation. ""The detail on that is not sufficiently strong for us to be able to plan confidently for what the health service may have to deal with, and the extent to which we might still be able to lift restrictions, beyond the next four weeks,"" the first minister said. ""We'll be gathering data from England and Scotland on that because they are further down this course of time than than we are."" Wales has seen a ""sustained, week-on-week increase"" in the rate of Covid-19 across the country due to the Delta variant, according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said cases had been increasing since the end of May, with a ""particularly sharp rise"" in those involving people aged under 25. He noted the incidence rate was less than 10 cases per 100,000 people in Wales two weeks ago but was now 23.6 cases per 100,000 people, with the positivity rate more than doubling to 2.4%. Two weeks ago, there were 97 confirmed cases in Wales and most of those were linked to clusters in the north and the south-east of Wales, Mr Drakeford said. ""Yesterday, that figure had risen to just under 490 reported cases and that number will be higher again today."" Asked whether it was possible another lockdown would be imposed in in the future, the first minister said Wales is ""nowhere near"" needing to reverse any rule changes. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh government was ""pausing"" the relaxation of restrictions ""because we don't want to add fresh risk in to what has become a more risky context"". However, he added: ""Things are different this time to the way they were back in March of last year and over the Christmas and new year period, primarily because of vaccination. ""Now, what we're not clear about is the full extent to which vaccination has altered the link between falling ill with coronavirus and needing hospital treatment. ""The more people we can vaccinate, the stronger the defence will be - and the more certain we will become that we don't need to put anything in reverse and indeed will be able to move even further forward."" The Welsh government is looking at whether rules on face
masks in schools could be relaxed. The current
rule in Wales is that face coverings should be worn in all areas, including the
classroom, by everyone except children in primary school. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: âThere will be no
immediate change, but we will work with schools, local authorities and teaching
unions to find ways for the future that they do not need to be worn in every
classroom, every day.â First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed changes to coronavirus restrictions on wedding receptions. He said: ""From Monday, the size of the venue and a risk assessment will determine how many people can attend an indoor wedding or civil partnership reception or wake."" The maximum number permitted at present is 30. Mr Drakeford added that residential outdoor education centres will start to reopen, starting with primary school age children, while regulations will be amended to ""bring grassroots music and comedy venues into line with the rules for hospitality"". Pilot events will also continue to run through June and July, while a statement will also be published about the use of face coverings in schools.

From Monday, the number of people able to attend wedding receptions will be determined by the size of the venue. A third wave of the Covid pandemic is already under way, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. It leaves Wales facing a ""serious public health situation,"" he added. Although case numbers in Wales are lower per head of population than in England and Scotland, Mr Drakeford said Wales was likely to be âtwo or three weeks behindâ in terms of rising case numbers. âOur scientific advisers believe the UK is now in the pre-peak stage of a third wave of the pandemic,â he told Friday's Covid briefing. âIn the last week, the First Minister of Scotland and the Prime Minister have both paused their plans to relax coronavirus restrictions because of concern about the Delta variant. âAnd today, I have to announce, we will be doing the same here in Wales.â Covid vaccines for care workerswill not be compulsory in Wales, the first minister has confirmed. Mark Drakeford said he preferred an approach of convincing care home workers by ""argument and persuasion"". One care home manager in Llandrindod Wells, Powys, said being willing to be vaccinated was a condition of her staff's employment. In England, care workers face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially lose their job if they refuse to have the jab. First Minister Mark Drakeford is about to give a Welsh government update on the pandemic. We'll post the highlights here - you can also watch it live on BBC One Wales, theBBC iPlayer, onS4C, and via the Coronavirus Update video link at the top of this page.  Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies has welcomed the move to ease restrictions on weddings, saying it will provide ""welcome relief to couples planning their big day"". However, with other restrictions set to continue for another four weeks, he called for more financial support for businesses and criticised the manner of the announcement. ""Given the continued impact on livelihoods, such
announcements shouldnât bypass the Senedd,"" Mr Davies said. ""Earlier this week, the Commons
speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, summoned ministers to Parliament so the lockdown
announcement [for England]  could be scrutinised - and he was right to do so. âFor the Senedd to do its job effectively and be relevant, these
announcements should be scrutinised in a timely fashion, not days after
implementation.â There have not been any new deaths with coronavirus reported in the latest Public Health Wales (PHW) figures. The number of new cases reported on Friday is 163. The overall case rate in Wales - that's the number of cases per 100,000 people over the most recent seven-day period - has risen again to 23.6.

As it happened: Welsh government lockdown updateDetails and reaction as First Minister Mark Drakeford explains why major changes are being delayed.,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh government update on coronavirus Wales is at the start of a third wave of the pandemic, he says Substantial easing of lockdown rules is on hold for four weeks due to concern about the Delta variant The 30-guest limit for wedding receptions and wakes is being lifted with numbers to depend on how many the venue can safely accommodate Vaccinations will not be made compulsory for care workers in Wales, the first minister has confirmed Disruption to surgery due to the pandemic will continue to affect millions of patients for many years, researchers say John Arkless and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us today for our live coverage of the latest Welsh government coronavirus briefing. Here's a recap of what First Minister Mark Drakeford told us:  You can keep up to date with the latest developments via the BBC News website and social media channels. Have a good weekend, and stay safe.  Swimmers in Aberystwyth will be able tobook a dip at a university poolwhile a leisure centre remains out of bounds after being turned into a Covid field hospital. Ceredigion council said slots will be made available from 28 June at Aberystwyth University while Plascrug Leisure Centre remains closed. The council said work to decommission the field hospital at Plascrug was ""far more than initially anticipated"". Most pools and leisure centres in Wales reopened on 3 May. Last month, there were complaintschildren were ""missing out""due to the continued closure of the leisure centre. The council said it was ""extremely grateful"" to the university and was committed to reopening the public pool as soon as possible. Covid-19
hasnow dropped to becoming the 31st highest cause of death in Wales, latest
mortality analysis shows. For
six of the previous 14 months, Covid-19 was the biggest cause of death in
Wales. There
were 15 deaths due to Covid in May - 0.6% of all deaths, Office for National
Statistics (ONS) figures showed. The
monthly Covid mortality rate of 5.2 deaths per 100,000 was the lowest since the
pandemic began. Covid was the 18th highest cause of death in Wales in April. Plaid Cymru said the pause of easing lockdown restrictions in Wales âmakes senseâ, but called for greater support for those directly affected. Sian Gwenllian, the partyâs deputy leader in the Senedd,
said: âWe donât know how much pressure this will put on our hospitals, so
keeping the status quo for a further four weeks does make complete sense, as
does the focus on vaccination to maximise protection. âBut I do think we need clarity from Welsh government on
support measures - for businesses, for those needing to self-isolate, and for
the track-and-trace work of local authorities.â The hospitality sector in particular needed additional
support, Ms Gwenllian said. The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system, said it was right to remain ""cautious"" at a ""critical juncture"" of the pandemic. Its director, Darren Hughes, said: âWhilst the number of Covid patients in hospitals remains low, the NHS is experiencing incredibly high levels of demand across the service, particularly in emergency care and GP practices. ""Delivery of the vaccination programme in Wales has been phenomenal and couldnât have been done without the hard work and commitment of staff, as well as the willingness of the Welsh public to protect themselves, their loved ones and their communities. âThe rise in cases of the Delta variant in Wales means itâs more important than ever that we vaccinate as many people as possible so we can maximise the protection this offers.""  The Conservatives have called on the first minister to give more
clarity on when lockdown restrictions would be eased further. James Evans, the Welsh Tory spokesman for mental health and
wellbeing, said: âWe do have to be cautious with the Delta variant spreading
across Wales and the UK. ""However I would like some light at the end of
the tunnel from the first minister. âIf you look at the data hospitalisations are 95% lower than
their previous peak, deaths are 99% lower then their previous peak. ""Eighty percent have antibodies, 96% of those of the over-65s and in the vulnerable groups have
antibodies, and I think in Wales we do need to have some idea of freedom day. ""The vaccine programme is working - we just need a bit of light at the end of the
tunnel.â First Minister Mark Drakeford says it's a âprofessional obligationâ for anyone who works in the care or health sector to get vaccinated, but he was ânot persuadedâ to make it compulsory. He was responding to a question about whether he would introduce compulsory measures, following an announcement in England that Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes. Mr Drakeford said while the Welsh government encouraged vaccination in the sector, he was ânot persuaded by shifting to compulsionâ. âOur conclusion has been that if we can make the progress we need to make by persuasion, by conversation, by giving people the evidence that we think is there to prove that vaccination is safe and effective, that that is a preferable way of doing itâ, he said. Wales' vaccination programme will ""switch into a new emphasis on double doses"" over the next four weeks, First Minister Mark Drakeford says. He said the focus would be on people in their 50s and 60s, as full vaccination rates for people even older was now high. Mr Drakeford said health boards would be targeting parts of their areas where there were infection hotspots. The other ""big task"", he said, was to get better information on the extent to which vaccination prevents hospitalisation. ""The detail on that is not sufficiently strong for us to be able to plan confidently for what the health service may have to deal with, and the extent to which we might still be able to lift restrictions, beyond the next four weeks,"" the first minister said. ""We'll be gathering data from England and Scotland on that because they are further down this course of time than than we are."" Wales has seen a ""sustained, week-on-week increase"" in the rate of Covid-19 across the country due to the Delta variant, according to the first minister.

What went wrong for 21-day leader?,"Edwin Poots was confirmed as DUP leader in May, after Arlene Foster was ousted Edwin Poots has resigned as DUP leader after just 21 days in the job following an internal party revolt. He had been elected in the first leadership contest in the DUP's 50-year history, with predecessors chosen by the party's top ranks. So what went so wrong, so quickly, for the party's shortest-serving leader? Edwin Poots was under huge pressure having agreed a deal with Sinn FÃ©in and the Westminster government to ensure Paul Givan became Northern Ireland's first minister. This move was voted against by most of his elected colleagues. Edwin Poots gave the vast majority of ministerial posts to his supporters Mr Poots, who took over as leader from Arlene Foster in May, hadnarrowly defeated Sir Jeffrey Donaldson in a leadership vote. The ousting of Mrs Foster was decisive, and also strikingly brutal. On 28 April 2021,the former DUP leader resignedwithin 24 hours of it being widely leaked to the media that a significant number of elected representatives had signed a letter of no confidence. Former First Minister Arlene Foster described her own ousting as ""pretty brutal"" Former party leader Peter Robinson branded the manner of the heave, which was instigated by Mr Poots' supporters, as ""publicly humiliating, vindictive and needlessly nasty"". That view was shared by a great number of DUP members - some of whom had their own issues with Mrs Foster's leadership, but who nevertheless believed she should have been treated with more respect. Mrs Foster shared her thoughts about the nature of her ousting with theBBC's Newscast programme. ""I think I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards, it was pretty brutal,"" she said. Arlene Foster: From trailblazing leader to party civil war On Thursday, Mrs Foster enjoyed a spot of lunch with a friend as the DUP party squabbled over the leadership of the party. In a tweet, she said ""I hope everyone is having a nice day"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Poots' selection of a ministerial team was always going to be a balancing act. He had to reward those who backed him, but many believe he also needed to conciliate those who were unhappy with his election. Who is Edwin Poots? Reaction as DUP leader Edwin Poots resigns DUP leader Edwin Poots resigns after 21 days While he did ultimately appoint a few supporters of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson to lower level assembly roles, the vast majority of posts were given to his own supporters. The reaction to this was summed up by two ministers sacked by Poots, with Diane Dodds and Peter Weirboth accusing him of failing to sufficiently reach out. Mrs Dodds said it was ""regrettable"" the new team did ""not match the rhetoric about healing and bringing the party together"". Significantly, there was no move to bring Sir Jeffrey into a prominent role in the Poots' camp after a closely fought leadership election. The policy stance that ultimately undid the politician was the one he took on Irish language. Mr Poots' insisted on pressing ahead with the nomination of his close friend Paul Givan as Stormont's first minister, despite opposition from a majority of his elected representatives who were deeply unhappy. The vast majority of DUP assembly members (MLAs) - 24 to four - voted against Mr Poots' decision during a meeting ahead of the special assembly sitting. Draft provisions for new Irish language laws were included in New Decade, New Approach Deal, which helped restore power-sharing in 2020 Sinn FÃ©in had made clear it would only re-nominate Ms O'Neill if the party secured a guarantee that language legislation agreed in theNew Decade New Approach Dealin 2020, that restored power-sharing, would be implemented. A refusal by Sinn FÃ©in to nominate would have crashed the NI Executive and prompted a snap election. Mr Poots said he would implement the legislation, but did not assure Sinn FÃ©in he would do it in the current assembly mandate. In response, Sinn FÃ©in asked the UK government to introduce the laws at Westminster instead. In the early hours of 17 June, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis not only agreed to Sinn FÃ©in's request, but also announced Mr Poots was happy to proceed with reconstituting the NI Executive on that basis. This move came as a shock to many within the DUP ranks and culminated in the decisive meeting at DUP party headquarters in east Belfast the following evening, after which Mr Poots resigned. Sir Jefferey Donaldson has been tipped as the clear frontrunner for the leadership of the party, as well as some suggestions that East Antrim MP and long-standing DUP stalwart Sammy Wilson could be in the running. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson entered the last DUP election race on the date of Northern Ireland's centenary The Lagan Valley MP narrowly missed out in the last leadership contest to Edwin Poots by just two votes on 14 May. A big question for the DUP in the short term is just how quickly Edwin Poots can feasibly be replaced as leader. It is likely party officers will outline the timetable for that process, proposing a cut-off date for anyone interested in the position, which could be as soon as next week. After passing that stage, the party will then assess who is in the running for the leadership, and then decide how that is going to be ratified or rubber-stamped. The party has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons recently, and the DUP will understandably want to move on from this difficult period as soon as possible. Newly elected First Minister Paul Givan finds himself in an uncomfortable position. The very man who placed him there a day ago has been unceremoniously dumped from his leadership role by the party. Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill were confirmed as first and deputy first ministers during a special meeting of the assembly on Thursday Whoever takes on the leadership position will need to make a decision on how best to handle the first minister conundrum. Unless Paul Givan resigns from his post he will remain as first minister. If he was to resign, it would then trigger a seven-day count down for another first minister to be appointed. Failure to do that, will result in Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis calling an election. Some within the party believe Sir Jeffrey Donaldson could help bring stability back to the party. Sir Jeffrey may see Mr Givan remaining on in the first minister post as the best way to steady the ship.

Why the Northern Ireland Protocol matters,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

Retail sales fall in May as shoppers dine out,"Retail sales fell by 1.4% between April and May as people chose to visit reopened bars and restaurants instead of buying food at supermarkets. The Office for National Statistics said sales fell most significantly at food stores as consumers took advantage of Covid restrictions being lifted in the hospitality sector to eat out. In contrast, sales at non-food shops rose on demand for outdoor furniture. The proportion of online sales dipped as people returned to physical shops. It is the third month in a row that the proportion of online sales has fallen, but the ONS said they ""remain nearly 60% higher than the level seen in February 2020"" before the pandemic. The ONS said that the volume of food sales dropped by 5.7% between April and May. New figures from Tesco for the three months to 29 May appear to follow the trend. It said like-for-like sales grew strongly in March before ""moderating"" in April and May. Tesco said that compared to the same period last year - when supermarkets experienced a rush in trade during the first lockdown - sales across the group rose by 1%.In the UK alone, trade rose by 0.5%. Compared with the first quarter of 2019 before the pandemic, Tesco said sales were up by 8.1%. ONS data shows that sales at non-food shops grew by 2.3% between April and May although there were ""contrasting pictures within the sector"". Shops selling households goods reported a sharp rise in sales with anecdotal evidence suggesting ""increased spending on outdoor garden furniture in preparation for the summer and the relaxation of social gathering rules"". Toy and sports equipment retailers also saw a rise in trade. Conversely, sales fell for both clothing and department stores, but the ONS said this followed strong growth in previous months and compared to May last year clothing shop sales rose 28.9% and department stores increased by 12.6%. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics said that while the 1.4% fall in retail sales was ""disappointing"",  he said it ""may not mean that overall consumer spending is much weaker than we have been expecting if there was just a bigger shift in spending from the shops to the pubs as indoor hospitality reopened in mid-May"". We did more socialising and less shopping last month. Tesco only managed to eke out sales growth of 0.5% in the UK for its first quarter of the year. But the business has now started to come up against some tough comparisons with the start of the pandemic last year when supermarket sales went through the roof as shoppers stockpiled and the first lockdown began. It's going to be hard going for all our supermarkets to deliver much growth this year given the stonking sales they enjoyed last year. Tesco's boss, Ken Murphy, says customer behaviour is also starting to normalise with smaller shopping baskets and people making frequent trips to the aisles. But Tesco's online sales remain strong with some 1.3 million orders being fulfilled every week. Like a number of other businesses, it's also experiencing a shortage in HGV drivers but Mr Murphy thinks this is something that Tesco can manage. However, Pantheon Macroeconomics said more up-to-date data ""tentatively suggest(s) that the recovery in households' spending is struggling to progress"". The Bank of England said that credit and debit card payments in the seven days to 10 June were 5% lower compared to February last year before the pandemic. This is worse than the 1.5% decline recorded in May when compared to February 2020. It also said figures from restaurant reservation firm OpenTable indicated that ""restaurant diner numbers peaked in the second half of May and subsequently have nearly returned to normal levels for the time of the year"". Pantheon's chief UK economist, Samuel Tombs, said: ""We continue to think that the recovery in households' spending will lose momentum as it approaches its pre-Covid level later this year. ""Households' real disposable income looks set to fall in the fourth quarter, as the end of the furlough scheme reduces employment and inflation rises to match wage growth.""

UK food and drink exports to the EU almost halve,"UK food and drink exports to the European Union almost halved in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2020. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) figures show EU sales dropped by 47%. The trade body said the decline was largely due to changes in the UK's trading relationships, but said the pandemic was also a factor. The government said it was ""too early to draw any firm conclusions"" on the long term impact of Brexit. It also said the pandemic had depressed demand. ""The most recent ONS trade statistics show that for both March and April, overall exports to the EU have exceeded the average levels across 2020,"" a government spokesperson added. Rachel Hicks, co-founder and co-distiller at Sky Wave Gin said the ""red tape is strangling"" her business. She said that EU sales ""utterly dropped off a cliff"" in the first quarter, meaning her turnover was down 30%. Rachel Hicks of Sky Wave Gin said EU sales had ""dropped off a cliff"" ""The real shame is somewhere like Asia - a fast growing region for gin - is going to potentially snaffle all the markets,"" Ms Hicks said. ""We are now unable to quickly send gin to our customers all over Europe and have to wait for HMRC to inspect us every time we send gin abroad."" Graham Flannigan from Berwick Shellfish in Northumberland, is in a similar position. He said his seafood exports had ""come down drastically"" mainly due to Brexit and the impact of lockdowns. ""The logistics systems are moving better now but it's the red tape that is having to be built into the cost of the goods and this is having a knock on effect,"" he added. Dominic Goudie, the FDF's head of international trade, said the drop in exports his federation had recorded was a ""disaster"" for the industry. ""It is a very clear indication of the scale of losses that UK manufacturers face in the longer-term due to new trade barriers with the EU."" New trade barriers were not the only factor affecting cross channel trade. The FDF said that the Covid-19 outbreak accounted for a decline of some 10-15%. UK asks EU to extend grace period for chilled meat British exports worth billions face EU tariffs Figures for the quarter were also affected by companies stockpiling ahead of the Brexit-related changes. The combination of these factors, the FDF says, led to significant falls in the value of leading exports. Compared with the first quarter of 2019 - before Covid became a factor - exports of cheese were down 72%; fish sales were down 52% and chocolate was down 37%. Exports of food and drink to nearly all EU nations fell significantly in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year. Worst hit was trade with Ireland - normally the sector's biggest overseas market. It was down by more than 70%. But sales to Germany, Spain and Italy also more than halved. For decades, the UK has sold more food and drink to the European Union than to the rest of the world combined. However, the fall in shipments to Europe means that is no longer the case. In the first quarter exports to non-EU nations made up 55% of the total. The FDF said this is the first time this has happened in at least 20 years. Overall, sales to non-EU countries rose by 0.3% - although there was a significant increase in shipments to China. Sales to the region, which fell in the first quarter of last year due to Covid-related lockdowns, recovered to reach Â£200m - well above their pre-pandemic level of Â£163m. On 31 December, the so-called 'implementation period', in place since Britain left the EU, came to an end. That meant trade across the channel became subject to new post-Brexit regulations and customs formalities for the first time. This FDF says this has had a particularly significant impact on the trade in products of animal origin and other perishable foods, because it led to significant delays while formalities were completed. ""Trade that would take 12 hours in the past can now take a day or even a week,"" said Mr Goudie. ""If you lose two days or even three days it takes a big chunk out of the of shelf life of the product, which makes the trade itself less viable.""

Here's a recap of what First Minister Mark Drakeford told us:  You can keep up to date with the latest developments via the BBC News website and social media channels. Have a good weekend, and stay safe.  Swimmers in Aberystwyth will be able tobook a dip at a university poolwhile a leisure centre remains out of bounds after being turned into a Covid field hospital. Ceredigion council said slots will be made available from 28 June at Aberystwyth University while Plascrug Leisure Centre remains closed. The council said work to decommission the field hospital at Plascrug was ""far more than initially anticipated"". Most pools and leisure centres in Wales reopened on 3 May. Last month, there were complaintschildren were ""missing out""due to the continued closure of the leisure centre. The council said it was ""extremely grateful"" to the university and was committed to reopening the public pool as soon as possible. Covid-19
hasnow dropped to becoming the 31st highest cause of death in Wales, latest
mortality analysis shows. For
six of the previous 14 months, Covid-19 was the biggest cause of death in
Wales. There
were 15 deaths due to Covid in May - 0.6% of all deaths, Office for National
Statistics (ONS) figures showed. The
monthly Covid mortality rate of 5.2 deaths per 100,000 was the lowest since the
pandemic began. Covid was the 18th highest cause of death in Wales in April. Plaid Cymru said the pause of easing lockdown restrictions in Wales âmakes senseâ, but called for greater support for those directly affected. Sian Gwenllian, the partyâs deputy leader in the Senedd,
said: âWe donât know how much pressure this will put on our hospitals, so
keeping the status quo for a further four weeks does make complete sense, as
does the focus on vaccination to maximise protection. âBut I do think we need clarity from Welsh government on
support measures - for businesses, for those needing to self-isolate, and for
the track-and-trace work of local authorities.â The hospitality sector in particular needed additional
support, Ms Gwenllian said. The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system, said it was right to remain ""cautious"" at a ""critical juncture"" of the pandemic. Its director, Darren Hughes, said: âWhilst the number of Covid patients in hospitals remains low, the NHS is experiencing incredibly high levels of demand across the service, particularly in emergency care and GP practices. ""Delivery of the vaccination programme in Wales has been phenomenal and couldnât have been done without the hard work and commitment of staff, as well as the willingness of the Welsh public to protect themselves, their loved ones and their communities. âThe rise in cases of the Delta variant in Wales means itâs more important than ever that we vaccinate as many people as possible so we can maximise the protection this offers.""  The Conservatives have called on the first minister to give more
clarity on when lockdown restrictions would be eased further. James Evans, the Welsh Tory spokesman for mental health and
wellbeing, said: âWe do have to be cautious with the Delta variant spreading
across Wales and the UK. ""However I would like some light at the end of
the tunnel from the first minister. âIf you look at the data hospitalisations are 95% lower than
their previous peak, deaths are 99% lower then their previous peak. ""Eighty percent have antibodies, 96% of those of the over-65s and in the vulnerable groups have
antibodies, and I think in Wales we do need to have some idea of freedom day. ""The vaccine programme is working - we just need a bit of light at the end of the
tunnel.â First Minister Mark Drakeford says it's a âprofessional obligationâ for anyone who works in the care or health sector to get vaccinated, but he was ânot persuadedâ to make it compulsory. He was responding to a question about whether he would introduce compulsory measures, following an announcement in England that Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes. Mr Drakeford said while the Welsh government encouraged vaccination in the sector, he was ânot persuaded by shifting to compulsionâ. âOur conclusion has been that if we can make the progress we need to make by persuasion, by conversation, by giving people the evidence that we think is there to prove that vaccination is safe and effective, that that is a preferable way of doing itâ, he said. Wales' vaccination programme will ""switch into a new emphasis on double doses"" over the next four weeks, First Minister Mark Drakeford says. He said the focus would be on people in their 50s and 60s, as full vaccination rates for people even older was now high. Mr Drakeford said health boards would be targeting parts of their areas where there were infection hotspots. The other ""big task"", he said, was to get better information on the extent to which vaccination prevents hospitalisation. ""The detail on that is not sufficiently strong for us to be able to plan confidently for what the health service may have to deal with, and the extent to which we might still be able to lift restrictions, beyond the next four weeks,"" the first minister said. ""We'll be gathering data from England and Scotland on that because they are further down this course of time than than we are."" Wales has seen a ""sustained, week-on-week increase"" in the rate of Covid-19 across the country due to the Delta variant, according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said cases had been increasing since the end of May, with a ""particularly sharp rise"" in those involving people aged under 25. He noted the incidence rate was less than 10 cases per 100,000 people in Wales two weeks ago but was now 23.6 cases per 100,000 people, with the positivity rate more than doubling to 2.4%. Two weeks ago, there were 97 confirmed cases in Wales and most of those were linked to clusters in the north and the south-east of Wales, Mr Drakeford said. ""Yesterday, that figure had risen to just under 490 reported cases and that number will be higher again today."" Asked whether it was possible another lockdown would be imposed in in the future, the first minister said Wales is ""nowhere near"" needing to reverse any rule changes. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh government was ""pausing"" the relaxation of restrictions ""because we don't want to add fresh risk in to what has become a more risky context"". However, he added: ""Things are different this time to the way they were back in March of last year and over the Christmas and new year period, primarily because of vaccination. ""Now, what we're not clear about is the full extent to which vaccination has altered the link between falling ill with coronavirus and needing hospital treatment. ""The more people we can vaccinate, the stronger the defence will be - and the more certain we will become that we don't need to put anything in reverse and indeed will be able to move even further forward."" The Welsh government is looking at whether rules on face
masks in schools could be relaxed. The current
rule in Wales is that face coverings should be worn in all areas, including the
classroom, by everyone except children in primary school. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: âThere will be no
immediate change, but we will work with schools, local authorities and teaching
unions to find ways for the future that they do not need to be worn in every
classroom, every day.â First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed changes to coronavirus restrictions on wedding receptions. He said: ""From Monday, the size of the venue and a risk assessment will determine how many people can attend an indoor wedding or civil partnership reception or wake."" The maximum number permitted at present is 30. Mr Drakeford added that residential outdoor education centres will start to reopen, starting with primary school age children, while regulations will be amended to ""bring grassroots music and comedy venues into line with the rules for hospitality"". Pilot events will also continue to run through June and July, while a statement will also be published about the use of face coverings in schools. This video can not be played Covid weddings: Bride-to-be asks 'how is this fair?' over rules One bride-to-be has questioned whether current wedding rules in Wales are fair, limiting the number of guests for an indoor receptions to 30. From Monday, the number of people able to attend wedding receptions will be determined by the size of the venue. A third wave of the Covid pandemic is already under way, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. It leaves Wales facing a ""serious public health situation,"" he added. Although case numbers in Wales are lower per head of population than in England and Scotland, Mr Drakeford said Wales was likely to be âtwo or three weeks behindâ in terms of rising case numbers. âOur scientific advisers believe the UK is now in the pre-peak stage of a third wave of the pandemic,â he told Friday's Covid briefing. âIn the last week, the First Minister of Scotland and the Prime Minister have both paused their plans to relax coronavirus restrictions because of concern about the Delta variant. âAnd today, I have to announce, we will be doing the same here in Wales.â Covid vaccines for care workerswill not be compulsory in Wales, the first minister has confirmed. Mark Drakeford said he preferred an approach of convincing care home workers by ""argument and persuasion"". One care home manager in Llandrindod Wells, Powys, said being willing to be vaccinated was a condition of her staff's employment. In England, care workers face being redeployed away from front-line care or potentially lose their job if they refuse to have the jab. First Minister Mark Drakeford is about to give a Welsh government update on the pandemic. We'll post the highlights here - you can also watch it live on BBC One Wales, theBBC iPlayer, onS4C, and via the Coronavirus Update video link at the top of this page.  Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies has welcomed the move to ease restrictions on weddings, saying it will provide ""welcome relief to couples planning their big day"". However, with other restrictions set to continue for another four weeks, he called for more financial support for businesses and criticised the manner of the announcement. ""Given the continued impact on livelihoods, such
announcements shouldnât bypass the Senedd,"" Mr Davies said. ""Earlier this week, the Commons
speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, summoned ministers to Parliament so the lockdown
announcement [for England]  could be scrutinised - and he was right to do so. âFor the Senedd to do its job effectively and be relevant, these
announcements should be scrutinised in a timely fashion, not days after
implementation.â There have not been any new deaths with coronavirus reported in the latest Public Health Wales (PHW) figures. The number of new cases reported on Friday is 163. The overall case rate in Wales - that's the number of cases per 100,000 people over the most recent seven-day period - has risen again to 23.6. This video can not be played Cardiff Castle Street cars return move leads to protest Cars will be able todrive on a major route through Cardiff city centre againfrom the autumn after the council approved a move to lift the vehicle ban. Castle Street, which was one of the most polluted roads in Wales, closed to private cars last year during the first lockdown and was turned into an outdoor dining area last summer. Air pollution has been at the centre of the argument, with the Welsh government expressing disappointment at the decision. Cardiff Council leader Huw Thomas, said closing the road had moved pollution to other parts of the city. One of the few changes to Covid rules in Wales being announced today isthe lifting of the 30-person limit on guests at wedding receptions, with attendance decided on venue size instead. First Minister Mark Drakeford said if venues ""can safely accommodate over 100 people, that's what they'll do"". The changes also apply to wakes and will come into force from Monday. Â© 2025 BBC.

England & Scotland set for key Euros meeting,"This video can not be played Highlights: Both teams frustrated as iconic fixture ends in a goalless draw England and Scotland played out a goalless draw at Wembley to leave both countries with their hopes of reaching Euro 2020's knockout stage very much alive. The first meeting between the men's teams in a major tournament since Euro 96 was played out in a typically raucous atmosphere despite only 22,500 fans in attendance - and both sides had big opportunities to win. Most of the honours must go to Scotland, however, who bounced back from their opening defeat by the Czech Republic at Hampden Park with real resilience and character to fully deserve this important point. It was The Tartan Army who were elated at the final whistle while England's players heard the sound of loud jeering from their supporters. England, who were sluggish and disappointing, should have taken the lead early on when John Stones headed Mason Mount's corner against the woodwork. As Scotland settled and improved, England were grateful to Jordan Pickford's superb save from Stephen O'Donnell and a goal-line clearance from Reece James to divert Lyndon Dykes' goal-bound shot after the break. Gareth Southgate's side, with a win over Croatia in the bag, now have a chance to overtake the Czech Republic and win Group D in their final game while Scotland will chase victory against Croatia at Hampden Park. England one step closer to last 16 - Kane Scotland must build on draw - Robertson How 'Scotland's Kante' Gilmour shone at Wembley How social media reacted to nervy night of action Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played O'Donnell does everything right there' - dangerous volley saved by Pickford Scotland's players punched the air with delight when the final whistle sounded and they had secured a point that keeps them in the mix going into their final game. Manager Steve Clarke had his team well-drilled and, once they had survived an uncertain start, they gave as good as they got. The heroes' welcome they received when they went to thank the rain-sodden Tartan Army at the final whistle was thoroughly deserved. England had plenty of possession in the second half but this must never be portrayed as a Scottish rearguard action. It was anything but. Yes, they were forced back for periods but were always positive, on the lookout to attack and it needed that crucial intervention from James to deny Dykes a winner. And in 20-year-old Billy Gilmour, on his first Scotland start, they had the game's outstanding performer, the Chelsea's midfielder showing his class on the ball and a real fighting spirit in the physical challenges. It was an outstanding, mature display. Arsenal's Kieran Tierney also showed how much he was missed in that Czech defeat with a powerhouse performance that must give Scotland real hope against Croatia. Clarke got it right tactically but England counterpart Southgate has questions to ponder. There is no doubt who will be the happier manager. Czech Republic on verge of last 16 after draw with Croatia Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played Marshall rooted to the spot as Stones hits post from corner England were efficient rather than spectacular in victory against Croatia on Sunday but it was very much a case of job done to set the platform to face the old enemy in a repeat of that Euro 96 encounter. Instead, England faded badly after a bright start although Raheem Sterling was furious when Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz ignored his pleas for a second-half penalty when he tangled with Andy Robertson. England did not deserve victory but they are still in a very healthy position going into their final game. That does not mean Southgate can be satisfied after what was a very disappointing night - especially as he faces a dilemma he could not have been contemplating before this tournament started. Captain Harry Kane was poor before his substitution against Croatia on Sunday and was equally anonymous here. He looked sluggish, off the pace and short on threat. It was no surprise when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford with 16 minutes left, even though England were desperately chasing a winner. In his defence, Kane has been starved of good service. To suggest his place is in question is unthinkable but there can be no doubt Southgate wants and needs a lot more from his world-class captain. And Aston Villa's Jack Grealish may now also player a bigger part in the equation, although he could not alter the pattern of this game after he replaced Phil Foden. England's fans have made Grealish very much the people's champion and were chanting his name long before he eventually came on. Will Southgate bow to their demands and start him against the Czech Republic after an England display so lacking in spark? England are still in a very good position - but they will need to be so much better than this. This video can not be played 'England were too frantic' - Southgate In their 115th meeting in all competitions, England and Scotland shared a goalless draw for only the fourth time, also doing so in 1872, 1970 and 1987, although this was the first time in a game at Wembley in the 33rd meeting there. This was England's 17th goalless draw at a major tournament (Euros + World Cup), two more than any other team in the history of those competitions. England have kept 14 clean sheets in their last 18 matches in all competitions (W14 D2 L2) since losing 2-1 to the Czech Republic in a European Championship qualifier in October 2019. Scotland have failed to score in eight of their last 12 matches at major tournaments (W2 D3 L7), and are one of only two teams to have played twice at Euro 2020 and failed to score, along with Turkey. Since the new Wembley opened in 2007, this was only England's second ever goalless draw there in a competitive fixture, also drawing 0-0 in October 2010 against Montenegro in a European Championships qualifier under Fabio Capello. This was Luke Shaw's first appearance for England at a major tournament since June 2014 against Costa Rica in the World Cup, 2,551 days ago. The only two players with longer gaps between tournament appearances for the Three Lions are Martin Keown (2,917 days, 1992-2000) and Tony Adams (2,912 days, 1988-96). Jack Grealish came off the bench and won four fouls, the most by a substitute at Euro 2020 and the most by a sub in a Euros match since Eder won five for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final vs France. At 25 years and 31 days, England named their youngest ever starting XI at a major tournament, with the previous youngest their XI against Belgium in the 2018 World Cup third-place play-off match (25y 175d). Tonight was England's 32nd consecutive international match naming a unique starting XI, England's longest run of naming an XI for the first time since a run of 56 games between 1990 and 1996. This video can not be played England scramble in dying minutes but Scotland able to clear danger Group D plays to a conclusion on Tuesday, with England hosting the Czech Republic at Wembley and Scotland facing Croatia at Hampden Park. Both games are at 20:00 BST and all four team can still qualify for the last 16.

Iranians vote in presidential poll marred by bans,"The economic crisis is one of the main issues for Iranian voters Iranians have voted to elect a new president, with all but one of the four candidates regarded as hardliners. The winner will replace incumbent Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who has served the maximum two terms. Dissidents and some reformists have called for a boycott, saying the barring of several contenders has removed any genuine competition. The elections come at a time of widespread discontent among Iranians over economic hardships. Polls have now closed, state television reported, although it said voting at some stations has been extended to allow late-comers to cast their ballots. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast his vote early on Friday morning in Tehran and encouraged people to go the polls. ""Each vote counts ... come and vote and choose your president,"" he said. ""This is important for the future of your country."" However, there is widespread apathy among voters, after three years of crippling sanctions reinstated by the US when it abandoned a nuclear deal between world powers and Iran. Four ways election matters Four claims fact-checked The unusual way power is held in Iran ""Whether I vote or not, someone has already been elected,"" a Tehran shopkeeper was quoted by AFP news agency as saying. ""They organise the elections for the media."" Another, named as Vahid, a woodcraft teacher in the city, told Reuters he would vote ""because my leader [Ayatollah Khamenei] wants me to"". The elections coincide with the latest round of talks in Vienna aimed at reviving the accord, which saw Iran agree to limit its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Almost 600 hopefuls, including 40 women, registered for the election. But in the end only seven men were approved last month by the 12 jurists and theologians on the hard-line Guardian Council, an unelected body that has the ultimate decision with regard to candidates' qualifications. This video can not be played Iran elections: To vote or not to vote? By Thursday, three of the approved candidates had dropped out. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first round there will be a run-off election. Ebrahim Raisi Ebrahim Raisi wears a black turban identifying him as a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad The 60-year-old cleric has served as a prosecutor for most of his career. He was appointed judiciary chief in 2019, two years after he lost by a landslide to Mr Rouhani in the last election. Mr Raisi has presented himself as the best person to fight corruption and solve Iran's economic problems. However, many Iranians and human rights activists have expressed concern over his role in the mass executions of political prisoners in the 1980s. Abdolnasser Hemmati Abdolnaser Hemmati was dismissed as central bank chief after his candidacy was approved The 64-year-old technocrat became governor of the Central Bank of Iran in 2018. He was dismissed from the position after becoming a candidate. His appointments to prominent positions under Mr Rouhani and his hard-line predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, are seen as evidence of his ability to work with all factions in Iran. But he faced criticism from the other candidates for failing to mitigate the effects of US sanctions on Iran's currency, whose value has plummeted. Mohsen Rezai The 66-year-old hardliner is the secretary of the Expediency Council, which advises the Supreme Leader and has ultimate adjudicating power in disputes over legislation. He was commander of the powerful Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, and has run for the presidency three times since leaving the force. Amirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi Amirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi is an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon who has been an MP since 2008 and first deputy speaker since this May. The 50-year-old hardliner is the youngest of the candidates. Iran presidential election: Who are the candidates? Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian These elections are seen by many Iranians as a brazen power grab by the hardliners who seem to have decided that they can never win free and fair elections, judging by their past performance. With these elections, the hardliners will have all the centres of power in their control. But there will be a downside: greater dissatisfaction among a people already in desperate economic straits, and instability. If Ebrahim Raisi becomes president, the hardliners will want to establish a puritanical system of Islamic government in the vision of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This will bring in more controls on social activities, fewer freedoms and jobs for women, and tighter control of the social media and the press. Under a hardline presidency, Iran would continue to have tense relations with the West. It would continue to push to extend Shia Islam and project power in the region with the help of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major armed, political and economic force in Iran - and its local proxies. Iran would want to cosy up to China in the hope of attracting hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese investment. The election of a hardline president might also adversely affect the current indirect talks between Iran and the US to return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement and have the key US sanctions lifted. The hardliners were never happy with the deal in the first place. What to expect from a hardline president About 59 million people are eligible to vote in Iran, which has a population of 80 million. Turnout for the last presidential poll in 2017 was 73%, but the most recent survey by the state-backed Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) suggested that it could be only 42% on Friday. About 59 million people are eligible to vote in Iran That would be a historic low for any election in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and would pose a problem for Iran's leaders, who see turnout as a sign of legitimacy. On Thursday, Mr Rouhani told Iranians not to let the ""shortcomings of an institution or a group"" stop them from voting - an apparent reference to the Guardian Council. ""For the time being, let's not think about grievances tomorrow,"" he said.

London hosts growing Tartan Army ahead of match,"This video can not be played A large crowd of fans has gathered in Leicester Square ahead of the match Thousands of Scotland fans have gathered in central London to watch the team's Euro 2020 match with England. Many fans travelled despite warnings they should not go to London unless they have a match ticket, or a safe place to watch the game. Those who gathered in Leicester Square were moved on by police shortly after half-time. The Tartan Army were allocated only about 2,600 tickets for Wembley, due to Covid rules. The final score was 0-0. A fan zone in Trafalgar Square was reserved for 750 key workers. Scotland fans who had gathered in Leicester Square were moved on by police Groups of supporters wearing kilts, Scotland shirts and flags have been chanting, singing and playing bagpipes gathered at Leicester Square, King's Cross and Hyde Park. A large number of officers moved in on Scotland fans congregated in Leicester Square shortly before half time, after it is understood an opposing group tried to approach the visiting fans who remained at the central London location after kick off. Officers moved in and placed a cordon around the group of Scots who were later moved out of the square. Live: England vs Scotland coverage Why do Scotland fans sing Yes Sir, I Can Boogie? In pictures: Scotland fans descend on London Spice Girls and mad cows: Scotland v England in 1996 Earlier adispersal order was issuedfor central London, giving the police extra powers to break up groups of people where they believe their behaviour is causing a nuisance, harassment or distress. There have been no reports of any significant disorder - although there have been videos on social media that appeared to show some fans singing offensive anti-English songs. Estimates that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel south for the match have been been described as ""very conservative"" by a London Assembly member. Ahead of the match, fans gathered in Leicester Square wearing kilts and Scotland shirts waved flags and set off blue smoke bombs while chanting, singing and playing the bagpipes. Some England fans were also seen in the square wearing team shirts and draped in England's flag. People were seen climbing into the fountain of William Shakespeare in the square and splashing around in the water. Others climbed on top of the statue and put a cone on its head. Scotland fans gathered in Leicester Square and put a cone on a Shakespeare statue First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged fans to ""be respectful to our hosts"" in London, and said they should not behave in a way that was going to make the Covid problem worse. She also said she would ""abhor and condemn unreservedly"" any anti-English behaviour. Ali Brawley, 55, from Galston in East Ayrshire, said he had arrived with a group of friends in London at midnight on Wednesday, and had spent the time since ""sightseeing"" around the city's pubs. Mr Brawley and his friends will be watching the game from a pub which they booked, but he believes it would have been easier for fans - and the police - if there had been a dedicated fan zone for the Tartan Army.

He added: ""We had our first train cancelled, our hotel closed last week for refurbishment - we had to rebook the hotel. We just thought we weren't getting to get here. ""The organisation has been horrendous because of Covid, it's been tough to try and get somewhere to watch the football. ""I do believe they should have had big screens, herd us all together so we're all in the one place but now all the Scots are going to be everywhere."" Scotland fan Michael McLean, from Inverness, told BBC Scotland he had decided to travel after booking travel and accommodation several months ago. ""It's an amazing atmosphere so far. I think it seems that they've underestimated how many would travel down for the game,"" he said. ""It feels like a normal football occasion. It doesn't feel like there's a pandemic on, which I don't think is good in a way, but it's definitely good to enjoy an occasion after a year-and-a-half."" Mr McLean said the trains had been packed on the way down, with crowds of Scottish fans gathering and chanting outside King's Cross station on Thursday afternoon. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimehe had heard London Mayor Sadiq Khan's pleas for fans to stay away, but said much of the travel he had booked was non-refundable. ""Â£600 in total for all of us would be a lot to lose just to decide not to go down. Fair enough if it was refundable - but I don't want to lose the money."" One Scot who lives in London said it was ""inevitable"" that crowds of fans would travel south. Gary, a 30-year-old consultant, said: ""It was inevitable, regardless of restrictions in place. You can't stop the masses coming down to celebrate a once in a generation event."" Of the Scotland-England rivalry, he added that ""99%"" would be friendly. ""It'll be a laugh,"" he said. The Met Police's football chief, Ch Insp Joseph Stokoe, said officers had been reminding fans that some Londoners are ""still living under the fear of the pandemic"". He added: ""It's a shame, it feels like there aren't enough places for the fans to enjoy themselves, but that's why the message has always been - if you don't have a ticket, don't travel. ""Enjoy the match, enjoy the event locally, in a safer event. Don't come here, because unfortunately because of what's gone on across the world, we've been unable to provide the amount of fan zones you might expect in normal times."" Emma Best, a member of the London Assembly and the Conservative group's spokeswoman on health, said she believed an estimate that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel might turn out to be a ""very conservative"" estimate. But Ms Best added that the Tartan Army had been creating a ""really good-natured atmosphere"" throughout the city. ""The Boogie songis being played everywhere I've been walking. It's a lovely atmosphere and you could be forgiven for thinking we are not still in the midst of a pandemic, and I think that sums it up. ""What a shame that we can't have this match in normal times and really enjoy this occasion, but we are where we are and I do hope it's as safe as it can be."" These fans arrived at King's Cross Station in London on Friday Wembley is open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry. Pubs and bars in London were also expected to limit numbers allowed in. The much-anticipated match, the 115th in international football's oldest rivalry, is the first time the two sides have met in a major tournament since Euro 96, when Paul Gascoigne's famous goal sealed a 2-0 win for England. How do Scotland defeat England? Scotland lost their first game of the tournament2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday, while England defeated Croatia 1-0 the previous day. Wembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Scotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. After the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil. Where are you watching the Euros this evening? Have you set up camp at home or away?

Why is President Biden concerned about the Northern Ireland Protocol?,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

Juneteenth: What is the newest US holiday?The commemoration of the last enslaved black American being freed is now an official US holiday.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Juneteenth is a celebration of the freedom, culture and empowerment of African-Americans. A holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US has been celebrated every 19 June since President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act in 2021. So what is the origin of Juneteenth, how did it become a holiday and how can you celebrate it? On 19 June 1865 - months after the northern US states defeated the slave-owning South in the US Civil War - enslaved African-Americans in Galveston, Texas, were finally told they were free. That act of liberation came more than two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln declared all enslaved people in the rebellious states to be free by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation. The declaration by General Gordon Granger to bring the proclamation into effect in the state of Texas is seen by many as the true end of slavery. Why is it called Juneteenth? The word was created by joining the words ""June"" and ""nineteenth"" together. WATCH: What you need to know about Juneteenth Yes - though it took decades to happen. Juneteenth was first recognised as a state holiday in Texas in 1980. In the years afterwards, every state but South Dakota formally went on to recognise Juneteenth as a state or ceremonial holiday. When he was senator for Illinois, Barack Obama co-sponsored legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday, but the law was never passed - even after he became president. US lawmakers hold the holiday's official flag after the law passed Congress But the legislation gained momentum after Black Lives Matter protests around the country in the summer of 2020. In the lead-up to 19 June 2021, both chambers of the US Congress moved swiftly to pass the bill and - with the signature of President Biden, it became law. It was the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr Day was established in 1983. Among the campaigners for a federal holiday were Opal Lee, who, at age 89, walked from Texas to Washington DC in 2016 to raise awareness and persuade lawmakers. She walked 2.5 miles (4km) each day - representing the two-and-a-half years it took for enslaved people in Texas to learn they had been freed. Ms Lee spoke of her ""many different feelings"" after Congress approved the new federal holiday. ""I don't know what to call them all,"" she said. ""I am so delighted to know that suddenly we've got a Juneteenth. ""It's not a Texas thing or a black thing. It's an American thing."" A Juneteenth celebration at the memorial to George Floyd in Minneapolis US government offices close for Juneteenth, as do any private businesses that participate. As for whether state government employees get a paid day off - that depends on whether state authorities mark Juneteenth as a state holiday, a day of observance or something in between. It is a varied picture. Similarly, celebrations and traditions differ across the US. In some states there are parades, festivals and block parties where people gather to share food and play games. As well as public readings and singing, picnics and church services, in some states rodeos, contests, concerts and parades are also organised. Food also plays an important part, with barbecues being one of the most popular ways of marking the day with family and friends. Many people choose to shop at black-owned businesses or eat at black-owned restaurants. Others elect to attend solemn or reflective events that call attention to ongoing racial inequality. This video can not be played The battle over what's taught in US history class The ending of slavery did not end racism, and in the years after emancipation, so-called Jim Crow laws were created to separate black people from white society and limit their civil rights. The legacy of those laws is still being dismantled. The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African Americans at the hands of police have spurred anti-racism protests. It also comes as a cultural debate rages over the history of slavery and how it should be taught in American schools.

""Â£600 in total for all of us would be a lot to lose just to decide not to go down. Fair enough if it was refundable - but I don't want to lose the money."" One Scot who lives in London said it was ""inevitable"" that crowds of fans would travel south. Gary, a 30-year-old consultant, said: ""It was inevitable, regardless of restrictions in place. You can't stop the masses coming down to celebrate a once in a generation event."" Of the Scotland-England rivalry, he added that ""99%"" would be friendly. ""It'll be a laugh,"" he said. The Met Police's football chief, Ch Insp Joseph Stokoe, said officers had been reminding fans that some Londoners are ""still living under the fear of the pandemic"". He added: ""It's a shame, it feels like there aren't enough places for the fans to enjoy themselves, but that's why the message has always been - if you don't have a ticket, don't travel. ""Enjoy the match, enjoy the event locally, in a safer event. Don't come here, because unfortunately because of what's gone on across the world, we've been unable to provide the amount of fan zones you might expect in normal times."" Emma Best, a member of the London Assembly and the Conservative group's spokeswoman on health, said she believed an estimate that 20,000 Scotland fans would travel might turn out to be a ""very conservative"" estimate. But Ms Best added that the Tartan Army had been creating a ""really good-natured atmosphere"" throughout the city. ""The Boogie songis being played everywhere I've been walking. It's a lovely atmosphere and you could be forgiven for thinking we are not still in the midst of a pandemic, and I think that sums it up. ""What a shame that we can't have this match in normal times and really enjoy this occasion, but we are where we are and I do hope it's as safe as it can be."" These fans arrived at King's Cross Station in London on Friday Wembley is open at 25% capacity for the match, with supporters having to show either proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test before entry. Pubs and bars in London were also expected to limit numbers allowed in. The much-anticipated match, the 115th in international football's oldest rivalry, is the first time the two sides have met in a major tournament since Euro 96, when Paul Gascoigne's famous goal sealed a 2-0 win for England. How do Scotland defeat England? Scotland lost their first game of the tournament2-0 against the Czech Republic on Monday, while England defeated Croatia 1-0 the previous day. Wembley and Hampden are among 11 venues across Europe hosting the games in the tournament, which was delayed for a year because of the pandemic. Scotland have never made it past the group stage before, but the top two - or possibly three - teams will go through to the knockout phase. After the match at Wembley, Croatia will visit Hampden on Tuesday for Scotland's second match on home soil. Where are you watching the Euros this evening? Have you set up camp at home or away?

UK food and drink exports to the EU 'almost halve',"UK food and drink exports to the European Union almost halved in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2020. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) figures show EU sales dropped by 47%. The trade body said the decline was largely due to changes in the UK's trading relationships, but said the pandemic was also a factor. The government said it was ""too early to draw any firm conclusions"" on the long term impact of Brexit. It also said the pandemic had depressed demand. ""The most recent ONS trade statistics show that for both March and April, overall exports to the EU have exceeded the average levels across 2020,"" a government spokesperson added. Rachel Hicks, co-founder and co-distiller at Sky Wave Gin said the ""red tape is strangling"" her business. She said that EU sales ""utterly dropped off a cliff"" in the first quarter, meaning her turnover was down 30%. Rachel Hicks of Sky Wave Gin said EU sales had ""dropped off a cliff"" ""The real shame is somewhere like Asia - a fast growing region for gin - is going to potentially snaffle all the markets,"" Ms Hicks said. ""We are now unable to quickly send gin to our customers all over Europe and have to wait for HMRC to inspect us every time we send gin abroad."" Graham Flannigan from Berwick Shellfish in Northumberland, is in a similar position. He said his seafood exports had ""come down drastically"" mainly due to Brexit and the impact of lockdowns. ""The logistics systems are moving better now but it's the red tape that is having to be built into the cost of the goods and this is having a knock on effect,"" he added. Dominic Goudie, the FDF's head of international trade, said the drop in exports his federation had recorded was a ""disaster"" for the industry. ""It is a very clear indication of the scale of losses that UK manufacturers face in the longer-term due to new trade barriers with the EU."" New trade barriers were not the only factor affecting cross channel trade. The FDF said that the Covid-19 outbreak accounted for a decline of some 10-15%. UK asks EU to extend grace period for chilled meat British exports worth billions face EU tariffs Figures for the quarter were also affected by companies stockpiling ahead of the Brexit-related changes. The combination of these factors, the FDF says, led to significant falls in the value of leading exports. Compared with the first quarter of 2019 - before Covid became a factor - exports of cheese were down 72%; fish sales were down 52% and chocolate was down 37%. Exports of food and drink to nearly all EU nations fell significantly in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year. Worst hit was trade with Ireland - normally the sector's biggest overseas market. It was down by more than 70%. But sales to Germany, Spain and Italy also more than halved. For decades, the UK has sold more food and drink to the European Union than to the rest of the world combined. However, the fall in shipments to Europe means that is no longer the case. In the first quarter exports to non-EU nations made up 55% of the total. The FDF said this is the first time this has happened in at least 20 years. Overall, sales to non-EU countries rose by 0.3% - although there was a significant increase in shipments to China. Sales to the region, which fell in the first quarter of last year due to Covid-related lockdowns, recovered to reach Â£200m - well above their pre-pandemic level of Â£163m. On 31 December, the so-called 'implementation period', in place since Britain left the EU, came to an end. That meant trade across the channel became subject to new post-Brexit regulations and customs formalities for the first time. This FDF says this has had a particularly significant impact on the trade in products of animal origin and other perishable foods, because it led to significant delays while formalities were completed. ""Trade that would take 12 hours in the past can now take a day or even a week,"" said Mr Goudie. ""If you lose two days or even three days it takes a big chunk out of the of shelf life of the product, which makes the trade itself less viable.""

"Lib Dems reverse Tory majority to win by-electionThe party leader says overturning a 16,000 majority sends a ""shockwave through British politics"".","This video can not be played Sir Ed Davey celebrates his party's win in the Chesham and Amersham while breaking down a model blue wall The Liberal Democrats have pulled off a stunning by-election victory, overturning a 16,000 majority in a seat that has always voted Conservative. Leader Sir Ed Davey celebrated by knocking over a wall of blue bricks, claiming his party was now the ""main threat"" to the Tories in many areas. The party's candidate Sarah Green won by 8,028 votes from the Tories, with the Green Party in third place. Labour had the worst by-election result in the party's history, with 622 votes. The result is a major boost for the Liberal Democrats after their poor performance at the 2019 general election and brings their total number of MPs at Westminster to 12. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the result for his party as ""disappointing"". Kuenssberg: Defeat will fuel Tory 'brand Boris' fears Voters say result means 'a different voice for us' Lib Dems to make most of new MP Appearing alongside Ms Green at a victory rally in the Buckinghamshire constituency, Sir Ed said: ""This is a great result, a huge swing to us. There are many Conservatives across the country who are now worried. ""People have been talking about a red wall, well after Chesham and Amersham and Sarah Green's victory they'll be talking about a blue wall, and how the Lib Dems are the main threat to the Conservatives. ""People here felt ignored and taken for granted, and we listened. Sarah Green is going to take these concerns to Parliament and hold this appalling Tory government to account."" In her victory speech in the early hours of Friday, Ms Green said: ""Tonight the voice of Chesham and Amersham is unmistakable. Together we have said, 'enough is enough, we will be heard and this government will listen'."" This video can not be played Lib Dem Sarah Green vows to ""hold the government to account"" Local opposition to the HS2 rail line, which is being built through the constituency, and the government's planning reforms, which could see more homes being built in rural areas, were major factors in the poll. Mr Johnson attributed the defeat to local issues and insisted the government was focused on ""uniting and levelling up within regions across the whole country"". Responding to suggestions his party's house building plans had led to defeat, he said there had been a ""wilful misunderstanding about the planning reforms"" adding that the government wanted to develop brownfield sites rather than ""build all over the countryside"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says by-election was âdisappointing resultâ Speaking to the BBC, Conservative candidate Peter Fleet warned against reading ""too much"" into his defeat arguing that the result was caused by ""very local circumstances"". But Bob Seely - Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight - told the BBC the government ""badly need to think again about planning"". ""This entire system feeds the over-development of the south and the under-development of other areas. It needs to change."" Polling Expert Prof Sir John Curtice said ""in remain-voting middle class seats in the south of England, the Conservative coalition has been weakened to some degree in the wake of Brexit - the Liberal Democrats are best placed to profit from that."" Why a political battle looms over planning rules Will Tories worry about 'Blue Wall' losses? For the Liberal Democrats, this will be a legendary victory to rank alongside famous by-election upsets of the past. We may be seeing the return of classic Lib Dem ""pavement politics"" - relentlessly campaigning on local issues such as HS2, which the party supports nationally, but opposed locally. More worrying for the Conservatives, is the apparent backlash against the government's planning reforms. But are there bigger conclusions to be drawn? The Lib Dems claim the political geography of the UK is changing. The party made inroads in some traditional Conservative areas - many of which had majorities for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum -  in the recent local elections in England. Some Conservative councillors worried that their party's emphasis on ""levelling up"" and on former Labour seats in northern England could be making some voters in the south feel left behind. But, so far, the Conservatives have been gaining more ground in the north than they have been losing in the south. As for Labour at Chesham and Amersham, their vote collapsed. It's clear that there was tactical voting to oust the Conservatives. What might be more concerning to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is the sheer extent of this - and that the party's vote was as solid as quicksand. The by-election was caused by the death in April of former Welsh Secretary Dame Cheryl Gillan. In 2019, she retained the seat with more than half of the vote. But the Conservative majority has been steadily decreasing since the 2015 General Election, when it was 23,920, with UKIP coming second. In 2017, it was 22,140 with Labour second with 11,374, and in 2019the Liberal Democrats got the second-highest number of votes, picking up 13% more than they did in 2017. Following the by-election, Ben Nunn - director of communications for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - stepped down from his role. He told the BBC it was a ""personal decision"".

Reaction as DUP leader Edwin Poots resigns,"DUP's Paul Givan and Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill were put forward as first and deputy first ministers But DUP party representatives had voted against nominating by a large majority, causing a rift within the party The nomination came after the UK government said it would legislate for language protections if Stormont does not DUP members entered a crisis meeting late on Thursday with DUP leader Edwin Poots expected to face a vote of no confidence Edwin Poots resigned weeks into his leadership after a meeting of party officers at DUP headquarters Tomorrow the DUP's MLAs and MPs will start again the process of finding a new party leader. As always, BBC News NI will be on hand to bring you all the latest developments, but after a long day, evening and night we bring our live coverage to a close. Goodnight. The Belfast Telegraph's Suzanne Breen predicts a ""coronation"" for Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. ""He's popular with Alliance voters, with Ulster Unionist voters, for transfers in Assembly elections,"" she tells The View. I think the DUP had a punt on Poots, now it's time for steady, safe, tried and trusted leadership. ""Jeffrey Donaldson is perfect for that. ""He's not confrontational and is a bridge builder."" ""Donaldson is not that different from Beattie,"" says the News Letter's Ben Lowry. ""Will they be able to work together very well? ""Or will they be too similar and will that boost Jim Allister?""

Prof Jon Tonge, of Liverpool University, who has a book about the DUP said Mr Poots should have been better prepared. ""It wasnât a complex Line of Duty style plot,"" he tells The View. âWe knew what was coming from Sinn FÃ©in â they wanted New Decade New Approach to be
implemented and he should have been prepared for that, squared his party off,
knowing Sinn FÃ©in would smell blood as the DUP would be petrified by an election. ""Anyone could have seen that was coming. ""Thatâs how he has
ended up where he is now â by not bringing his party with him and those
assembly members who supported him weeks ago â deserted him in droves â his

""Edwin was clearly very, very keen to take the leadership, there were many in the party unhappy about the way that if was done.

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is now in pole position. He was the beaten contender, losing out by just two votes to Edwin Poots. But I think he is now being regarded by many in the party as the one who can bring that unifying presence, to reach out and heal some of the wounds. He has to reach out to the MLAs who were disillusioned with the previous leadership because he was part of that leadership. So he'll have a job of work to do to get everybody on to his page. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Paul Givan remains in place and the only way he can be removed from the post of first minister is if he resigns from the position. And there is no indication of that happening. I would be surprised if Edwin Poots did not raise the issue of Paul Givan's position at that discussion with party officers tonight whenever he agreed that he would tender his resignation. And I wouldn't be surprised if Paul Givan remains in that post until the new leader comes along, or even beyond that. The big focus of the DUP will be to now provide some stability and rather than reshuffling some of the key positions, they might try and let things settle a bit.  Allow Twitter content?

Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent BBC News NI understands a motion of no confidence was mentioned
but not tabled at the meeting of DUP officers. Party sources described the meeting as ârobustâ and said it
had become clear Mr Poots knew he had to resign. It is thought the process to appoint his successor could
move âat paceâ, according to one DUP figure. Doug Beattie and Edwin Poots officially took the leadership reigns on the same night. Tonight the Ulster Unionist leader says whoever follows Mr Poots as DUP leader will face the same issues. âThe
unedifying events around the DUP leadership were entirely inevitable. It
doesn`t matter who the leader of the DUP is because they will face the same
critical issues which were negotiated and agreed on their watch. âUnionism
deserves better and Northern Ireland deserves better. Unionism needs modern,
confident, progressive leadership and a roadmap for recovery and renewal. The
Ulster Unionist Party will concentrate on providing that leadership and remains
a united, welcoming party that is looking to the future.  âFor
too long Unionism has been fed a diet of fear and negativity. We have the
talents and abilities to project a more confident, inclusive, vibrant brand of
Northern Ireland unionism across the United Kingdom and beyond. There are huge
challenges ahead, but by setting out a proper long-term strategy for the
future, we can lift unionism to a better place.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Minister apologises for failing rape victims""We've got to do a lot better,"" says Robert Buckland, as he sets out plans to tackle low conviction rates.UK Politics","This video can not be played Robert Buckland says ""sorry.. we have to do a lot better"" for victims of sexual offences Ministers have said they feel ""deeply ashamed"" of low conviction rates for rape cases in England and Wales. Speaking to the BBC, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland apologised to victims and promised to ""do a lot better"". He also admitted budget cuts were partly to blame for convictions falling to a record low in recent years. The government says it is now considering allowing victims to pre-record their evidence to spare them the trauma of a courtroom trial. Its review also outlined plans,externalto focus more on the suspect's behaviour - not the accuser's, and make sure phones taken away for evidence-gathering were returned within a day. The review was met with mixed responses, with one rape charity saying it was a missed opportunity and failed to identify any big commitments that would radically and swiftly improve rape victims' experience. Labour said the government had ""failed victims of rape on every front"" and its recommendations did not go far enough. Laura Kuenssberg: Apology to rape victims matters, but actions count Why are rape prosecutions falling? Calls for rape victims to pre-record evidence Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Buckland said the report revealed ""at all stages of the criminal justice process frankly a failure to deal with complaints made by many thousands of victims"". ""The first thing I think I need to say is, sorry - it's not good enough."" In a foreword to the review, Mr Buckland, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Attorney General Michael Ellis, said: ""The vast majority of victims do not see the crime against them charged and reach a court - one in two victims withdraw from rape investigations. ""These are trends of which we are deeply ashamed,"" they wrote. ""Victims of rape are being failed."" They went on to say that most rapes were carried out by people known to the victim, making investigations very personal and intrusive for the victim. The trauma and their experience afterwards led many to disengage from the criminal justice process, they said. ""We are not prepared to accept that rape is just 'too difficult' a crime to prosecute. We can, and must, do better,"" they added. This video can not be played Katherine: ""I feel really sad that it's taken this for them to listen"" Katherine Araniello says she felt she wanted to take her own life after her rape case was dropped ""practically on the eve of the trial"" by the Crown Prosecution Service. She says she was given an explanation as to why her case was dropped but it was only ""very vague"". ""They didn't call me in to iron out any issues they might have at their end."" She says she felt like ""it was my character"" the Crown Prosecution Service were judging, not that of the alleged perpetrator, and her treatment by the CPS ""really stung, and it still stings to this day"". ""That lack of acknowledgment from the CPS on how to treat victims, highly traumatised victims as well, has left me really angry with the system,"" she says. ""They haven't learned their lessons."" Each year there are about 128,000 victims of rape and attempted rape but fewer than 20% of them report the crime to the police, according to the report. And just 1.6% of rapes result in someone being charged. Emily Hunt, an independent adviser to the review and herself a rape victim, said the low prosecution rate was not because people made false allegations. She cited Home Office research showing up to 3% of rape allegations could be false, which meant 97% of them were not. ""The reality is, in almost all cases, if someone says they've been raped, they have not made it up which makes the current situation all the more shocking and unacceptable,"" she said in the report. Plans set out in the report include: Introducing better data extraction technology to reduce the time that victims are without their phones - with an aim to have them returned by police within 24 hours. Currently this process can take months causing distress for victims left phoneless at a time when they most need support from friends and family Putting greater emphasis on understanding a suspect's behaviour rather than focusing on a victim's credibility Sparing victims the trauma of attending a courtroom trial by videoing their cross-examination earlier in the process and away from the courtroom. A pilot will be trialled in several courts, with a wider rollout considered. This measure is already used for children and vulnerable victims and witnesses The report - commissioned in March 2019 - also said the volume of cases going to court should return to ""at least 2016 levels"" and that regular ""scorecards"" would be published to monitor progress. The Law Commission will also begin a review into ""rape myths"" and examine the use of a victims' sexual history as evidence. There are many possible factors behind the fall in prosecutions. The report argued it was due to ""a strained relationship"" between different parts of the system, lack of support for the victims and ""an increase in invasive requests for their personal data"". Asked in his BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Robert Buckland replied: ""Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case."" He said the government was now ""seeking to make the necessary investment"" but also insisted ""it's about more than just money, it's about culture."" He argued that ""for too long"" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence. ""If your house is burgled people don't start asking 'why did you go out?'â¦ all those assumptions I'm afraid are far too often not applied when it comes to sexual offences,"" he said. In rape investigations, there has also been an increase in the amount of evidence to consider, often from phones and social media, making them more difficult for police, prosecutors and, potentially, victims. Victims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird has said,externalsome victims withdraw their complaints because ""they cannot face the unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into their privacy"". There have also been suggestions a secret conviction rate target, set by the CPS, led to prosecutors dropping weaker or more challenging cases. In November 2019, it was revealed the CPS had introduced a target in 2016 that 60% of rape cases should end in a conviction. The victims' commissioner welcomed the review's proposals but said the government ""has a mountain to climb if it is to restore victims' confidence"". Dame Vera said it was ""disheartening"" that the pre-recording of video evidence was not being introduced more widely. Labour's shadow solicitor general Ellie Reeves said the government's review had missed a ""real opportunity"" to improve the justice system, and accused the government of failing victims of rape ""on every front âby pushing the justice system to the brink of collapse through a decade of cuts to police, courts and the CPS"". She said ""piecemeal pilots"" and ""âtinkering"" would not be enough to fix the failures. Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the current system was ""in disarray"". She said it was welcome the government had admitted women have been failed, but women's groups felt ""frustration and disappointment"" over how long the measures in the review would take to be rolled out. ""Waiting a further two years to see some of these recommendations come to fruition is too long,"" she added. Amelia Handy, policy lead for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said the review was ""a missed opportunity"". ""While there are individual elements of the government's report that are encouraging, it's hard to identify any big commitments that will radically and swiftly improve the experience of the justice system for victims and survivors,"" she said. She called for ""independent research into who does and doesn't report sexual offences to the police"" and an urgent review into governance of the Crown Prosecution Service. Sumanta Roy from Imkaan - an organisation tackling violence against women from ethnic minorities - called for ring-fenced funding ""to address the historical under-funding of specialist independent support services for black, minoritised women"".

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is now in pole position. He was the beaten contender, losing out by just two votes to Edwin Poots. But I think he is now being regarded by many in the party as the one who can bring that unifying presence, to reach out and heal some of the wounds. He has to reach out to the MLAs who were disillusioned with the previous leadership because he was part of that leadership. So he'll have a job of work to do to get everybody on to his page. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Paul Givan remains in place and the only way he can be removed from the post of first minister is if he resigns from the position. And there is no indication of that happening. I would be surprised if Edwin Poots did not raise the issue of Paul Givan's position at that discussion with party officers tonight whenever he agreed that he would tender his resignation. And I wouldn't be surprised if Paul Givan remains in that post until the new leader comes along, or even beyond that. The big focus of the DUP will be to now provide some stability and rather than reshuffling some of the key positions, they might try and let things settle a bit.  Allow Twitter content?

Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent BBC News NI understands a motion of no confidence was mentioned
but not tabled at the meeting of DUP officers. Party sources described the meeting as ârobustâ and said it
had become clear Mr Poots knew he had to resign. It is thought the process to appoint his successor could
move âat paceâ, according to one DUP figure. Doug Beattie and Edwin Poots officially took the leadership reigns on the same night. Tonight the Ulster Unionist leader says whoever follows Mr Poots as DUP leader will face the same issues. âThe
unedifying events around the DUP leadership were entirely inevitable. It
doesn`t matter who the leader of the DUP is because they will face the same
critical issues which were negotiated and agreed on their watch. âUnionism
deserves better and Northern Ireland deserves better. Unionism needs modern,
confident, progressive leadership and a roadmap for recovery and renewal. The
Ulster Unionist Party will concentrate on providing that leadership and remains
a united, welcoming party that is looking to the future.  âFor
too long Unionism has been fed a diet of fear and negativity. We have the
talents and abilities to project a more confident, inclusive, vibrant brand of
Northern Ireland unionism across the United Kingdom and beyond. There are huge
challenges ahead, but by setting out a proper long-term strategy for the
future, we can lift unionism to a better place.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Edwin was clearly very, very keen to take the leadership, there were many in the party unhappy about the way that if was done. ""It was then over to him then to demonstrate why he felt it was necessary. ""What were the changes that he felt needed to happen? ""However, over the course of the last two weeks we haven't seen that - for example in terms of North South relations, the protocol and of course what has happened over the last 24 hours.""

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is now in pole position. He was the beaten contender, losing out by just two votes to Edwin Poots. But I think he is now being regarded by many in the party as the one who can bring that unifying presence, to reach out and heal some of the wounds. He has to reach out to the MLAs who were disillusioned with the previous leadership because he was part of that leadership. So he'll have a job of work to do to get everybody on to his page. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Paul Givan remains in place and the only way he can be removed from the post of first minister is if he resigns from the position. And there is no indication of that happening. I would be surprised if Edwin Poots did not raise the issue of Paul Givan's position at that discussion with party officers tonight whenever he agreed that he would tender his resignation. And I wouldn't be surprised if Paul Givan remains in that post until the new leader comes along, or even beyond that. The big focus of the DUP will be to now provide some stability and rather than reshuffling some of the key positions, they might try and let things settle a bit.  Allow Twitter content?

Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent BBC News NI understands a motion of no confidence was mentioned
but not tabled at the meeting of DUP officers. Party sources described the meeting as ârobustâ and said it
had become clear Mr Poots knew he had to resign. It is thought the process to appoint his successor could
move âat paceâ, according to one DUP figure. Doug Beattie and Edwin Poots officially took the leadership reigns on the same night. Tonight the Ulster Unionist leader says whoever follows Mr Poots as DUP leader will face the same issues. âThe
unedifying events around the DUP leadership were entirely inevitable. It
doesn`t matter who the leader of the DUP is because they will face the same
critical issues which were negotiated and agreed on their watch. âUnionism
deserves better and Northern Ireland deserves better. Unionism needs modern,
confident, progressive leadership and a roadmap for recovery and renewal. The
Ulster Unionist Party will concentrate on providing that leadership and remains
a united, welcoming party that is looking to the future.  âFor
too long Unionism has been fed a diet of fear and negativity. We have the
talents and abilities to project a more confident, inclusive, vibrant brand of
Northern Ireland unionism across the United Kingdom and beyond. There are huge
challenges ahead, but by setting out a proper long-term strategy for the
future, we can lift unionism to a better place.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Minister apologises for failing rape victims""We've got to do a lot better,"" says Robert Buckland, as he sets out plans to tackle low conviction rates.UK PoliticsThe black Scotland captain whose team trounced EnglandAndrew Watson, the first black international player, captained the Scots to a record win against England.Scotland","This video can not be played Robert Buckland says ""sorry.. we have to do a lot better"" for victims of sexual offences Ministers have said they feel ""deeply ashamed"" of low conviction rates for rape cases in England and Wales. Speaking to the BBC, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland apologised to victims and promised to ""do a lot better"". He also admitted budget cuts were partly to blame for convictions falling to a record low in recent years. The government says it is now considering allowing victims to pre-record their evidence to spare them the trauma of a courtroom trial. Its review also outlined plans,externalto focus more on the suspect's behaviour - not the accuser's, and make sure phones taken away for evidence-gathering were returned within a day. The review was met with mixed responses, with one rape charity saying it was a missed opportunity and failed to identify any big commitments that would radically and swiftly improve rape victims' experience. Labour said the government had ""failed victims of rape on every front"" and its recommendations did not go far enough. Laura Kuenssberg: Apology to rape victims matters, but actions count Why are rape prosecutions falling? Calls for rape victims to pre-record evidence Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Buckland said the report revealed ""at all stages of the criminal justice process frankly a failure to deal with complaints made by many thousands of victims"". ""The first thing I think I need to say is, sorry - it's not good enough."" In a foreword to the review, Mr Buckland, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Attorney General Michael Ellis, said: ""The vast majority of victims do not see the crime against them charged and reach a court - one in two victims withdraw from rape investigations. ""These are trends of which we are deeply ashamed,"" they wrote. ""Victims of rape are being failed."" They went on to say that most rapes were carried out by people known to the victim, making investigations very personal and intrusive for the victim. The trauma and their experience afterwards led many to disengage from the criminal justice process, they said. ""We are not prepared to accept that rape is just 'too difficult' a crime to prosecute. We can, and must, do better,"" they added. This video can not be played Katherine: ""I feel really sad that it's taken this for them to listen"" Katherine Araniello says she felt she wanted to take her own life after her rape case was dropped ""practically on the eve of the trial"" by the Crown Prosecution Service. She says she was given an explanation as to why her case was dropped but it was only ""very vague"". ""They didn't call me in to iron out any issues they might have at their end."" She says she felt like ""it was my character"" the Crown Prosecution Service were judging, not that of the alleged perpetrator, and her treatment by the CPS ""really stung, and it still stings to this day"". ""That lack of acknowledgment from the CPS on how to treat victims, highly traumatised victims as well, has left me really angry with the system,"" she says. ""They haven't learned their lessons."" Each year there are about 128,000 victims of rape and attempted rape but fewer than 20% of them report the crime to the police, according to the report. And just 1.6% of rapes result in someone being charged. Emily Hunt, an independent adviser to the review and herself a rape victim, said the low prosecution rate was not because people made false allegations. She cited Home Office research showing up to 3% of rape allegations could be false, which meant 97% of them were not. ""The reality is, in almost all cases, if someone says they've been raped, they have not made it up which makes the current situation all the more shocking and unacceptable,"" she said in the report. Plans set out in the report include: Introducing better data extraction technology to reduce the time that victims are without their phones - with an aim to have them returned by police within 24 hours. Currently this process can take months causing distress for victims left phoneless at a time when they most need support from friends and family Putting greater emphasis on understanding a suspect's behaviour rather than focusing on a victim's credibility Sparing victims the trauma of attending a courtroom trial by videoing their cross-examination earlier in the process and away from the courtroom. A pilot will be trialled in several courts, with a wider rollout considered. This measure is already used for children and vulnerable victims and witnesses The report - commissioned in March 2019 - also said the volume of cases going to court should return to ""at least 2016 levels"" and that regular ""scorecards"" would be published to monitor progress. The Law Commission will also begin a review into ""rape myths"" and examine the use of a victims' sexual history as evidence. There are many possible factors behind the fall in prosecutions. The report argued it was due to ""a strained relationship"" between different parts of the system, lack of support for the victims and ""an increase in invasive requests for their personal data"". Asked in his BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Robert Buckland replied: ""Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case."" He said the government was now ""seeking to make the necessary investment"" but also insisted ""it's about more than just money, it's about culture."" He argued that ""for too long"" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence. ""If your house is burgled people don't start asking 'why did you go out?'â¦ all those assumptions I'm afraid are far too often not applied when it comes to sexual offences,"" he said. In rape investigations, there has also been an increase in the amount of evidence to consider, often from phones and social media, making them more difficult for police, prosecutors and, potentially, victims. Victims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird has said,externalsome victims withdraw their complaints because ""they cannot face the unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into their privacy"". There have also been suggestions a secret conviction rate target, set by the CPS, led to prosecutors dropping weaker or more challenging cases. In November 2019, it was revealed the CPS had introduced a target in 2016 that 60% of rape cases should end in a conviction. The victims' commissioner welcomed the review's proposals but said the government ""has a mountain to climb if it is to restore victims' confidence"". Dame Vera said it was ""disheartening"" that the pre-recording of video evidence was not being introduced more widely. Labour's shadow solicitor general Ellie Reeves said the government's review had missed a ""real opportunity"" to improve the justice system, and accused the government of failing victims of rape ""on every front âby pushing the justice system to the brink of collapse through a decade of cuts to police, courts and the CPS"". She said ""piecemeal pilots"" and ""âtinkering"" would not be enough to fix the failures. Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the current system was ""in disarray"". She said it was welcome the government had admitted women have been failed, but women's groups felt ""frustration and disappointment"" over how long the measures in the review would take to be rolled out. ""Waiting a further two years to see some of these recommendations come to fruition is too long,"" she added. Amelia Handy, policy lead for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said the review was ""a missed opportunity"". ""While there are individual elements of the government's report that are encouraging, it's hard to identify any big commitments that will radically and swiftly improve the experience of the justice system for victims and survivors,"" she said. She called for ""independent research into who does and doesn't report sexual offences to the police"" and an urgent review into governance of the Crown Prosecution Service. Sumanta Roy from Imkaan - an organisation tackling violence against women from ethnic minorities - called for ring-fenced funding ""to address the historical under-funding of specialist independent support services for black, minoritised women"".

Today's live page has been brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Jo Couzens, Paul Gribben and James Clarke. It's been a busy day, but it's time to say goodbye. Here's a summary of what's gone on during the day: As England opens up first doses of vaccines to everyone aged 18 and older, over-40s and people with underlying health conditions are being contacted to bring their second doses forward. The initial advice across the whole of the UK was to offer jabs 12 weeks apart in order to give as many people as possible a first dose. Now those who haven't yet had their second dose in some priority groups can have it after eight weeks. You can rearrange an appointment yourself, but you must first cancel your original bookingonline,external, or by calling 119. Second doses are also beingbrought forward,externalinScotlandto eight weeks and appointments can be rebooked viathe NHS Inform website,external. InNorthern Ireland,the interval between doses has been reduced from 10 weeks to six weeks,externalfor appointments scheduled after 14 June. InWales, the government saysvaccination clinics ""are accelerating second doses"",external, and that people will be contacted by their local health board in due course. Here's everything you need to know about going for your jabs. Andrew Lloyd Webber has rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's offer to add his new musical Cinderella to a pilot scheme for full-capacity live events. The PM said earlier this week he was in talks with the theatre impresario about including the show in the scheme. But Lord Lloyd Webber says the theatre industry has been treated as ""an afterthought and undervalued"" and he would only take part in the scheme if others in the trade were treated equally. On Monday, the government confirmed it would not lift all Covid restrictions until at least 19 July - delayed from the proposed date of 21 June. Last week, Lord Lloyd Webber said he was determined to open his show to a full house on 25 June, even if he risked being arrested. However, after rejecting the option to be one of the official pilot events, he has rowed back on his threat to go to jail and confirmed the show will go ahead with a 50% capacity, the current legal limit.

The total infections have crossed the five million mark and at least seven African countries have run out of vaccines. Africa remains an area of concern, even though it accounts for only about 5% of new global infections and 2% of deaths, WHO officials say. New cases in Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Rwanda have
doubled in the past week, WHO emergencies programme head Mike
Ryan is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. ""It's a trajectory that is very, very concerning,"" he has told reporters at the organisation's headquarters in Geneva. ""The brutal reality is that in an era of multiple
variants, with increased transmissibility, we have left vast
swathes of the population, the vulnerable population of Africa,
unprotected by vaccines."" South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Egypt have recorded the most virus cases in the continent. Uganda and Namibia are experiencing a deadly third wave, with dozens of fatalities recorded daily. A total of 136,030 people have succumbed to the virus in different African countries, according to the WHO. The Delta variant is in 14 African countries while the Beta variant, first detected in South Africa, is in 25 countries. The WHO says there's no clear timeline on when more vaccines will be available, but there is an urgent need for them. UK music fans are sitting on hundreds of thousands of tickets for postponed concerts rather than returning them. The latest four-week delay to fully unlocking Covid restrictions has pushed an additional 5,000 gigs into doubt. Artists such as Rag'n'Bone Man, Olly Murs and Rudimental had scheduled shows between 21 June and 19 July and face a choice of postponing or scrapping gigs. Industry body Live estimates the events scheduled for the next four weeks are worth Â£500m to the struggling sector. It also means fans remain out of pocket to see shows they forked out for many months ago. Read BBC business reporter Rebecca Wearn's full reporthere. And a guide to the rules for gigs and festivals ishere. Most existing Covid restrictions in the UK are staying in place for the moment, because of concerns over the Delta variant. The government had hoped to""remove all legal limits on social contact"",externalin England from 21 June. It's now been put back until 19 July.

Wembley hosted 22,500 fans - 25% of its capacity - for England's Group D fixture against Croatia Uefa says it is ""confident"" the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 will be held at Wembley as planned - but has a contingency plan amid concerns around England's coronavirus restrictions. The Times reported the games could be moved from London to Budapest if VIPs are not given an exemption to England's strict quarantine rules. The UK government has postponed lifting all restrictions until 19 July - the final of the tournament is due to take place on 11 July. Most countries in Euro 2020 are on the UK government's amber or red list. Wembley's capacity is reduced to 22,500 for group fixtures at Euro 2020, but that is set to be expanded to 45,000 - about 50% of full capacity - for games in the knockout stages. The matches are being treated as fan pilot events and so are exempt from strict capacity limits. Read more on this storyhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Cases are rising in every

10,000 is nearly 30% higher than last Fridayâs which was, in turn about 30%
higher than the week before. But the two weeks before that
saw numbers rising by nearly 50% each week. Slower rises are still rises,
and weâll have to wait and see how this plays through into hospitalisations. But any potential slowdown is
a hopeful sign â before reversing, you need to hit the brakes. BBC Newsbeat Like many others, Enter Shikari frontman Rou Reynolds says the past 18 months have been strange. Last year, Covid-19 wiped out the UK's summer festival season, and this yearonly a handful are still taking place. This weekend, the band will be back on stage at Download Festival in Donnington Park, Leicestershire. ""Can you believe it? We've been spending the last three weeks trying to work out how to be a live band again,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I remember saying halfway through the pandemic, it sort of feels like we're experiencing what the death of a band would be like, by just not being able to play."" Read the full storyhere. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring The recent surge in Covid numbers in Russia may be an example
of how careless talk costs lives. For months, Russians had been told by officials and
Kremlin-controlled media how successful their country had been at battling the
coronavirus, while the West was described as failing miserably. People in Europe, for instance, were said to be confused and
angry because of endless lockdowns. There were reports on Russian TV of
violence, rioting and vaccine shortages in the West. Time and again, Russian TV
described Western vaccines as part of the problem, and claimed that they were
causing more deaths. No evidence was offered to back up these claims. Meanwhile in Russia, state TV would say, things were getting
better: restrictions were being lifted, shopping centres and museums were
reopening, students were going back to universities, and vaccination was proceeding apace. Only little mention was made of how many Russians exactly had
been vaccinated, or how many had died because of the virus - it had been all
but defeated, supposedly. Now the rhetoric has changed. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry
Peskov on Friday blamed a record number of daily Covid infections in the capital, Moscow, on
""nihilism"", and state TV is alarmed and broadcasting pro-vaccination
appeals. But given the past behaviour by both officials and the
media, it should perhaps come as no surprise if many in Russia are complacent
and distrustful of vaccines.  Nearly 470,000 UK
adults received either the first or second dose of a Covid vaccine yesterday. The latest government
data shows 243,978 first doses were given, taking the total
number of people to have received their initial jab to 42,460,632. A total of 223,260 people were given a second vaccination, meaning 30,898,467, or 58.7% of adults, have now had both jabs. There have been a
further 10,476 cases of Covid in the UK, thelatest government figures,externalshow. Another 11 deaths
within 28 days of a positive test have also been announced. Last Friday there were
8,125 cases and 17 deaths reported. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier,Israel has said it is to send at least a million doses of Covid vaccine to the Palestinian Authorityin return for receiving a similar amount back later in the year. The deal means Israel will not waste doses that are about to expire, while the Palestinians can accelerate their vaccination programme. This appears to be a win-win arrangement for Israelis and Palestinians. The first batches have already been received by the Palestinian health ministry. It says they will be used in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and that vaccination centres will now open seven days a week with extended hours. Israel, which has led the world with its rapid rollout of Covid vaccines, has faced criticism for not doing more to ensure Palestinians have access. It denies having responsibility under international law - but Israeli health officials say thereâs a benefit to helping Palestinians get immunised because of mixing of the populations. Harry Potter publisher Bloomsbury has said vaccines will be compulsory for its staff returning to the office when it reopens. Many firms are having to weigh up the necessity of workforce vaccinations. The government has announced care home workers in England will be required to have a vaccination or risk losing their jobs. Bloomsbury toldThe Bookseller,externalmagazine, which first reported the company's decision, that it had taken both ""medical and scientific advice"". ""The simple fact is that this virus is still extremely dangerous."" The publisher is due to reopen on 19 July and made employees aware of the policy in an email ahead of the second May Bank Holiday weekend. Read more on this storyhere. Katie PrescottToday business presenter Some passengers due to set sail with cruise company MSC are having their trips cancelled because the delay to easing Covid restrictions means the ships have been overbooked. Cruise ships are allowed to hold up to 1,000 guests under the current guidelines. But MSC oversold tickets for cruises after 21 June, saying it ""had fully expected that most restrictions would be removed"". Customers who had their trips cancelled yesterday are complaining on social media about the lack of information and about being out of pocket for things such as parking, travel to the ports and hotels. One woman told me she paid Â£1,4000 for her elderly mother to go into respite care for the week. Andy Hunt from Essex was due to set sail from Southampton. He says: ""Now they've had my money, we had the suitcases out of the garage, got the week booked off, my wife has the week booked off, the dogs are booked into kennels. I'm really, really frustrated it could have been handled so much better."" MSC says the first 1,000 passengers who booked get priority boarding and those left will be able to rebook or get a refund.

Italy is on the amber list for UK travel and had, until today, not required quarantine on arrival as long as visitors presented anegative Covid test result,externaltaken in the previous 48 hours. Italy reported 37 coronavirus-related deaths yesterday against 52 on Wednesday, while the daily number of new infections fell to 1,325 from 1,400, the health ministry says. In contrast, the UK reported 11,007 new cases yesterday. Euro 2020 sees Wales due to play Italy in Rome on Sundayso some fans from the UK may already be in the country.

Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Rates of coronavirus infection in England are highest in the North West, the Office for National Statistics estimates. About 0.55% of people are testing positive there, with the next closest Yorkshire & the Humber at 0.25%. No other English region has rates above 0.2%. There are possible signs of a decrease in the percentage of children testing positive in school years 7 to 11. The highest rates are in the group between school year 12 (16-year-olds) and those aged 24, which sees 0.5% testing positive, and among 25 to 34-year-olds - at 0.4%. About 0.2% of younger children would test positive and about 0.1% of older adults would test positive, the ONS says. This video can not be played Smaller cities around the US are offering incentives, sometimes up to $15,000 (Â£10,800), for young talent to move there. And with remote work on the rise during the pandemic, people are freer to relocate. Nearly one in four Americans is expected to be a fully remote worker in a few years. Vaccinating children is routine and widely accepted - measles, mumps, polio, diphtheria, rotavirus, multiple strains of meningitis, whooping coughâ¦ the list goes on. All this starts from just a few weeks old. So, what about Covid-19? Some countries are cracking on. The US is immunising children between 12 and 15. It expects to have enough safety data to go even younger next year. But in the UK -the BBC has been told- a decision to vaccinate all 12 to 17-year-olds is unlikely to be recommended by UK experts any time soon. There is a scientific question - will vaccinating children save lives? - which is complex as the answer may vary from country to country. There is also a moral and ethical dimension if doses destined for children would save more lives if they were given to health workers and vulnerable adults in other countries.

"England and Scotland set for key Euros clashWembley will host 22,500 fans as the teams meet in a major tournament for the first time in 25 years.","This video can not be played Highlights: Both teams frustrated as iconic fixture ends in a goalless draw England and Scotland played out a goalless draw at Wembley to leave both countries with their hopes of reaching Euro 2020's knockout stage very much alive. The first meeting between the men's teams in a major tournament since Euro 96 was played out in a typically raucous atmosphere despite only 22,500 fans in attendance - and both sides had big opportunities to win. Most of the honours must go to Scotland, however, who bounced back from their opening defeat by the Czech Republic at Hampden Park with real resilience and character to fully deserve this important point. It was The Tartan Army who were elated at the final whistle while England's players heard the sound of loud jeering from their supporters. England, who were sluggish and disappointing, should have taken the lead early on when John Stones headed Mason Mount's corner against the woodwork. As Scotland settled and improved, England were grateful to Jordan Pickford's superb save from Stephen O'Donnell and a goal-line clearance from Reece James to divert Lyndon Dykes' goal-bound shot after the break. Gareth Southgate's side, with a win over Croatia in the bag, now have a chance to overtake the Czech Republic and win Group D in their final game while Scotland will chase victory against Croatia at Hampden Park. England one step closer to last 16 - Kane Scotland must build on draw - Robertson How 'Scotland's Kante' Gilmour shone at Wembley How social media reacted to nervy night of action Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played O'Donnell does everything right there' - dangerous volley saved by Pickford Scotland's players punched the air with delight when the final whistle sounded and they had secured a point that keeps them in the mix going into their final game. Manager Steve Clarke had his team well-drilled and, once they had survived an uncertain start, they gave as good as they got. The heroes' welcome they received when they went to thank the rain-sodden Tartan Army at the final whistle was thoroughly deserved. England had plenty of possession in the second half but this must never be portrayed as a Scottish rearguard action. It was anything but. Yes, they were forced back for periods but were always positive, on the lookout to attack and it needed that crucial intervention from James to deny Dykes a winner. And in 20-year-old Billy Gilmour, on his first Scotland start, they had the game's outstanding performer, the Chelsea's midfielder showing his class on the ball and a real fighting spirit in the physical challenges. It was an outstanding, mature display. Arsenal's Kieran Tierney also showed how much he was missed in that Czech defeat with a powerhouse performance that must give Scotland real hope against Croatia. Clarke got it right tactically but England counterpart Southgate has questions to ponder. There is no doubt who will be the happier manager. Czech Republic on verge of last 16 after draw with Croatia Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played Marshall rooted to the spot as Stones hits post from corner England were efficient rather than spectacular in victory against Croatia on Sunday but it was very much a case of job done to set the platform to face the old enemy in a repeat of that Euro 96 encounter. Instead, England faded badly after a bright start although Raheem Sterling was furious when Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz ignored his pleas for a second-half penalty when he tangled with Andy Robertson. England did not deserve victory but they are still in a very healthy position going into their final game. That does not mean Southgate can be satisfied after what was a very disappointing night - especially as he faces a dilemma he could not have been contemplating before this tournament started. Captain Harry Kane was poor before his substitution against Croatia on Sunday and was equally anonymous here. He looked sluggish, off the pace and short on threat. It was no surprise when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford with 16 minutes left, even though England were desperately chasing a winner. In his defence, Kane has been starved of good service. To suggest his place is in question is unthinkable but there can be no doubt Southgate wants and needs a lot more from his world-class captain. And Aston Villa's Jack Grealish may now also player a bigger part in the equation, although he could not alter the pattern of this game after he replaced Phil Foden. England's fans have made Grealish very much the people's champion and were chanting his name long before he eventually came on. Will Southgate bow to their demands and start him against the Czech Republic after an England display so lacking in spark? England are still in a very good position - but they will need to be so much better than this. This video can not be played 'England were too frantic' - Southgate In their 115th meeting in all competitions, England and Scotland shared a goalless draw for only the fourth time, also doing so in 1872, 1970 and 1987, although this was the first time in a game at Wembley in the 33rd meeting there. This was England's 17th goalless draw at a major tournament (Euros + World Cup), two more than any other team in the history of those competitions. England have kept 14 clean sheets in their last 18 matches in all competitions (W14 D2 L2) since losing 2-1 to the Czech Republic in a European Championship qualifier in October 2019. Scotland have failed to score in eight of their last 12 matches at major tournaments (W2 D3 L7), and are one of only two teams to have played twice at Euro 2020 and failed to score, along with Turkey. Since the new Wembley opened in 2007, this was only England's second ever goalless draw there in a competitive fixture, also drawing 0-0 in October 2010 against Montenegro in a European Championships qualifier under Fabio Capello. This was Luke Shaw's first appearance for England at a major tournament since June 2014 against Costa Rica in the World Cup, 2,551 days ago. The only two players with longer gaps between tournament appearances for the Three Lions are Martin Keown (2,917 days, 1992-2000) and Tony Adams (2,912 days, 1988-96). Jack Grealish came off the bench and won four fouls, the most by a substitute at Euro 2020 and the most by a sub in a Euros match since Eder won five for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final vs France. At 25 years and 31 days, England named their youngest ever starting XI at a major tournament, with the previous youngest their XI against Belgium in the 2018 World Cup third-place play-off match (25y 175d). Tonight was England's 32nd consecutive international match naming a unique starting XI, England's longest run of naming an XI for the first time since a run of 56 games between 1990 and 1996. This video can not be played England scramble in dying minutes but Scotland able to clear danger Group D plays to a conclusion on Tuesday, with England hosting the Czech Republic at Wembley and Scotland facing Croatia at Hampden Park.

Police to crack down on drones flown dangerously,"Drones have hugely increased in popularity in recent years with hundreds of thousands now being used by hobbyists and businesses in the UK Police in the UK are being given new powers to crack down on people flying drones irresponsibly or illegally, with dedicated teams on the lookout for those breaking the rules. Last week a drone user was fined more than Â£5,000 for flying illegally over MI6's building in central London. Police working for Operation Foreverwing can now confiscate drones being flown dangerously. They will also be able to issue on-the-spot fines. The Home Office, which worked closely with the police in setting up Operation Foreverwing in March, said that officers will be given ""the tools needed to tackle drone misuse"". This will include specialist equipment, vehicles and training. ""This represents a landmark moment for the UK in tackling this new and developing threat,"" said Shaun Hipgrave, Home Office director responsible for counter-drones. Under the rules, anyone operating a drone that either weighs 250 grams or more, or one fitted with a camera, has to register with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Those with drones weighing more than 250 grams must also pass a test on the CAA website. ""We've had 200,000 registrations since the system was set up in November 2019 but we think that there are many more out there unregistered, potentially tens of thousands,"" said Jonathan Nicholson, from the CAA. ""Our prime concern is about aviation safety and how aircraft and drones can legally share airspace. So the emphasis is on the drone user, because it is much more likely they will see a helicopter or light aircraft, than the pilot of those will see a drone."" He said that the rules for registered, larger drones were ""common sense"" and include: stay well away from aircraft, airports and airfields don't fly closer than 50m (164ft) to people and don't fly over them never fly over crowds keep 150m away from built-up areas Those flouting the rules face fines, and anyone endangering aircraft could receive a prison sentence of up to five years. As well as safety and privacy issues, the police are also concerned about the use of drones for illegal activities such as smuggling drugs into prisons. Police will be on the lookout for drones, amid some high-profile events happening in the UK, including the current Euro 2020 football competition, and the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November.

Let rape victims record evidence,"A new report has found that too often ""special measures"" - designed to help witnesses give evidence and relieve stress - were not being offered to victims. Photo posed by a model. Rape victims in England and Wales should be able to pre-record evidence and cross-examinations so that they do not have to face perpetrators in court, the victims' commissioner has said. In a new report, Dame Vera Baird has called for the practice to be rolled out ""as soon as practically possible"". It would also reduce stressful waits in the run-up to trials, she told the BBC. The BBC understands the government is considering the move, but it is not clear how it would be implemented. A plan will be laid out in a government review due to be published next month. Ina review of the provision,externalfor vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in courts, Dame Vera said pre-recording interviews would relieve unnecessary stress for those who had experienced sexual assault. ""We've found that almost everybody who was asked had heard victims say how frightened they were to come to court,"" she said. They did not want to come face-to-face with the defendant or their ""supporters"", she said, nor did they want people in the public gallery. She also said the practice would reduce the wait between the witness giving initial evidence to police and being cross-examined in court, which can sometimes be two years because of backlogs made worse by the pandemic. Instead, the evidence and cross-examination could both be filmed soon after the alleged offence, and played to a jury in court once the case reached trial, without any further involvement from the victim. Dame Vera said this would mean the complainant could give their account ""whilst their memory is good"" then move on - and, if they choose, get therapy without fear that their notes could then be used by the defence. She said asking people alleging rape to wait for years before being cross-examined ""preserves the traumatisation"" and can lead to them withdrawing from prosecution altogether. Around43% of rape complainants dropped out of prosecutions,externalin the nine months to December 2020, according to Home Office figures. Those who do proceed can give up if their case is listed for a certain date but cancelled last minute, Dame Vera said, adding: ""It's a torture you don't have to put anyone through."" The law in England and Wales says that under ""special measures"", witnesses who are classed as vulnerable or intimidated are eligible to pre-record their initial evidence and cross-examination. This practice was rolled outfor all vulnerable witnesses - which includes all children - last year.However, it is not currently used for intimidated witnesses, which includes those who allege sexual offences. A pilot was introduced in three courts September 2019 and an evaluation has not yet been published. Dame Vera Baird's report was based on interviews with people working in the criminal justice sector and victim support services. The victims' commissioner's report found that the guilty plea rate was ""notably higher"" when evidence was pre-recorded and the process was less traumatic for witnesses. It also said, more broadly, that too often ""special measures"" - designed to help witnesses give evidence and relieve stress - were not being offered to those who were entitled to them. These measures include the provision of screens to shield witnesses from the defendant in court, and the option to appear in court from a separate room via television link. Among its recommendations is a call for the government to make sure that separate entrances and waiting rooms are available for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, and to make greater use of remote centres where witnesses can give evidence without attending court. The BBC understands that a government review to be published next month will also include plans to ask judges to bar the public from courts more often and to ensure mobile phones are returned to victims within 24 hours. Katie Russell, spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales,  told the BBC that these measures, as well as pre-recording evidence, would have the ""potential to improve the unacceptably low levels of criminal justice"" that rape and sexual violence complainants receive. ""All sexual violence and abuse victims and survivors have been subjected to trauma and deserve trauma-informed and sensitive treatment,"" she said. She also said the ""significant length of time"" that mobile phones were kept for had been ""a cause for concern for some time"". ""Being disconnected from friends, family and support networks at such a difficult and stressful time can undoubtedly be distressing,"" she said. In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: ""We understand how traumatic the court process can be and despite the pandemic we are continuing to improve the support provided for victims."" ""This includes protective screens and video links in every criminal court, more separate waiting rooms as well as piloting the pre-recording of cross-examination for rape victims to help further reduce the stress of attending court,"" it added. ""At the same time, a new Victims' Bill - set out in the Queen's Speech - will strengthen the rights of victims at every stage of the justice system.""

England and Scotland set for key Euros meeting,"This video can not be played Highlights: Both teams frustrated as iconic fixture ends in a goalless draw England and Scotland played out a goalless draw at Wembley to leave both countries with their hopes of reaching Euro 2020's knockout stage very much alive. The first meeting between the men's teams in a major tournament since Euro 96 was played out in a typically raucous atmosphere despite only 22,500 fans in attendance - and both sides had big opportunities to win. Most of the honours must go to Scotland, however, who bounced back from their opening defeat by the Czech Republic at Hampden Park with real resilience and character to fully deserve this important point. It was The Tartan Army who were elated at the final whistle while England's players heard the sound of loud jeering from their supporters. England, who were sluggish and disappointing, should have taken the lead early on when John Stones headed Mason Mount's corner against the woodwork. As Scotland settled and improved, England were grateful to Jordan Pickford's superb save from Stephen O'Donnell and a goal-line clearance from Reece James to divert Lyndon Dykes' goal-bound shot after the break. Gareth Southgate's side, with a win over Croatia in the bag, now have a chance to overtake the Czech Republic and win Group D in their final game while Scotland will chase victory against Croatia at Hampden Park. England one step closer to last 16 - Kane Scotland must build on draw - Robertson How 'Scotland's Kante' Gilmour shone at Wembley How social media reacted to nervy night of action Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played O'Donnell does everything right there' - dangerous volley saved by Pickford Scotland's players punched the air with delight when the final whistle sounded and they had secured a point that keeps them in the mix going into their final game. Manager Steve Clarke had his team well-drilled and, once they had survived an uncertain start, they gave as good as they got. The heroes' welcome they received when they went to thank the rain-sodden Tartan Army at the final whistle was thoroughly deserved. England had plenty of possession in the second half but this must never be portrayed as a Scottish rearguard action. It was anything but. Yes, they were forced back for periods but were always positive, on the lookout to attack and it needed that crucial intervention from James to deny Dykes a winner. And in 20-year-old Billy Gilmour, on his first Scotland start, they had the game's outstanding performer, the Chelsea's midfielder showing his class on the ball and a real fighting spirit in the physical challenges. It was an outstanding, mature display. Arsenal's Kieran Tierney also showed how much he was missed in that Czech defeat with a powerhouse performance that must give Scotland real hope against Croatia. Clarke got it right tactically but England counterpart Southgate has questions to ponder. There is no doubt who will be the happier manager. Czech Republic on verge of last 16 after draw with Croatia Listen - Daily Euros: BBC Football Daily This video can not be played Marshall rooted to the spot as Stones hits post from corner England were efficient rather than spectacular in victory against Croatia on Sunday but it was very much a case of job done to set the platform to face the old enemy in a repeat of that Euro 96 encounter. Instead, England faded badly after a bright start although Raheem Sterling was furious when Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz ignored his pleas for a second-half penalty when he tangled with Andy Robertson. England did not deserve victory but they are still in a very healthy position going into their final game. That does not mean Southgate can be satisfied after what was a very disappointing night - especially as he faces a dilemma he could not have been contemplating before this tournament started. Captain Harry Kane was poor before his substitution against Croatia on Sunday and was equally anonymous here. He looked sluggish, off the pace and short on threat. It was no surprise when he was replaced by Marcus Rashford with 16 minutes left, even though England were desperately chasing a winner. In his defence, Kane has been starved of good service. To suggest his place is in question is unthinkable but there can be no doubt Southgate wants and needs a lot more from his world-class captain. And Aston Villa's Jack Grealish may now also player a bigger part in the equation, although he could not alter the pattern of this game after he replaced Phil Foden. England's fans have made Grealish very much the people's champion and were chanting his name long before he eventually came on. Will Southgate bow to their demands and start him against the Czech Republic after an England display so lacking in spark? England are still in a very good position - but they will need to be so much better than this. This video can not be played 'England were too frantic' - Southgate In their 115th meeting in all competitions, England and Scotland shared a goalless draw for only the fourth time, also doing so in 1872, 1970 and 1987, although this was the first time in a game at Wembley in the 33rd meeting there. This was England's 17th goalless draw at a major tournament (Euros + World Cup), two more than any other team in the history of those competitions. England have kept 14 clean sheets in their last 18 matches in all competitions (W14 D2 L2) since losing 2-1 to the Czech Republic in a European Championship qualifier in October 2019. Scotland have failed to score in eight of their last 12 matches at major tournaments (W2 D3 L7), and are one of only two teams to have played twice at Euro 2020 and failed to score, along with Turkey. Since the new Wembley opened in 2007, this was only England's second ever goalless draw there in a competitive fixture, also drawing 0-0 in October 2010 against Montenegro in a European Championships qualifier under Fabio Capello. This was Luke Shaw's first appearance for England at a major tournament since June 2014 against Costa Rica in the World Cup, 2,551 days ago. The only two players with longer gaps between tournament appearances for the Three Lions are Martin Keown (2,917 days, 1992-2000) and Tony Adams (2,912 days, 1988-96). Jack Grealish came off the bench and won four fouls, the most by a substitute at Euro 2020 and the most by a sub in a Euros match since Eder won five for Portugal in the Euro 2016 final vs France. At 25 years and 31 days, England named their youngest ever starting XI at a major tournament, with the previous youngest their XI against Belgium in the 2018 World Cup third-place play-off match (25y 175d). Tonight was England's 32nd consecutive international match naming a unique starting XI, England's longest run of naming an XI for the first time since a run of 56 games between 1990 and 1996. This video can not be played England scramble in dying minutes but Scotland able to clear danger Group D plays to a conclusion on Tuesday, with England hosting the Czech Republic at Wembley and Scotland facing Croatia at Hampden Park. Both games are at 20:00 BST and all four team can still qualify for the last 16.

Lib Dems beat Tories in by-election,"This video can not be played Sir Ed Davey celebrates his party's win in the Chesham and Amersham while breaking down a model blue wall The Liberal Democrats have pulled off a stunning by-election victory, overturning a 16,000 majority in a seat that has always voted Conservative. Leader Sir Ed Davey celebrated by knocking over a wall of blue bricks, claiming his party was now the ""main threat"" to the Tories in many areas. The party's candidate Sarah Green won by 8,028 votes from the Tories, with the Green Party in third place. Labour had the worst by-election result in the party's history, with 622 votes. The result is a major boost for the Liberal Democrats after their poor performance at the 2019 general election and brings their total number of MPs at Westminster to 12. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the result for his party as ""disappointing"". Kuenssberg: Defeat will fuel Tory 'brand Boris' fears Voters say result means 'a different voice for us' Lib Dems to make most of new MP Appearing alongside Ms Green at a victory rally in the Buckinghamshire constituency, Sir Ed said: ""This is a great result, a huge swing to us. There are many Conservatives across the country who are now worried. ""People have been talking about a red wall, well after Chesham and Amersham and Sarah Green's victory they'll be talking about a blue wall, and how the Lib Dems are the main threat to the Conservatives. ""People here felt ignored and taken for granted, and we listened. Sarah Green is going to take these concerns to Parliament and hold this appalling Tory government to account."" In her victory speech in the early hours of Friday, Ms Green said: ""Tonight the voice of Chesham and Amersham is unmistakable. Together we have said, 'enough is enough, we will be heard and this government will listen'."" This video can not be played Lib Dem Sarah Green vows to ""hold the government to account"" Local opposition to the HS2 rail line, which is being built through the constituency, and the government's planning reforms, which could see more homes being built in rural areas, were major factors in the poll. Mr Johnson attributed the defeat to local issues and insisted the government was focused on ""uniting and levelling up within regions across the whole country"". Responding to suggestions his party's house building plans had led to defeat, he said there had been a ""wilful misunderstanding about the planning reforms"" adding that the government wanted to develop brownfield sites rather than ""build all over the countryside"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says by-election was âdisappointing resultâ Speaking to the BBC, Conservative candidate Peter Fleet warned against reading ""too much"" into his defeat arguing that the result was caused by ""very local circumstances"". But Bob Seely - Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight - told the BBC the government ""badly need to think again about planning"". ""This entire system feeds the over-development of the south and the under-development of other areas. It needs to change."" Polling Expert Prof Sir John Curtice said ""in remain-voting middle class seats in the south of England, the Conservative coalition has been weakened to some degree in the wake of Brexit - the Liberal Democrats are best placed to profit from that."" Why a political battle looms over planning rules Will Tories worry about 'Blue Wall' losses? For the Liberal Democrats, this will be a legendary victory to rank alongside famous by-election upsets of the past. We may be seeing the return of classic Lib Dem ""pavement politics"" - relentlessly campaigning on local issues such as HS2, which the party supports nationally, but opposed locally. More worrying for the Conservatives, is the apparent backlash against the government's planning reforms. But are there bigger conclusions to be drawn? The Lib Dems claim the political geography of the UK is changing. The party made inroads in some traditional Conservative areas - many of which had majorities for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum -  in the recent local elections in England. Some Conservative councillors worried that their party's emphasis on ""levelling up"" and on former Labour seats in northern England could be making some voters in the south feel left behind. But, so far, the Conservatives have been gaining more ground in the north than they have been losing in the south. As for Labour at Chesham and Amersham, their vote collapsed. It's clear that there was tactical voting to oust the Conservatives. What might be more concerning to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is the sheer extent of this - and that the party's vote was as solid as quicksand. The by-election was caused by the death in April of former Welsh Secretary Dame Cheryl Gillan. In 2019, she retained the seat with more than half of the vote. But the Conservative majority has been steadily decreasing since the 2015 General Election, when it was 23,920, with UKIP coming second. In 2017, it was 22,140 with Labour second with 11,374, and in 2019the Liberal Democrats got the second-highest number of votes, picking up 13% more than they did in 2017. Following the by-election, Ben Nunn - director of communications for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - stepped down from his role. He told the BBC it was a ""personal decision"".

Iran presidential vote marred by disqualifications,"The economic crisis is one of the main issues for Iranian voters Iranians have voted to elect a new president, with all but one of the four candidates regarded as hardliners. The winner will replace incumbent Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who has served the maximum two terms. Dissidents and some reformists have called for a boycott, saying the barring of several contenders has removed any genuine competition. The elections come at a time of widespread discontent among Iranians over economic hardships. Polls have now closed, state television reported, although it said voting at some stations has been extended to allow late-comers to cast their ballots. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast his vote early on Friday morning in Tehran and encouraged people to go the polls. ""Each vote counts ... come and vote and choose your president,"" he said. ""This is important for the future of your country."" However, there is widespread apathy among voters, after three years of crippling sanctions reinstated by the US when it abandoned a nuclear deal between world powers and Iran. Four ways election matters Four claims fact-checked The unusual way power is held in Iran ""Whether I vote or not, someone has already been elected,"" a Tehran shopkeeper was quoted by AFP news agency as saying. ""They organise the elections for the media."" Another, named as Vahid, a woodcraft teacher in the city, told Reuters he would vote ""because my leader [Ayatollah Khamenei] wants me to"". The elections coincide with the latest round of talks in Vienna aimed at reviving the accord, which saw Iran agree to limit its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Almost 600 hopefuls, including 40 women, registered for the election. But in the end only seven men were approved last month by the 12 jurists and theologians on the hard-line Guardian Council, an unelected body that has the ultimate decision with regard to candidates' qualifications. This video can not be played Iran elections: To vote or not to vote? By Thursday, three of the approved candidates had dropped out. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first round there will be a run-off election. Ebrahim Raisi Ebrahim Raisi wears a black turban identifying him as a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad The 60-year-old cleric has served as a prosecutor for most of his career. He was appointed judiciary chief in 2019, two years after he lost by a landslide to Mr Rouhani in the last election. Mr Raisi has presented himself as the best person to fight corruption and solve Iran's economic problems. However, many Iranians and human rights activists have expressed concern over his role in the mass executions of political prisoners in the 1980s. Abdolnasser Hemmati Abdolnaser Hemmati was dismissed as central bank chief after his candidacy was approved The 64-year-old technocrat became governor of the Central Bank of Iran in 2018. He was dismissed from the position after becoming a candidate. His appointments to prominent positions under Mr Rouhani and his hard-line predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, are seen as evidence of his ability to work with all factions in Iran. But he faced criticism from the other candidates for failing to mitigate the effects of US sanctions on Iran's currency, whose value has plummeted. Mohsen Rezai The 66-year-old hardliner is the secretary of the Expediency Council, which advises the Supreme Leader and has ultimate adjudicating power in disputes over legislation. He was commander of the powerful Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, and has run for the presidency three times since leaving the force. Amirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi Amirhossein Qazizadeh Hashemi is an ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon who has been an MP since 2008 and first deputy speaker since this May. The 50-year-old hardliner is the youngest of the candidates. Iran presidential election: Who are the candidates? Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian These elections are seen by many Iranians as a brazen power grab by the hardliners who seem to have decided that they can never win free and fair elections, judging by their past performance. With these elections, the hardliners will have all the centres of power in their control. But there will be a downside: greater dissatisfaction among a people already in desperate economic straits, and instability. If Ebrahim Raisi becomes president, the hardliners will want to establish a puritanical system of Islamic government in the vision of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This will bring in more controls on social activities, fewer freedoms and jobs for women, and tighter control of the social media and the press. Under a hardline presidency, Iran would continue to have tense relations with the West. It would continue to push to extend Shia Islam and project power in the region with the help of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a major armed, political and economic force in Iran - and its local proxies. Iran would want to cosy up to China in the hope of attracting hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese investment. The election of a hardline president might also adversely affect the current indirect talks between Iran and the US to return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement and have the key US sanctions lifted. The hardliners were never happy with the deal in the first place. What to expect from a hardline president About 59 million people are eligible to vote in Iran, which has a population of 80 million. Turnout for the last presidential poll in 2017 was 73%, but the most recent survey by the state-backed Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) suggested that it could be only 42% on Friday. About 59 million people are eligible to vote in Iran That would be a historic low for any election in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and would pose a problem for Iran's leaders, who see turnout as a sign of legitimacy. On Thursday, Mr Rouhani told Iranians not to let the ""shortcomings of an institution or a group"" stop them from voting - an apparent reference to the Guardian Council. ""For the time being, let's not think about grievances tomorrow,"" he said.
