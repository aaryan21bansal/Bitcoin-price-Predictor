Positive atmosphere in Brexit talks - May,"Theresa May met German's Angela Merkel and other EU leaders Issues still need to be resolved but progress is being made in Brexit negotiations, Theresa May has insisted. The prime minister said there had been a ""very positive atmosphere"" in talks with several EU leaders in Brussels. The UK, she said, would honour its financial commitments and shared the same desire as Ireland to stop barriers to trade or movement across the border. EU Council President Donald Tusk said talks could move to the next phase in December but it was a ""huge challenge"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At a security summit in Brussels, Mrs May had lunch with Angela Merkel and also met Mr Tusk, who told her last week that she has until the start of December to make an enhanced offer on money and provide guarantees on the Irish border after Brexit. Ministers have given her their backing to increase the UK's ""divorce bill"" but only if the EU shows movement on trade. The government has refused to comment on reports it had agreed to pay about Â£40bn to pave the way for EU leaders to approve the next phase of talks on future relations at a summit on 14 December. All you need to know about Brexit DUP hits out at Irish government on Brexit Brexit: UK 'ready to pay more to EU' Speaking in Brussels, Mrs May did not answer specific questions about money and said there were ""still issues across the various matters that we're negotiating on to be resolved"". But she added: ""There's been a very positive atmosphere in the talks and a genuine feeling that we want to move forward together."" Last week, Mr Tusk said the EU was ""ready"" to move on to the next phase of talks - focused on a trade and security partnership after the UK leaves in March 2019 - but the UK must first show more progress on outstanding ""separation"" issues. The BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said that after holding talks with Mrs May, Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen had told journalists in the Belgian capital that there had been ""movement"" on the issue of money. ""It seems to me that there is progress and so I have decided to be optimistic about this,"" Mr Rasmussen - one of the UK's closest allies - said. The PM also said the UK was in continuing discussions with the Irish government about the solutions for avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. No 10 earlier had to clarify its position after a spokesman appeared to suggest the possibility of Northern Ireland staying in the customs union may be up for negotiation. Asked about the issue at a lobby briefing, the spokesman said the UK must ""continue to negotiate to find an innovative way forward"". But Downing Street later insisted that the UK's stated policy - that the whole of the UK is leaving the single market and customs union - remained in force. The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and served the EU with formal notice of Brexit in March 2017. This began a two-year countdown to the UK's departure day which will be in March 2019.

US 'to stop arming anti-IS Syrian Kurds',"The YPG played a key role in removing IS from Raqqa and other strongholds The US is to stop supplying arms to the Syrian Kurdish militia the YPG, Turkey has said. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said President Donald Trump had made the promise in a phone call to his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The White House said it was making ""adjustments"" to its support for partners inside Syria but did not explicitly name the YPG. Turkey has long complained about US support for the group. Washington has viewed the YPG as a key player in the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS), but Ankara brands the group's fighters as terrorists. Turkey says the YPG is as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades in south-eastern Turkey. The US, however, has seen the YPG as distinct from the PKK. In May it announced it would supply arms to the Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which were poised to drive IS from its stronghold of Raqqa. It had previously armed only Arab elements of the SDF. US-led coalition military advisers have been assisting YPG fighters ""President Trump instructed [his generals] in a very open way that the YPG will no longer be given weapons,""Mr Cavusoglu was quoted as saying in the Turkish Hurriyet Daily News,external. He said Mr Trump gave his assurances after President Erdogan reiterated his concern over the continued supply of weapons and armoured vehicles to the YPG. What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? The rapid rise and fall of 'Islamic State' Analysis: The BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington If this is true, it would be a major shift in US policy. The Kurds have proved to be valuable partners in the fight against IS. It is notable that Washington's account of the call does not mention taking away the arms that the Trump administration agreed to give the YPG earlier this year - something Ankara has called for. Turkey feared the weapons would end up in the hands of fighters intent on creating an independent Kurdish state. The Pentagon is likely reassessing its needs in Syria as the fight against IS has waned in recent months. But whatever adjustments are being made, it is clear the US military has no plans to leave the war-torn country. It has been revealed that about 2,000 US troops are now based there - a significant increase since the Obama administration. The White House confirmed the two leaders had spoken by phone and said Mr Trump ""reaffirmed the strategic partnership"" between the US and Turkey. ""Consistent with our previous policy, President Trump also informed President Erdogan of pending adjustments to the military support provided to our partners on the ground in Syria, now that the battle of Raqqa is complete,"" the statement said. ""We are progressing into a stabilisation phase to ensure that Isis [IS] cannot return. The leaders also discussed the purchase of military equipment from the United States."" Pro-Syrian government forces have also driven IS from land it once controlled The SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, has driven IS militants from much of the land it once controlled. The YPG and its political arm, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), denies any direct links with the PKK, whose insurgency has left thousands dead. But Mr Cavusoglu has previously said that every weapon obtained by the YPG constituted ""a threat to Turkey"". The SDF declared victory in Raqqa last month after a four-month battle to retake the city from IS, which had ruled it for three years.

Zimbabwe leader to 're-engage' with world,"This video can not be played President Mnangagwa called Robert Mugabe ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"" Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa has pledged to re-engage the country with the world, following the dramatic departure of Robert Mugabe. In his inauguration speech, Mr Mnangagwa sought to reassure foreign investors to attract badly needed funds to revive Zimbabwe's failing economy. And he also praised Mr Mugabe, calling him Zimbabwe's ""founding father"". Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal as vice-president earlier this month led the ruling party and the army to intervene. Mr Mugabe - who had wanted Grace Mugabe, the then-first lady, to take up the presidency - was forced to announce his resignation on Tuesday, ending 37 years of authoritarian rule. The historic day as it happened The ceremony in pictures Addressing Harare's packed 60,000-capacity National Sports Stadium, the new leader said Zimbabwe was now ""ready and willing for a steady re-engagement with all the nations of the world"". He said ""key choices will have to be made to attract foreign direct investment to tackle high-levels of unemployment while transforming our economy"". This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? And pledging a ""new destiny"" for Zimbabwe, he added: ""Let us humbly appeal to all of us that we let bygones be bygones."" Mr Mnangagwa - who had fled the country earlier this month only to return to a hero's welcome on Wednesday - also said that: Mr Mugabe's land reforms would not be reversed, but white farmers whose land was seized would be compensated ""Acts of corruption must stop"", warning of ""swift justice"" Elections scheduled for 2018 would go ahead as planned He would be ""the president of all citizens, regardless of colour, creed, religion, tribe, totem or political affiliation"" Mr Mnangagwa has for decades been part of Zimbabwe's ruling elite. Despite his pledges, he is still associated by many with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since the country gained independence in 1980. He was the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed. His ruthlessness won him the nickname ""the crocodile"". But Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres, blaming the army. Analysis by BBC Online Africa editor Joseph Winter Emmerson Mnangagwa's speech of reconciliation will be widely welcomed in Zimbabwe, even if his powers of oratory fell well short of those of his predecessor. He reached out to people across the ""ethnic, racial and political"" divides, following years of deep polarisation under Robert Mugabe. However, those Zimbabweans who can recall the days before Mr Mugabe - the minority - will know that when he took power in 1980, he made similar pledges, and was widely praised for it, both at home and around the world. What Zimbabweans really want is for Mr Mnangagwa to breathe new life into their failed economy. Here, he also made all the right noises, recognising the severity of the problem. He even promised compensation to the white farmers whose eviction caused the economy to spiral into free-fall. However, it is not clear where he would get the money from, and he did insist that land reform itself was non-negotiable. He also accepted that he would not be judged on his speeches, but on his actions. All Zimbabweans will agree with that. Will Mnangagwa be different from Mugabe? Mnangagwa: Profile of 'the crocodile' What's next for Zimbabwe? No - and the official reason given was that at 93, the former president needed to rest. But the fact he did not attend is a reminder that this is no ordinary transition, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports, and that, despite Mr Mugabe's official resignation, he was forced out by the military. On Thursday, several reports suggested Mr Mugabe had been granted immunity from prosecution. Local media are reporting that Mr Mnangagwa has offered the Mugabe family ""maximum security and welfare"". The former president ""expressed his good wishes and support for the incoming president,"" the Herald newspaper reports. This video can not be played A pensioner, an activist and a white farmer share hopes for Zimbabwe's future Tuesday's news that Mr Mugabe was stepping down - two days after Zanu-PF sacked him as its leader - sparked wild celebrations. A resignation letter was read out in parliament, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. He had been under pressure since the military took control of the country a week before, seizing the headquarters of the national broadcaster. Ten numbers that will help you understand Zimbabwe Although Mr Mugabe was largely under house arrest for several days, he appeared to be resisting pressure to stand down. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets of Harare to urge him to go. In his letter, he said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Zimbabwe's economy is in a very bad state. It has not recovered fully from crises in the last decade, when rampant inflation grew so bad the country had to abandon its own currency. Now, according to some estimates, 90% of people there are unemployed. This video can not be played Leader of the opposition MDC party, Morgan Tsvangirai, warns of a ""power retention agenda"" Its main industrial index has slumped by 40% since last week's military intervention and the stock market has shed $6bn (Â£4.5bn) in a week. Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Analysts say the market is now correcting itself, optimistic of a change of economic policy under Mr Mnangagwa. However,the International Monetary Fund has warned that Zimbabwe must act quickly to dig its economy out of a holeand access international financial aid. Mugabe 'a father and mentor' to Mnangagwa.

Teen detained for life for killing girlKatie Rough was found with cuts to her neck and chest on a playing field in York.7h7 hours agoYork & North Yorkshire,"Katie was found seriously injured near playing fields in York in January A teenager who killed seven-year-old Katie Rough has been detained for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of five years. The girl, 16, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility in July. Katie was smothered and slashed with a knife at a playing field in Woodthorpe, York, on 9 January. Mr Justice Soole at Leeds Crown Court said it was a ""truly exceptional case"". The defendant, who appeared via video link, sat with her head down clutching a soft toy as Katie's family looked on from the jury box. Sentencing the teenager, the judge said: ""The gravity of the offence of killing a small child speaks for itself. The level of danger to the public is high. ""In the circumstances of your continuing silence, the critical question is whether there is any reliable estimate as to how long that danger will continue."" Her barrister said this was not a ""malicious manoeuvre"", but a coping mechanism, as she was still suffering from post-traumatic stress. A previous hearing was told how the girl, who was 15 at the time of the attack, suffered with severe mental health problems and was convinced people ""were robots"". During the hearing, the court was told how the girl was found standing in a cul-de-sac covered in blood and carrying a Stanley knife as she rang 999 to tell police what she had done. A post-mortem examination showed Katie had two severe cuts to her body, one to her neck and the other to her torso, but died from being smothered. Paul and Alison Rough found their daughter at the same time as police officers reached her In July, after denying murder but admitting manslaughter, the teenager was given a 12-week interim hospital order to allow for further assessment of her mental health before sentencing. The judge was told the girl began suffering from mental health problems more than a year before the killing and that due to her ""irrational beliefs"" she may have been trying to prove that Katie was not a robot. Prosecutors said she had reported delusional thoughts as well as depression, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Nicholas Johnson QC, defending, told the previous hearing his client ""was clearly crying out for help and support"". During the sentencing hearing, the court was told psychiatrists still cannot agree on the exact nature of the girl's mental disturbance. Some have explored whether she was suffering from a depressive disorder and others considered if she has an emerging personality disorder. Mr Johnson explained she had not engaged with the experts and asked the judge to conclude that she was ""unwilling because she was unable"". More than 300 people attended Katie's funeral in February NHS England said it had commissioned an independent inquiry to investigate the treatment the teenager had received prior to the killing. Following sentencing a statement by Katie's family was read outside court by police. It said: ""Our story is about a loving home and family that was torn apart on a day when we lost our daughter. ""Our story goes on into a future where our home feels very empty, but we will keep going for sake of our other children and our grandson. ""Katie's memory will live on in our hearts but also more widely, as a little girl who brought more colour to her world."" Det Ch Insp Andrea Kell, of North Yorkshire Police, said: ""This investigation has been one of the most tragic and challenging I have ever dealt with. ""There are no positive results from cases such as these.""

Pistorius jail term more than doubled,"Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp in 2013 A South African court has increased Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius's jail sentence for killing his girlfriend to 13 years and five months. Prosecutors had argued that the six-year term for murdering Reeva Steenkamp was ""shockingly light"". Ms Steenkamp's parents were ""emotional"" as they watched the ruling at home on TV, a spokeswoman said. ""They feel there has been justice for Reeva. She can now rest in peace,""Tania Koen told Associated Press,external. ""But at the same time, people think this is the end of the road for them... the fact is they still live with Reeva's loss every day,"" Ms Koen said. Oscar Pistorius claimed he shot dead Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day in 2013 after mistaking her for a burglar. The making and unmaking of Oscar Pistorius Reeva Steenkamp, my friend The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein has now given Pistorius the minimum 15 years prescribed for murder in South Africa, less time already served. The lower court had justified the six-year sentence by citing mitigating circumstances such as rehabilitation and remorse. It said they outweighed aggravating factors such as his failure to fire a warning shot. Ms Steenkamp was a model and celebrity Pistorius's brother Carl said on social media,externalthat he was ""shattered. Heartbroken. Gutted"" at the decision. ""We have all suffered incomprehensible loss. The death of Reeva was and still is a great loss for our family too,"" he wrote. Analysis: BBC's Milton Nkosi in Johannesburg There is huge relief here from the National Prosecuting Authority and from Ms Steenkamp's family and friends. Prosecutors are relieved because the earlier sentence of six years for murder could have set a precedent in future trials. The Pistorius family are devastated, as is the athlete himself. The six-year sentence gave an impression of inconsistency. There have been fraud and corruption trials that led to 15-year sentences. It seemed lenient considering that the Paralympian fired four bullets into a bathroom door behind which there was an unarmed and frightened Ms Steenkamp. Oscar Pistorius, 31, was not in court to hear the decision. He was initially given a five-year term for manslaughter in 2014, but was found guilty of murder on appeal in 2015. Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door at his home in the capital Pretoria. Previously, the six-time Paralympic gold medallist had made history by becoming the first amputee sprinter to compete at the Olympics, in 2012 in London, running on prosthetic ""blades"".

Arena attack costs offer 'not enough',"Twenty-two people died after a suicide bomber detonated a device at Manchester Arena on 22 May A government offer to cover costs as a result of the Manchester Arena attack is ""not good enough"", Andy Burnham has said. The Greater Manchester mayor has called on Theresa May to reimburse the city's costs from the 22 May bombing - which the council puts at Â£17m - in full. City officials have been told they will receive Â£12m, with the remaining Â£5m requested subject to review. The government said it was ""absolutely committed"" to providing support. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a device which killed 22 people and injured 512 in the foyer of the venue at an Ariana Grande concert. Manchester City Council wants cash from the government to cover expenses incurred by the authority and emergency services in the wake of the massacre. Mr Burnham said the offer to Manchester contrasted with the government's coverage in full of the costs incurred due to the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

""It was said to us at the time, whatever we need will be there,"" he said. ""It is not the case that we can just be paid the majority, or what the government considers to be reasonable. ""We are not trying it on here - we are not sending in a bill that is inflated in any way. These are the costs."" ""Strong assurance"" has been given by the government that Manchester will receive Â£12m, including Â£3m to be paid immediately. A spokesman said the government ""stands by its commitment to provide all necessary further assistance"". Greater Manchester Combined Authority says it has requested Â£9.8m for policing costs from the Home Office The Department of Health will make Â£1.6m available towards mental health support NHS England has made Â£1m available for post-incident support for those affected Recovery assistance of Â£371,700 will be paid to help Manchester with costs of immediate support for victims and families The government also said it had donated a requested Â£1m towards the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund. Further sums are expected from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority for the victims. Prime Minister Theresa May set out details in a letter to Mr Burnham. Mr Burnham said the letter was ""inconclusive"" and it meant Manchester was ""left with the bill"" six months on. It was not acceptable to be left in this position, he added. Andy Burnham said it was not acceptable that Manchester was ""left with the bill"" six months on from the attack Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese said the response was ""incomplete"". ""Manchester will continue to push to ensure that those costs are met in full so there is no knock-on effect on our budget for public services,"" he said. Greater Manchester is also seeking Â£5m to cover the costs of the inquests,which were adjourned earlierwhile the investigation continues.

Irish PM hopes talks can avert election,"Leo Varadkar said that if an election happened ""it would be better to have it done before Christmas"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said he hopes talks can resolve a crisis that threatens to collapse the Irish government. Thecrisis was sparked when the main opposition party, Fianna FÃ¡il, tabled a motion of no confidence in the deputy prime minister. The motion against Frances Fitzgerald comes over her handling of a police whistleblower controversy. Mr Varadkar said he did not want a general election. Irish government 'new politics' era survives first year Fianna FÃ¡il agrees to back minority Fine Gael government Audit reveals Garda irregularities Timeline: Controversies dog Garda However, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) added that he will continue to back Ms Fitzgerald and that if an election was to happen ""it would be better to have it done before Christmas"". The no confidence motion threatens the confidence-and-supply arrangement in which the Fine Gael-led minority government is supported by Fianna FÃ¡il. Fianna FÃ¡il agreed after the 2016 general election not to vote against the minority governmentin confidence motions and to support it for three budgets, two of which are now past. The two parties are now at loggerheads over the position of Ms Fitzgerald. Fine Gael passed a motion to support her at an emergency party meeting on Thursday night. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin said the situation would be resolved if Ms Fitzgerald resigned Fianna FÃ¡il front bench members lodged the no confidence motion for debate next Tuesday. Mr Varadkar said that talks between himself and Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin on Friday had ""cleared the air somewhat"". He said that Fianna FÃ¡il motion was still going ahead but that there is still ""an opportunity over the next couple of days to resolve it"". ""I don't believe that the decapitation of the tÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister), based on trumped-up charges, is fair,"" he told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ. ""So let's all calm down a bit, let's pause for reflection, let's perhaps withdraw these motions and allow the Charleton Tribunal, starting on 8 January, to do the work that we set it up to do."" Frances Fitzgerald was Irish minister for justice during a police whistleblower controversy Earlier on Friday, Mr Martin said that his party did not want an election but that the issue could be resolved if Ms Fitzgerald resigned. Ms Fitzgerald has faced questions in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) about what she knew about what lawyers were going to put to a whistleblower at a commission of enquiry. In particular, she has been questioned over her account of an email she received about the legal strategy of the former Garda (police) commissioner in the case of Sgt Maurice McCabe. Ms Fitzgerald has recently admitted that she was made aware a year earlier than she had previously stated, that lawyers for the Garda were going to attempt to discredit Sgt McCabe. The email was initially sent to Ms Fitzgerald in May 2015, but she told the DÃ¡il earlier this week that she could not remember reading it. Sinn FÃ©in, the country's third largest party,had tabled their own no confidence motion against Ms Fitzgerald on Thursday.

Argentina promises truth on missing sub,"This video can not be played Families of the crew say relatives aren't being told anything Argentine President Mauricio Macri has promised that an inquiry into the disappearance of a navy submarine will ""know the truth"" of what happened. Mr Macri urged Argentines not to look for people to blame until all the facts were known. He said the search for the ARA San Juan and its 44 crew would continue. Hopes have faded since the navy said an event ""consistent with an explosion"" was detected near the sub's last-known location. Announcing the official inquiry at navy headquarters in Buenos Aires, Mr Macri said the 34-year-old submarine had recently undergone a refit and was ""in perfect condition"". ""We should not venture into looking for people to blame,"" he told a news conference. ""This will require a serious, deep investigation that reveals certainties about why we are witnessing what happened. My commitment is with the truth."" President Mauricio Macri, centre, announced the official inquiry at navy headquarters Earlier, navy spokesman Capt Enrique Baldi said there was still no trace of the submarine, which vanished nine days ago. More than 12 countries are involved in the search. Mr Baldi said search teams had access to ""the best technology available"" via the US navy. He added: ""We have the best naval, air and sensor resources available in the area, all focused on searching for the submarine. We are still looking and no country is saying at the moment when they will stop. Logically it's time-limited but no-one is speaking about that at the moment."" The ARA San Juan disappeared last Wednesday Some of the crew's relatives reacted with anger to the news on Thursday that an explosion had been detected. ""They manipulated us! They lied to us!"" said ItatÃ­ LeguizamÃ³n, whose husband was on board. Waiting for news of their loved ones Who are the missing crew? She and others have raised questions about the state of repair the submarine was in. Some said lack of investment and corruption in the armed forces had made the submarine unsafe. Argentine newspaper La NaciÃ³n reports that there is speculation that navy chief Marcelo Eduardo HipÃ³lito Srur may resign, but officials have said this is not imminent. On Wednesday the navy received a US report of a loud noise - called a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" - detected hours after the submarine went missing. The navy knew only the location of the suspected explosion, not its cause, Captain Baldi said, and search efforts would be concentrated in the area. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported the breakdown, which was described as a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. According to Capt Baldi, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base once more after reporting the problem. What happens when a submarine vanishes Grief and anger dominate Argentine media In the message, he reportedly said that the problem had been adequately fixed and that the sub would submerge and proceed towards Mar del Plata. The last contact was made at 07:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday 15 November. It is not known what happened to the sub after that contact. Argentine navy protocol stipulates that in peace time, submarines make contact with the base twice a day. When the submarine failed to call in, the Argentine navy began its search. There are 44 crew on board the submarine, which is under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew are men but there is also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old is the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. Her family says it was Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk's dream to become a submariner Nicknamed ""the queen of the sea"" by her father, she comes from OberÃ¡, a city in northern Argentina. Despite having been born and raised far inland, her relatives say that ""she was born to be a submariner"", citing her ""will of steel"" and a passion for her job. The rest of the crew is made up of submariners of varying ages and experience. The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, has been on the ARA San Juan for 11 years, local media reported. Accidents involving submarines are rare. Here are some of the most serious: All 70 crew aboard China'sGreat WallMing-class submarine suffocated in 2003 when a diesel engine malfunctioned, consuming the vessel's oxygen supply Russia'sKursksubmarine sank in the Barents Sea in 2000 aftera torpedo exploded during an exercise, killing all 118 on board, including 23 who survived the blast but died due to a lack of oxygen TheUSS Scorpionsank in the Atlantic in 1968, possibly because a torpedo exploded, killing the 99 crew TheUSS Threshersank during diving tests in 1963, killing all 129 on board - the biggest submarine death toll in history Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Russia, Peru, South Africa, Uruguay and the UK are among the countries that have sent either ships or planes to help with the search. The US navy has deployed two underwater vehicles which use sonar to create images of the sea floor. A Nasa research aircraft has also flown over the search area but failed to spot anything.

Pupils asked: 'Would you live next to black person?',"Naomi Davis said her daughter Chayse felt ""singled out"" in the diversity lesson A school asked pupils to rank potential neighbours based on who they would most like to live next to - from a list which included ""a black person"" and a ""gay man"". Parent Naomi Davis complained to Bristol Free School when daughter Chayse told her about the exercise. She said the exercise had been designed to do ""something positive"" but ""hadn't achieved its objective"". The school said it would ""review the materials as a result of her concerns"". It said the citizenship and diversity lesson was part of a ""unit of work aimed at heightening students' understanding of the advantages of living in a diverse and inclusive society"". When her 11-year-old daughter came home, Ms Davis said, she told her mum she wanted ""to show you something and I don't think it's going to make you happy"". She then showed her a photo she had taken of the worksheet. It invited pupils to rank potential neighbours, including: Someone with a learning difficulty A vegetarian A guitarist in a band A teenage parent A hoody wearer Ms Davis said her daughter ""did not understand the context of why a black person would be on that list"". Bristol Free School said the lesson was about citizenship and diversity Although she understood why teachers had given the ""much-needed"" piece of work, she said it had made Chayse feel ""singled out"". ""That's why I went back to the school - because they are trying to do a positive piece of work but this had the reverse effect,"" she said. Ms Davis praised the school for its ""extremely speedy response"" and said they were very ""apologetic"". She added she ""wanted to make it clear"" that the ""main issue"" with the list was the comparison between what a black person or a disabled person ""might go through"" to a vegetarian. Ms Davis said the school had told her it was also going to work with parents from black, Asian and other ethic groups to help devise its worksheets.

Model killer 'monster' jailed for attacksMark Dixie was jailed in 2008 for raping and murdering teenage model Sally Anne Bowman.6h6 hours agoLondon,"Eighteen-year-old Sally Anne Bowman was murdered in south London in 2005 The murderer of model Sally Anne Bowman has been given two further life sentences for raping two other women. Mark Dixie, now 47, was jailed for at least 34 years in 2008 for repeatedly stabbing 18-year-old Miss Bowman, before raping her as she lay dead or dying in south London in 2005. Dixie confessed to detectives in 2015 he was responsible for more attacks, including one when he was a teenager. Senior investigating officer Chris Le Pere described Dixie as ""a monster"". Outside court Mr Le Pere said although the Metropolitan Police had no evidence to link the former pub chef to any other rapes or murders, ""with my experience, I would find it very surprising if he had not done something extremely serious we don't know about"". Mark Dixie was jailed for a minimum of 34 years in 2008 Friday's sentencing hearing was told Dixie targeted his first victim when he was 16 while she was sitting in her own car in an isolated south London car park. He then tied her up inside and set the vehicle on fire. The victim said he ""seemed delighted in her evident fear"" as she became hysterical, fearing she was going to die. She managed to free herself and raised the alarm, Southwark Crown Court was told in July. However, she was left ""utterly petrified"", when she received two chilling phone calls from her attacker in the following days, the court was told. In a victim impact statement, she said: ""I didn't seek counselling, I had survived, I was in one piece. I just wanted to get on with life."" The second attack, in 2002, saw him bludgeon a woman with a chef's steel, normally used to sharpen kitchen knives, before telling her ""I'm going to kill you"" and molesting her. She managed to escape when Dixie was interrupted by a man who heard her screams. The court heard Dixie took his victim's mobile phone during the attack and later boasted to her ex-boyfriend in a call: ""I've battered her. I've battered her. I've left her by the railway."" The Sally Anne Bowman murder In the early hours of 25 September 2005, Sally Anne Bowman, an 18-year-old hairdresser and model, was murdered near her home in Croydon, south London. Returning from a night out, she was stabbed in the neck and stomach and then raped as she lay dead or dying. She had been dropped off by her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sproston who police arrested but later released without charge. The murder remained unsolved until June 2006, when local man Mark Dixie was arrested following a fight at the pub where he worked as a chef. DNA taken from a swab linked him to the case and he was charged with the murder. During the Old Bailey trial Dixie, admitted to having sex with Miss Bowman after finding her on the ground outside her home, but denied murdering her. He was found guilty of Miss Bowman's murder and was sentenced to life in jail with a minimum term of 34 years. Sally Anne Bowman's body was found by a skip in Croydon Father-of-three Dixie admitted charges of rape, indecent assault and grievous bodily harm during a hearing on 26 July. In January 2015 the killer, who had pleaded not guilty throughout his first trial, finally confessed to the murder. Dixie wrote to police saying he wanted to ""tell the truth"" about what happened to Miss Bowman, before telling detectives he had killed her in a frenzied attack that included biting her after she fled from her boyfriend's car in a row.

Model killer 'monster' jailed for attacks,"Eighteen-year-old Sally Anne Bowman was murdered in south London in 2005 The murderer of model Sally Anne Bowman has been given two further life sentences for raping two other women. Mark Dixie, now 47, was jailed for at least 34 years in 2008 for repeatedly stabbing 18-year-old Miss Bowman, before raping her as she lay dead or dying in south London in 2005. Dixie confessed to detectives in 2015 he was responsible for more attacks, including one when he was a teenager. Senior investigating officer Chris Le Pere described Dixie as ""a monster"". Outside court Mr Le Pere said although the Metropolitan Police had no evidence to link the former pub chef to any other rapes or murders, ""with my experience, I would find it very surprising if he had not done something extremely serious we don't know about"". Mark Dixie was jailed for a minimum of 34 years in 2008 Friday's sentencing hearing was told Dixie targeted his first victim when he was 16 while she was sitting in her own car in an isolated south London car park. He then tied her up inside and set the vehicle on fire. The victim said he ""seemed delighted in her evident fear"" as she became hysterical, fearing she was going to die. She managed to free herself and raised the alarm, Southwark Crown Court was told in July. However, she was left ""utterly petrified"", when she received two chilling phone calls from her attacker in the following days, the court was told. In a victim impact statement, she said: ""I didn't seek counselling, I had survived, I was in one piece. I just wanted to get on with life."" The second attack, in 2002, saw him bludgeon a woman with a chef's steel, normally used to sharpen kitchen knives, before telling her ""I'm going to kill you"" and molesting her. She managed to escape when Dixie was interrupted by a man who heard her screams. The court heard Dixie took his victim's mobile phone during the attack and later boasted to her ex-boyfriend in a call: ""I've battered her. I've battered her. I've left her by the railway."" The Sally Anne Bowman murder In the early hours of 25 September 2005, Sally Anne Bowman, an 18-year-old hairdresser and model, was murdered near her home in Croydon, south London. Returning from a night out, she was stabbed in the neck and stomach and then raped as she lay dead or dying. She had been dropped off by her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sproston who police arrested but later released without charge. The murder remained unsolved until June 2006, when local man Mark Dixie was arrested following a fight at the pub where he worked as a chef. DNA taken from a swab linked him to the case and he was charged with the murder. During the Old Bailey trial Dixie, admitted to having sex with Miss Bowman after finding her on the ground outside her home, but denied murdering her. He was found guilty of Miss Bowman's murder and was sentenced to life in jail with a minimum term of 34 years. Sally Anne Bowman's body was found by a skip in Croydon Father-of-three Dixie admitted charges of rape, indecent assault and grievous bodily harm during a hearing on 26 July. In January 2015 the killer, who had pleaded not guilty throughout his first trial, finally confessed to the murder. Dixie wrote to police saying he wanted to ""tell the truth"" about what happened to Miss Bowman, before telling detectives he had killed her in a frenzied attack that included biting her after she fled from her boyfriend's car in a row. Later, while being interviewed by police, he said he had not raped or murdered anybody before. Mark Dixie had previously worked as a pub chef However, he went on to admit two further attacks after he was told by the investigating officer: ""That's not entirely true.

President vows to serve all Zimbabweans,"This video can not be played President Mnangagwa called Robert Mugabe ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"" Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa has addressed a packed stadium, vowing to serve all citizens. He said he felt ""deeply humbled"" to take the role. And he said he was ""not oblivious to the many Zimbabweans from across the political and racial divide who have helped make this day."" He paid tribute to his predecessor Robert Mugabe - to muted applause - calling him ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"". Mr Mugabe left office dramatically this week after 37 years of authoritarian rule. His departure followed a power struggle in which Mr Mnangagwa was sacked as vice president to pave the way for Grace Mugabe, the then-first lady, to take up the presidency. Mr Mnangagwa fled the country but returned to a hero's welcome and on Friday struck a conciliatory tone. ""The task at hand is that of rebuilding our country,"" he said. ""I am required to serve our country as the president of all citizens regardless of colour, creed, religion, tribe, totem or political affiliation."" Follow live updates from a historic day The ceremony in pictures Although Mr Mnangagwa has unseated Zimbabwe's long-time ruler, he is still associated by many with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since the country gained independence in 1980. He was the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed. But he has denied any role in the massacres, blaming the army. Tens of thousands of people packed the National Sports Stadium in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, to witness the inauguration. Pop singer Jah Prayzer provided the entertainment and, as people in the crowd danced, the atmosphere was closer to that of a concert. Dignitaries, including leaders from various African countries, filed in to cheers. Opposition leaders Morgan Tsvangirai and Joice Mujuru - who both had their sights on the presidency at various times - were there. Will Mnangagwa be different from Mugabe? Mnangagwa: Profile of 'the crocodile' What's next for Zimbabwe? Mr Mnangagwa was led in the oath of office by Chief Justice Luke Malaba, saying he would ""be faithful to Zimbabwe"", ""protect and promote the rights and people of Zimbabwe"" and discharge his duties to the best of his abilities. Mr Mnangagwa was accompanied by his wife Auxilia and gave her a kiss after the green presidential sash was placed around his neck. No - and the official reason given was that at 93, the former president needed to rest. But the fact he is not attending is a reminder that this is no ordinary transition, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports, and that despite Mr Mugabe's official resignation he was forced out by the military. On Thursday, several reports suggested Mr Mugabe had been granted immunity from prosecution. President Mugabe was accused of preparing the presidency for his wife Grace Local media are reporting that Mr Mnangagwa has offered the Mugabe family ""maximum security and welfare"". The former president ""expressed his good wishes and support for the incoming president,"" the Herald newspaper reports. The news on Tuesday that Mr Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations. It came in the form of a letter read out in parliament, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. He had been under pressure since the military took control of the country a week before, seizing the headquarters of the national broadcaster. Although Mr Mugabe was largely under house arrest for several days, he appeared to be resisting pressure to stand down. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets of Harare to urge him to go. The demonstration was led by veterans of the country's war of independence, who last year turned against him. This video can not be played A pensioner, an activist and a white farmer share hopes for Zimbabwe's future On Sunday, Zanu-PF sacked Mr Mugabe as its leader. Two days later, he resigned as president. In his letter, he said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Zimbabwe's economy is in a very bad state. It has not recovered fully from crises in the last decade, when rampant inflation grew so bad the country had to abandon its own currency. Now, according to some estimates, 90% of people there are unemployed. Its main industrial index has slumped by 40% since last week's military intervention and the stock market has shed $6bn (Â£4.5bn) in a week. Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Ten numbers that will help you understand what's going on Analysts say the market is now correcting itself, optimistic of a change of economic policy under Mr Mnangagwa. However,the International Monetary Fund has warned that Zimbabwe must act quickly to dig its economy out of a holeand access international financial aid. In his speech, Mr Mnangagwa said he would base a new economic policy on agriculture and foreign direct investment. He has pledged to create jobs. He also said the country's land reform programme would not be reversed, but pledged to compensate farmers for the land that was confiscated from them. The seizure of land from white farmers is seen as a key factor in the country's economic meltdown. On Thursday, Zimbabwe's main opposition MDC party called for deep-rooted political reform to dismantle the repressive apparatus that sustained Mr Mugabe's regime. This video can not be played Leader of the opposition MDC party, Morgan Tsvangirai, warns of a ""power retention agenda"" MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai said the ""culture of violence"" and ""culture of corruption"" had to be changed after ""after so many years of Zanu-PF misrule"". It is unclear whether Zanu-PF will govern alone ahead of scheduled elections next year, or whether a coalition government of national unity that includes opposition groups will be formed. Mr Mnangagwa confirmed in his speech that elections would be held as planned. What next for Zimbabwe?

Navy vows to continue missing sub search,"This video can not be played Families of the crew say relatives aren't being told anything Argentine President Mauricio Macri has promised that an inquiry into the disappearance of a navy submarine will ""know the truth"" of what happened. Mr Macri urged Argentines not to look for people to blame until all the facts were known. He said the search for the ARA San Juan and its 44 crew would continue. Hopes have faded since the navy said an event ""consistent with an explosion"" was detected near the sub's last-known location. Announcing the official inquiry at navy headquarters in Buenos Aires, Mr Macri said the 34-year-old submarine had recently undergone a refit and was ""in perfect condition"". ""We should not venture into looking for people to blame,"" he told a news conference. ""This will require a serious, deep investigation that reveals certainties about why we are witnessing what happened. My commitment is with the truth."" President Mauricio Macri, centre, announced the official inquiry at navy headquarters Earlier, navy spokesman Capt Enrique Baldi said there was still no trace of the submarine, which vanished nine days ago. More than 12 countries are involved in the search. Mr Baldi said search teams had access to ""the best technology available"" via the US navy. He added: ""We have the best naval, air and sensor resources available in the area, all focused on searching for the submarine. We are still looking and no country is saying at the moment when they will stop. Logically it's time-limited but no-one is speaking about that at the moment."" The ARA San Juan disappeared last Wednesday Some of the crew's relatives reacted with anger to the news on Thursday that an explosion had been detected. ""They manipulated us! They lied to us!"" said ItatÃ­ LeguizamÃ³n, whose husband was on board. Waiting for news of their loved ones Who are the missing crew? She and others have raised questions about the state of repair the submarine was in. Some said lack of investment and corruption in the armed forces had made the submarine unsafe. Argentine newspaper La NaciÃ³n reports that there is speculation that navy chief Marcelo Eduardo HipÃ³lito Srur may resign, but officials have said this is not imminent. On Wednesday the navy received a US report of a loud noise - called a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" - detected hours after the submarine went missing. The navy knew only the location of the suspected explosion, not its cause, Captain Baldi said, and search efforts would be concentrated in the area. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported the breakdown, which was described as a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. According to Capt Baldi, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base once more after reporting the problem. What happens when a submarine vanishes Grief and anger dominate Argentine media In the message, he reportedly said that the problem had been adequately fixed and that the sub would submerge and proceed towards Mar del Plata. The last contact was made at 07:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday 15 November. It is not known what happened to the sub after that contact. Argentine navy protocol stipulates that in peace time, submarines make contact with the base twice a day. When the submarine failed to call in, the Argentine navy began its search. There are 44 crew on board the submarine, which is under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew are men but there is also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old is the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. Her family says it was Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk's dream to become a submariner Nicknamed ""the queen of the sea"" by her father, she comes from OberÃ¡, a city in northern Argentina. Despite having been born and raised far inland, her relatives say that ""she was born to be a submariner"", citing her ""will of steel"" and a passion for her job. The rest of the crew is made up of submariners of varying ages and experience. The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, has been on the ARA San Juan for 11 years, local media reported. Accidents involving submarines are rare. Here are some of the most serious: All 70 crew aboard China'sGreat WallMing-class submarine suffocated in 2003 when a diesel engine malfunctioned, consuming the vessel's oxygen supply Russia'sKursksubmarine sank in the Barents Sea in 2000 aftera torpedo exploded during an exercise, killing all 118 on board, including 23 who survived the blast but died due to a lack of oxygen TheUSS Scorpionsank in the Atlantic in 1968, possibly because a torpedo exploded, killing the 99 crew TheUSS Threshersank during diving tests in 1963, killing all 129 on board - the biggest submarine death toll in history Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Russia, Peru, South Africa, Uruguay and the UK are among the countries that have sent either ships or planes to help with the search. The US navy has deployed two underwater vehicles which use sonar to create images of the sea floor. A Nasa research aircraft has also flown over the search area but failed to spot anything.

More than 230 killed in Egyptian mosque,"The militants targeted a mosque near al-Arish Militants have launched a bomb and gun attack on a mosque in Egypt's North Sinai province, killing 235 people, state media say. The al-Rawda mosque in the town of Bir al-Abed was targeted during Friday prayers. It is the deadliest attack of its kind since an Islamist insurgency in the peninsula was stepped up in 2013. Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi vowed to respond with ""brute force"" after talks with security officials. No group has yet claimed the attack, but militants affiliated with so-called Islamic State (IS) have been responsible for scores of deadly attacks in the province. This video can not be played Ambulances rushed to the scene of the attack They usually target security forces and Christian churches, and the bloody attack on a mosque associated with Sufi Muslims has shocked Egypt. Witnesses said dozens of gunmen arrived in off-road vehicles and bombed the packed mosque before opening fire on worshippers as they tried to flee. The assailants are reported to have set parked vehicles on fire in the vicinity to block off access to the mosque. Pictures from the scene show rows of bloodied victims inside the mosque. At least 100 people were wounded, reports say, overwhelming hospitals. ""They were shooting at people as they left the mosque,"" a local resident who had relatives there told Reuters news agency. ""They were shooting at the ambulances too."" It is the deadliest militant attack in modern Egyptian history. Bir al-Abed is about 130 miles (211km) from Cairo. Locals are quoted as saying that followers of Sufism, a mystical branch of Sunni Islam, regularly gathered at the mosque. Although Sufis are widely accepted across much of the Muslim world, some jihadist groups, including IS, see them as heretics. Who are Egypt's militant groups? What is Sufism? The head of IS's religious police in Sinai said last December that Sufis who did not ""repent"" would be killed, after the group beheaded two elderly men reported to be Sufi clerics. The victim of the mosque attack also included military conscripts. Militant Islamists have been waging an insurgency on the Sinai peninsula in recent years, stepping up attacks after Egypt's military overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi after mass anti-government protests in July 2013. Hundreds of police, soldiers and civilians have been killed since then, mostly in attacks carried out by Sinai Province group, which is affiliated to IS. In September,at least 18 policemen were killed when the group attacked a convoy near al-Arish. Sinai Province has also carried out deadly attacks against Egypt's Coptic Christian minority elsewhere in the country, and said it bombed a Russian plane carrying tourists in Sinai in 2015, killing 224 people on board. Egypt disputes desert shootout reports Sinai plane crash: What we know The IS affiliate in Sinai It has been operating mainly in North Sinai, which has been under a state of emergency since October 2014, when 33 security personnel were killed in an attack claimed by the group. Sinai Province is thought to want to take control of the Sinai Peninsula in order to turn it into an Islamist province run by IS. By Sally Nabil, BBC News, Cairo Islamist militants have been operating in northern Sinai for several years, mainly targeting security forces. But this is the first time that worshippers inside a mosque have been targeted. The number of victims is unprecedented for an attack of this type. Northern Sinai has been living under a media blackout over the past few years. No media organisations have been allowed to go there, including state-sponsored ones. The frequency of attacks raises doubts about the effectiveness of military operations. While the army releases statements every now and then, claiming victory in some parts of Sinai, there seems to be no end in sight to the ongoing battle between the army and militants. The injured were brought to hospitals far away, including in Cairo President Sisi has declared three days of mourning. The military is reported to have already conducted air strikes in mountains around Bir al-Abed.

"President vows to serve all ZimbabweansEmmerson Mnangagwa, the former vice president, returned from exile to take up office.5h5 hours agoAfrica","This video can not be played President Mnangagwa called Robert Mugabe ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"" Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa has addressed a packed stadium, vowing to serve all citizens. He said he felt ""deeply humbled"" to take the role. And he said he was ""not oblivious to the many Zimbabweans from across the political and racial divide who have helped make this day."" He paid tribute to his predecessor Robert Mugabe - to muted applause - calling him ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"". Mr Mugabe left office dramatically this week after 37 years of authoritarian rule. His departure followed a power struggle in which Mr Mnangagwa was sacked as vice president to pave the way for Grace Mugabe, the then-first lady, to take up the presidency. Mr Mnangagwa fled the country but returned to a hero's welcome and on Friday struck a conciliatory tone. ""The task at hand is that of rebuilding our country,"" he said. ""I am required to serve our country as the president of all citizens regardless of colour, creed, religion, tribe, totem or political affiliation."" Follow live updates from a historic day The ceremony in pictures Although Mr Mnangagwa has unseated Zimbabwe's long-time ruler, he is still associated by many with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since the country gained independence in 1980. He was the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed. But he has denied any role in the massacres, blaming the army. Tens of thousands of people packed the National Sports Stadium in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, to witness the inauguration. Pop singer Jah Prayzer provided the entertainment and, as people in the crowd danced, the atmosphere was closer to that of a concert. Dignitaries, including leaders from various African countries, filed in to cheers. Opposition leaders Morgan Tsvangirai and Joice Mujuru - who both had their sights on the presidency at various times - were there. Will Mnangagwa be different from Mugabe? Mnangagwa: Profile of 'the crocodile' What's next for Zimbabwe? Mr Mnangagwa was led in the oath of office by Chief Justice Luke Malaba, saying he would ""be faithful to Zimbabwe"", ""protect and promote the rights and people of Zimbabwe"" and discharge his duties to the best of his abilities. Mr Mnangagwa was accompanied by his wife Auxilia and gave her a kiss after the green presidential sash was placed around his neck. No - and the official reason given was that at 93, the former president needed to rest. But the fact he is not attending is a reminder that this is no ordinary transition, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports, and that despite Mr Mugabe's official resignation he was forced out by the military. On Thursday, several reports suggested Mr Mugabe had been granted immunity from prosecution. President Mugabe was accused of preparing the presidency for his wife Grace Local media are reporting that Mr Mnangagwa has offered the Mugabe family ""maximum security and welfare"". The former president ""expressed his good wishes and support for the incoming president,"" the Herald newspaper reports. The news on Tuesday that Mr Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations. It came in the form of a letter read out in parliament, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. He had been under pressure since the military took control of the country a week before, seizing the headquarters of the national broadcaster. Although Mr Mugabe was largely under house arrest for several days, he appeared to be resisting pressure to stand down. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets of Harare to urge him to go. The demonstration was led by veterans of the country's war of independence, who last year turned against him. This video can not be played A pensioner, an activist and a white farmer share hopes for Zimbabwe's future On Sunday, Zanu-PF sacked Mr Mugabe as its leader. Two days later, he resigned as president. In his letter, he said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Zimbabwe's economy is in a very bad state. It has not recovered fully from crises in the last decade, when rampant inflation grew so bad the country had to abandon its own currency. Now, according to some estimates, 90% of people there are unemployed. Its main industrial index has slumped by 40% since last week's military intervention and the stock market has shed $6bn (Â£4.5bn) in a week. Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Ten numbers that will help you understand what's going on Analysts say the market is now correcting itself, optimistic of a change of economic policy under Mr Mnangagwa. However,the International Monetary Fund has warned that Zimbabwe must act quickly to dig its economy out of a holeand access international financial aid. In his speech, Mr Mnangagwa said he would base a new economic policy on agriculture and foreign direct investment. He has pledged to create jobs. He also said the country's land reform programme would not be reversed, but pledged to compensate farmers for the land that was confiscated from them. The seizure of land from white farmers is seen as a key factor in the country's economic meltdown. On Thursday, Zimbabwe's main opposition MDC party called for deep-rooted political reform to dismantle the repressive apparatus that sustained Mr Mugabe's regime. This video can not be played Leader of the opposition MDC party, Morgan Tsvangirai, warns of a ""power retention agenda"" MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai said the ""culture of violence"" and ""culture of corruption"" had to be changed after ""after so many years of Zanu-PF misrule"". It is unclear whether Zanu-PF will govern alone ahead of scheduled elections next year, or whether a coalition government of national unity that includes opposition groups will be formed. Mr Mnangagwa confirmed in his speech that elections would be held as planned. What next for Zimbabwe?

Teen detained for life for killing girl,"Katie was found seriously injured near playing fields in York in January A teenager who killed seven-year-old Katie Rough has been detained for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of five years. The girl, 16, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility in July. Katie was smothered and slashed with a knife at a playing field in Woodthorpe, York, on 9 January. Mr Justice Soole at Leeds Crown Court said it was a ""truly exceptional case"". The defendant, who appeared via video link, sat with her head down clutching a soft toy as Katie's family looked on from the jury box. Sentencing the teenager, the judge said: ""The gravity of the offence of killing a small child speaks for itself. The level of danger to the public is high. ""In the circumstances of your continuing silence, the critical question is whether there is any reliable estimate as to how long that danger will continue."" Her barrister said this was not a ""malicious manoeuvre"", but a coping mechanism, as she was still suffering from post-traumatic stress. A previous hearing was told how the girl, who was 15 at the time of the attack, suffered with severe mental health problems and was convinced people ""were robots"". During the hearing, the court was told how the girl was found standing in a cul-de-sac covered in blood and carrying a Stanley knife as she rang 999 to tell police what she had done. A post-mortem examination showed Katie had two severe cuts to her body, one to her neck and the other to her torso, but died from being smothered. Paul and Alison Rough found their daughter at the same time as police officers reached her In July, after denying murder but admitting manslaughter, the teenager was given a 12-week interim hospital order to allow for further assessment of her mental health before sentencing. The judge was told the girl began suffering from mental health problems more than a year before the killing and that due to her ""irrational beliefs"" she may have been trying to prove that Katie was not a robot. Prosecutors said she had reported delusional thoughts as well as depression, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Nicholas Johnson QC, defending, told the previous hearing his client ""was clearly crying out for help and support"". During the sentencing hearing, the court was told psychiatrists still cannot agree on the exact nature of the girl's mental disturbance. Some have explored whether she was suffering from a depressive disorder and others considered if she has an emerging personality disorder. Mr Johnson explained she had not engaged with the experts and asked the judge to conclude that she was ""unwilling because she was unable"". More than 300 people attended Katie's funeral in February NHS England said it had commissioned an independent inquiry to investigate the treatment the teenager had received prior to the killing. Following sentencing a statement by Katie's family was read outside court by police. It said: ""Our story is about a loving home and family that was torn apart on a day when we lost our daughter. ""Our story goes on into a future where our home feels very empty, but we will keep going for sake of our other children and our grandson. ""Katie's memory will live on in our hearts but also more widely, as a little girl who brought more colour to her world."" Det Ch Insp Andrea Kell, of North Yorkshire Police, said: ""This investigation has been one of the most tragic and challenging I have ever dealt with. ""There are no positive results from cases such as these.""

Cable 'too good' for Bad Sex book award,"Sir Vince's debut novel was published in September Sir Vince Cable won't be considered for 2017's Bad Sex in Fiction Award - because his writing isn't bad enough. The Literary Review, which organises the prize, said his thriller Open Arms had received ""many"" nominations but wasn't ultimately shortlisted. That means he will not compete against the likes of Wilbur Smith's War Cry, one of six nominees announced so far. In it a male character says he wants to explore his lover ""like Dr Livingstone and Mr Stanley exploring Africa"". The same passage from Smith's novel, co-written with David Churchill, refers to nipples ""standing up as proudly as little guardsmen on parade"". Another shortlisted work - The Future Won't Be Long by Turkish-American author Jarett Kobek - likens sexual intercourse to a ""pulsing wave"", a ""holy burst"" and a ""congress of wonder"". A third nominee - The Seventh Function of Language by France's Laurent Binet - features a man wooing a woman with the words: ""Let's construct an assemblage."" War Cry is part of Wilbur Smith's series of Courtney novels Their love-making continues ""until they reach the point of impact, when the two desiring machines collide in an atomic explosion"". In her debut novel Mother of Darkness, Venetia Welby writes about a character called Tera who ""moans in colours"" as her lover approaches. ""It was as if a Catherine Wheel had been ignited in my solar plexus,"" muses a character in another passage from the book singled out for consideration. Organisers say the purpose of the prize is ""to draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction"". The award, whose recent winners include Morrissey'sdebut novel List of the Lost, does not cover pornographic or expressly erotic literature. The winner of the prize,which last year wentto Italian author Erri De Luca, will be announced in central London on 30 November. The venue? The Naval and Military Club - also known as the In & Out.

Mr Johnson explained she had not engaged with the experts and asked the judge to conclude that she was ""unwilling because she was unable"". More than 300 people attended Katie's funeral in February NHS England said it had commissioned an independent inquiry to investigate the treatment the teenager had received prior to the killing. Following sentencing a statement by Katie's family was read outside court by police. It said: ""Our story is about a loving home and family that was torn apart on a day when we lost our daughter. ""Our story goes on into a future where our home feels very empty, but we will keep going for sake of our other children and our grandson. ""Katie's memory will live on in our hearts but also more widely, as a little girl who brought more colour to her world."" Det Ch Insp Andrea Kell, of North Yorkshire Police, said: ""This investigation has been one of the most tragic and challenging I have ever dealt with.

Who are Sinai militant groups?,"IS' Sinai Province, the most prominent jihadist group, posted video showcasing their weapons More than 200 people have died in an unprecedented attack targeting a Sunni mosque in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula during Friday prayers, highlighting the alarming threat posed by jihadist militants in the region. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, the deadliest of its kind in the country. So-called Islamic State (IS) is the most prominent and violent of the militant groups in Sinai, with a record of targeting civilians in that area and in mainland Egypt. Other groups active in the country are mostly aligned with IS's arch jihadist rival, al-Qaeda. Sinai Province convoy IS's Sinai affiliate, Sinai Province, has claimed responsibility for many deadly attacks, mostly targeting the army in Sinai. It also claimed the downing of a Russian airliner in October 2015. Formerly known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, the group first appeared in September 2011 and rebranded itself with an IS pledge of allegiance in November 2014. The group generally targets Egyptian security forces in northern Sinai, but has also claimed an attack on a tourist site in southern Sinai in April. In the first part of the year IS stepped up its rhetoric and attacks against Christians in Sinai and elsewhere in Egypt, claiming two deadly attacks on churches in Tanta and Alexandria on 9 April. IS started to scale up its attacks in Sinai since September, as it started losing territory in Iraq and Syria. On 24 November, IS boasted about attacks it had carried out earlier in the week targeting policemen in western Arish, the area of the attacked mosque. In addition to its attacks on Christians, IS has adopted a threatening tone against Sufi Muslims, whom it considers to be heretics. The head of IS's religious police in Sinai had previously said that Sufis who did not ""repent"" would be killed. IS has beheaded a number of Sufi men whom it accused of ""sorcery"". Screen grab from the video posted by Jund al-Islam The propaganda and rhetoric of this low-profile group suggests alignment with al-Qaeda. Its rivalry with IS in Sinai surfaced in November when Jund al-Islam issued a threat to IS militants. In an audio message released on 11 November, Jund al-Islam claimed responsibility for an October attack on IS militants in Sinai, and vowed to crush the rival group ""for committing crimes against Muslims"" in the peninsula. A day later, Jund al-Islam issued another statement condemning the 9 November deadly attack on lorry drivers in northern Sinai, as well as blaming IS and the Egyptian government for the deaths. In both its recent messages, Jund al-Islam stressed that it did not target ""innocent Muslims"". Jund al-Islam's recent communiques follow a lengthy spell of media silence since 2015, and suggest the group is presenting itself as a challenger to IS in Sinai. The group emerged in September 2013 with a claim of a double suicide attack on the Egyptian military intelligence HQ in the northern Sinai town of Rafah, which borders the Gaza Strip. It stepped up its propaganda campaign in 2015, claiming rocket attacks on Israel and issuing a propaganda video that hinted at links with al-Qaeda in Yemen (AQAP). Not to be confused with the former Sahara-based jihadist group al-Mourabitoun, this Egyptian faction announced itself in 2015. However, since its formation, the group has not been observed to carry out any prominent attacks, and has mainly put out statements and threats. Given its lack of visible activity, it remains unclear where exactly al-Mourabitoun operates in Egypt. Its propaganda suggests an al-Qaeda orientation, and veteran jihadist media operatives have linked it to an al-Qaeda attempt to check the rise of IS in Egypt. Its leader, Abu-Umar al-Muhajir, alias Hisham Ashmawi, is a former Egyptian army officer and a senior figure in Ansar Beit al-Maqdis before it pledged allegiance to IS. In October 2015, Ashmawi called for the killing of Egyptian military officers, and for revenge in response to the deaths of Palestinians by Israel's security forces. Ashmawi reiterated that message in March 2016, and urged Muslim clerics to play an active role in encouraging young people to embrace jihad. This new group, not to be confused with the veteran Ansar al-Islam in Iraq, emerged in November, when it claimed responsibility for a high-profile attack in Egypt's Western Desert. Ansar al-Islam described the attack, in which more than 50 security personnel died, as ""the beginning of our jihad"". The group's attack claim and its founding statement of 3 November was widely circulated by high-profile online supporters of al-Qaeda, which suggested a nod of approval. Its rhetoric and pledge to fight until the establishment of Islamic law suggest a jihadist orientation. Ansar al-Islam's statement urged Egyptians to join the jihad, or support the group through words or funds. Al-Murabitun posted a video featuring its leader, Abu-Umar al-Muhajir Meaning ""Soldiers of Egypt"", this group appeared in January 2014, and carried out attacks in Cairo over the summer. It has possible al-Qaeda associations, in that the Yemeni and African branches of that network posted eulogies on the death of its leader in April 2015. It also coordinated attacks with Ansar Beit al-Maqdis before the latter joined IS. But Ajnad Misr has repeatedly said that it tries to avoid civilian casualties in its attacks. Many of the group's members are now thought to be in prison. In October 2017, the Egyptian authorities sought death sentences for 13 individuals with suspected links to the group. The individuals are accused of killing soldiers, police officers and civilians, with a verdict expected in December. The Hasm Movement surfaced in the summer of 2016 and has focused on attacking government and security personnel in Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt. The Egyptian authorities and media have linked Hasm to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is outlawed in Egypt. The group's rhetoric is more Islamist and ""pro-revolution"" than jihadist. On 1 October Hasm targeted the Myanmar embassy in Cairo with an explosive device to express its solidarity with Rohingya Muslims, it said. Hasm released its first propaganda video in January in which it showcased its training camps and boasted about the range of attacks it had carried out on the Egyptian authorities. Slick production and the group's claim of organisation and structure in the video were clearly meant to indicate that Hasm was not a shadowy group, but rather a sophisticated force to be reckoned with.

The IS affiliate in Sinai,"Sinai, including here in El-Arish, has seen multiple Islamist attacks in recent years The militant group Sinai Province is the most active insurgent group in Egypt. It has been linked to a number of deadly attacks, mostly in North Sinai, but also in the capital, Cairo, and other provinces. The Islamist group, initially known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem), has been active in the Sinai Peninsula since 2011. It changed its name after itpledged allegianceto the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in November 2014. In 2015, Sinai Province staged aseries of attacksagainst the army, whose scale and complexity indicated the possibility of closer coordination with the IS leadership in Syria. Sinai Province is thought to be aiming to take control of the Sinai Peninsula in order to turn it into an Islamist province run by IS. The number of active Sinai Province members is believed to be between 1,000 and 1,500. It has expanded its operations outside Sinai by creating cells in some governorates, including Cairo and Giza. These cells have claimed several attacks, including one on a security building in the northern province of Dakahliya in December 2013, which killed at least 15 people and injured over 100. The group's operations have also reached the Western Desert, an area popular with tourists for its oases and rock formations, but which has also become a militant hideout due to its proximity to volatile Libya. Sinai Province has been operating mainly in North Sinai, which has been under a state of emergency since October 2014 when 33 security personnel were killed in an attack claimed by the group. The then Egyptian prime minister, Ibrahim Mehleb, described the army's confrontation with Sinai Province as a ""state of war"". North Sinai is thinly populated and broadly underdeveloped, with some of the local population feeling marginalised from the government's investment programme on the mainland. The sense of disconnect is seen as helping fuel a level of support for the militants there. A buffer zone has been created along Egypt's border with Gaza The border with Israel and the Gaza Strip has been a scene of tension over the past few years. The Egyptian authorities have created a buffer zone, demolishing houses and digging a trench to prevent smuggling between Egypt and Gaza - which they say is a source of weapons for the militants. In September 2015, the Egyptian army launched a large-scale military campaign against militant groups in North Sinai. The ongoing Operation The Martyr's Right targets sites mainly in Rafah, Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, all towns in northern areas of the peninsula. As part of the offensive, the army pumped water from the Mediterranean Sea into the tunnels along the Gaza border. Sinai Province started by attacking Israel with rockets, but after the removal of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013 it focused on Egypt's security services, killing dozens of soldiers. It has been involved in suicide bombings, drive-by shootings, assassinations and beheadings. In July 2015, the group said it had attacked an Egyptian naval vessel in the Mediterranean with a missile fired from the shore - a worrying development for shipping in the region. After the launch of the military campaign in North Sinai in September 2015, the group changed its strategy again by carrying out frequent small-scale bombings and hit and run attacks rather than intermittent ""spectaculars"". A survey conducted by London-based Al-Araby al-Jadid news website said the group had carried outmore than 31 attacks,externalin various areas across Sinai within just a two-week period in March 2016. Sinai Province has developed a media production operation, and has published a host of propaganda videos online. One entitled The Soldiers' Harvest and released in September 2015 featured several attacks the group said it carried out against security personnel. These included shooting policemen in the street, sniping at army soldiers, and targeting military vehicles with explosive devices. Another video released in March 2016 allegedly showed training camps in a desert area where members of the group received combat training. In other videos, the group has urged citizens to avoid cooperating with the authorities, especially by joining the army and police. In some of its films, the group has softened its tone towards the Muslim Brotherhood, who it previously criticized for adopting ""infidel democracy"" and joining the political process. In a video released just few days before the fifth anniversary of the 25 January 2011 revolution, Sinai Province called on what it described as ""supporters of peacefulness"" - a reference to the Muslim Brotherhood - to rise up against President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi.

Flaw in YouTube's obscenity tracking toolA system for flagging indecent comments on children's videos was compromised by a serious glitch.16h16 hours ago,"This video can not be played The Childrenâs Commissioner for England says the comments are âvery worryingâ Part of YouTube's system for reporting sexualised comments left on children's videos has not been functioning correctly for more than a year, say volunteer moderators. They say there could be up to 100,000 predatory accounts leaving indecent comments on videos. A BBC Trending investigation has discovered a flaw in a tool that enables the public to report abuse. But YouTube says it reviews the ""vast majority"" of reports within 24 hours. It says it has no technical problems in its reporting mechanism and that it takes child abuse extremely seriously. On Wednesday, the company announcednew measures to protect children on the site,external. The form where YouTube users can report violations YouTube is the world's largest video-sharing site. In addition to algorithms that can automatically block illegal and exploitative videos, it relies on users to report illegal behaviour or content that goes against its rules. The company says it has a zero-tolerance policy against any form of grooming or child endangerment. Users can use an online form to report potentially predatory accounts, and they are then asked to include links to relevant videos and comments. The reports then go to moderators - YouTube employees who review the material and have the power to delete it. However, sources told Trending that after members of the public submitted information on the form, the associated links might be missing from the report. YouTube employees could see that a particular account had been reported, but had no way of knowing which specific comments were being flagged. Highlighted: the flag icon on a YouTube account page which leads to a form where users can report violations BBC Trending was informed of the issue by members of YouTube's Trusted Flagger programme - a group that includes individuals, as well as some charities and law enforcement agencies. The programme began in 2012, and those involved have special tools to alert YouTube to potential violations. The company says reports of violations by Trusted Flaggers are accurate more than 90% of the time. The volunteers are not paid by YouTube, but do receive some perks such as invitations to conferences. With the help of a small group of Trusted Flaggers, Trending identified 28 comments directed at children that were clearly against the site's guidelines. Listen to BBC Trending radio The comments are shocking. Some of them are extremely sexually explicit. Others include the phone numbers of adults, or requests for videos to fulfil sexual fetishes. They were left on YouTube videos posted by young children and they are exactly the kind of material that should be immediately removed under YouTube's own rules - and in many cases reported to the authorities. Some of the comments found and reported on children's videos, which have now been deleted The children in the videos appeared to be younger than 13 years old, the minimum age for registering an account on YouTube. The videos themselves did not have sexual themes, but showed children emulating their favourite YouTube stars by, for instance, reviewing toys or showing their ""outfit of the day"". The explicit comments on these videos were passed on to the company using its form to report child endangerment - the same form that is available to general users. Over a period of several weeks, five of the comments were deleted, but no action was taken against the remaining 23 until Trending contacted the company and provided a full list. All of the predatory accounts were then deleted within 24 hours. The disturbing YouTube videos that are tricking children YouTube child protection mechanism 'failing' YouTube restricts 'creepy' kids' videos Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Members of the Trusted Flaggers programme told Trending that they felt their efforts in taking down such accounts and comments were not being fully supported by the company. They spoke, as a group, on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the work they do. ""We don't have access to the tools, technologies and resources a company like YouTube has or could potentially deploy,"" members of the programme told Trending. ""So for example any tools we need, we create ourselves."" ""There are loads of things YouTube could be doing to reduce this sort of activity, fixing the reporting system to start with. But for example, we can't prevent predators from creating another account and have no indication when they do, so we can take action."" YouTube has come under pressure recently because of the persistence of inappropriate and potentially illegal videos and other content on its site. BBC Trending previously reportedon spoofs of popular cartoons which contain disturbing and inappropriate content not suitable for children. The site recently announced new restrictions on the ""creepy"" videos. Recent reports byThe Times,external,Buzzfeed,externaland other outlets have also highlighted disturbing videos both featuring children and targeted towards young people. And in August, Trending revealeda huge backlog of child endangerment reports made by the Trusted Flaggers themselves. Since then, the Trusted Flaggers who spoke to Trending say more attention is paid to their reports and that most of their reports are being dealt with in days. But in part because of the shortcomings in the public reporting system, the group estimates that there are ""between 50,000 to 100,000 active predatory accounts still on the platform"". Earlier in October, YouTube announced additional measures to crack down on disturbing videos and to protect children. ""In recent months, we've noticed a growing trend around content on YouTube that attempts to pass as family-friendly, but is clearly not,"" the company saidin a blog post,external. The measures include increasing enforcement, terminating channels that might endanger children, and removing ads from some videos. The company also announced that starting this week it will disable commenting on videos of children that have attracted sexual or predatory comments.

The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, described the findings as ""very worrying"". ""This is a global platform and so the company need to ensure they have a global response. There needs to be a company-wide response that absolutely puts children protection as a number one priority, and has the people and mechanisms in place to ensure that no child has been put in an unsafe position while they using the platform."" The National Crime Agency told Trending: ""It is vital that online platforms used by children and young people have in place robust mechanisms and processes to prevent, identify and report sexual exploitation and abuse."" A YouTube spokesperson said: ""We receive hundreds of thousands of flags of content every day and the vast majority of content flagged for violating our guidelines is reviewed in 24 hours. ""Content that endangers children is abhorrent and unacceptable to us. ""We have systems in place to take swift action on this content with dedicated policy specialists reviewing and removing flagged material around the clock, and terminating the accounts of those that leave predatory comments outright."" The company said that in the past week they've disabled comments on thousands of videos and shut down hundreds of accounts that have made predatory comments.

"Social media 'distorts' news, says GoveMichael Gove questions the role of ""raw and authentic"" Twitter voices in debates on animal welfare.2h2 hours agoUK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Animal sentience: Social media reaction to fake news claims Michael Gove has hit out at the way social media ""corrupts and distorts"" political reporting and decision making following a row about animal welfare. The environment secretary said attacks on MPs over a vote on EU laws on animal ""sentience"" were ""absolutely wrong"". The Commons vote sparked protests and social media campaign backed by high-profile figures such as Ben Fogle. The explorer has apologised for posting ""misleading threads"" but defended sharing details on ""important stories"". Last week MPs voted not to incorporate part of an EU treaty recognising that animals could feel emotion and pain into the EU Withdrawal Bill. Allow Twitter content?

Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had tabled the amendment to the EU bill, which would have transferred the EU protocol on animal sentience - the ability to experience feelings - into domestic law. But ministers argued that the recognition of animals' sentience already existed in UK law and MPs rejected the amendment. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""On social media there was a suggestion that somehow the MPs had voted against the principle that animals are sentient beings, that did not happen, that is absolutely wrong."" ""There is an unhappy tendency now for people to believe that the raw and authentic voice of what's shared on social media is more reliable than what is said in Hansard or on the BBC. This video can not be played Michael Gove says the government has made a commitment to animal welfare UK law 'to recognise animal feelings' ""More than that there is a particular concern somehow, a belief somehow that outside the European Union our democratic institutions can't do better than we did in the EU. We've got to challenge both those points."" He said Parliament was ""an effective and vigorous institution which can ensure protection for human rights and animal rights"". Veterinary bodies want existing references to animal sentience in law made more explicit ""We've also got to stand up against the way in which social media corrupts and distorts both reporting and decision making... It's important that all of us do that and that some of us who shared some of these messages on social media have been generous enough to acknowledge ... that they may have unwittingly passed these messages on.""

Mr Gove said there would not be a ""gap"" in animal welfare provisions as a result of the vote, once the UK left the EU, because the UK would ""ensure we have stronger protection written into law"". He argued that the EU legislation was ""poorly designed"" and said there was ""no way in which animal protection can be diminished in any way, in any shape, or in any form"". But Ms Lucas said the government had been ""backpedalling"" since the vote: ""What I was told in the chamber was that they had no need to take any account of my amendment because this principle of animal sentience was already recognised in UK law in the Animal Welfare Act of 2006. ""Now that is patently untrue, wrong and I am very glad in the last 24 hours Michael Gove and others have been rapidly backpedalling and admitting that that's not true.""

British Veterinary Association senior vice president Gudrun Ravetz told the BBC that there was a ""significant difference"" between the Article 13 EU protocol, which put a duty on the state to pay full regard to animal welfare when formulating and implementing policies, and the UK legislation, the 2006 Animal Welfare Act, which put the duty on the owner. The first was ""explicit"" about ""animal sentience"", the latter was only ""implicit about sentience of animals and vertebrates"". ""That is a very important principle, we have the duty of animal welfare for the owner and keeper under the Animal Welfare Act, and that will continue but what we want to see is that duty to the state,"" she added.

"Cable barred from Bad Sex book awardThe Liberal Democrat leader's novel Open Arms can't be shortlisted because he is an MP, say organisers.1han hour agoEntertainment & Arts","Sir Vince's debut novel was published in September Sir Vince Cable won't be considered for 2017's Bad Sex in Fiction Award - because his writing isn't bad enough. The Literary Review, which organises the prize, said his thriller Open Arms had received ""many"" nominations but wasn't ultimately shortlisted. That means he will not compete against the likes of Wilbur Smith's War Cry, one of six nominees announced so far. In it a male character says he wants to explore his lover ""like Dr Livingstone and Mr Stanley exploring Africa"". The same passage from Smith's novel, co-written with David Churchill, refers to nipples ""standing up as proudly as little guardsmen on parade"". Another shortlisted work - The Future Won't Be Long by Turkish-American author Jarett Kobek - likens sexual intercourse to a ""pulsing wave"", a ""holy burst"" and a ""congress of wonder"". A third nominee - The Seventh Function of Language by France's Laurent Binet - features a man wooing a woman with the words: ""Let's construct an assemblage."" War Cry is part of Wilbur Smith's series of Courtney novels Their love-making continues ""until they reach the point of impact, when the two desiring machines collide in an atomic explosion"". In her debut novel Mother of Darkness, Venetia Welby writes about a character called Tera who ""moans in colours"" as her lover approaches. ""It was as if a Catherine Wheel had been ignited in my solar plexus,"" muses a character in another passage from the book singled out for consideration. Organisers say the purpose of the prize is ""to draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction"". The award, whose recent winners include Morrissey'sdebut novel List of the Lost, does not cover pornographic or expressly erotic literature.

"'Indiana Joan', 95, faces looting probe","At least one of Mrs Howard's digs was at the Saqqara necropolis, south of Cairo A 95-year-old Australian woman has found herself at the centre of an international row over her collection of ancient Middle Eastern artefacts. Joan Howard, the wife of a UN diplomat, used her travel to the region to join archaeology digs in the 60s and 70s. But a recent profile in The West Australian newspaper, showcasing her extensive collection, prompted outrage. Archaeologists have called for an investigation into her collection of cultural artefacts. The Australian Associated Press reports that the country's Department of Foreign Affairs is now looking into the matter. Shaaban Abdel Gawad, the director-general of the Retrieved Antiquities Department at Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, told the Sydney Morning Herald that Egypt's foreign ministry had requested the investigation. ""We want to investigate how these pieces made it out of Egypt illegally,"" he told the newspaper. Despite the controversy, it is not clear if Mrs Howard broke any national or international laws. The original profile piece,published in early November by The West Australian,external, nicknamed Mrs Howard ""Indiana Joan"" after Harrison Ford's fictional globetrotting archaeologist. It called her Australia's ""real life tomb raider"" who had ""a mischievous twinkle"" in her eye when talking about her collection - which it said is worth more than A$1m (Â£571,000). Objects in the collection include a funeral mask from an Egyptian mummy, axe heads dating back 40,000 years, Roman weapons, and coins and jewellery from ancient Egypt. ""Through her husband's UN connections, over 11 years she was given carte blanche to travel between Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and Israel,"" the newspaper reported. ""She used her diplomatic freedom to search for antiquities before laws changed and it became legally difficult to do so,"" it added. Woman bares alopecia in engagement photos Paramedics fulfil dying woman's wish Finland rolls out bread made from insects The Unesco convention on the illicit trade of cultural property was adopted in 1970, meaning it is now illegal to remove such items from their country of origin. Egypt's national laws to protect its antiquities date back to the 1880s, according to the International Council of Museums, and many of the other nations where Mrs Howard travelled have had their own laws since at least the 1950s. There have now been calls for an investigation into the legality of Mrs Howard's activities in the 1960s and 1970s, to see if any of the artefacts should be repatriated. Archaeologist Monica Hanna is one of those calling for an investigation into the great-grandmother. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dr Hanna posted an open letter to Australia's ambassador to Egypt claiming that Mrs Howard ""behaved as a pirate"" by appropriating artefacts from archaeological sites. Mrs Howard has not responded to the latest developments. The perceived positive spin on the profile of the ""real-life Tomb Raider"" is also controversial in itself. ""The celebratory tone of the article of her boasting on the destruction of archaeological sites sends a very negative image,"" Dr Hanna said in her letter. Many of Egypt's most prized cultural artefacts have long been held by other countries - such as the Rosetta Stone, which is part of the British Museum's collection. But the problem is not limited to the colonial era. During the expansion of the so-called Islamic State,many cultural artefacts were sold on the black market to raise funds for the group. And earlier this year, Christian-owned US arts and crafts companyHobby Lobby forfeited thousands of smuggled ancient artefacts from Iraq it had bought for a Bible museum, paying $3m (Â£2.3m) in a legal settlement.

Profile: Sinai Province militant group,"Sinai, including here in El-Arish, has seen multiple Islamist attacks in recent years The militant group Sinai Province is the most active insurgent group in Egypt. It has been linked to a number of deadly attacks, mostly in North Sinai, but also in the capital, Cairo, and other provinces. The Islamist group, initially known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem), has been active in the Sinai Peninsula since 2011. It changed its name after itpledged allegianceto the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in November 2014. In 2015, Sinai Province staged aseries of attacksagainst the army, whose scale and complexity indicated the possibility of closer coordination with the IS leadership in Syria. Sinai Province is thought to be aiming to take control of the Sinai Peninsula in order to turn it into an Islamist province run by IS. The number of active Sinai Province members is believed to be between 1,000 and 1,500. It has expanded its operations outside Sinai by creating cells in some governorates, including Cairo and Giza. These cells have claimed several attacks, including one on a security building in the northern province of Dakahliya in December 2013, which killed at least 15 people and injured over 100. The group's operations have also reached the Western Desert, an area popular with tourists for its oases and rock formations, but which has also become a militant hideout due to its proximity to volatile Libya. Sinai Province has been operating mainly in North Sinai, which has been under a state of emergency since October 2014 when 33 security personnel were killed in an attack claimed by the group. The then Egyptian prime minister, Ibrahim Mehleb, described the army's confrontation with Sinai Province as a ""state of war"". North Sinai is thinly populated and broadly underdeveloped, with some of the local population feeling marginalised from the government's investment programme on the mainland. The sense of disconnect is seen as helping fuel a level of support for the militants there. A buffer zone has been created along Egypt's border with Gaza The border with Israel and the Gaza Strip has been a scene of tension over the past few years. The Egyptian authorities have created a buffer zone, demolishing houses and digging a trench to prevent smuggling between Egypt and Gaza - which they say is a source of weapons for the militants. In September 2015, the Egyptian army launched a large-scale military campaign against militant groups in North Sinai. The ongoing Operation The Martyr's Right targets sites mainly in Rafah, Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, all towns in northern areas of the peninsula. As part of the offensive, the army pumped water from the Mediterranean Sea into the tunnels along the Gaza border. Sinai Province started by attacking Israel with rockets, but after the removal of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013 it focused on Egypt's security services, killing dozens of soldiers. It has been involved in suicide bombings, drive-by shootings, assassinations and beheadings. In July 2015, the group said it had attacked an Egyptian naval vessel in the Mediterranean with a missile fired from the shore - a worrying development for shipping in the region. After the launch of the military campaign in North Sinai in September 2015, the group changed its strategy again by carrying out frequent small-scale bombings and hit and run attacks rather than intermittent ""spectaculars"". A survey conducted by London-based Al-Araby al-Jadid news website said the group had carried outmore than 31 attacks,externalin various areas across Sinai within just a two-week period in March 2016. Sinai Province has developed a media production operation, and has published a host of propaganda videos online. One entitled The Soldiers' Harvest and released in September 2015 featured several attacks the group said it carried out against security personnel. These included shooting policemen in the street, sniping at army soldiers, and targeting military vehicles with explosive devices. Another video released in March 2016 allegedly showed training camps in a desert area where members of the group received combat training. In other videos, the group has urged citizens to avoid cooperating with the authorities, especially by joining the army and police. In some of its films, the group has softened its tone towards the Muslim Brotherhood, who it previously criticized for adopting ""infidel democracy"" and joining the political process. In a video released just few days before the fifth anniversary of the 25 January 2011 revolution, Sinai Province called on what it described as ""supporters of peacefulness"" - a reference to the Muslim Brotherhood - to rise up against President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi.

Dominic O'Neill, 38, was detained and placed in the back, but ""managed to get into the driver's seat and drive off"" in Leicester, on 21 October. O'Neill was sentenced to 16 months in prison for several motoring offences at Leicester Crown Court. Leicestershire Police said its officers had ""received advice"" surrounding the circumstances of the crash.

Attack on Egypt mosque 'kills 85',"The militants targeted a mosque near al-Arish Militants have launched a bomb and gun attack on a mosque in Egypt's North Sinai province, killing 235 people, state media say. The al-Rawda mosque in the town of Bir al-Abed was targeted during Friday prayers. It is the deadliest attack of its kind since an Islamist insurgency in the peninsula was stepped up in 2013. Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi vowed to respond with ""brute force"" after talks with security officials. No group has yet claimed the attack, but militants affiliated with so-called Islamic State (IS) have been responsible for scores of deadly attacks in the province. This video can not be played Ambulances rushed to the scene of the attack They usually target security forces and Christian churches, and the bloody attack on a mosque associated with Sufi Muslims has shocked Egypt. Witnesses said dozens of gunmen arrived in off-road vehicles and bombed the packed mosque before opening fire on worshippers as they tried to flee. The assailants are reported to have set parked vehicles on fire in the vicinity to block off access to the mosque. Pictures from the scene show rows of bloodied victims inside the mosque. At least 100 people were wounded, reports say, overwhelming hospitals. ""They were shooting at people as they left the mosque,"" a local resident who had relatives there told Reuters news agency. ""They were shooting at the ambulances too."" It is the deadliest militant attack in modern Egyptian history. Bir al-Abed is about 130 miles (211km) from Cairo. Locals are quoted as saying that followers of Sufism, a mystical branch of Sunni Islam, regularly gathered at the mosque. Although Sufis are widely accepted across much of the Muslim world, some jihadist groups, including IS, see them as heretics. Who are Egypt's militant groups? What is Sufism? The head of IS's religious police in Sinai said last December that Sufis who did not ""repent"" would be killed, after the group beheaded two elderly men reported to be Sufi clerics. The victim of the mosque attack also included military conscripts. Militant Islamists have been waging an insurgency on the Sinai peninsula in recent years, stepping up attacks after Egypt's military overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi after mass anti-government protests in July 2013. Hundreds of police, soldiers and civilians have been killed since then, mostly in attacks carried out by Sinai Province group, which is affiliated to IS. In September,at least 18 policemen were killed when the group attacked a convoy near al-Arish. Sinai Province has also carried out deadly attacks against Egypt's Coptic Christian minority elsewhere in the country, and said it bombed a Russian plane carrying tourists in Sinai in 2015, killing 224 people on board. Egypt disputes desert shootout reports Sinai plane crash: What we know The IS affiliate in Sinai It has been operating mainly in North Sinai, which has been under a state of emergency since October 2014, when 33 security personnel were killed in an attack claimed by the group. Sinai Province is thought to want to take control of the Sinai Peninsula in order to turn it into an Islamist province run by IS. By Sally Nabil, BBC News, Cairo Islamist militants have been operating in northern Sinai for several years, mainly targeting security forces. But this is the first time that worshippers inside a mosque have been targeted. The number of victims is unprecedented for an attack of this type. Northern Sinai has been living under a media blackout over the past few years. No media organisations have been allowed to go there, including state-sponsored ones. The frequency of attacks raises doubts about the effectiveness of military operations. While the army releases statements every now and then, claiming victory in some parts of Sinai, there seems to be no end in sight to the ongoing battle between the army and militants. The injured were brought to hospitals far away, including in Cairo President Sisi has declared three days of mourning. The military is reported to have already conducted air strikes in mountains around Bir al-Abed. ""What is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism, to destroy our efforts to stop the terrible criminal plan that aims to destroy what is left of our region,"" Mr Sisi said in a televised address. Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit condemned the attack as a ""terrifying crime which again shows that Islam is innocent of those who follow extremist terrorist ideology"". In other reaction: UK Prime Minister Theresa May tweeted: ""Appalled by the sickening attack on a mosque in North Sinai. Condolences with all those in #Egypt affected by this evil and cowardly act."" US President Donald Trump called the attack ""horrible and cowardly"". French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the attack ""despicable"", while Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said lights at the Eiffel Tower would turn off to honour the victims The city hall in Tel Aviv, Israel, projected the Egyptian flag to show solidarity Allow Twitter content?

My friend Reeva,"Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by her boyfriend Oscar Pistorius on Valentine's Day 2013. Much attention has been focused on Mr Pistorius, the South African Olympic athlete who denies the charges. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani has been finding out more about the victim, a model, reality TV star and law graduate. While Reeva Steenkamp projected the image of a sex kitten in the glossy men's magazines, those who knew her say the ""real Reeva"" was a deeply private person and had a ""small-town girl"" attitude about her. ""She was self-conscious. You would never think that but she was,"" says Kerry Smith, a close friend who met Reeva at university - before she was twice voted among the ""100 sexiest women in the world"" for FHM magazine. Looking through photos of the two on her laptop and old Facebook messages - one in which Ms Steenkamp said she regarded her as ""a sister"" - Ms Smith says her friend was determined to use her law degree in years to come. ""She always said modelling would not last - you need to have something to come back to,"" she tells me as we sit in her living room in Port Elizabeth, known as the ""friendly city"", where both women grew up. ""She was more than just a pretty face, she had a beautiful heart and ambition,"" the 35-year-old legal assistant says. Kerry Smith and Reeva Steenkamp had planned to open a law firm to help abused women The 29-year-old died almost instantly after Mr Pistorius shot her through a toilet door in his Pretoria home. The double-amputee sprinter denies murder, saying he feared an intruder had broken in. Ms Smith was one of a select few who attended the intimate funeral for Ms Steenkamp, who had been going out with the athlete for three months. ""There's no closure. We couldn't even view her body in the coffin,"" she says, sadly. Ms Steenkamp was shot three times - once in the head, meaning her family could not hold an open-casket ceremony. Given that she was killed by her boyfriend, it is poignant that one of her passions was helping victims of domestic abuse. Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp was born on 19 August 1983, to Barry Steenkamp, a horse trainer, and his second wife June Graduated in law at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth Presenter at Fashion TV Named among ""100 sexiest women in the world"" in 2011 and 2012 for FHM magazine, which featured her on the cover Appeared in reality TV programme Tropika Island of Treasure, recorded in Jamaica and broadcast two days after her death Shot dead by her boyfriend of three months, Oscar Pistorius in 14 February 2013 Profile: Reeva Steenkamp The two university friends had planned to start a law firm to help abused women after graduating. It was an ambition they kept in mind despite Ms Steenkamp's modelling career - and she had applied to the bar in late 2011, aiming to become a legal advocate by the age of 30. Before her involvement with Mr Pistorius, Ms Steenkamp had reportedly been in an abusive relationship with Wayne Agrella, accusations the jockey denies, while Ms Smith had been in an abusive marriage for 10 years. ""She wanted to save everyone, wanted to protect everyone,"" her friend recalls. Oscar Pistorius told the murder trial the couple had been planning a future together Some believe this need to save and protect played a hand in her relationship with Mr Pistorius, who the world has learned was insecure about his disability in spite of his ""superhuman"" persona on the world athletics stage. Ms Smith says it upsets her when people dismiss Ms Steenkamp's messages to Mr Pistorius, in which she said she was sometimes scared of him. Referring to the relationship that supposedly fuelled her need to protect women from abusive men, Ms Smith says: ""For Reeva I think it was mainly mental, I don't know that he was physically abusive but definitely emotionally abusive. ""When she was with Wayne she always felt she had to cover up. She would always be on these fad diets with him. She lost a lot of weight,"" she says. ""It wasn't a healthy relationship. When she moved to Johannesburg, we were grateful because it meant she would be free from him."" Mr Agrella, who was with the model for six years, denies that the relationship was anything but loving. ""That is the biggest lie ever. I even asked the family what this was about, they were just as shocked I was,"" says Mr Agrella, tersely. Since this tragedy happened people have had this impression that Reeva was just a model or the pretty girl and she was so much more than that. There was this implication that she was riding on Oscar Pistorius' coat-tails and the fact of the matter is she was already somewhere, in her own right. She had a successful career and many of us in the industry were watching her with great expectation - you could see that Reeva was going places. She was a really, really beautiful person - forget about the looks, I mean her heart and mind. Even as a teenager she got it, she had a great work ethic.  At competitions, shoots and anything that we did, she was one of the first to arrive and one of the last to leave. The reason I've still got these photographs is because I had kept them aside to give her next time she was back in town. I've given them to her parents now. Ms Smith says her own abusive marriage almost cost her friendship with Ms Steenkamp. The pair did not see each other for several years - reconnecting some years later after Ms Smith had re-married. ""She later said it was because she couldn't handle seeing me being treated like that,"" says Ms Smith. She and ""Reeves"", as she affectionately calls her friend of more than 10 years, met in 2002 when they both studied law at Port Elizabeth's Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University. Reeva Steenkamp dyed her hair blonde after she was turned down twice to be a cover girl for FHM The pair were honoured among the top 10 achievers in the first year class - and had spent a month working together on an assignment. This was when she got the first glimpse of Ms Steenkamp's drive, Ms Smith says. Her friend always had striking looks, even before she became a TV star: ""She had this classic beauty to her. What made her even more beautiful was how unaware she seemed of it."" At university, Ms Steenkamp spent most of her time behind a book, with loved ones and riding horses. During her final year of university she broke her back after falling off a horse and was bedridden for two months. Those close to her say this was what she needed to get out her shell. ""I think it made her realise that things can happen so quickly,"" says Ms Smith, who was one of the first people to visit her in hospital shortly after the accident. ""She's lying there, her head is strapped in and she is not allowed to move and she says: 'My hair is dirty, I've got grass in my hair and I've got sand in my hair. I can't handle it' - it was so her,"" laughs Ms Smith, saying her friend never let bad situations get her down. Although she was worried about embarking on her modelling career relatively late, Ms Steenkamp was set on making a name for herself in the industry. After being turned down for auditions for FHM cover girl two years in a row, she underwent a makeover - changing her hair colour from brunette to sunny blonde. Kerry Smith was one of the few friends invited to Reeva Steenkamp's funeral ""She was determined to get that job. Reeva was the kind of person who didn't take no for an answer. She worked hard and lost weight, re-invented herself and it paid off,"" says Ms Smith. Her face lights up when she speaks of her friend, she is mostly in high spirits but there are moments when she pauses to compose herself. She dips in and out of referring to Ms Steenkamp in the present, a sign perhaps that she has not quite dealt with the loss. Ms Smith tells me how shocked she was when she heard that the model was dating Mr Pistorius, because Ms Steenkamp had recently told her how happy she was with another man, whom she had been seeing for three years. ""I thought that was the person she was going to marry, they even had a company together. I don't know what happened, next thing I know she is dating Oscar,"" she says. When Ms Steenkamp died, the couple had been dating for three months and her parents had not met the athlete ""It happened so quickly, even her parents hadn't met him. Soon after that it had all ended."" Like many others, Ms Smith has questions about the moments leading up to the shooting. ""She was not a quiet person at all. She would have screamed, hearing him shout in the house, she would have let rip, she would have not kept her mouth shut at all,"" says Ms Smith. But Mr Pistorius says Ms Steenkamp remained quiet, otherwise he would have known she was in the toilet. She had spoken of some concerns about Mr Pistorius, like his speeding while driving. ""I think she genuinely loved him and that blinded her. I think she got to a point where she thought it was all fine,"" says Ms Smith. Like Ms Steenkamp's parents, she says she just wants the truth and for justice to be served. We have been sitting for more than an hour looking at the messages she and Ms Steenkamp exchanged - she says she reads them sometimes when missing her becomes too much. ""She was mad about my daughter. It breaks my heart to think she will never have that. She adored children,"" Ms Smith says, struggling to complete her sentences. The pain is still all too raw.

Attack on Egypt mosque 'kills 54',"The militants targeted a mosque near al-Arish Militants have launched a bomb and gun attack on a mosque in Egypt's North Sinai province, killing 235 people, state media say. The al-Rawda mosque in the town of Bir al-Abed was targeted during Friday prayers. It is the deadliest attack of its kind since an Islamist insurgency in the peninsula was stepped up in 2013. Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi vowed to respond with ""brute force"" after talks with security officials. No group has yet claimed the attack, but militants affiliated with so-called Islamic State (IS) have been responsible for scores of deadly attacks in the province. This video can not be played Ambulances rushed to the scene of the attack They usually target security forces and Christian churches, and the bloody attack on a mosque associated with Sufi Muslims has shocked Egypt. Witnesses said dozens of gunmen arrived in off-road vehicles and bombed the packed mosque before opening fire on worshippers as they tried to flee. The assailants are reported to have set parked vehicles on fire in the vicinity to block off access to the mosque. Pictures from the scene show rows of bloodied victims inside the mosque. At least 100 people were wounded, reports say, overwhelming hospitals. ""They were shooting at people as they left the mosque,"" a local resident who had relatives there told Reuters news agency. ""They were shooting at the ambulances too."" It is the deadliest militant attack in modern Egyptian history. Bir al-Abed is about 130 miles (211km) from Cairo. Locals are quoted as saying that followers of Sufism, a mystical branch of Sunni Islam, regularly gathered at the mosque. Although Sufis are widely accepted across much of the Muslim world, some jihadist groups, including IS, see them as heretics. Who are Egypt's militant groups? What is Sufism? The head of IS's religious police in Sinai said last December that Sufis who did not ""repent"" would be killed, after the group beheaded two elderly men reported to be Sufi clerics.

Last week, Mr Tusk said the EU was ""ready"" to move on to the next phase of talks - focused on a trade and security partnership after the UK leaves in March 2019 - but the UK must first show more progress on outstanding ""separation"" issues. The BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said that after holding talks with Mrs May, Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen had told journalists in the Belgian capital that there had been ""movement"" on the issue of money. ""It seems to me that there is progress and so I have decided to be optimistic about this,"" Mr Rasmussen - one of the UK's closest allies - said. The PM also said the UK was in continuing discussions with the Irish government about the solutions for avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. No 10 earlier had to clarify its position after a spokesman appeared to suggest the possibility of Northern Ireland staying in the customs union may be up for negotiation. Asked about the issue at a lobby briefing, the spokesman said the UK must ""continue to negotiate to find an innovative way forward"". But Downing Street later insisted that the UK's stated policy - that the whole of the UK is leaving the single market and customs union - remained in force. The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and served the EU with formal notice of Brexit in March 2017. This began a two-year countdown to the UK's departure day which will be in March 2019.

Flaw in YouTube's obscenity tracking tool,"This video can not be played The Childrenâs Commissioner for England says the comments are âvery worryingâ Part of YouTube's system for reporting sexualised comments left on children's videos has not been functioning correctly for more than a year, say volunteer moderators. They say there could be up to 100,000 predatory accounts leaving indecent comments on videos. A BBC Trending investigation has discovered a flaw in a tool that enables the public to report abuse. But YouTube says it reviews the ""vast majority"" of reports within 24 hours. It says it has no technical problems in its reporting mechanism and that it takes child abuse extremely seriously. On Wednesday, the company announcednew measures to protect children on the site,external. The form where YouTube users can report violations YouTube is the world's largest video-sharing site. In addition to algorithms that can automatically block illegal and exploitative videos, it relies on users to report illegal behaviour or content that goes against its rules. The company says it has a zero-tolerance policy against any form of grooming or child endangerment. Users can use an online form to report potentially predatory accounts, and they are then asked to include links to relevant videos and comments. The reports then go to moderators - YouTube employees who review the material and have the power to delete it. However, sources told Trending that after members of the public submitted information on the form, the associated links might be missing from the report. YouTube employees could see that a particular account had been reported, but had no way of knowing which specific comments were being flagged. Highlighted: the flag icon on a YouTube account page which leads to a form where users can report violations BBC Trending was informed of the issue by members of YouTube's Trusted Flagger programme - a group that includes individuals, as well as some charities and law enforcement agencies. The programme began in 2012, and those involved have special tools to alert YouTube to potential violations. The company says reports of violations by Trusted Flaggers are accurate more than 90% of the time. The volunteers are not paid by YouTube, but do receive some perks such as invitations to conferences. With the help of a small group of Trusted Flaggers, Trending identified 28 comments directed at children that were clearly against the site's guidelines. Listen to BBC Trending radio The comments are shocking. Some of them are extremely sexually explicit. Others include the phone numbers of adults, or requests for videos to fulfil sexual fetishes. They were left on YouTube videos posted by young children and they are exactly the kind of material that should be immediately removed under YouTube's own rules - and in many cases reported to the authorities. Some of the comments found and reported on children's videos, which have now been deleted The children in the videos appeared to be younger than 13 years old, the minimum age for registering an account on YouTube. The videos themselves did not have sexual themes, but showed children emulating their favourite YouTube stars by, for instance, reviewing toys or showing their ""outfit of the day"". The explicit comments on these videos were passed on to the company using its form to report child endangerment - the same form that is available to general users. Over a period of several weeks, five of the comments were deleted, but no action was taken against the remaining 23 until Trending contacted the company and provided a full list. All of the predatory accounts were then deleted within 24 hours. The disturbing YouTube videos that are tricking children YouTube child protection mechanism 'failing' YouTube restricts 'creepy' kids' videos Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Members of the Trusted Flaggers programme told Trending that they felt their efforts in taking down such accounts and comments were not being fully supported by the company. They spoke, as a group, on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the work they do. ""We don't have access to the tools, technologies and resources a company like YouTube has or could potentially deploy,"" members of the programme told Trending. ""So for example any tools we need, we create ourselves."" ""There are loads of things YouTube could be doing to reduce this sort of activity, fixing the reporting system to start with. But for example, we can't prevent predators from creating another account and have no indication when they do, so we can take action."" YouTube has come under pressure recently because of the persistence of inappropriate and potentially illegal videos and other content on its site. BBC Trending previously reportedon spoofs of popular cartoons which contain disturbing and inappropriate content not suitable for children. The site recently announced new restrictions on the ""creepy"" videos. Recent reports byThe Times,external,Buzzfeed,externaland other outlets have also highlighted disturbing videos both featuring children and targeted towards young people. And in August, Trending revealeda huge backlog of child endangerment reports made by the Trusted Flaggers themselves. Since then, the Trusted Flaggers who spoke to Trending say more attention is paid to their reports and that most of their reports are being dealt with in days. But in part because of the shortcomings in the public reporting system, the group estimates that there are ""between 50,000 to 100,000 active predatory accounts still on the platform"". Earlier in October, YouTube announced additional measures to crack down on disturbing videos and to protect children. ""In recent months, we've noticed a growing trend around content on YouTube that attempts to pass as family-friendly, but is clearly not,"" the company saidin a blog post,external. The measures include increasing enforcement, terminating channels that might endanger children, and removing ads from some videos. The company also announced that starting this week it will disable commenting on videos of children that have attracted sexual or predatory comments. Be aware of what your children are doing on the internet. Pay particular attention to comments being made on videos and sudden spikes in popularity for content posted by children online. The NSPCC has aseries of guidelines about keeping children safe online,external They promote the acronym TEAM: Talk about staying safe online; Explore the online world together; Agree rules about what's OK and what's not; and Manage your family's settings and controls. There are more resources on theBBC Stay Safe site. In the UK, online grooming can be reported via theClick CEOP button,external. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, described the findings as ""very worrying"". ""This is a global platform and so the company need to ensure they have a global response. There needs to be a company-wide response that absolutely puts children protection as a number one priority, and has the people and mechanisms in place to ensure that no child has been put in an unsafe position while they using the platform."" The National Crime Agency told Trending: ""It is vital that online platforms used by children and young people have in place robust mechanisms and processes to prevent, identify and report sexual exploitation and abuse."" A YouTube spokesperson said: ""We receive hundreds of thousands of flags of content every day and the vast majority of content flagged for violating our guidelines is reviewed in 24 hours. ""Content that endangers children is abhorrent and unacceptable to us. ""We have systems in place to take swift action on this content with dedicated policy specialists reviewing and removing flagged material around the clock, and terminating the accounts of those that leave predatory comments outright."" The company said that in the past week they've disabled comments on thousands of videos and shut down hundreds of accounts that have made predatory comments. ""We are committed to getting this right and recognise we need to do more, both through machine learning and by increasing human and technical resources.""

Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""On social media there was a suggestion that somehow the MPs had voted against the principle that animals are sentient beings, that did not happen, that is absolutely wrong.""

Mr Gove said there would not be a ""gap"" in animal welfare provisions as a result of the vote, once the UK left the EU, because the UK would ""ensure we have stronger protection written into law"". He argued that the EU legislation was ""poorly designed"" and said there was ""no way in which animal protection can be diminished in any way, in any shape, or in any form"". But Ms Lucas said the government had been ""backpedalling"" since the vote: ""What I was told in the chamber was that they had no need to take any account of my amendment because this principle of animal sentience was already recognised in UK law in the Animal Welfare Act of 2006. ""Now that is patently untrue, wrong and I am very glad in the last 24 hours Michael Gove and others have been rapidly backpedalling and admitting that that's not true.""

British Veterinary Association senior vice president Gudrun Ravetz told the BBC that there was a ""significant difference"" between the Article 13 EU protocol, which put a duty on the state to pay full regard to animal welfare when formulating and implementing policies, and the UK legislation, the 2006 Animal Welfare Act, which put the duty on the owner. The first was ""explicit"" about ""animal sentience"", the latter was only ""implicit about sentience of animals and vertebrates"". ""That is a very important principle, we have the duty of animal welfare for the owner and keeper under the Animal Welfare Act, and that will continue but what we want to see is that duty to the state,"" she added.

Firm offers paid leave for all parents,"The UK's largest insurer will allow all new parents the same amount of paid leave after the arrival of a  child. Aviva will offer its 16,000 employees 26 weeks leave on full basic pay, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. The policy applies to parents who have given birth, adopted or chosen surrogacy. But the industry body for personnel managers, the CIPD, said men's take-up of shared parental leave remained low. Nevertheless, the CIPD said Aviva's move was a significant and positive step. Reality Check: Are fathers using their paternity leave? Call for 'decently paid' maternity leave Most employed mothers are entitled to 52 weeks' maternity leave Statutory maternity pay covers the first 39 weeks. It is usually paid at 90% of the mother's weekly wage for the first six weeks, with the remaining 33 weeks at Â£140.98 a week or 90% of their weekly wage, whichever is lower Employees may be entitled toshared parental leave,externalwithin the first year of a child's birth or adoption Women who earn less than Â£112 a week are not eligible for statutory maternity pay; instead most can claim maternity allowance Fathers may be entitled to one or two weeks paidpaternity leave,external The move tackles one of the barriers to career progression, Aviva says. Aviva argues the move will create a ""level playing field for men and women"" who want to take time out of their career to spend time with their family. The CIPD's spokeswoman welcomed Aviva's move increase the pay available ""to allow both parents to play an equal part in the upbringing of their child"". Aviva would need to use male role models to show it is acceptable to take up the offer of parental leave, ""to encourage a change in perceptions and foster a cultural change. Otherwise, male employees may still be reticent about taking time off, even if paid,"" she added. Fathers often take a minimum amount of time off for financial reasons, whilst their partner's income is reduced. The UK's provision for new mothers is among the worst in Europe,the TUC said earlier this year. The trade union body says only Ireland and Slovakia have worse ""decently paid"" entitlements, which it defines as two-thirds of a woman's salary - or more than Â£840 a month. Croatia offers six months leave; Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have more than four months; Estonia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Malta, and Switzerland offer more than three months. Aviva will offer nearly double the EU minimum requirement of 14 weeks, by giving 26 weeks leave at full basic pay for each parent within 12 months of a child's arrival. Aviva's new policy was devised by Sarah Morris, its chief people officer and a member of the company's executive committee. She is also on the steering committee of the 30% Club, which campaigns for greater representation of women on the boards of Britain's biggest companies. The insurer's policy is not the most generous in the corporate world, however. In August 2015Netflix announced an unlimited leave policy,externalallowing new parents to take as much time off as they want during the first year with their new child.

'Explosion' dashes sub crew survival hopes,"This video can not be played As hopes faded for the sub, angry relatives said the search operation had been inadequate Hopes that the 44 crew of a missing Argentine submarine might still be alive have been dashed after the navy said an event consistent with an explosion had been detected. The ""abnormal, singular, short, violent, non-nuclear event"" was recorded in the south Atlantic by a nuclear test watchdog last week. Relatives of the missing crew reacted with grief and anger at the news. It follows a US report of a loud noise in the same area. The ARA San Juan disappeared last Wednesday. More than a dozen countries including the US, Russia and the UK have sent assistance. It was provided to the Argentine navy on Thursday by the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), spokesman Capt Enrique Balbi said. In a statement, the CTBTO said two of its hydro-acoustic stations had detected a signal from an ""underwater impulsive event"". The ARA San Juan disappeared last Wednesday On Wednesday the navy received a US report of a ""hydro-acoustic anomaly"" detected hours after the submarine went missing. Capt Balbi said the suspected explosion took place near the submarine's last known location. The navy only knew the location of the suspected explosion, not its cause, he said, and search efforts would be concentrated in the area. News of the suspected explosion was broken to family members gathered at the Mar del Plata navy base shortly before Capt Balbi spoke to journalists. Some remonstrated angrily with the navy spokesman, reports said, while others collapsed in tears. Relatives accused the navy of lying to them and of raising false hopes. Others pointed the finger at the government, saying lack of investment and corruption in the armed forces had made the submarine unsafe. One man whose brother was on board the ARA San Juan was quoted by Clarin newspaper [in Spanish] as shouting:,external""They killed my brother, the bastards. They killed my brother because they take them out to sail [in a vessel held together] with wire."" Relatives of crew members fear the worst Grief and anger dominate Argentine media Luis Tagliapietra, whose son DamiÃ¡n was on board, told Radio Cut thatthe navy had told them all the crew had been killed,externalin the explosion at a depth of 200m. On Wednesday, Capt Balbi said oxygen would be running out on board the vessel. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported the breakdown, which Capt Galeazzi described as a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. According to Capt Balbi, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base once more after reporting the problem. What happens when a submarine vanishes In the message, he reportedly said that the problem had been adequately fixed and that the sub would submerge and proceed towards Mar del Plata. The last contact was made at 07:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday 15 November. It is not known what happened to the sub after that contact. Argentine navy protocol stipulates that in peace time, submarines make contact twice a day with the base. When the submarine failed to call in, the Argentine navy began its search. There are 44 crew on board the submarine, which is under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew are men but there is also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old is the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. Her family says it was Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk's dream to become a submariner Nicknamed ""the queen of the sea"" by her father she comes from OberÃ¡, a city in northern Argentina. Despite having been born and raised far inland, her relatives say that ""she was born to be a submariner"", citing her ""will of steel"" and a passion for her job. The rest of the crew is made up of submariners of varying ages and experience. The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, has been on the ARA San Juan for 11 years, local media reported. Accidents involving submarines are rare. Here are some of the most serious: All 70 crew aboard China'sGreat WallMing-class submarine suffocated in 2003 when a diesel engine malfunctioned, consuming the vessel's oxygen supply Russia'sKursksubmarine sank in the Barents Sea in 2000 aftera torpedo exploded during an exercise, killing all 118 on board, including 23 who survived the blast but died due to a lack of oxygen TheUSS Scorpionsank in the Atlantic in 1968, possibly because a torpedo exploded, killing the 99 crew TheUSS Threshersank during diving tests in 1963, killing all 129 on board - the biggest submarine death toll in history Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Russia, Peru, South Africa, Uruguay and the UK are among the countries that have sent either ships or planes to help with the search. The US navy has deployed two underwater vehicles which use sonar to create images of the sea floor. A Nasa research aircraft has also flown over the search area but failed to spot anything.

Mr Gove said there would not be a ""gap"" in animal welfare provisions as a result of the vote, once the UK left the EU, because the UK would ""ensure we have stronger protection written into law"". He argued that the EU legislation was ""poorly designed"" and said there was ""no way in which animal protection can be diminished in any way, in any shape, or in any form"". But Ms Lucas said the government had been ""backpedalling"" since the vote: ""What I was told in the chamber was that they had no need to take any account of my amendment because this principle of animal sentience was already recognised in UK law in the Animal Welfare Act of 2006. ""Now that is patently untrue, wrong and I am very glad in the last 24 hours Michael Gove and others have been rapidly backpedalling and admitting that that's not true."" And David Cameron's ex-director of communications suggested Mr Gove reflect on the impact of social media during the EU referendum - in which he was a passionate Leave campaigner.

British Veterinary Association senior vice president Gudrun Ravetz told the BBC that there was a ""significant difference"" between the Article 13 EU protocol, which put a duty on the state to pay full regard to animal welfare when formulating and implementing policies, and the UK legislation, the 2006 Animal Welfare Act, which put the duty on the owner. The first was ""explicit"" about ""animal sentience"", the latter was only ""implicit about sentience of animals and vertebrates"". ""That is a very important principle, we have the duty of animal welfare for the owner and keeper under the Animal Welfare Act, and that will continue but what we want to see is that duty to the state,"" she added. Mr Gove was a relatively late convert to social media, only joining Twitter in June 2016 after he was sacked as a minister by Theresa May.

"Captain Smith leads Australia recoveryCaptain Steve Smith's unbeaten 64 helps Australia recover to 165-4, trailing England by 137 after two days of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane.3h3 hours agoBBC SportComments","This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: The best TMS moments as Australia fight back First Ashes Test, Gabba, Brisbane (day two of five) England 302:Vince 83, Malan 56, Stoneman 53 Australia 165-4:Smith 64*, Marsh 44* Australia trail by 137 runs Scorecard Australia captain Steve Smith withstood the charge of the England bowlers to leave the first Ashes Test delicately poised after two days in Brisbane. On a fascinating and, at times, thrilling day, Smith made an unbeaten 64 to lead his side to 165-4, 137 behind. That was a significant recovery from 76-4 as England's attack, expertly marshalled by skipper Joe Root, was excellent in the scorching afternoon heat. Smith combined with Shaun Marsh, who is 44 not out, for an unbroken partnership of 89. The tourists earlier lost their last six wickets for 56 runs to slip to 302 all out. In control when Dawid Malan (56) and Moeen Ali (38) were together, England surrendered the initiative in a whirl of poor shots, aggression from Australia's fast bowlers and the trickery of off-spinner Nathan Lyon. He claimed two wickets, while pace bowlers Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins finished with three each. To slump from 246-4 was feeble from England, but their total was put into context as Australia struggled to score freely on a pitch that remains slower than a usual Gabba wicket. Although Smith and Marsh were solid later in the day, England are well in the hunt to end Australia's 29-year unbeaten run on this ground. England can expect more bouncers but Australia have a soft underbelly - Agnew 'This game is in the balance' - TMS podcast with Agnew & Vaughan Listen to Test Match Special highlights of day two Marriage proposal in pitch-side Gabba pool Steve Smith's fifty spanned 112 balls and contained five fours If a first day when England reached 196-4 was attritional, disrupted by rain and not enough to really stir the crowd, then day two was when the Ashes excitement truly arrived. It was cut and thrust as soon as play resumed at 09:30 local time, England more intent to play shots and finding the boundary with regularity. When Australia's bowlers began to target England with short bowling, the hostility shown to the visiting batsmen rallied the home support. For the first time in the match, the Gabba lived up to its 'Gabbatoir' nickname as the sight of an England collapse in front of baying fans evoked memories of the 5-0 whitewash in 2013-14. Still, the Barmy Army were lively throughout, trading songs with hundreds of Australia supporters dressed as the late commentator Richie Benaud on a scorching afternoon. During the Australia fightback, noise dropped as tension grew and at one point a scuffle in the crowd had to be broken up by the police. However, perhaps the biggest cheer of the day had nothing to do with cricket, instead greeting a successful marriage proposal in the boundary-side swimming pool. Michael Langridge proposes to Tori Roebuck For a while in the afternoon, it looked as though the brilliance of England's bowlers would take advantage of Australia's brittle batting. With Root directing fielders according to careful plans and the attack showing the discipline and skill to execute them, the top order was dismantled. Debutant opener Cameron Bancroft poked at a wide one to be caught behind off Stuart Broad, while off-spinner Moeen, on after only eight overs, pinned Usman Khawaja in front. Jake Ball claimed the crucial wicket of David Warner, the vice-captain tamely chipping to short mid-wicket, and James Anderson successfully reviewed a not-out decision to have Peter Handscomb lbw. Smith, the top-ranked batsman in the world, stood firm throughout and gave no chances as he shuffled across his stumps to score almost exclusively on the leg side. He found an ally in Marsh, who was controversially recalled to the side but grew in stature as the final session wore on. Marsh twice edged through the slips, once off Moeen and once off Root's part-time off-spin. In the end, it was England who were happier to see the close. The tourists and Ashes holders will come back fresher on Saturday, looking to break the fifth-wicket partnership in order to attack the lower order. Steve Smith and Shaun Marsh survived the final 37 overs of the day While Malan and Moeen were extending their fifth-wicket stand - worth 33 overnight - to 83, it looked like England would reap full rewards for their day-one patience. Malan, the third Ashes debutant in England's top five to pass 50, played drives and hooks and Moeen swept Lyon as Australia's bowling seemed there for the taking. But when Malan was sloppily suckered into hooking Starc straight to deep square-leg, it began a collapse reminiscent ofEngland's defeat four years ago. Australia's pace bowlers were energised into a barrage of short-pitched deliveries and Jonny Bairstow, Ball and Broad also fell to the short ball. At the other end, Lyon trapped Moeen lbw and bowled a driving Chris Woakes to pick up the wickets his performance deserved. It took Broad's swiping 20 to get England past 300, but from their earlier position they will surely feel like they should have scored more. CricViz analyses the state of the match, the past 500 Tests, players' records and the characteristics of a ground to estimate the probability of each result England seamer James Anderson on BBC Test Match Special:""Every batsman that has come in has said they don't know what a good score is. ""If we come out and get two early wickets tomorrow, then 300 is a pretty good score."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS:""I found today really, really exciting to watch. ""The game is in the balance. It's been fascinating. When I team scores 302, those kind of scores tend to bring out really good Test matches. Australia spinner Nathan Lyon:""There were a lot of nerves around for our first innings - there are in every Test. ""We need to bat as long as we can, get to their score and hopefully past it. The bowlers need to fight hard with the stick."" This is the third time England have reached 300 batting first at the Gabba; they won on both previous occasions, in 1936-37 and 1986-87 England have only lost once at the Gabba when scoring at least 300 in their first innings, when they made 325 in 2002-03 All three of Jake Ball's Test wickets have been top-three batsmen: Azhar Ali, Cheteshwar Pujara and David Warner Australia have only won one Ashes Test at the Gabba when conceding a first-innings lead batting second (1990-91) 'England should expect more bouncers' Starc 'can't wait' for quick Ashes pitch Couple get engaged in the Gabba's pool How Smith dug Australia out of trouble - relive Ashes day two Vince hits 83 before Australia rally England in Australia 2017-18 Test Match Special: Clips and Podcast TMS Facebook TMS Twitter England and Wales Cricket Board Cricket Australia Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser EFL Cup semi-final: Spurs v Liverpool back underway as Bentancur suffers concerning injury West Ham to appoint Potter after sacking Lopetegui Scottish Premiership: Maeda puts Celtic ahead & Killie opener disallowed Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the factory he used to work in to find out how they bake 1.4 million loaves a week Dara Ã  Briain and Isy Suttie discover strange-but-true tales The pair are joined by astronaut Helen Sharman to learn about how humans learned to survive in space A round-up of 2024's top sports stories.

"Man in handcuffs crashes police carDrink-driver Dominic O'Neill was handcuffed and placed in the back of the police car, but ""managed to drive off"".1han hour agoLeicester","Dominic O'Neill crashed a police car while he was in custody wearing handcuffs A drink-driver who tried to escape in a police car and crashed into cars while wearing handcuffs has been jailed. Dominic O'Neill, 38, was detained and placed in the back, but ""managed to get into the driver's seat and drive off"" in Leicester, on 21 October. O'Neill was sentenced to 16 months in prison for several motoring offences at Leicester Crown Court. Leicestershire Police said its officers had ""received advice"" surrounding the circumstances of the crash. More news from across the East Midlands Police said officers, who were on patrol on Abbey Park Road, identified a car which was driving on false plates. O'Neill, of Lincoln Street in the city, was ""driving the car and failed to stop"" for the officers. A short while later officers stopped the car on Parker Drive where O'Neill was detained and handcuffed. Police said he was placed in the back of the car, but ""managed to get into the driver's seat and drive off"". The offender crashed and damaged two vehicles which were stationary at traffic lights. He abandoned the police car and ran off, but was arrested nearby. O'Neill was charged and admitted aggravated vehicle taking/dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, using a vehicle on a road/public place without third party insurance and driving a motor vehicle with alcohol levels above the limit. As well as the jail-term, he also had to pay a victim surcharge of Â£140 and was disqualified from driving for four years and eight months.

"New Zimbabwe president sworn inEmmerson Mnangagwa, the former vice president, returned from exile to take up office.","This video can not be played President Mnangagwa called Robert Mugabe ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"" Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa has addressed a packed stadium, vowing to serve all citizens. He said he felt ""deeply humbled"" to take the role. And he said he was ""not oblivious to the many Zimbabweans from across the political and racial divide who have helped make this day."" He paid tribute to his predecessor Robert Mugabe - to muted applause - calling him ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"". Mr Mugabe left office dramatically this week after 37 years of authoritarian rule. His departure followed a power struggle in which Mr Mnangagwa was sacked as vice president to pave the way for Grace Mugabe, the then-first lady, to take up the presidency. Mr Mnangagwa fled the country but returned to a hero's welcome and on Friday struck a conciliatory tone. ""The task at hand is that of rebuilding our country,"" he said. ""I am required to serve our country as the president of all citizens regardless of colour, creed, religion, tribe, totem or political affiliation."" Follow live updates from a historic day The ceremony in pictures Although Mr Mnangagwa has unseated Zimbabwe's long-time ruler, he is still associated by many with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since the country gained independence in 1980. He was the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed. But he has denied any role in the massacres, blaming the army. Tens of thousands of people packed the National Sports Stadium in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, to witness the inauguration. Pop singer Jah Prayzer provided the entertainment and, as people in the crowd danced, the atmosphere was closer to that of a concert. Dignitaries, including leaders from various African countries, filed in to cheers. Opposition leaders Morgan Tsvangirai and Joice Mujuru - who both had their sights on the presidency at various times - were there. Will Mnangagwa be different from Mugabe? Mnangagwa: Profile of 'the crocodile' What's next for Zimbabwe? Mr Mnangagwa was led in the oath of office by Chief Justice Luke Malaba, saying he would ""be faithful to Zimbabwe"", ""protect and promote the rights and people of Zimbabwe"" and discharge his duties to the best of his abilities. Mr Mnangagwa was accompanied by his wife Auxilia and gave her a kiss after the green presidential sash was placed around his neck. No - and the official reason given was that at 93, the former president needed to rest. But the fact he is not attending is a reminder that this is no ordinary transition, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports, and that despite Mr Mugabe's official resignation he was forced out by the military. On Thursday, several reports suggested Mr Mugabe had been granted immunity from prosecution. President Mugabe was accused of preparing the presidency for his wife Grace Local media are reporting that Mr Mnangagwa has offered the Mugabe family ""maximum security and welfare"". The former president ""expressed his good wishes and support for the incoming president,"" the Herald newspaper reports. The news on Tuesday that Mr Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations. It came in the form of a letter read out in parliament, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. He had been under pressure since the military took control of the country a week before, seizing the headquarters of the national broadcaster. Although Mr Mugabe was largely under house arrest for several days, he appeared to be resisting pressure to stand down. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets of Harare to urge him to go. The demonstration was led by veterans of the country's war of independence, who last year turned against him. This video can not be played A pensioner, an activist and a white farmer share hopes for Zimbabwe's future On Sunday, Zanu-PF sacked Mr Mugabe as its leader. Two days later, he resigned as president. In his letter, he said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Zimbabwe's economy is in a very bad state. It has not recovered fully from crises in the last decade, when rampant inflation grew so bad the country had to abandon its own currency. Now, according to some estimates, 90% of people there are unemployed. Its main industrial index has slumped by 40% since last week's military intervention and the stock market has shed $6bn (Â£4.5bn) in a week. Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Ten numbers that will help you understand what's going on Analysts say the market is now correcting itself, optimistic of a change of economic policy under Mr Mnangagwa. However,the International Monetary Fund has warned that Zimbabwe must act quickly to dig its economy out of a holeand access international financial aid. In his speech, Mr Mnangagwa said he would base a new economic policy on agriculture and foreign direct investment. He has pledged to create jobs. He also said the country's land reform programme would not be reversed, but pledged to compensate farmers for the land that was confiscated from them. The seizure of land from white farmers is seen as a key factor in the country's economic meltdown. On Thursday, Zimbabwe's main opposition MDC party called for deep-rooted political reform to dismantle the repressive apparatus that sustained Mr Mugabe's regime. This video can not be played Leader of the opposition MDC party, Morgan Tsvangirai, warns of a ""power retention agenda"" MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai said the ""culture of violence"" and ""culture of corruption"" had to be changed after ""after so many years of Zanu-PF misrule"". It is unclear whether Zanu-PF will govern alone ahead of scheduled elections next year, or whether a coalition government of national unity that includes opposition groups will be formed. Mr Mnangagwa confirmed in his speech that elections would be held as planned. What next for Zimbabwe?

Political row could force Irish election,"Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin could fight a fresh election in the coming months The Republic of Ireland could face a general election after the country's second largest party tabled a motion of no confidence in the deputy prime minister. The Fianna FÃ¡il motion against Frances Fitzgerald comes over her handling of a police whistleblower controversy. Her party, Fine Gael, passed a motion to support her at an emergency party meeting on Thursday night. Fianna FÃ¡il front bench members lodged the motion for debate next Tuesday. Fine Gael lead the minority government with the support of Fianna FÃ¡il. Fianna FÃ¡il, the main opposition party, agreed to back a Fine Gael minority government after the 2016 general electiondid not return a majority government. Irish government 'new politics' era survives first year Fianna FÃ¡il agrees to back minority Fine Gael government Audit reveals Garda irregularities Timeline: Controversies dog Garda Under the terms of the confidence and supply arrangement, Fianna FÃ¡il agreed not to vote against the minority government in confidence motions and to support it for three budgets, two of which are now past. Now, the government looks likely to collapse, forcing a snap election next month, unless Ms Fitzgerald resigns before the no confidence motion is debated. Frances Fitzgerald was Irish minister for justice during a police whistleblower controversy Sinn FÃ©in, the country's third largest party,had tabled their own no confidence motion on Thursday. It is due to be debated and voted on next week. Ms Fitzgerald has been under pressure over her handling of an ongoing controversy around a Garda (police) whistleblower when she was Irish justice minister. What we are witnessing is a game of call my bluff, involving three political parties. The decision by Sinn FÃ©in to put down a motion of no confidence in Frances Fitzgerald was aimed at calling Fianna FÃ¡il's bluff. That's because Fianna FÃ¡il has an agreement with the minority-led Fine Gael government whereby they were prepared to support them in a confidence-and-supply arrangement. But Fianna FÃ¡il called Sinn FÃ©in's bluff by deciding to put down their motion of no confidence which will take precedence over the Sinn FÃ©in one -  at a time when Sinn FÃ©in is undergoing generational change. Fine Gael is now calling Fianna FÃ¡il's bluff by saying they are prepared to go to the country over this issue. Once TDs go back into their constituencies they will face questions from the public:  How can you bring down a government over a missing or forgotten email by Frances Fitzgerald during key Brexit talks, when many thousands of people are homeless and there are huge hospital waiting lists? Fine Gael normally prides itself on putting the country before the party. I wouldn't be surprised if, in the coming days, Frances Fitzgerald fell on her sword. Ms Fitzgerald has faced questions in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) about what she knew about what lawyers were going to put to a whistleblower at a commission of enquiry. In particular, she has been questioned over her account of an email she received about the legal strategy of the former Garda commissioner in the case of Sgt Maurice McCabe. Ms Fitzgerald has recently admitted that she was made aware a year earlier than she had previously stated, that lawyers for the Garda were going to attempt to discredit Sgt McCabe. The email was initially sent to Ms Fitzgerald in May 2015, but she told the DÃ¡il earlier this week that she could not remember reading it. Speaking to Irish national broadcaster RTÃ, Fianna FÃ¡il justice spokesperson Jim O'Callaghan said that Ms Fitzgerald ""should go"". He said that party leader MicheÃ¡l Martin had expressed this view to Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told RTÃ that the government would continue to support Ms Fitzgerald and that calls for her resignation were ""built on sand"".

May to warn EU of 'hostile state' threatPM will also meet European Council President Donald Tusk to discuss Brexit progress.11h11 hours agoUK Politics,"Theresa May met German's Angela Merkel and other EU leaders Issues still need to be resolved but progress is being made in Brexit negotiations, Theresa May has insisted. The prime minister said there had been a ""very positive atmosphere"" in talks with several EU leaders in Brussels. The UK, she said, would honour its financial commitments and shared the same desire as Ireland to stop barriers to trade or movement across the border. EU Council President Donald Tusk said talks could move to the next phase in December but it was a ""huge challenge"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At a security summit in Brussels, Mrs May had lunch with Angela Merkel and also met Mr Tusk, who told her last week that she has until the start of December to make an enhanced offer on money and provide guarantees on the Irish border after Brexit. Ministers have given her their backing to increase the UK's ""divorce bill"" but only if the EU shows movement on trade. The government has refused to comment on reports it had agreed to pay about Â£40bn to pave the way for EU leaders to approve the next phase of talks on future relations at a summit on 14 December. All you need to know about Brexit DUP hits out at Irish government on Brexit Brexit: UK 'ready to pay more to EU' Speaking in Brussels, Mrs May did not answer specific questions about money and said there were ""still issues across the various matters that we're negotiating on to be resolved"". But she added: ""There's been a very positive atmosphere in the talks and a genuine feeling that we want to move forward together."" Last week, Mr Tusk said the EU was ""ready"" to move on to the next phase of talks - focused on a trade and security partnership after the UK leaves in March 2019 - but the UK must first show more progress on outstanding ""separation"" issues. The BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said that after holding talks with Mrs May, Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen had told journalists in the Belgian capital that there had been ""movement"" on the issue of money. ""It seems to me that there is progress and so I have decided to be optimistic about this,"" Mr Rasmussen - one of the UK's closest allies - said. The PM also said the UK was in continuing discussions with the Irish government about the solutions for avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. No 10 earlier had to clarify its position after a spokesman appeared to suggest the possibility of Northern Ireland staying in the customs union may be up for negotiation. Asked about the issue at a lobby briefing, the spokesman said the UK must ""continue to negotiate to find an innovative way forward"". But Downing Street later insisted that the UK's stated policy - that the whole of the UK is leaving the single market and customs union - remained in force. The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and served the EU with formal notice of Brexit in March 2017. This began a two-year countdown to the UK's departure day which will be in March 2019.

On a fascinating and, at times, thrilling day, Smith made an unbeaten 64 to lead his side to 165-4, 137 behind. That was a significant recovery from 76-4 as England's attack, expertly marshalled by skipper Joe Root, was excellent in the scorching afternoon heat. Smith combined with Shaun Marsh, who is 44 not out, for an unbroken partnership of 89. The tourists earlier lost their last six wickets for 56 runs to slip to 302 all out. In control when Dawid Malan (56) and Moeen Ali (38) were together, England surrendered the initiative in a whirl of poor shots, aggression from Australia's fast bowlers and the trickery of off-spinner Nathan Lyon. He claimed two wickets, while pace bowlers Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins finished with three each. To slump from 246-4 was feeble from England, but their total was put into context as Australia struggled to score freely on a pitch that remains slower than a usual Gabba wicket.

When Australia's bowlers began to target England with short bowling, the hostility shown to the visiting batsmen rallied the home support. For the first time in the match, the Gabba lived up to its 'Gabbatoir' nickname as the sight of an England collapse in front of baying fans evoked memories of the 5-0 whitewash in 2013-14. Still, the Barmy Army were lively throughout, trading songs with hundreds of Australia supporters dressed as the late commentator Richie Benaud on a scorching afternoon. During the Australia fightback, noise dropped as tension grew and at one point a scuffle in the crowd had to be broken up by the police. However, perhaps the biggest cheer of the day had nothing to do with cricket, instead greeting a successful marriage proposal in the boundary-side swimming pool. Michael Langridge proposes to Tori Roebuck For a while in the afternoon, it looked as though the brilliance of England's bowlers would take advantage of Australia's brittle batting. With Root directing fielders according to careful plans and the attack showing the discipline and skill to execute them, the top order was dismantled. Debutant opener Cameron Bancroft poked at a wide one to be caught behind off Stuart Broad, while off-spinner Moeen, on after only eight overs, pinned Usman Khawaja in front. Jake Ball claimed the crucial wicket of David Warner, the vice-captain tamely chipping to short mid-wicket, and James Anderson successfully reviewed a not-out decision to have Peter Handscomb lbw. Smith, the top-ranked batsman in the world, stood firm throughout and gave no chances as he shuffled across his stumps to score almost exclusively on the leg side. He found an ally in Marsh, who was controversially recalled to the side but grew in stature as the final session wore on. Marsh twice edged through the slips, once off Moeen and once off Root's part-time off-spin. In the end, it was England who were happier to see the close. The tourists and Ashes holders will come back fresher on Saturday, looking to break the fifth-wicket partnership in order to attack the lower order. Steve Smith and Shaun Marsh survived the final 37 overs of the day While Malan and Moeen were extending their fifth-wicket stand - worth 33 overnight - to 83, it looked like England would reap full rewards for their day-one patience. Malan, the third Ashes debutant in England's top five to pass 50, played drives and hooks and Moeen swept Lyon as Australia's bowling seemed there for the taking. But when Malan was sloppily suckered into hooking Starc straight to deep square-leg, it began a collapse reminiscent ofEngland's defeat four years ago. Australia's pace bowlers were energised into a barrage of short-pitched deliveries and Jonny Bairstow, Ball and Broad also fell to the short ball. At the other end, Lyon trapped Moeen lbw and bowled a driving Chris Woakes to pick up the wickets his performance deserved.

Guess Who? Tom Baker returns as DoctorThe actor makes a surprise return to complete an unfinished story 38 years after it was abandoned.7h7 hours agoCambridgeshire,"This video can not be played Tom Baker returns on camera as the Doctor in Shada Tom Baker has made a surprise appearance on camera as Doctor Who, donning his trademark stripy scarf in a newly-released episode. The 83-year-old actor has returned to complete the unfinished story Shada, filmed in Cambridge, 38 years after it was abandoned. The parts not filmed in 1979 will be completed with animation and Baker's voice, but he has also filmed a scene. Baker, the fourth Doctor, played the Time Lord between 1974 and 1981. Heis seen by fans of the show as one of the best actors in the role. The story finds the Doctor in Cambridge working alongside Romana and a retired Time Lord Filming for Shada, which was written by Douglas Adams at the same time as he was creating The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was started in 1979. But strike action at the BBC meant studio scenes were never completed and the episodes were abandoned. It has now been released by BBC Worldwide, with the original footage combined with new colour animations and voiceovers to complete the story. In the new scene, Baker was filmed on the set of theoriginal Tardisas it appeared in 1979. Missing scenes of the Shada adventures have been animated Speaking about returning to the role, Baker said the Doctor ""probably never left me"". ""That's why I can't stay away from it, it was a lovely time of my life,"" he added. ""I loved doing Doctor Who, it was life to me. I used to dread the end of rehearsal because then real life would impinge on me. Doctor Who... when I was in full flight, then I was happy."" Of his time filming Shada in Cambridge in 1979, Baker said: ""Mostly I remember being mocked by the students on the [River] Cam because I wasn't very good at punting, I kept losing the pole."" Tom Baker starred in Shada alongside Romana, played by Lalla Ward The newly-recorded lines from Baker as the Doctor and Lalla Ward as his companion Romana follow the original script by Douglas Adams. The story finds the Doctor in Cambridge working alongside Romana and a retired Time Lord, Professor Chronotis, to defeat the evil alien Skagra who is attempting to steal the secrets to the prison planet Shada. Jem Roberts, author of The Frood: The Authorised and Very Official History of Douglas Adams, said Adams later used the character Chronotis and parts of the plot in his novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. ""Adams was probably glad that Shada was not finished, so he could use it for the backbone of his novel. He was a great believer in recycling,"" he said. Baker has returned to the role of the Doctor in audio plays and appeared as the Curator in the 2013 50th anniversary special The Day of the Doctor. He last appeared on screen as the Doctor in a 1993 Children in Need special. Shada is available to buy now as a digital download and will be released on DVD and Blu-ray on 4 December.

The making and unmaking of Pistorius,"He was one of the world's most successful sportsmen, an inspiration to millions, but now Oscar Pistorius is serving a five-year sentence for killing his girlfriend. Sixteen years ago, breathless after the 75m swim, he climbs out of the pool with his stumps trailing behind him, and into the arms of his friends. He clambers on to the back of a classmate, Deon, who trots off with the grinning 12-year-old Oscar as cargo. The second part of the race is an 800m run, and the route stretches ahead of them under a blue Johannesburg sky. As the five young racers pass the netball courts, they leave behind the concrete path and feel the soft grass of the school playing fields underfoot. Cheyne is in front, carrying Oscar's prosthetic legs under his arms. Oscar is carried over the finish line by Kaylem, who won the race but doubled back to pick up his friend. Like a human relay baton, Oscar completes the race after being passed from one friend to another, according to a pre-arranged plan. Deon carries Oscar while Cheyne carries his friend's prosthetics This vignette from early 1999 at Constantia Kloof Primary School in Roodepoort, near Johannesburg, sums up the childhood of Oscar Pistorius - never left out, surrounded by friends, often the centre of attention. Last year, he was the focus of attention during a six-month trial after shooting his girlfriend through a toilet door. The attack happened just months after he was the poster boy at the London Paralympics and made history by competing in the Olympic Games three weeks earlier. The life of Pistorius can be seen in two arcs. There is one story of extraordinary determination - how this boy with no evident running talent at 12 somehow scaled the heights of sport in just a few years. But the second story is how that innocent boy became, as weeks of testimony in court suggested, a man plagued by his temper, with a reckless love for guns and speed - condemned by the judge as ""negligent"" when he pulled the trigger. In one of Oscar's earliest memories, he hurtled down a hill near his home, in his brother Carl's go-kart, as the two of them began a lifelong passion for speed - they were ""adrenalin junkies"", Pistorius later wrote in his autobiography, Blade Runner. As the wall at the bottom of the hill loomed in front of them, with no brakes on the kart, Carl grabbed Oscar's prosthetic leg, yanked it off and pushed it into the wheel to bring the vehicle to a sudden stop. This narrow escape did nothing to dampen his new addiction - aged four he was riding mini-motorbikes. Soon after he was racing his father at go-karting. Aged 15, he was driving his brother's Golf, and as an adult a speedboating accident nearly ended his career. This hotheaded adventurousness in the young boy was partly encouraged by his family, who were determined that his disability would not make him a spectator in life. In the Pistorius family, who lived in a comfortable part of Johannesburg, no-one was allowed to say ""I can't."" Born with no fibulas - the smaller of the two lower leg bones -  Oscar's legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. Six months later, he received his first prosthetics, a defining moment in his life, he later said. This plaster and mesh fitted with a lycra ""skin"" was a liberation. Immediately, he says, he felt invincible and his energy was boundless. ""I believe that it was at this time in my life that my personality was shaped, and that my family was instrumental in laying the foundation stones of my competitive nature, and of the man that I am today,"" he wrote in Blade Runner. His mother was a huge influence. She put inspirational notes into the lunchboxes of her children, and one letter she wrote for him he still keeps: ""The real loser is never the person who crosses the finishing line last. The real loser is the person who sits on the side, the person who does not even try to compete."" Getting ready for school, she would say: ""Carl, put on your shoes. Oscar, put on your legs."" He was different, but equal. In fact, the young Oscar didn't feel different at all. ""He didn't like to be reminded that he was different because mentally he wasn't different,"" says Gianni Merlo, who co-authored Pistorius' book. ""This was because of the way his mother brought him up as a kid. He has a spirit that is completely different because he was born that way. Without knowing what it feels like to be normal, you feel normal."" As well as providing an emergency brake for go-karts, there were other advantages to prosthetic legs. Oscar never had to wear cricket pads and he could leave his leg dangling against a hot oven and not suffer terrible burns. Children at the beach marvelled at his small round footprints, while opponents on the rugby field who tackled him were left clutching an artificial limb. Carl suffered serious injuries in a road accident last month A major inspiration was a teacher at Constantia Kloof, Tessa Shellard, who encouraged him to take part in sports, even putting him in the school team for a prestigious nationwide triathlon series, despite him not being the best athlete. ""I gave him the opportunity that maybe others didn't give him. I saw a youngster with a disability but one who had it within himself to persevere. He was like a little hero in my heart that, at that young age, he gave so much."" He usually gave it everything, even though he often came last. That biathlon race, in which he was carried by his friends, came on a day when his prosthetics were hurting him and so they hatched a plan to spare him the pain. Oscar was bubbly and full of energy, says Shellard, and in 2007 he came back to the school and signed a photo of the two of them, writing: ""Times of change, memories still the same, thank you for all the times you helped me up."" Aged nine, he had his first fist-fight - over a girl - and more followed. The family's response? His father and grandfather taught him how to box. This was the time when he first learned to defend himself, he says, and he later proved on several occasions that he was never slow in lashing out, usually verbally, at people who annoyed him. The most public example was when, after defeat in the 200m at the London Paralympics, he accused Brazilian Alan Oliveira of using illegal blades - an incident captured on live TV. Despite this pluckiness, he showed little sporting talent in his early teens. That didn't shine until Pretoria Boys School, when he was able to use much lighter prosthetics, thanks to a family friend and design engineer, Chris Hatting. Initially it was endurance running, not sprinting, that interested him. He was showing ability in 10km races, and enjoying rugby and water polo. His discovery of sports in which he could properly compete, not just take part, meant his schooldays were generally happy - but three life-changing events cast a more sombre light on these years. The first was the divorce of his parents, which meant Oscar and his siblings were separated from their father and lived with their mother in a smaller house. Perhaps as a way to bridge this distance, his father bought Oscar and Carl a small speedboat and his sons found yet another means to race against each other - this time on water-skis. Then in March 2002 his mother Sheila died. To the 15-year-old it felt like his world's guiding light had been extinguished. He has the dates of her birth and death tattooed on his right arm. ""Sport was my salvation, as it helped me get through this difficult time,"" he wrote. ""My mother had been a strong woman, the centre of my world. Sporting activity was the only thing that could distract me from such a loss."" His aunt Diana stepped in to play a greater part in the upbringing of Oscar, Carl and Aimee. She says Sheila was such a devoted mother that her death required a ""huge adjustment at a difficult time developmentally"" for the three teenagers. ""Sheila valued each of her children for their individual talents and was proud of them,"" says Oscar's aunt, Diana Binge. ""Strict, loving, spontaneous and always game for fun, she was also a devout Christian who brought her children up to observe the Christian way of life, something she tried to demonstrate in her own relationships. ""She was open about Oscar's disability and shared her experience in bringing Oscar up in order to encourage other parents of disabled children. Oscar has continued her legacy of helping others. ""Sheila had unique relationships with each of her children and losing her would have left a unique gap in each of their lives, which each of them had to handle in their own way."" A year after his mother's death came the third life-changing event - he shattered his knee on the rugby pitch. It came at a time when he had been working hard on his general fitness, to complement his rugby and water polo. One trainer, Jannie Brooks, has spoken about how Pistorius used his gym in Pretoria for six months - boxing, skipping and doing press-ups - before he realised he had no legs. ""He was just one of the bunch, doing everything at the same pace as everybody else."" But after the injury, he was back with the same medics who had carried out the amputations when he was a baby, and his recovery was slow. It was during his rehabilitation, supervised by the University of Pretoria, that he was advised to take up sprinting to help the knee joint recover. At the same time, Hatting - now working for a firm in the US - was working on new, lighter prosthetics and he invited Oscar to fly to the US to try the Flex-Foot Cheetah blades, manufactured by Ossur. Three weeks after taking up sprinting, Pistorius ran his first 100m race. With his father watching in Bloemfontein, he won the race in a time faster than any double amputee had achieved before - 11.72s. A star was born. Eight months later, he won the 200m gold at the Paralympics in Athens and his life changed forever. It was at this moment - September 2004 - that the world woke up to his talent and personality. Before long he began running against non-disabled athletes, first in a Golden Gala 400m race in Rome in 2007, finishing second, and then in Sheffield where, in very wet conditions, he finished last. The question now began to be asked whether his prosthetics gave him an advantage. It was a huge blow when, the following year, the world governing body for athletics (IAAF) concluded that they did, and banned them. But he fought the decision and won an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, paving the way for him to compete in the summer Olympic Games in Beijing later that year. Failing to qualify, he set his sights on London in 2012, where in due course he became the first track and field athlete to compete in both Paralympic and Olympic Games. ""Oscar, with his personality, athletic prowess and the fact that he was trying to compete in the able-bodied Olympics made him the big breakthrough name, who brought sponsorship in Paralympic sport to the next level, internationally,"" says Paralympic commentator Tony Garrett, who has known Pistorius since he burst on to the scene in Athens. Not only was he a very good athlete, says Garrett, one who broke down the barriers between disabled and non-disabled sport, he was a good-looking young man full of vitality, ready to take on the world. Pistorius has always strongly rejected the suggestion that his fight to compete in the Olympics meant he regarded Paralympic sport as second-rate. He says he just believed it was unfair to exclude disabled athletes from taking part, if they were good enough. ""I am not a Paralympic athlete, nor an Olympic athlete. I am simply an athlete and sprinter."" Despite his relatively privileged background, his achievements made him a hero to many South Africans, even if they came from different communities. He was a unifying figure. ""For us South Africans,"" wrote Justice Malala in the Guardian, ""it is impossible to watch Oscar Pistorius run without... wanting to break down and cry and shout with joy."" But as the sponsorship deals and media appearances multiplied, Garrett was not the only person to notice a change in the man he knew. In 2011, Pistorius hadstormed out of a BBC radio interview,externalafter taking exception to a question about his fight to take part in non-disabled athletics. Then there was the outburst at the London Games, when he lashed out at Alan Oliveira. Another South African Paralympian, Arnu Fourie, told a journalist he had to change rooms in the athletes' village because Pistorius was shouting on the phone so much. ""His lifestyle and image changed and clearly something got to him and he wasn't the same person, there were so many demands on his time,"" says Garrett. ""I think he let rip every so often and he wouldn't have done that a few years ago."" Other acquaintances concur that his character subtly altered. Sports journalist Graeme Joffe, who co-owned a racehorse called Tiger Canyon with Pistorius and three others, first met him 13 years ago. Then Pistorius was an athlete of enormous promise and Joffe was really impressed by his confidence and charisma. ""But three years ago, the syndicate was put together and I and some of the other owners met him at the stables. I immediately thought there was something about Oscar that had changed,"" he says. ""He was a different man to the one I had interviewed so many times, in the sense that he was a bit stand-offish and a little bit cold, not his usual warm self."" Joffe says he had taken note of Pistorius' behaviour towards the BBC interviewer, and was aware of an earlier incident when Pistorius, captaining a speedboat, was involved in an accident in which someone could have been killed. ""These were big red flags for me and I was quite surprised that no-one in the media or in his management team condemned it publicly,"" says Joffe. ""He was showing a spoilt-brat attitude that came out a year later at the Paralympics [in 2012] when he embarrassed the country."" This wasn't just about fame going to his head, says Joffe, there were other incidents over the years that suggested an aggressive side and a recklessness that the public didn't see - at least not until the trial. There was a gun that went off in a restaurant and another shot through a car roof, and the odd verbal and physical fight. The South African media didn't explore this unpalatable side of the national hero, says Joffe. And journalists who questioned whether Pistorius' blades could give him an advantage were given no more interviews. What did make headlines - at least, in the celebrity press - was the romance with Reeva Steenkamp. The two met in November 2012 through a mutual friend at a motoring event and she agreed to accompany him to an awards ceremony that night as he didn't have a date. The model was already a reality show star and a regular presence on the cover of magazines. She was also hugely popular. Her best friend and housemate Gina Myers told the BBC this was a woman ""as magnificent on the inside as she was beautiful on the outside"". A friend of the couple, Del Levin, saw the couple at a dinner about two weeks before Steenkamp's death, when Levin's wife, a well known television personality, sat next to her and the two women spoke for a long time. Levin and his wife got the impression the couple, who had then known each other for about three months, were happy. By his own admission, Pistorius' relationships with women over the years have been turbulent. In his book, he referred to a ""particularly nasty argument"" here, a ""very fiery"" relationship there. ""He could get very furious suddenly,"" says his biographer Merlo. ""He spoke of a fire inside. He had tough arguments with girls and afterwards sweet reconciliation. He has always had very beautiful girlfriends. I never saw the temper but sometimes there were situations where it was [apparent]. Sometimes he can explode but I have always seen the bright part of the moon, I've never seen the dark part."" Before Pistorius became a celebrity, he was very open to people, very friendly, says Merlo, who first met the athlete in 2007 in Rome and began working on the book with him the following year. People fell in love with him when they met him, he says, but the red carpet wasn't a stage upon which he felt comfortable. ""It's not easy for a young guy who becomes a celebrity to follow the light that you see from afar that can be your light."" Merlo agrees with those who say Pistorius underwent a change. But some friends of the athlete tell a very different story - of a man full of warmth and fun who overcame life's setbacks and stayed loyal despite his fame. Levin, a marketing director, says that unlike many in Johannesburg's high society, the athlete was sincere in his affections. ""I wasn't a close friend but I got to know him over the years. He was an amazing, generous and courteous and kind person, easy to get along with, and very willing to share his own experiences and insights. ""Typically when you meet someone on the social scene, they're very cold and stand-offish and particularly if you are the spouse of someone [famous] but he was someone who embraced me from the beginning. He would see me and run over and say 'Hey' and talk, and we would catch up and see how things were. He was definitely not just faking it but genuinely interested in you."" One thing that did strike Levin was Pistorius' fears about security. He had recently bought a new home in the Johannesburg suburb of Sandton and talked about how happy he was that it was equipped with more safety features than his house in Pretoria. Pistorius sold the house where Steenkamp was killed, to pay for legal fees Little did he know that his home would become the subject of such scrutiny in the months ahead. Few bedrooms, bathrooms, doors, duvets, fans and electric sockets have been pored over in such detail. After a year in jail and now under house arrest, the freedom and companionship of the sunny playing fields of Constantia Kloof Primary School must seem a world away. Â© 2025 BBC.

Crowds gather for Zimbabwe swearing-in,"This video can not be played President Mnangagwa called Robert Mugabe ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"" Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa has addressed a packed stadium, vowing to serve all citizens. He said he felt ""deeply humbled"" to take the role. And he said he was ""not oblivious to the many Zimbabweans from across the political and racial divide who have helped make this day."" He paid tribute to his predecessor Robert Mugabe - to muted applause - calling him ""a father, mentor, comrade-in-arms and my leader"". Mr Mugabe left office dramatically this week after 37 years of authoritarian rule. His departure followed a power struggle in which Mr Mnangagwa was sacked as vice president to pave the way for Grace Mugabe, the then-first lady, to take up the presidency. Mr Mnangagwa fled the country but returned to a hero's welcome and on Friday struck a conciliatory tone. ""The task at hand is that of rebuilding our country,"" he said. ""I am required to serve our country as the president of all citizens regardless of colour, creed, religion, tribe, totem or political affiliation."" Follow live updates from a historic day The ceremony in pictures Although Mr Mnangagwa has unseated Zimbabwe's long-time ruler, he is still associated by many with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since the country gained independence in 1980. He was the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed. But he has denied any role in the massacres, blaming the army. Tens of thousands of people packed the National Sports Stadium in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, to witness the inauguration. Pop singer Jah Prayzer provided the entertainment and, as people in the crowd danced, the atmosphere was closer to that of a concert. Dignitaries, including leaders from various African countries, filed in to cheers. Opposition leaders Morgan Tsvangirai and Joice Mujuru - who both had their sights on the presidency at various times - were there. Will Mnangagwa be different from Mugabe? Mnangagwa: Profile of 'the crocodile' What's next for Zimbabwe? Mr Mnangagwa was led in the oath of office by Chief Justice Luke Malaba, saying he would ""be faithful to Zimbabwe"", ""protect and promote the rights and people of Zimbabwe"" and discharge his duties to the best of his abilities. Mr Mnangagwa was accompanied by his wife Auxilia and gave her a kiss after the green presidential sash was placed around his neck. No - and the official reason given was that at 93, the former president needed to rest. But the fact he is not attending is a reminder that this is no ordinary transition, the BBC's Andrew Harding reports, and that despite Mr Mugabe's official resignation he was forced out by the military. On Thursday, several reports suggested Mr Mugabe had been granted immunity from prosecution. President Mugabe was accused of preparing the presidency for his wife Grace Local media are reporting that Mr Mnangagwa has offered the Mugabe family ""maximum security and welfare"". The former president ""expressed his good wishes and support for the incoming president,"" the Herald newspaper reports. The news on Tuesday that Mr Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations. It came in the form of a letter read out in parliament, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. He had been under pressure since the military took control of the country a week before, seizing the headquarters of the national broadcaster. Although Mr Mugabe was largely under house arrest for several days, he appeared to be resisting pressure to stand down. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets of Harare to urge him to go. The demonstration was led by veterans of the country's war of independence, who last year turned against him. This video can not be played A pensioner, an activist and a white farmer share hopes for Zimbabwe's future On Sunday, Zanu-PF sacked Mr Mugabe as its leader. Two days later, he resigned as president. In his letter, he said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Zimbabwe's economy is in a very bad state. It has not recovered fully from crises in the last decade, when rampant inflation grew so bad the country had to abandon its own currency. Now, according to some estimates, 90% of people there are unemployed. Its main industrial index has slumped by 40% since last week's military intervention and the stock market has shed $6bn (Â£4.5bn) in a week. Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Ten numbers that will help you understand what's going on Analysts say the market is now correcting itself, optimistic of a change of economic policy under Mr Mnangagwa. However,the International Monetary Fund has warned that Zimbabwe must act quickly to dig its economy out of a holeand access international financial aid. In his speech, Mr Mnangagwa said he would base a new economic policy on agriculture and foreign direct investment. He has pledged to create jobs. He also said the country's land reform programme would not be reversed, but pledged to compensate farmers for the land that was confiscated from them. The seizure of land from white farmers is seen as a key factor in the country's economic meltdown. On Thursday, Zimbabwe's main opposition MDC party called for deep-rooted political reform to dismantle the repressive apparatus that sustained Mr Mugabe's regime. This video can not be played Leader of the opposition MDC party, Morgan Tsvangirai, warns of a ""power retention agenda"" MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai said the ""culture of violence"" and ""culture of corruption"" had to be changed after ""after so many years of Zanu-PF misrule"". It is unclear whether Zanu-PF will govern alone ahead of scheduled elections next year, or whether a coalition government of national unity that includes opposition groups will be formed. Mr Mnangagwa confirmed in his speech that elections would be held as planned. What next for Zimbabwe?

Predatory accounts still on YouTube,"This video can not be played The Childrenâs Commissioner for England says the comments are âvery worryingâ Part of YouTube's system for reporting sexualised comments left on children's videos has not been functioning correctly for more than a year, say volunteer moderators. They say there could be up to 100,000 predatory accounts leaving indecent comments on videos. A BBC Trending investigation has discovered a flaw in a tool that enables the public to report abuse. But YouTube says it reviews the ""vast majority"" of reports within 24 hours. It says it has no technical problems in its reporting mechanism and that it takes child abuse extremely seriously. On Wednesday, the company announcednew measures to protect children on the site,external. The form where YouTube users can report violations YouTube is the world's largest video-sharing site. In addition to algorithms that can automatically block illegal and exploitative videos, it relies on users to report illegal behaviour or content that goes against its rules. The company says it has a zero-tolerance policy against any form of grooming or child endangerment. Users can use an online form to report potentially predatory accounts, and they are then asked to include links to relevant videos and comments. The reports then go to moderators - YouTube employees who review the material and have the power to delete it. However, sources told Trending that after members of the public submitted information on the form, the associated links might be missing from the report. YouTube employees could see that a particular account had been reported, but had no way of knowing which specific comments were being flagged. Highlighted: the flag icon on a YouTube account page which leads to a form where users can report violations BBC Trending was informed of the issue by members of YouTube's Trusted Flagger programme - a group that includes individuals, as well as some charities and law enforcement agencies. The programme began in 2012, and those involved have special tools to alert YouTube to potential violations. The company says reports of violations by Trusted Flaggers are accurate more than 90% of the time. The volunteers are not paid by YouTube, but do receive some perks such as invitations to conferences. With the help of a small group of Trusted Flaggers, Trending identified 28 comments directed at children that were clearly against the site's guidelines. Listen to BBC Trending radio The comments are shocking. Some of them are extremely sexually explicit. Others include the phone numbers of adults, or requests for videos to fulfil sexual fetishes. They were left on YouTube videos posted by young children and they are exactly the kind of material that should be immediately removed under YouTube's own rules - and in many cases reported to the authorities. Some of the comments found and reported on children's videos, which have now been deleted The children in the videos appeared to be younger than 13 years old, the minimum age for registering an account on YouTube. The videos themselves did not have sexual themes, but showed children emulating their favourite YouTube stars by, for instance, reviewing toys or showing their ""outfit of the day"". The explicit comments on these videos were passed on to the company using its form to report child endangerment - the same form that is available to general users. Over a period of several weeks, five of the comments were deleted, but no action was taken against the remaining 23 until Trending contacted the company and provided a full list. All of the predatory accounts were then deleted within 24 hours. The disturbing YouTube videos that are tricking children YouTube child protection mechanism 'failing' YouTube restricts 'creepy' kids' videos Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Members of the Trusted Flaggers programme told Trending that they felt their efforts in taking down such accounts and comments were not being fully supported by the company. They spoke, as a group, on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the work they do. ""We don't have access to the tools, technologies and resources a company like YouTube has or could potentially deploy,"" members of the programme told Trending. ""So for example any tools we need, we create ourselves."" ""There are loads of things YouTube could be doing to reduce this sort of activity, fixing the reporting system to start with. But for example, we can't prevent predators from creating another account and have no indication when they do, so we can take action."" YouTube has come under pressure recently because of the persistence of inappropriate and potentially illegal videos and other content on its site. BBC Trending previously reportedon spoofs of popular cartoons which contain disturbing and inappropriate content not suitable for children. The site recently announced new restrictions on the ""creepy"" videos. Recent reports byThe Times,external,Buzzfeed,externaland other outlets have also highlighted disturbing videos both featuring children and targeted towards young people. And in August, Trending revealeda huge backlog of child endangerment reports made by the Trusted Flaggers themselves. Since then, the Trusted Flaggers who spoke to Trending say more attention is paid to their reports and that most of their reports are being dealt with in days. But in part because of the shortcomings in the public reporting system, the group estimates that there are ""between 50,000 to 100,000 active predatory accounts still on the platform"". Earlier in October, YouTube announced additional measures to crack down on disturbing videos and to protect children. ""In recent months, we've noticed a growing trend around content on YouTube that attempts to pass as family-friendly, but is clearly not,"" the company saidin a blog post,external. The measures include increasing enforcement, terminating channels that might endanger children, and removing ads from some videos. The company also announced that starting this week it will disable commenting on videos of children that have attracted sexual or predatory comments. Be aware of what your children are doing on the internet. Pay particular attention to comments being made on videos and sudden spikes in popularity for content posted by children online. The NSPCC has aseries of guidelines about keeping children safe online,external They promote the acronym TEAM: Talk about staying safe online; Explore the online world together; Agree rules about what's OK and what's not; and Manage your family's settings and controls. There are more resources on theBBC Stay Safe site. In the UK, online grooming can be reported via theClick CEOP button,external. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, described the findings as ""very worrying"". ""This is a global platform and so the company need to ensure they have a global response. There needs to be a company-wide response that absolutely puts children protection as a number one priority, and has the people and mechanisms in place to ensure that no child has been put in an unsafe position while they using the platform."" The National Crime Agency told Trending: ""It is vital that online platforms used by children and young people have in place robust mechanisms and processes to prevent, identify and report sexual exploitation and abuse."" A YouTube spokesperson said: ""We receive hundreds of thousands of flags of content every day and the vast majority of content flagged for violating our guidelines is reviewed in 24 hours. ""Content that endangers children is abhorrent and unacceptable to us. ""We have systems in place to take swift action on this content with dedicated policy specialists reviewing and removing flagged material around the clock, and terminating the accounts of those that leave predatory comments outright."" The company said that in the past week they've disabled comments on thousands of videos and shut down hundreds of accounts that have made predatory comments.

'Needle abuse' found in Beijing nursery,"Authorities are investigating the RYB Education kindergarten in Beijing's Chaoyang district A Beijing nursery is accused of giving injections and feeding drugs to toddlers, in a case that has sparked outrage in China. Authorities are now investigating the nursery, which is a branch of the well-known RYB Education chain. The company says it ""deeply apologises"" for the matter that has caused ""severe disquiet"". Beijing officials are also conducting a security check in all nurseries in the Chinese capital. The incident comes weeks aftera Shanghai childcare centre was alleged to have abused several toddlers. At least eight children attending the RYB Education pre-school in the upscale Chaoyang district are said to have been injected with unknown substances. Parents told local media they had discovered needle marks on their children's bodies in recent days, and also circulated photographs online. State broadcaster CCTV aired a report showing a picture of needle marks taken by a parent They also said their children were fed pills or syrup before their naptime. One father told state broadcaster CCTV that his child had said that every day after lunch they would be given two white pills, and ""go to sleep"" after eating the pills. Local media report that some parents are also alleging possible sexual abuse, saying their children were stripped naked. On Thursday, several parents gathered outside the kindergarten to protest.Some told Caixin Global,externalthat they suspected teachers had used needles to discipline children. ""Disobedient students were also forced to stand naked or were locked up in a dark room at the kindergarten,"" one parent told the news portal. Police have seized CCTV footage at the nursery, and three teachers have also been suspended. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Education said that a ""comprehensive security check"" was being conducted in all nurseries in Beijing. One father told CCTV that his child was fed two white pills every day RYB Educationissued a statement on Thursday,external(in Chinese) saying it was co-operating with police and added: ""We deeply apologise for this matter which has brought severe disquiet to parents and society!"" It  also said: ""If any wrongdoing is found, we will not shake off the responsibility. And we have also reported to the police some false accusations against us."" The company is one of China's most well-known early childhood education providers, and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September. The case has sparked an intense outcry and reignited anxieties over childcare standards in China, which has seen other cases of abuse at nurseries in recent years. Last year four teachers at a RYB nursery in Jilin province were jailed for abuse, also involving giving injections to children. State news agency Xinhua reported at the time that one child was found to have more than 50 needle marks. RYB Education, one of China's most well-known education providers, was listed on New York Stock Exchange in September Mainstream media have extensively covered the latest Beijing case, which has drawn tens of thousands of comments on microblogging network Sina Weibo. Most expressed outrage at the nursery and education authorities, and demanded fuller explanations as well as heavier punishments for the teachers. ""Suspension? That's just too easy,"" said one commenter, while another said: ""Don't let these beasts harm anyone else!"" Many also claimed that some online discussion was being scrubbed. A check on FreeWeibo, a website which tracks censorship on the network, found the top censored search was ""Honghuanglan"", RYB Education's Chinese name. ""The authorities are covering things up, and have an attitude where they do not directly answer questions. After this, no matter what kind of explanations they give, it will be hard to believe them. They are losing public trust step by step!"" said one commenter. Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing A storm of social media attention came after a crowd of angry Beijing parents gathered outside the kindergarten. There are reports that police have already confirmed that the marks on the children are consistent with needle punctures. Realising the explosive potential for this issue to spread, the Beijing education authorities have been quick to announce a full safety check of all kindergartens under its control. Shock over the allegations follows an investigation last month into bruised children at a kindergarten in Wuhan, Hubei province and another scandal in Shanghai, also in November this year, after a video was released appearing to show kindergarten children being assaulted and injured by teachers.

Breaking|Breaking newsCourt increases Oscar Pistorius jail termA South African court increases Oscar Pistorius's sentence for killing his girlfriend to 13 years and five months in jail.2m3 minutes agoAfrica,"Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp in 2013 A South African court has increased Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius's jail sentence for killing his girlfriend to 13 years and five months. Prosecutors had argued that the six-year term for murdering Reeva Steenkamp was ""shockingly light"". Ms Steenkamp's parents were ""emotional"" as they watched the ruling at home on TV, a spokeswoman said. ""They feel there has been justice for Reeva. She can now rest in peace,""Tania Koen told Associated Press,external. ""But at the same time, people think this is the end of the road for them... the fact is they still live with Reeva's loss every day,"" Ms Koen said. Oscar Pistorius claimed he shot dead Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day in 2013 after mistaking her for a burglar. The making and unmaking of Oscar Pistorius Reeva Steenkamp, my friend The Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein has now given Pistorius the minimum 15 years prescribed for murder in South Africa, less time already served. The lower court had justified the six-year sentence by citing mitigating circumstances such as rehabilitation and remorse. It said they outweighed aggravating factors such as his failure to fire a warning shot. Ms Steenkamp was a model and celebrity Pistorius's brother Carl said on social media,externalthat he was ""shattered. Heartbroken. Gutted"" at the decision. ""We have all suffered incomprehensible loss. The death of Reeva was and still is a great loss for our family too,"" he wrote. Analysis: BBC's Milton Nkosi in Johannesburg There is huge relief here from the National Prosecuting Authority and from Ms Steenkamp's family and friends. Prosecutors are relieved because the earlier sentence of six years for murder could have set a precedent in future trials. The Pistorius family are devastated, as is the athlete himself. The six-year sentence gave an impression of inconsistency. There have been fraud and corruption trials that led to 15-year sentences. It seemed lenient considering that the Paralympian fired four bullets into a bathroom door behind which there was an unarmed and frightened Ms Steenkamp. Oscar Pistorius, 31, was not in court to hear the decision. He was initially given a five-year term for manslaughter in 2014, but was found guilty of murder on appeal in 2015. Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door at his home in the capital Pretoria. Previously, the six-time Paralympic gold medallist had made history by becoming the first amputee sprinter to compete at the Olympics, in 2012 in London, running on prosthetic ""blades"".

Guess Who? Tom Baker returns as Doctor,"This video can not be played Tom Baker returns on camera as the Doctor in Shada Tom Baker has made a surprise appearance on camera as Doctor Who, donning his trademark stripy scarf in a newly-released episode. The 83-year-old actor has returned to complete the unfinished story Shada, filmed in Cambridge, 38 years after it was abandoned. The parts not filmed in 1979 will be completed with animation and Baker's voice, but he has also filmed a scene. Baker, the fourth Doctor, played the Time Lord between 1974 and 1981. Heis seen by fans of the show as one of the best actors in the role. The story finds the Doctor in Cambridge working alongside Romana and a retired Time Lord Filming for Shada, which was written by Douglas Adams at the same time as he was creating The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was started in 1979. But strike action at the BBC meant studio scenes were never completed and the episodes were abandoned. It has now been released by BBC Worldwide, with the original footage combined with new colour animations and voiceovers to complete the story. In the new scene, Baker was filmed on the set of theoriginal Tardisas it appeared in 1979. Missing scenes of the Shada adventures have been animated Speaking about returning to the role, Baker said the Doctor ""probably never left me"". ""That's why I can't stay away from it, it was a lovely time of my life,"" he added. ""I loved doing Doctor Who, it was life to me. I used to dread the end of rehearsal because then real life would impinge on me. Doctor Who... when I was in full flight, then I was happy."" Of his time filming Shada in Cambridge in 1979, Baker said: ""Mostly I remember being mocked by the students on the [River] Cam because I wasn't very good at punting, I kept losing the pole."" Tom Baker starred in Shada alongside Romana, played by Lalla Ward The newly-recorded lines from Baker as the Doctor and Lalla Ward as his companion Romana follow the original script by Douglas Adams. The story finds the Doctor in Cambridge working alongside Romana and a retired Time Lord, Professor Chronotis, to defeat the evil alien Skagra who is attempting to steal the secrets to the prison planet Shada. Jem Roberts, author of The Frood: The Authorised and Very Official History of Douglas Adams, said Adams later used the character Chronotis and parts of the plot in his novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. ""Adams was probably glad that Shada was not finished, so he could use it for the backbone of his novel. He was a great believer in recycling,"" he said. Baker has returned to the role of the Doctor in audio plays and appeared as the Curator in the 2013 50th anniversary special The Day of the Doctor. He last appeared on screen as the Doctor in a 1993 Children in Need special. Shada is available to buy now as a digital download and will be released on DVD and Blu-ray on 4 December.

Five ways to revive economy,"Serious work on restoring Zimbabwe's finances need to begin once the celebrations over Robert Mugabe's departure have ended Current events in Zimbabwe show that while a week may be a long time in politics, it is really a very short blink of an eye in economics. Zimbabweans on the streets of Harare and Bulawayo may be hopeful for political change, but they are much more sanguine and realistic when it comes to improving the country's economy. Presidents can be impeached in days or weeks. It takes years to wreck economies and usually even longer to repair them. So, will Emmerson Mnangagwa be able to take Zimbabwe's economy off life support and at least start to put it on the road to recovery? Analysts are very sceptical that a quick solution is even feasible. The euphoria that has gripped the nation has certainly raised hopes that the future will be brighter, but if that improved sentiment is to deliver economic dividends, the government needs to make some drastic reforms. Cash injection The first tool President Mnangagwa would need to even get a recovery kick-started is hard currency. Zimbabwe hasn't had a currency of its own since 2009, after hyperinflation killed off the old Zimbabwean dollar. Zimbabwe 100 trillion and 500 thousand dollar banknotes, produced after the country experienced a period of hyperinflation Zimbabwe has lost its status as the breadbasket of Africa Since then, the US dollar has been the main currency for transactions, as well as the South African rand. And in recent years a cash shortage has been slowly strangling the economy, which is half the size it was at the turn of the millennium. Ten numbers that will help you understand what's actually going on But who would stump up the cash? Western donors will remain wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Mr Mnangagwa. The International Monetary Fund, which describes Zimbabwe's economy as one of the most fragile in the world, may be more willing - but only with many strings attached to any deal. China is possibly the most likely cash benefactor in the initial stages of a Mnangagwa administration. In some circles, Mr Mnangagwa is seen as Zimbabwe's Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who instigated a degree of market liberalisation. Dump damaging policies and stamp out corruption Assuming the cash is forthcoming, what then? Mr Mnangagwa would have to dump economic policies that are unpalatable to foreign investors. Zimbabwe's agricultural production started to plunge after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures came into effect Zimbabwe has a potential labour force that is one of the most skilled in Africa In 2009, Mr Mugabe signed the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act (IEEA) into law, which aimed to place 51% of companies into the hands of Black Zimbabweans. Even some Chinese companies have been forced to close their operations in Zimbabwe in recent years, because the IEEA made it unprofitable to do business in the country. Once considered the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe saw its agricultural production start to plunge at the turn of the century after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures. Mugabe has gone, but will Zimbabwe change? Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Some sources claim that Mr Mnangagwa is keen to revitalise Zimbabwe's commercial farms, and may seek the help of white farmers to do it. Corruption has been a major restraint on economic growth in Zimbabwe for years. Much of the farmland that was seized from white farmers ended up in the hands of army generals and the political elite, who knew next to nothing about agriculture. The farms simply fell into disarray. Likewise, businesses that ended up with people with more political connections than entrepreneurial flair more often than not went to the wall. Three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades Not that corruption is confined to Zimbabwe in the African context, but it is one of those places that it seems to trickle down from the top. Just ask any South African who has driven their car across the border and been stopped at a police roadblock. But Mr Mnangagwa has not escaped the corruption criticism. It is alleged that he was at the top of corruption tree when the army effectively took over theMarange diamond fieldsin the east of the country in 2008. At the time, he was the defence minister. That whole affair raised the eyebrows even of Mr Mugabe, who said last year that he felt at least $13bn of revenue had gone missing from the diamond bonanza. Negotiate with foreign lenders For nearly 20 years, Zimbabwe has been in default on $9bn worth of international debt. That debt needs restructuring, probably with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank. Perhaps a government that did not only include Zanu-PF could even get the debt (or some of it) wiped out. Mr Mnangagwa is thought to be open to a new deal with the IMF, but getting new financing and renegotiating old deals would probably be easier for a unity government which included opposition politicians, especially former Finance Minister Tendai Biti. Create the conditions to reduce unemployment and entice the diaspora to return Formal jobs in Zimbabwe are rare. Unemployment runs at more than 90%. Creating the conditions for investment and seeing that money flows in should have a dramatic short-term effect on unemployment. Western governments will be wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa (above) Other conditions already exist: the country has an abundance of natural resources in both agriculture and mining, and a potential labour force that's one of the most skilled in Africa. All it needs is the political will and the right economic conditions for Zimbabwe's unemployment statistics to become rather less stratospheric. Meanwhile, three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades. They too have skills which would be useful in the rebuilding of the economy. But they will have to feel they would be landing on solid and stable ground - both financially and politically. Otherwise, why go back? In addition, it could be argued that a Zanu-PF dominated government would not want them back this side of an election. The vast majority of the returning diaspora would be unlikely to vote for Mr Mnangagwa and his party. Create its own currency In the longer term, Zimbabwe needs to have its own currency. Using the US dollar was necessary after the old Zim dollar became worth less than the paper it was printed on and met its demise. Banks in Zimbabwe have been feeling the strain in recent months But there is so much more to creating a viable currency than switching on a printing press. Confidence is key. Last year, the Reserve Bank introduced ""bond notes"" which were meant to alleviate the chronic shortage of US dollars in the system. However, many thought this was an attempt to re-introduce the Zim dollar via the back door. Mugabe's long career in pictures The polarising Grace Mugabe How Zimbabweans celebrated In fact, the notes have done nothing to address the cash shortage and some analysts say they might have actually made the situation worse, by pushing up the demand for US dollars even further. Few people like using the bond notes, even though the amount in circulation is relatively low and the denominations are small. Putting money into a bank was no longer considered the soundest of options, because the cash could only be withdrawn in small amounts and there was always the fear that the Reserve Bank would come for your hard-earned dollars. So, the stock market soared, ironically becoming one of the best performing bourses in the world. Indeed, the rise in the stock market has only been curtailed by the army intervention and the resignation of Mr Mugabe.

Young people react to Budget changesThe economy in four chartsThe endless squeeze on living standardsReality Check: Will stamp duty cut help first time buyers?,"Nikki Entwistle, 33, said stamp-duty changes would not help her afford a deposit What do the measures introduced inthe Budgetmean to young people in the UK? The Chancellor Philip Hammond, announced the immediate abolitionof stamp dutyfor properties up to Â£300,000 in England, Northern Ireland and, for a time, Wales. The average first-time buyer pays about Â£1,600 in stamp duty, according to Halifax Building Society. The BBC spoke to a number of young people to find out if they thought the chancellor had gone far enough. The stamp-duty reform was welcomed by some first-time buyers, but some worried it was not enough to enable young people to get their foot on the ladder Hollie Croft, 31, is buying a house in London with her husband. ""Our stamp duty would have been Â£9,000,"" she said. ""Now, we can afford to redo the bathroom straight away instead of living with the rundown one until we'd saved up. ""Saving for a deposit whilst paying London rent has meant no holidays, no new clothes and very few nights out. ""I still think current house prices are disproportionate to wages and I don't know if this change will help in the long term, but for us right now? We're very happy."" Madeleine van Oss, a 25-year-old law student in Oxford, told the BBC the stamp-duty cut reflected the difficulty many young people faced accessing the housing market. ""If I get a good job and I can buy a house, the stamp-duty [cut] will help me,"" she said. ""It's good to see an acknowledgement that things are harder for us now than it was for them back in the day. ""Personally, I do well out of [this Budget],"" she added. What the Budget 2017 means for you Key points at-a-glance Budget calculator Others were more circumspect. Nick, 19, said: ""A lot of [this Budget], I felt, was just empty promises and things to attempt to win over voters."" He added: ""I'm not sure how much of an impact the stamp-duty change will make to first-time buyers. ""With property prices rising, especially in London, Â£300,000 in house terms isn't a lot, in my opinion."" Nikki Entwistle, 33, agrees. After being made redundant from her job at British Gas in 2016, she decided to go back to college, where she is now studying animal management. ""I've never been able to afford my own home,"" she said. ""I've rented property since I was about 19. ""It seemed expensive then, but prices have gone up a lot. ""I don't know how the government expects us to be able to afford to save. ""With council tax, energy bills, rent and food, there's not enough left. ""I think there needs to be a cap on rent. ""Paying almost Â£700 a month makes it impossible."" James Furniss-Rees welcomed the cut in stamp duty but thinks that measures could be introduced to address student debt James Furniss-Rees, who graduated from university in July with Â£58,000 of debt, said there had been ""not enough"" in the Budget for him. ""There was no real talk about debt, where there will be changes to timeframes, when to pay back and how,"" he said. ""The government should revise whether we pay tuition fees at all, because it's unrealistic for us to pay that all back.""

The economy in four chartsThe endless squeeze on living standardsReality Check: Will stamp duty cut help first time buyers?,"If the economy is a cruise liner then the chancellor made the cabins more affordable for some passengers on Wednesday. Philip Hammond said first-time buyers buying a home of up to Â£300,000 would pay no stamp duty. While that will make some passengers happy, the weather for their trip could turn stormy in the coming years. That is because the body which assembles economic data is forecasting a dramatic deterioration in conditions. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which prepares the figures that the chancellor bases his Budget on, predicts that annual economic growth will be below 2% for five years - one of the worst forecasts in living memory. Why has the situation turned so gloomy? After all, the UK was one of the fastest growing of the major economies in 2016. The answer hinges on productivity. If we return to our cruise ship, for years the crew were able to make it go significantly faster every year. But since the storm that was the financial crisis of 2007, that improved performance has not been repeated. It's not clear why productivity has been so disappointing. Experts have several theories, including poor management and a lack of investment. Whatever the reason, the official forecasters have conceded that productivity is unlikely to recover and that translates into slower economic growth. You can see how that outlook has deteriorated in the chart below. The government's income is closely linked to growth. The faster the economy grows, the greater the receipts from VAT, income tax, corporation tax and other revenue-raising measures. The government is already borrowing to fund spending on government departments and servicing the nation's debt. It plans to reduce that borrowing, to zero, but the downgrades to growth means that will be harder to do. The chart below shows how the deficit (the difference between government income and expenditure) is forecast to fall over the next five years, but not as fast as the OBR predicted in the spring.

The endless squeeze on living standardsReality Check: Will stamp duty cut help first time buyers?,"What is the point of capitalism? That might seem like a pretty big question, but one answer could be ""to provide people the opportunity through work to become richer"". What, though, if the economy fails in that endeavour? If the system leaves you - despite all your efforts - worse off in December than you were the previous January? Or worse off now than you were a decade ago? It was Lord Adair Turner, the former head of the Low Pay Commission, who put it succinctly. ""The UK over the last 10 years has created a lot of jobs, but today real wages are below where they were in 2007,""he told me earlier this year. ""That is not the capitalist system delivering its promise that over a decade or so it will raise all boats, and it is a very fundamental issue."" Fundamental indeed. Stagnant earnings forecast 'astonishing' UK 'faces longest fall in living standards' At a glance summary: Budget key points Yesterday the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) announced an aggressive downgrade of both its growth and productivity forecasts. Those big, macro-economic announcements have a significant effect on all of us as well as on the state of the public finances. It means the economy is forecast to be weaker at producing wealth for every hour that we work. Which makes the chances of a pay rise for everyone recede. Today, two pieces of chunky analysis of the OBR's judgements reveal why those downgrades are so important. The social justice think tank, the Resolution Foundation, said that ""lower productivity feeds directly through to pay, which is now forecast to be Â£1,000 a year lower on average than the OBR thought back in March"". The Foundation says that the fall in real incomes people are experiencing could now become the longest since records began. And that wages will not recover to their pre-financial crisis levels until 2025 - that's 17 years during which people have been experiencing an incomes squeeze. The tax and economy think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, agrees. ""Real earnings are falling this year as inflation has risen to 3%,"" Paul Johnson, the Institute's director, said. ""The nascent recovery in earnings, which were growing through 2014 to the first half of 2016, has been choked off. ""That they even might still be below their 2008 level in 2022 as the OBR forecasts is truly astonishing. Let's hope this forecast turns out to be too pessimistic."" Government ministers will be similarly keeping their fingers crossed. And hoping that with strong employment levels and plans to boost investment in the type of infrastructure that boosts productivity - transport, scientific and technology research - the real incomes squeeze can be alleviated. Because if a system does not deliver increasing wealth - even if it is a modest increase - then people, quite naturally, begin to wonder what is the point.

Avatar therapy 'weakens hallucinations',"This video can not be played How avatar therapy is helping people stand up to schizophrenic voices by giving them a face Confronting an avatar on a computer screen helped patients hearing voices to cope better with hallucinations, a UK trial has found. Patients who received this therapy became less distressed and heard voices less often compared with those who had counselling instead. Experts said the therapy could add an important new approach to treating schizophrenia hallucinations. The trial, on 150 people, ispublished in The Lancet Psychiatry journal,external. It follows a much smaller pilot study in 2013. Hallucinations are common in people with schizophrenia and can be threatening and insulting. One in four patients continues to experience voices despite being treated with drugs and cognitive behavioural therapy. In this study, run by King's College London and University College London, 75 patients who had continued to hear voices for more than a year, were given six sessions of avatar therapy while another 75 received the same amount of counselling. In the avatar sessions, patients created a computer simulation to represent the voice they heard and wanted to control, including how it sounded and how it might look. Three avatars created by people taking part in the therapy The therapist then voiced the avatar while also speaking as themselves in a three-way conversation to help the patient gain the upper hand. Prof Tom Craig, study author from King's College London, said getting patients to learn to stand up to the avatar was found to be safe, easy to deliver and twice as effective as counselling at reducing how often voices were heard. ""After 12 weeks there was dramatic improvement compared to the other therapy,"" he said. ""With a talking head, patients are learning to confront and get replies from it. ""This shifts the idea that the voice is all-controlling,"" he said. Patients are encouraged to talk to the avatar and take control of the conversation, saying things such as, ""I'm not going to listen to you any more."" Seven patients who had had the avatar therapy and two from the counselling group said their hallucinations had completely disappeared after 12 weeks. Prof Tom Craig acted as therapist and voiced the avatar in the therapy sessions By 24 weeks, however, the patients in both groups had shown the same levels of improvement, suggesting the avatar therapy required booster sessions in the long term, the study said. Prof Craig said the next step was to find out if the therapy worked in other locations before it could be made widely available on the NHS, but he said the findings were a ""significant advance"" in treating hallucinations. Prof Stephen Lawrie, head of psychiatry at the University of Edinburgh, said the trial was impressive and robust but more work was needed. ""Further study is required to replicate these results, establish the role of such treatment versus others such as CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy], and clarify who might benefit most."" Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, said that if they could be reproduced, the findings ""will add an important new approach to care"". He added: ""If a wholly psychological intervention such as avatar therapy can produce such an improvement, then it should make us rethink the way we conceptualise auditory hallucinations."" Brian Dow, from charity Rethink Mental Illness, said he welcomed any attempts to try and develop new and innovative treatments for schizophrenia. ""Hallucinations can be extremely traumatising for patients who experience them and the results of the this trial are promising.""

YouTube child abuse reporting system 'flawed',"This video can not be played The Childrenâs Commissioner for England says the comments are âvery worryingâ Part of YouTube's system for reporting sexualised comments left on children's videos has not been functioning correctly for more than a year, say volunteer moderators. They say there could be up to 100,000 predatory accounts leaving indecent comments on videos. A BBC Trending investigation has discovered a flaw in a tool that enables the public to report abuse. But YouTube says it reviews the ""vast majority"" of reports within 24 hours. It says it has no technical problems in its reporting mechanism and that it takes child abuse extremely seriously. On Wednesday, the company announcednew measures to protect children on the site,external. The form where YouTube users can report violations YouTube is the world's largest video-sharing site. In addition to algorithms that can automatically block illegal and exploitative videos, it relies on users to report illegal behaviour or content that goes against its rules. The company says it has a zero-tolerance policy against any form of grooming or child endangerment. Users can use an online form to report potentially predatory accounts, and they are then asked to include links to relevant videos and comments. The reports then go to moderators - YouTube employees who review the material and have the power to delete it. However, sources told Trending that after members of the public submitted information on the form, the associated links might be missing from the report. YouTube employees could see that a particular account had been reported, but had no way of knowing which specific comments were being flagged. Highlighted: the flag icon on a YouTube account page which leads to a form where users can report violations BBC Trending was informed of the issue by members of YouTube's Trusted Flagger programme - a group that includes individuals, as well as some charities and law enforcement agencies. The programme began in 2012, and those involved have special tools to alert YouTube to potential violations. The company says reports of violations by Trusted Flaggers are accurate more than 90% of the time. The volunteers are not paid by YouTube, but do receive some perks such as invitations to conferences. With the help of a small group of Trusted Flaggers, Trending identified 28 comments directed at children that were clearly against the site's guidelines. Listen to BBC Trending radio The comments are shocking. Some of them are extremely sexually explicit. Others include the phone numbers of adults, or requests for videos to fulfil sexual fetishes. They were left on YouTube videos posted by young children and they are exactly the kind of material that should be immediately removed under YouTube's own rules - and in many cases reported to the authorities. Some of the comments found and reported on children's videos, which have now been deleted The children in the videos appeared to be younger than 13 years old, the minimum age for registering an account on YouTube. The videos themselves did not have sexual themes, but showed children emulating their favourite YouTube stars by, for instance, reviewing toys or showing their ""outfit of the day"". The explicit comments on these videos were passed on to the company using its form to report child endangerment - the same form that is available to general users. Over a period of several weeks, five of the comments were deleted, but no action was taken against the remaining 23 until Trending contacted the company and provided a full list. All of the predatory accounts were then deleted within 24 hours. The disturbing YouTube videos that are tricking children YouTube child protection mechanism 'failing' YouTube restricts 'creepy' kids' videos Follow BBC Trending on Facebook,external Members of the Trusted Flaggers programme told Trending that they felt their efforts in taking down such accounts and comments were not being fully supported by the company. They spoke, as a group, on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the work they do. ""We don't have access to the tools, technologies and resources a company like YouTube has or could potentially deploy,"" members of the programme told Trending. ""So for example any tools we need, we create ourselves."" ""There are loads of things YouTube could be doing to reduce this sort of activity, fixing the reporting system to start with. But for example, we can't prevent predators from creating another account and have no indication when they do, so we can take action."" YouTube has come under pressure recently because of the persistence of inappropriate and potentially illegal videos and other content on its site. BBC Trending previously reportedon spoofs of popular cartoons which contain disturbing and inappropriate content not suitable for children. The site recently announced new restrictions on the ""creepy"" videos. Recent reports byThe Times,external,Buzzfeed,externaland other outlets have also highlighted disturbing videos both featuring children and targeted towards young people. And in August, Trending revealeda huge backlog of child endangerment reports made by the Trusted Flaggers themselves. Since then, the Trusted Flaggers who spoke to Trending say more attention is paid to their reports and that most of their reports are being dealt with in days. But in part because of the shortcomings in the public reporting system, the group estimates that there are ""between 50,000 to 100,000 active predatory accounts still on the platform"". Earlier in October, YouTube announced additional measures to crack down on disturbing videos and to protect children. ""In recent months, we've noticed a growing trend around content on YouTube that attempts to pass as family-friendly, but is clearly not,"" the company saidin a blog post,external. The measures include increasing enforcement, terminating channels that might endanger children, and removing ads from some videos. The company also announced that starting this week it will disable commenting on videos of children that have attracted sexual or predatory comments. Be aware of what your children are doing on the internet. Pay particular attention to comments being made on videos and sudden spikes in popularity for content posted by children online. The NSPCC has aseries of guidelines about keeping children safe online,external They promote the acronym TEAM: Talk about staying safe online; Explore the online world together; Agree rules about what's OK and what's not; and Manage your family's settings and controls. There are more resources on theBBC Stay Safe site. In the UK, online grooming can be reported via theClick CEOP button,external. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, described the findings as ""very worrying"". ""This is a global platform and so the company need to ensure they have a global response. There needs to be a company-wide response that absolutely puts children protection as a number one priority, and has the people and mechanisms in place to ensure that no child has been put in an unsafe position while they using the platform."" The National Crime Agency told Trending: ""It is vital that online platforms used by children and young people have in place robust mechanisms and processes to prevent, identify and report sexual exploitation and abuse."" A YouTube spokesperson said: ""We receive hundreds of thousands of flags of content every day and the vast majority of content flagged for violating our guidelines is reviewed in 24 hours. ""Content that endangers children is abhorrent and unacceptable to us. ""We have systems in place to take swift action on this content with dedicated policy specialists reviewing and removing flagged material around the clock, and terminating the accounts of those that leave predatory comments outright."" The company said that in the past week they've disabled comments on thousands of videos and shut down hundreds of accounts that have made predatory comments. ""We are committed to getting this right and recognise we need to do more, both through machine learning and by increasing human and technical resources.""

How Zimbabwe's new leader will be different,"""This is the beginning of a new unfolding democracy in our country,"" Emmerson Mnangagwa told his supporters at his first public address since returning to Zimbabwe. But is it? For five decades, Mr Mnangagwa was former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's protÃ©gÃ©, comrade, and right-hand man. He was at his side during the fight against white minority rule, and during the post-liberation government. He is also said to have been behind some of the most notorious acts of repression which helped keep Mr Mugabe in power. There are, however, some key differences between the man likely to become Zimbabwe's new president, and his former mentor. Here are a few of them: Young people were among the thousands waiting to welcome Mr Mnangagwa Mr Mnangagwa may be in his 70s but that is still around two decades younger than the man he is replacing. There is some dispute over whether he is 71 or 75. Mr Mnangagwa is said to have avoided being hanged when arrested during the fight for independence by lying about his age. But while Mr Mugabe was notoriously stubborn, Mr Mnangagwa is said to be more flexible in his approach, if only for the purposes of achieving his goals. With elections planned for next year, many in the ruling  Zanu-PF party, whose ranks are filled with veterans of the struggle for independence, will be hoping he can reach out to Zimbabwe's youth. Mr Mnangagwa (right) fell in and out of his former leader's graces However, like Mr Mugabe, he has a reputation for ruthlessness. He was in charge of state security during the Matabeleland massacres of the 1980s, in which some 20,000 people were killed on suspicion of being part of a rebellion. And human rights groups accuse him of being behind a violent crackdown on opposition supporters after the disputed 2008 election. So one key question facing Zimbabwe, is whether he will allow the next election to be free and fair. What next for Zimbabwe? The 'crocodile' who snapped back Fergal Keane: Will Zimbabwe change? Emmerson Mnangagwa received a hero's welcome on his return As well as being more flexible, Mr Mnangagwa is arguably more pragmatic than Mr Mugabe. He is said to have recently held secret talks with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, although the BBC has not been able to independently verify this. While it is still far from certain that he would be open to a widely mooted government of national unity, it certainly looks more likely than it did a week ago. For Mr Mnangagwa, a key concern - by most accounts - is showing the international community that his country is stable, in order to secure investment in the economy. The BBC's Stanley Kwenda in Harare says that Mr Mnangagwa has a good reputation in the business sector, and tried to protect productive farms operated by white farmers during the controversial land reform programme. Mr Mnangagwa served as acting finance minster between 1995-1996, during a period of relative economic stability. He said in an interview last year that ""capital goes where it feels comfortable and warm, and if it's cold it runs to a country which gives it better weather"". That seems to have been a reference to the dire state of Zimbabwe's economy, and what it might take to turn it around following years of sanctions imposed after the seizure of white-owned farms. And in his speech after his return from exile, he said his focus would be on ""jobs, jobs, jobs"". Five ways to revive Zimbabweâs economy Called ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction was known as ""Lacoste"" Received military training in China and Egypt Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks Helped direct Zimbabwe's 1970s war of independence Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands were killed Denies any role in the massacres Seen as key link between army, intelligence agencies and Zanu-PF Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Journalist Martin Fletcher, who interviewed him last year, says Mr Mnangagwa was keen to indicate that Zimbabwe would change under his leadership. Mr Fletcher told the BBC that ""he wanted to signal to the West that he would be different from Mugabe, that he understood the need to restore the Zimbabwean economy. He was saying 'we want to attract foreign investment, [and] he talked about the need for the diaspora to come back, about the need to re-engage the West'"". That is likely to mean getting rid of polices like the indigenisation laws, which required all companies - including foreign investors - to be 51% owned by indigenous, ie black Zimbabweans. He is also likely to address the issue of land ownership, and access to land for white farmers. Zimbabwe Army General Constantino Chiwenga (left) is an ally of Mr Mnangagwa Mr Mugabe always enjoyed the support of the army, having been the political leader of the 1970s war of independence in which most of Zimbabwe's generals fought. But he was ultimately toppled by the military, who were even more loyal to Mr Mnangagwa. In particular, Mr Mnangagwa is close to army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga. Chiwenga: The army chief who took power from Mugabe On his return to Harare following Mr Mugabe's resignation, Mr Mnangagwa said that he had been ""in constant contact"" with security chiefs during the military takeover. Mr Mnangagwa was a teenage fighter in the war of independence, which he went on to lead. Those who fought in Zimbabwe's 1970s war of independence have long monopolised power As national security minister during the 1980s, he cemented his ties in the military and intelligence services, which have remained a loyal base. It is perhaps this relationship that concerns the opposition the most. MDC-T MP Eddie Cross told the BBC  that ""in many respects he is one of the architects of the collapse in Zimbabwe"". ""He's certainly been involved in many of the not-so-good episodes in recent years, including the 2013 election, which he pretty much managed on his own. ""I think, for many of us, we will fear that there won't be sufficient change"". Mr Mnangagwa's supporters within Zanu-PF are known as the Lacoste faction Whatever his faults, Mr Mugabe was undoubtedly a powerful orator, at ease whipping up a crowd, or, in the early days at least, discussing delicate diplomatic issues with world leaders. The same cannot be said of Mr Mnangagwa. His daughter says he is not an emotional man, while his son (a Harare DJ known as St Emmo) says: ""He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"" His nickname is ""The Crocodile"", hardly one of nature's most charismatic beasts. It was originally given to him during the liberation struggle when he led the so-called ""crocodile gang"". The name was later used to refer to his political shrewdness - his ability to lie low and then attack, viciously.

May to warn EU of 'hostile state' threatPM will also meet European Council President Donald Tusk to discuss Brexit progress.,"Theresa May met German's Angela Merkel and other EU leaders Issues still need to be resolved but progress is being made in Brexit negotiations, Theresa May has insisted. The prime minister said there had been a ""very positive atmosphere"" in talks with several EU leaders in Brussels. The UK, she said, would honour its financial commitments and shared the same desire as Ireland to stop barriers to trade or movement across the border. EU Council President Donald Tusk said talks could move to the next phase in December but it was a ""huge challenge"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

At a security summit in Brussels, Mrs May had lunch with Angela Merkel and also met Mr Tusk, who told her last week that she has until the start of December to make an enhanced offer on money and provide guarantees on the Irish border after Brexit. Ministers have given her their backing to increase the UK's ""divorce bill"" but only if the EU shows movement on trade. The government has refused to comment on reports it had agreed to pay about Â£40bn to pave the way for EU leaders to approve the next phase of talks on future relations at a summit on 14 December. All you need to know about Brexit DUP hits out at Irish government on Brexit Brexit: UK 'ready to pay more to EU' Speaking in Brussels, Mrs May did not answer specific questions about money and said there were ""still issues across the various matters that we're negotiating on to be resolved"". But she added: ""There's been a very positive atmosphere in the talks and a genuine feeling that we want to move forward together."" Last week, Mr Tusk said the EU was ""ready"" to move on to the next phase of talks - focused on a trade and security partnership after the UK leaves in March 2019 - but the UK must first show more progress on outstanding ""separation"" issues. The BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said that after holding talks with Mrs May, Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen had told journalists in the Belgian capital that there had been ""movement"" on the issue of money. ""It seems to me that there is progress and so I have decided to be optimistic about this,"" Mr Rasmussen - one of the UK's closest allies - said. The PM also said the UK was in continuing discussions with the Irish government about the solutions for avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. No 10 earlier had to clarify its position after a spokesman appeared to suggest the possibility of Northern Ireland staying in the customs union may be up for negotiation. Asked about the issue at a lobby briefing, the spokesman said the UK must ""continue to negotiate to find an innovative way forward"". But Downing Street later insisted that the UK's stated policy - that the whole of the UK is leaving the single market and customs union - remained in force. The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and served the EU with formal notice of Brexit in March 2017. This began a two-year countdown to the UK's departure day which will be in March 2019.
