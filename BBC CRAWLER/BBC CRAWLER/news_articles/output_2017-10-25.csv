Woman is only passenger on holiday jet,"Karon Grieve was given the VIP treatment during her flight on Sunday A woman who paid just Â£46 for a flight to Crete has spoken of her amazement at being the only passenger on board. Karon Grieve, from Dunlop in Ayrshire, described her Jet2 flight from Glasgow to the Greek island - which normally carries 189 passengers - as ""surreal"". She was given the VIP treatment after two other passengers booked on the flight failed to turn up. Jet2 said it was ""not unusual"" for the final flight of the season to have fewer bookings than normal. Ms Grieve, who was travelling to Crete to write a crime novel, said it was immediately obvious there were very few passengers when she turned up at the airport for her 16:30 flight on Sunday. She told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""I turned up at the check-in desk and was joking with the staff, saying 'how many people are on this flight?' ""The guy was laughing at me and he said 'oh come on, guess'. This video can not be played Karon Grieve said she behaved like a five-year-old ""We got it down from 10 to four and he said 'you'll never guess it, there's only three of you'. ""But when I got to the actual gate, the other two people hadn't turned up."" Ms Grieve said that, because she was the only passenger, all of the flight crew knew her name. She said: ""We were all on best friend terms before we'd even got on the plane. ""The captain was fantastic. She came and sat beside me while the first officer did all the flight checks and we were chatting away about the flight."" Karon is intending to spend the next month in Crete writing a crime novel While the plane was in the air, Ms Grieve said that the captain addressed her by name from the cockpit. She said: ""Every time she made an announcement she said, 'Hi there Karon, you'll see Croatia on your left-hand side', and then we flew through this amazing lightning storm and she suddenly came on and said, 'Hi Karon and the girls, quickly run to the other side of the plane and look at this, it's amazing'. ""It was just surreal"". Ms Grieve said she intended to spend the next month in Crete writing her book before returning to Scotland. However, she acknowledged the chances of experiencing a similar return journey were remote. A spokeswoman for Jet2 said: ""This was our last flight to Crete from Glasgow Airport this year, marking the end of a very busy and successful season. ""We're delighted that Karon got to experience our VIP customer service in style onboard our award-winning airline. ""It is not unusual for the final outbound flight of the season to have fewer bookings than normal, and the return flight back to Glasgow was completely full with customers returning from a lovely holiday. We hope Karon has a fantastic time in Crete and that we got her trip off to a great start.""

Are these 00s singers still relevant?,"L-R: Diana Vickers, Ms Dynamite and Kate Nash Earlier this week, Kate Nash took to Twitter to criticise BuzzFeed for their article about noughties singers who are no longer in the charts. The listicle,externalfeatures 33 artists who ""only exist in the memories of British millennials"", but Nash was quick to argue that a lack of recent chart success doesn't stop them from being active or credible musicians. ""I have huge problems with how the industry disposes of artists,"" shetweeted,external, ""it's a difficult career to maintain."" BuzzFeed told the BBC: ""We love Kate Nash and really did want to be her! Many of our posts reference nostalgia for things we love and this list is one of those, definitely not intended to be taken literally."" But Nash's comments raised questions about the wider issue of how much high chart positions and record deals equate to success in the music industry. The 30-year-old's last top 40 hit may have been in 2010, but she has recently written for Willow Smith and Rita Ora, and will release a new album next year. Nash also has several film and TV credits and is currently filming the second series of hit Netflix show Glow. Rebekka Johnson, Sydelle Noel, Kate Nash and Kia Stevens all star in Netflix's GLOW Peter Robinson, music writer andcreator of Popjustice,external, told the BBC: ""Hit records have a magical ability to take us to a specific time or place in our lives so it's fair to say Kate Nash's hits will have a special significance for a certain age group. ""But several entries in the article might have benefitted from a brief visit to Wikipedia."" The musicians on the list included Ms Dynamite, Blazin' Squad, Diana Vickers, Mis-Teeq, La Roux, 5ive, Rachel Stevens, The 411, and So Solid Crew. ""If you're a fan, it's natural to be excited when your favourite artist does well commercially, and disappointed if their latest release looks like a failure, particularly because labels tend to drop acts when sales take a dip,"" Robinson said. ""But if you're ignoring new music because it's not selling, and if you're allowing your tastes to be dictated by whose records are selling well, then, well, enjoy your Bradley Walsh album."" The BuzzFeed piece refers to millennials - people that grew up in the 00s. But according to singer Sandi Thom, who is also one of the 33 artists on the list, they are not as fickle as some may think. Sandi Thom performing at her album launch in 2008 ""Some of my biggest fans are kids under 10, and with the new era of Spotify anyone is discoverable or re-discoverable,"" she told the BBC. ""I couldn't care less what a journalist writes about me and my career. ""Making music is a privilege and if you can continue to do so throughout your career like all of the artists have been doing that were mentioned in the article, you're one lucky person!"" Robinson also addressed Nash's tweets about the mental health impact of being an artist who is trying to make it in the industry. Allow Twitter content?

""Being dropped is like being made redundant, which is gutting in any line of work, except to make matters worse, for an artist it happens in public,"" he said. ""And whereas most of us could bounce back and look for other work in the same area, in the music industry people are often seen as damaged goods: they had their chance, they blew it. ""The irony of course is that many of the planet's biggest artists, from Lady Gaga and Beyonce to Katy Perry and Bruno Mars, were all dropped before they became huge.""

Trump notes Xi's 'extraordinary' rise,"This video can not be played China Editor Carrie Gracie takes a look at the country's new senior leadership committee US President Donald Trump has congratulated Chinese leader Xi Jinping on his ""extraordinary elevation"" after this week's Communist Party congress. Mr Trump also praised Mr Xi in a TV interview in the US, and said ""some might call him king of China"". Mr Xi cemented his hold on China whenhe had a second five-year term confirmed, with no clear successor,at the congress. His name and doctrine have been written into the party's constitution. The two leaders are due to hold talks at a state visit to China next month, having met at the G20 summit in July. The pair also discussed North Korea and trade, President Trump said in a tweet. Hours later North Korean leader Kim Jong-un also congratulated Mr Xi. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the phone call with Mr Trump, Mr Xi expressed a desire to work with the US president to ""jointly blueprint future development of China-US ties"", Chinese state media report. Separately, Mr Trump praised Mr Xi as a ""very good person"" with whom he had ""a very good relationship"", in an interview with Fox Business Network. Describing Mr Xi's elevation as something that ""really virtually never happened in China"", Mr Trump called the Chinese leader ""a powerful man"". ""People say we have the best relationship of any president-president, because he's called president also. Some people might call him the king of China, but he's called president."" China has the world's second-largest economy after the US, its biggest trading partner. However, relations have been strained by Beijing's territorial disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea with Washington's allies in East Asia. Mixed feelings about 'awesome China' Meet China's new leaders Meanwhile North Korean state media agency KCNA reported that leader Kim Jong-un sent a congratulatory message to Mr Xi. The message ""expressed the conviction that the relations between the two parties and the two countries would develop in the interests"" of the Chinese and North Koreans. It also officially acknowledged Mr Xi's political doctrine, noting that China had ""entered the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era"". Though relations have cooled in recent years, amid Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests, China remains North Korea's closest ally. On Wednesday, Mr Xi was formally handed a second term in office at the close of the Communist Party congress in Beijing. He is now on a par with the founder of the state, Mao Zedong, and questions have been raised over whether the 64-year-old intends to rule beyond 2022. Five new appointments were made to the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, China's most powerful body. The two presidents met in Hamburg this summer There had been speculation Mr Xi would elevate his protÃ©gÃ© Chen Miner and Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua, both of whom are in their 50s and young enough to be credible successors. But the fact that the new appointees are all in their 60s, and likely to retire at the end of this five-year term, fuels speculation about Mr Xi's long-term intentions. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent atelegram,externalin which he said the re-election showed Mr Xi's ""political authority"" and the ""broad support"" his policy to develop China and strengthen its international position enjoyed. South Korean President Moon Jae-in congratulated Mr Xi on his re-election in a letter, writing that he looked forward to creating a ""practical strategic partnership"". Where are the women? Politburo boy band? Mr Xi has assumed an unprecedented number of positions since coming to power in 2012, including the title of ""core"" leader of China. His first term has been marked by significant development, a push for modernisation and increasing assertiveness on the world stage. It has also seen growing authoritarianism, censorship and a crackdown on human rights. He has spearheaded a sweeping anti-corruption campaign which has seen more than a million officials disciplined. It has been seen by some as a massive internal purge of opponents. Several major Western news organisations were barred from Wednesday's ceremony to reveal the new Politburo Standing Committee. Officially no reason was given for barring the BBC, Financial Times, Economist, New York Times and Guardian, but unofficially journalists were told that their reporting was to blame - another sign of Xi's determination to control the message at home and abroad.

Harvey Weinstein may be stripped of CBE,"Harvey Weinstein could be stripped of his CBE following allegations of sexual assault made against the Hollywood producer, the BBC understands. The removal of the honour is believed to be being ""actively considered"" by the government's Honours Forfeiture Committee for the first time. He was awarded an honorary CBE for outstanding contribution to the British film industry in 2004. Bafta has already suspended Weinstein's membership. Bafta suspends Harvey Weinstein Oscars board expels Harvey Weinstein A Cabinet Office spokesman said forfeiture action ""is confidential"" and he could not comment on whether a specific case was being considered by the committee. More than two dozen women - among them actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan - have made accusations against him including rape and sexual assault. Weinstein insists sexual relations he had were consensual. The latest claim against him came from actress and writer Brit Marling,who described an encounter in 2014 in which she claimed the movie mogul suggested they shower together. A number of organisations have distanced themselves from the American. The Oscars board voted to expel the 65-year-old, whose films have won 81 Oscars. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) suspended him and said it hoped the announcement would send ""a clear message"". A group of Labour MPs, including Jess Phillips and Chi Onwurah, have written to the prime minister calling for his CBE to be removed. Which notable people have lost knighthoods? CBE stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire and is a rank in the UK's honours system - one step below a knighthood. Taking honours away, called ""forfeiture"", is done when someone is judged to have brought the honours system into disrepute. The Honours Forfeiture Committee considers cases and the prime minister then sends recommendations to the Queen. Previous recipients of honours to have had them removed include banker Fred Goodwin. The former boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland was heavily criticised over his role in the bank's near-collapse in 2008. Other high-profile cases include jockey Lester Piggott, who was stripped of an OBE after he was jailed in 1987 for tax fraud. The former spy Anthony Blunt was stripped of his knighthood in 1979 for supplying hundreds of secret documents to the Soviets while a wartime agent for MI5.

'NHS Airbnb' and 'remainer universities',"The suggestion that the NHS could start paying people Â£50 a night to look after hospital patients who are recovering from surgery is the lead story forThe Guardian,external,The Times,externalandThe Daily Mirror,external.  Writing in the Mirror, the shadow minister for social care, Barbara Keeley, thinks the proposal is ""terrifying"" as there are ""clear safety risks"" if patients are forced to accept this ""cut-price"" care. The paper agrees, arguing that the initiative is a ""sticking plaster"" for an NHS close to collapse, when what is needed is a national care service to operate alongside the health service. Labour's suspension of the MP for Sheffield Hallam, Jared O'Mara following the emergence of racist, sexist and homophobic comments he made online more than a decade ago is widely welcomed, but several papers are critical of the time taken to reach the decision. The Times,externalsuggests parliament ""should not miss him too much"" as he is the only MP elected in June not to have spoken in the Commons. Whilethe Sun,externalargues it is ""a disgrace"" that Labour bosses knew about his antics more than a month ago ""but chose to do nothing"". The Reaction website,externalquestions how such a ""clearly unsuitable candidate"" could be selected by Labour in the first place.  It says supporters of Jeremy Corbyn seized the opportunity to back him when the initial candidate was forced to rule himself out after just starting a new job. Arguing that Mr O'Mara ""is just the tip of the Corbynista iceberg"", it says Labour ""has become cultish, and now values loyalty to the hard left more than suitability and capability"". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The lead story in theDaily Mail,externalhighlights what it describes as a ""string of examples"" of senior figures at universities speaking out in favour of the European Union.  It believes it's a ""troubling insight"" into the extent of anti-Brexit bias at universities, following the row about a Conservative MP who asked professors for details of their courses on the UK's departure from the EU. The Daily Telegraph,externalagrees, using its editorial to urge lecturers to turn their minds to mapping out Britain's post-EU future, instead of telling their students how they think the decision is wrong. The political editor ofthe Spectator,external, James Forsyth, believes that political meddling is putting the independence of universities at risk.  He claims the political class is ""remarkably unappreciative"" of the fact that Britain's universities are some of the best in the world, and says ""too many"" MPs want to interfere in ways that would undermine the institutions. He argues that if universities want to safeguard themselves against meddling politicians, ""then the way to do that is to go fully private"". A number of papers highlight a study which claims red squirrels infected with leprosy may have brought the disease to medieval England along Viking trading routes. The lead researcher has told theDaily Mail,externalthis would explain why leprosy was endemic in coastal areas of East Anglia earlier than it was in other parts of Britain.The Daily Telegraph,externalisn't convinced, noting that we are happy to blame rats for plague, ""but red squirrels have such a good press that even now it is hard to see them as bringers of zoonotic disease"".

"Japan police arrest 'ninja' thief, 74","The suspect carried out break-ins dressed as a ninja (file photo) Japanese police say they have finally caught a prolific thief who dressed as a ninja to carry out raids - and were surprised to find he was 74. After his usually covered face was caught on a security camera this year, he was put under surveillance which led to his arrest in July. Police now believe he is the so-called ""Ninja of Heisei"", thought to have carried out more than 250 break-ins. He has been charged with thefts worth 30m yen ($260,000; Â£200,000). Police had been baffled by a series of burglaries over eight years carried out by a suspect wearing black, assuming they had been carried out by someone younger. Investigators observed the suspect, whom they say seemed little different from most elderly men, during the day. But they say he then went into an abandoned building and changed clothes before waiting until it got dark to steal. ""He was dressed all in black just like a ninja,"" a senior official in the western Japanese city of Osaka said. Dentsu's overtime fine puts spotlight on Japan's work culture Japanese zoo mourns anime-loving celebrity penguin Police said the thief displayed great physical ability, running effortlessly on top of walls instead of taking the streets. After his arrest, the man was quoted as saying: ""If I were younger, I wouldn't have been caught. I'll quit now as I'm 74 and old enough.""

Acid accused 'told family of baby news',"Arthur Collins says he was trying to prevent a date rape drug being used to spike clubbers' drinks The ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann told her family she was pregnant hours before he sprayed a crowd of nightclub revellers with acid, a court has heard. Arthur Collins, 25, the father of Ms McCann's unborn child, said they broke the news at a barbecue on 16 April. In the early hours of 17 April, more than a dozen people were injured at the Mangle E8 club in Dalston, east London. Mr Collins admits throwing the liquid but says he did not know it was acid. Mr Collins and his co-accused, 21-year-old Andre Phoenix, deny causing grievous bodily harm with intent and actual bodily harm in relation to the incident, in which several people were disfigured. Jurors at Wood Green Crown Court heard that Mr Collins had been in a serious relationship with The Only Way Is Essex star Ms McCann for about a year at the time, and had found out she was pregnant just weeks earlier. ""It was the happiest I have ever felt. We were both really happy,"" said Mr Collins, who was living with his parents in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. The court heard how after breaking the news, Mr Collins left the barbecue to attend a LoveJuice event at Mangle. Sixteen people were injured in the incident at Mangle Mr Collins - who had entered the club wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""Candy Killer"" - told the jury he had been drinking at the venue but was not drunk. CCTV footage of the alleged attack showed victims clutching their faces after Mr Collins was seen dousing revellers from a bottle with a substance later found to have contained a liquid with a rating of pH1 - indicating a strong acid. Mr Collins told the jury he had thought the bottle actually contained a date rape drug. He said he had snatched it after hearing two men planning to spike a woman's drink. Mr Collins said: ""I wanted to show them the drugs was gone so they wouldn't spike any girl's drink and show them there was nothing left in the bottle."" He said the men were ""really aggressive"" as they came towards him in a bid to get the bottle back. ""I remember undoing the bottle and I threw it at the males,"" he told the jury. Before Mr Collins gave evidence on Wednesday, jurors were told a number of the charges against him and Mr Phoenix had been dropped following legal argument. Mr Collins denies five counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and nine counts of causing actual bodily harm against 14 people. Mr Phoenix, of Clyde Road, Tottenham, north London, denies four counts of GBH and two counts of ABH. The trial continues.

'Airbnb-style' beds to free up hospitals,"It is hoped the Essex trial will see around 30 patients waiting for discharge from hospital care stay Airbnb-style accommodation may be used to free-up NHS hospital beds as part of a pilot scheme under consideration. It is hoped the Essex trial will see around 30 patients waiting for discharge from hospital care stay with local residents who have a spare room. Healthcare start-up firm CareRooms is recruiting ""hosts"" to take in people recuperating from a hospital stay. Eligible patients may be recruited from Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. But the hospital has said final approval for the pilot has not yet been given. CareRooms said it will transform spare rooms and annexes with a private bathroom into ""secure care spaces for patients who are waiting to be discharged"". Eligible patients will be recruited from Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Prospective hosts, who can earn up to Â£1,000 a month, need to pass security checks before they are approved for the scheme. They would be required to heat up three microwave meals each day and supply drinks for patients and are offered ""host protection"" as well as a helpline and training. The company's website said it aims to ""provide patients with a practical alternative to hospitals and care homes to recuperate in"". The news comes amid the crisis of delayed discharges in hospitals. Last week, Age UK warned that increasing numbers of elderly and frail patients are being ""marooned"" in hospital beds, despite being medically fit. NHS figures show that last year, 2.2 million hospital ""bed days"" in England were lost due to delayed transfers of care. The proposed trial will take place in Essex, it was first revealed by the Health Service Journal (HSJ). CareRooms said the ""micro pilot"" would involve just five to 10 hosts over a three-month period. The trial will not start until all parties are assured that the process is ""safe or safer than standard practice"", it said. Yvonne BlÃ¼cher, managing director of Southend University Hospital, said: ""We would like to make it clear that only preliminary discussions have been held. Clearly if a decision to pilot such a proposal was made we would expect all safety, quality and regulatory arrangements to be satisfied.""

'Incredible' editing of life's building blocks,"Scientists have demonstrated an ""incredibly powerful"" ability to manipulate the building blocks of life in two separate studies. One altered the order of atoms in DNA to rewrite the human genetic code and the instructions for life. The other edited RNA, which is a chemical cousin of DNA and unlocks the information in the genetic code. The studies - which could eventually treat diseases - have been described as clever, important and exciting. Cystic fibrosis, inherited blindness and other diseases caused by a single typo in the genetic code could ultimately be prevented or treated with such approaches. Both studies were performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The first,published in the journal Nature,external, developed tools called base editors. DNA is built out of the four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). If a single one of them is in the wrong place, it can cause disease. Base editors alter the molecular structure of one base to convert it into another. Researchers can now manipulate the four bases. And the team used base editing to correct an inherited disease that leads to dangerously high levels of iron in the blood. Prof David Liu of the Broad Institute said: ""We are hard at work trying to translate base editing technology into human therapeutics."" However, he admits there are still issues around safety and implementation: ""Having a machine that can make the change you want to make is only the start. You still need to do all this other work, but having the machine really helps."" The second study,published in the journal Science,external, focused on RNA, another of the molecules essential for life. DNA is the master copy of the genetic code, but in order for a cell to use the genetic instructions, it must first create an RNA copy. It is like going to a library where you cannot read any of the books, but can only use photocopies. The researchers used their RNA approach to correct an inherited form of anaemia in human cells. Feng Zhang - also of the Broad Institute - said: ""The ability to correct disease-causing mutations is one of the primary goals of genome editing. ""This new ability to edit RNA opens up more potential opportunities to... treat many diseases, in almost any kind of cell."" All of the experiments were on human cells growing in the laboratory. DNA surgery on embryos removes disease Human embryos edited to stop disease UK scientists edit DNA of human embryos Dr Helen O'Neill, from UCL, said: ""This is an exciting week for genetic research. ""These papers highlight the fast pace of the field and the continuous improvements being made in genome editing, bringing it closer and closer to the clinic."" Scientific advances in genetic engineering are taking place at an incredible pace. And the same technologies work on plants, animals and micro-organisms too, posing questions for areas like agriculture. Dr Sarah Chan, a bioethicist at the University of Edinburgh, said we can no longer pretend the technology is too dangerous to contemplate. She told the BBC: ""We can't hide any more. ""The science is moving fast in the sense it is becoming less risky, more certain, more precise and more effective. ""It is absolutely past time for us to engage more widely with publics on the issue of gene editing.""

Parachute case accused 'despised by wife',"Victoria Cilliers was giving evidence for the first time at the trial of her former husband The wife of an Army fitness instructor accused of tampering with her parachute ""despised"" him over suspicions he was having an affair, a court heard. Victoria Cilliers, 40, suffered multiple injuries in a 4,000ft fall at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire in 2015. Emile Cilliers, 37, denies attempting to murder his former Army officer wife. Giving evidence at Winchester Crown Court, Mrs Cilliers said she wanted to ""get her own back"" on him, and changed her will to cut her husband out of it. Mr Cilliers also denies a second attempted murder charge and a third charge of tampering with a gas fitting at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on 30 March 2015. Mrs Cilliers told the court their marriage began to fail in November 2014. ""Cracks were starting to show, I was aware around that time, I had suspicions before that he was having an affair,"" she said Victoria Cilliers survived a 4.000ft fall Mrs Cilliers said she also knew her husband was in financial difficulty as he was ""bad with money"". Being also pregnant at the time, she was ""starting to feel insecure in the marriage"". Mrs Cilliers told the court she changed the terms of the will to leave the house to their children. In a letter to her husband to accompany the new document, she wrote: ""I do hope Emile you understand my reasons. ""I love you and you are an amazing father to the children, I just want to ensure that they have the access to education I had."" In court BBC Wiltshire reporter Rhiannon Fitz-Gerald Walking unaided into the wood-panelled courtroom, Victoria Cilliers was largely composed as she spent just over an hour giving evidence standing in the witness box. At times Mrs Cilliers lingered before answering questions from the prosecution but the former Army physiotherapist addressed the jury clearly and articulately, showing little sign of emotion. However, there were moments when the witness prickled in response to certain statements. As the prosecution prepared her for ""sensitive questions"", she retorted: ""My life's been public for the last few years."" Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers, a sergeant with the Aldershot-based Royal Army Physical Training Corps, twisted the lines of her main parachute and sabotaged a reserve chute the day before her jump. Mrs Cilliers, who suffered broken vertebrae, ribs and pelvis in the fall, admitted in court she gave differing accounts to police about the amount of time her husband was alone with her parachute. When asked if she had always told the truth over that, she replied: ""Not always. The extent of his lies and deceit had been disclosed to me and I just wanted to get my own back to a certain extent."" The trial continues. The Army fitness instructor denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers in April 2015 Parachute trial accused 'caused gas leak' Parachute sabotage accused 'texted lover' Parachute 'sabotage' possible in minutes Accused husband 'skilled parachute packer' Reserve parachute 'had never failed' Parachute 'not tampered with in toilet' Parachute sabotage trial jury visits site Parachute murder bid accused 'unemotional' Jury shown 'tangled parachute' pictures Parachute fail wife 'among UK's best' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Man sought by police after convenience store incident Fire breaks out at secondary school Secondary school confirms it will be closed after fire Photographs show snow fall in New Forest amid yellow weather warning The Cotswolds named as one of best places to live in country New chairman takes on role at charity after day out with Bobby Van At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

First conviction in US Fifa investigation,"Hector Trujillo was arrested in December 2015 in Florida, during a Disney cruise with his family. A former Guatemalan judge who led his country's football federation has become the first person to be sentenced in a US investigation into corruption in Fifa. Hector Trujillo was sentenced to eight months in prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy. He admitted to accepting almost $200,000 in bribes from a sports marketing company. The US has indicted around 40 football and marketing executives. Mr Trujillo admitted offering media and marketing rights to Guatemala's World Cup qualifier matches in return for bribes. The US investigation was first revealed in May 2015 and has seen federal prosecutors in New York indict around 40 sports and football executives linked to football in the Americas. Many of the charges involve bribes paid around the organisation of regional tournaments and World Cup qualifying games. Prosecutors in Switzerland have also been investigating and Fifa has conducted internal enquiries.

Toilet paper causes offence in Brazil,"The advert featured the words 'Black Is Beautiful' which have since been removed. A toilet paper manufacturer in Brazil has dropped the slogan ""Black Is Beautiful"" from its black-coloured brand. It is not so much the colour of the toilet roll, but the advert for it, which has attracted the most criticism. Personal VIP Black toilet paper was launched on Monday by Sao Paulo manufacturers Santher. It showed white actress Marina Ruy Barbosa draped in the black paper alongside the words 'Black Is Beautiful.' The words have been removed following criticism by racial equality campaigners for the misappropriation of a slogan synonymous with a historic cultural movement intended to empower black communities. Paulino Cardoso,external, a professor at Universidade de Estado de Santa Catarina and an organiser of black Latin American academics, railed against what he called a ""band of damned racists."" He posted: ""It is good to boycott and denounce all this propaganda"".

It later become more prominent in the writings of theBlack Conciousness Movement of Steve Bikoduring the anti-apartheid era. The term was intended to promote black features such as skin colour and hair textures as equal to white beauty standards. Rio de Janeiro-based writer Anderson Franca articulated why the term was offensive ina Facebook post,external. ""If you search 'Black Is Beautiful' anywhere in the world you'll find references to Angela Davis, Malcolm X, The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, Fela Kuti, James Baldwin, and Nina Simone, but not in Brazil,"" he posted. ""People died for this expression to be revered to this day. People are still dying and this expression is more important and vital than ever before.

Bush Sr apologises over sex assault claim,"Ms Lind said the alleged incident took place in 2014 Former US President George Bush Senior has apologised for any distress caused after an actress accused him of sexual assault. Heather Lind said the 93-year-old former president had ""touched me from behind from his wheelchair"" and told a ""dirty joke"" while posing for a photo. Ms Lind made the allegation on social network Instagram, in a post which has since been deleted. A spokesman for Mr Bush said the incident was an attempt at humour. ""President Bush would never - under any circumstance - intentionally cause anyone distress, and he most sincerely apologises if his attempt at humour offended Ms Lind,"" a statement supplied to outlets including the Daily Mail and People magazine said. Both websites preserved the contents of Ms Lind's post before it was deleted. Mr Bush served one term as US president from 1989 to 1993, and is the father of George W Bush, who served two terms in the office between 2001 and 2009. He suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease. Ms Lind said a photo of Barack Obama shaking Mr Bush's hand had disturbed her The incident allegedly took place during an event for the television show Turn: Washington's Spies, in which Ms Lind is one of the main cast members. In her Instagram post, Ms Lind said she was spurred to make the claim after seeing a photo of Barack Obama shaking Mr Bush Senior's hand at a recent fundraiser for hurricane victims, which she said had ""disturbed"" her. ""He sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo. He didn't shake my hand. He touched me from behind from his wheelchair with his wife Barbara Bush by his side,"" she wrote, according to the Daily Mail's transcript of the deleted post. ""He told me a dirty joke. And then, all the while being photographed, touched me again,"" she added. 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Ms Lind finished her post with the hashtag #metoo, which has seen widespread use by victims of sexual assault to share their experiences in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein Hollywood scandal. ""What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn't so different from a president really,"" she said.

Poker star loses Â£7.7m Supreme Court claim,"One of the world's top poker players, Phil Ivey, has lost a Supreme Court bid to reclaim Â£7.7m of winnings withheld by a London casino for five years. The American was challenging a Court of Appeal judgement that Crockfords Club could refuse to pay up when Ivey won the cash playing card game punto banco. The club said Mr Ivey had broken its rules by using an ""edge-sorting"" technique to spot advantageous cards. Mr Ivey had consistently argued that he had merely used a legitimate advantage. The 40-year-old, a former winner of the World Series of Poker, had arranged to play a private game of punto banco - a form of baccarat - at the casino in Mayfair, along with a fellow gambler, Cheung Yin Sun, during a visit to London in 2012. Crockford's owner, Genting Casinos UK, said the two players jointly used the technique of ""edge-sorting"", which involves identifying minute differences in the patterns on the back of playing cards and exploiting that information to increase the chances of winning. Genting said this was not a legitimate strategy. Phil Ivey is one of the world's most successful poker players but was playing punto banco on his London trip However, Mr Ivey contended that the technique was not a form of cheating because it did not involve dishonesty. He said that he had merely exploited Crockfords' failure to take proper steps to protect itself against a gambler of his ability - and he was therefore entitled to his full winnings, rather than just having his initial Â£1m stake returned to him. This video can not be played Paul Willcock, for the club, gives his reaction to the Phil Ivey verdict The five Supreme Court justices unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal's decision on the case, with Lord Hughes saying it was essential that punto banco remained a game of pure chance with neither the casino nor the player being able to beat the randomness of the cards that were dealt. He said: ""What Mr Ivey did was to stage a carefully planned and executed sting."" Speaking outside court, president and chief operating officer of Genting UK Paul Willcock said: ""This has been a landmark case in how the courts approach cheating in the modern day. ""This entirely vindicates Genting's decision not to pay Mr Ivey, a decision that was not taken lightly."" Mr Ivey is a 40-year-old world champion poker player who was born in Riverside, California, but now lives in Las Vegas. According to theHendon Mob poker ranking website,,externalhe is the sixth biggest earner of all time from tournament play - but he is known to have earned many more millions from private cash games. He once played heads-up poker (a one-on-one version of the game) against Texan billionaire Andy Beal for three straight days and walked away $16m richer as a result. During his divorce hearing in 2011 it was revealed in news reports thathe received almost Â£700,000 a month,externalfrom his stake in a poker company. Punto banco is a form of the card game baccarat. It is not unlike blackjack but the aim is to have cards that add up to nine, or as close as you can get. It has a complex set of rules: when the total value of the cards goes into double figures, the first digit of the total does not count - so two sixes add up to two rather than 12. And there are further set instructions on what further cards must be drawn, unlike in blackjack where the player has the option. Compared to other card games, it is not that widely played in casinos but is a popular choice with some high-stake gamblers. A form of baccarat called ""chemin de fer"" was played by James Bond in the casino scene of the 1962 film Dr No. Analysis by John Hand, BBC News For those who don't know their cards, it is hard to overstate how big a superstar Phil Ivey is in the poker world. Dubbed the ""Tiger Woods of poker"", he has raked in tens of millions of pounds from a game that he mastered as a teenager - and coined in many more millions from sponsorship and by exploiting his carefully-built personal image. His mass appeal is such that he became the face of a Chrysler cars ad campaign. For nearly two decades, Ivey has perfectly played the part of a cool, calm, calculating card-player with steely nerves and ice in his blood. Casinos fly him around the world as his presence can attract thousands of other punters. But will Ivey be as big a draw after going ""all-in"" against the British legal system and losing? It is helpful for him that the case was not about poker - and that some of the gamblers he competes with will empathise with his explanation that he was merely being the best punter he could be, in using his savvy to try to beat a casino. It was noticeable that this year Ivey skipped the main event in the World Series of Poker - the equivalent of Roger Federer taking a fortnight off during Wimbledon - and also mothballed his slick Ivey League poker school website. Whether that marks the start of a general wind-down with more days to spend his millions and fewer days spent ""grinding"" for 12 hours at a poker table remains to be seen.

Rock and roll legend Fats Domino dies,"This video can not be played Fats was the father of eight children, whose first names all began with the letter A Fats Domino, one of the most influential rock and roll performers of the 1950s and 60s, has died aged 89. The American rock and roll artist was best known for his songs Ain't That A Shame and Blueberry Hill. The New Orleans singer sold more than 65 million records, outselling every 1950s rock and roll act except Elvis Presley. His million-selling debut single, The Fat Man, is credited by some as the first ever rock and roll record. An official from New Orleans coroner's office confirmed the death, which was earlier announced by Domino's daughter to a local television station. Fats Domino had more than 30 hit singles Fats Domino - whose real name was Antoine Domino Jr - was one of the first rhythm and blues artists to gain popularity with a white audience and his music was most prolific in the 1950s. Domino had 11 US top 10 hits and his music is credited as a key influence on artists during the 1960s and 70s. Elvis Presley referred to Fats Domino as ""the real king of rock n roll"" and Paul McCartney reportedly wrote the Beatles song Lady Madonna in emulation of his style. In 1986 he was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but by his later life Domino would no longer leave his Louisiana hometown - not even to accept the award. New Orleans-born musician and actor Harry Connick Jr is among those who have paid tribute to Domino on Twitter, saying he had ""helped pave the way for New Orleans piano players"".

Antoine ""Fats"" Domino Jr was born in New Orleans on 26 Feb 1928, the son of a violinist. His parents were of Creole origin, and French Creole was spoken in the family. He was musically inclined from an early age and learned piano from his brother in law, the jazz banjo player, Harrison Verrett. He was given his nickname by bandleader Bill Diamond for whom he was playing piano in honky-tonks as a teenager. He said the youngster's technique reminded him of two other great piano players, Fats Waller and Fats Pichon. Domino left school at the age of 14 to work in a bedspring factory by day, and play in bars by night. He was soon accompanying such New Orleans luminaries as Professor Longhair and Amos Milburn. In the mid-1940s, he joined trumpeter Dave Bartholomew's band, and the two co-wrote Domino's first hit The Fat Man. Suddenly, the New Orleans sound became popular nationwide. Read more about the life of Fats Domino here ""Clean living keeps me in shape. Righteous thoughts are my secret...And New Orleans home cooking"" In an interview with the BBC in 1973, Domino spoke about his early life. He said: ""I was 17 when I made my first record in 1949. I never thought about being professional. I used to work in a lumberyard and that's where I first heard a number on a jukebox and I liked it. It was a piano number. It was called 'Swanee River Boogie' by Albert Ammonds."" Despite both musical heavyweights coming from New Orleans, Fats Domino said he only met Louis Armstrong twice in his life. He told the BBC in a later interview: ""I liked the way he was singing 'Blueberry Hill'. See, a lot of people think I wrote 'Blueberry Hill' but I didn't. ""That number was wrote in 1927 and I recorded that song in 1957. We just put a different background and I just sing it the way it would fit me and it came out great for me.""

Clinton team 'funded' Trump dirty dossier,"US President Donald Trump has seized on reports that Hillary Clinton's team bankrolled a sleazy dossier of allegations linking him to Russia. Claims that Mr Trump had been filmed with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel surfaced in the closing stretch of last year's White House race. Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) reportedly helped fund the research. ""The victim here is the President,"" Mr Trumptweeted,externalon Wednesday. Trump 'compromising' claims How did 'compromising' Trump claims come to light? According to US media reports,external, Perkins Coie, a law firm representing the Clinton campaign and DNC, hired intelligence firm Fusion GPS in April 2016. Allow Twitter content?

Fusion GPS, based in Washington DC, was paid to dig up dirt on Mr Trump, who was then Mrs Clinton's rival for the presidency. The intelligence firm subcontracted Christopher Steele, a former British spy who previously worked in Russia, to compile the research. Attributed to unnamed sources, it claimed that Mr Trump had colluded with Russian officials during the election campaign. The unsubstantiated dossier also alleged that Kremlin spies filmed Mr Trump with prostitutes at Moscow's Ritz-Carlton hotel in 2013. Christopher Steele, a former British spy who worked in Russia, compiled the research The opposition research was initially funded by an unknown Republican consulting firm, which pulled the plug once Mr Trump captured the party's nomination. The Clinton campaign then picked up the tab, according to the reports. As he headed off to Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday, President Trump told reporters on the White House lawn: ""It's very sad what they've done with this fake dossier."" He added: ""Hillary Clinton always denied it, the Democrats always denied it. ""I think it's a disgrace, it's a very sad commentary on politics in this country."" In January shortly before he was sworn in as president, Mr Trump dismissed the dossier as ""fake news"". White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted on Tuesday: ""The real Russia scandal? Clinton campaign paid for the fake Russia dossier, then lied about it & covered it up."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Political campaigns have been in the business of digging up dirt on their rivals since the dawn of democratic elections. A choice bit of ""opposition research"", deployed at an opportune moment, can be a decisive factor in a close election. So it should come as little surprise that supporters of a Republican candidate went to work building a file on Donald Trump during the party primaries or that Democrats took the baton as the general election geared up. What's unusual - and what will pique the interest of investigators and fuel the suspicions of conservatives - is that after the election, once Hillary Clinton was defeated, the FBI would pick up funding for this investigation. A topic as sensitive as this - allegations of foreign influence on a presidential campaign - doesn't seem like something the US government should be outsourcing. There have been plenty of accusations, on both sides of ideological divide, that the FBI has become politicised. Stories like this won't help diminish those concerns. In fact, they will almost certainly be cited to undermine the results of ongoing inquiries into Mr Trump's possible Russia ties, whether or not the eventual findings have a connection to this now-infamous dossier. The DNC said its new leadership had nothing to do with creation of the dossier. A spokeswoman told the Washington Post, which broke the story: ""But let's be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened."" Earlier this week, a US judge gave Fusion GPS until Thursday to reach an agreement with congressional investigators who issued a subpoena to see the firm's bank records over the last two years. Some of Mr Steele's allegations began circulating in Washington in the summer of 2016 as the FBI began looking into whether there were any links between Trump aides and the Kremlin. Special counsel Robert Mueller and several congressional panels are investigating the same alleged connections, but to date have revealed no conclusive evidence. A few weeks ago Mr Mueller's team questioned Mr Steele about the assertions in the dossier.

May reassures MPs over Brexit vote timing,"Theresa May has said she is confident there will be enough time for MPs to get a Brexit vote before the UK leaves. During Prime Minister's Questions, she was pressed on comments by David Davis who earlier said a vote might not happen before the March 2019 deadline. He said the vote's timing hinged on when a deal was done and this may be at the ""59th minute of the 11th hour"". But Mrs May said she believed it would happen ""in time for Parliament to have the vote we committed to"". The government agreed earlier this year to give Parliament a ""meaningful"" say on the outcome of the current negotiations but Downing Street has not said when it will be. The Brexit secretary told a Commons committee it had always been the government's goal that the vote would take place before the European Parliament gave its own verdict, expected to be in late 2018 or early 2019. Tusk talks of risks of Brexit 'defeat' Live: David Davis answers questions Business bodies call for Brexit clarity Reality Check: Is a last-minute Brexit deal possible? But he said that ""it can't come before we have the deal"" and pressed on whether this might not happen before the end of March 2019, he replied ""yes that's correct, in the event that we don't do the deal until then"". The comments have been seized on by Labour MPs one of whom - Stephen Kinnock - asked the PM how Parliament ""could have a meaningful vote on something that has already taken place"". Mrs May said it was right that negotiations could continue right until the scheduled date of Brexit but suggested that it was in the interest of all parties to conclude them before then. ""It is not just this Parliament that wants to have a vote on that deal - there will be ratifications by other Parliaments,"" she said. This video can not be played Stephen Kinnock asks PM to explain how it is possible to have a ""meaningful vote on something that has already taken place"" ""I am confident, because it is in the interests of both sides, that we will be able to achieve that agreement and negotiation in time for this Parliament to have the vote we committed to."" But Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said ministers were making up policy ""on the hoof on a daily basis"" while Lib Dem spokesman Tom Brake said not to have a vote before Brexit would be ""an insult to democracy"". Former Tory education secretary Nicky Morgan said it would be ""completely pointless"" to have a vote after the UK had left and was therefore pleased about the PM's reassurances. ""The danger of answering hypothetical questions as David Davis has done this morning is you end up in hotter water,"" she told the BBC's Daily Politics. ""The sovereign Parliament has to have a final meaningful vote."" But former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke said he was not concerned about there being a vote before Brexit as the UK would leave anyway under the terms of the Article 50 process, which he voted against. He told the BBC there was no way a trade deal would be agreed by March 2019 and until that happened - and Parliament approved it - the UK would remain signed up to whatever transition deal came into force. The government, Mr Davis told MPs, was aiming to conclude all its negotiations - including a future trade deal - by the time of its withdrawal and while this was perfectly feasible, it could be a close-run thing. ""It is no secret that the way the union makes its decisions tends to be at the 11th minute... 59th minute of the 11th hour of the 11th day and so on and that's precisely what I expect to happen here."" ""It will be very high stress, very exciting for everyone watching, but that's what will happen. In technical terms, there is no reason why we can't do this in the time available... I am quite sure in my mind we can do this."" Mr Davis suggested the talks could go up to the wire Under the terms of existing EU treaties, the UK would not be able to sign a trade deal with the EU until it becomes a ""third party"" and has left the EU. Mr Davis said ""technically"" this was true, but that a deal could be signed almost immediately, or as he put it, ""a nano second"" afterwards. The Department for Exiting the European Union released a statement afterwards clarifying Mr Davis's position, saying he had been asked about hypothetical scenarios and both the UK and EU hoped to finalise a deal by October 2018, giving time for Parliament to vote on it before the UK leaves. On Monday, Mrs May suggested the two-year implementation period she was hoping for was dependent on details of the final ""partnership"" being clear at the time of exit. This alarmed business groups, which warned earlier this week that the UK risks losing jobs and investment without an interim deal agreed much sooner. Pressed on this during the hearing, Mr Davis said that by the first quarter of next year, it ""should be pretty plain what we are trying to deliver"" in terms of transition, which he said would look ""much like"" the status quo in terms of trade, migration and other arrangements. However, he noted the EU had not yet drawn up their final negotiating guidelines on any transition and both sides needed to know what the UK's final destination would be before this was settled. While the UK wanted a full trade deal, he said there was the possibility of what he described as a ""bare bones"" agreement where there were understandings in key areas but no over-arching agreement. An outcome where the two sides were unable to agree anything was ""off the probability scale"", he added.

Apple hires ex-BBC One controller,"Jay Hunt will begin work at Apple at the start of 2018 Apple has hired Jay Hunt - the former controller of BBC One and chief creative officer of Channel Four - to join its video team. Ms Hunt was responsible for TV shows including Sherlock and Luther at the BBC before helping Channel 4 sign up the Great British Bake Off. Her title at Apple will be creative director, Europe, worldwide video. Apple has not specified what it involves, but she is expected to commission programmes on its behalf. Until now, Apple's own programming has served as an adjunct to its Music subscription service and included Planet of the Apps - a business reality TV competition  - and Carpool Karaoke - a spin-off from James Corden's Late Late Show. However, the US firm has committed $1bn (Â£754m) to acquire and produce further content over the coming months, accordingto a report in the Wall Street Journal,external. Ms Hunt helped Channel 4 take Bake Off from the BBC Earlier in the year, Apple revealed it had hired two Sony Pictures TV executives. Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg had overseen Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul and Rescue Me among other US shows. These developments have fuelled speculation that the company is preparing to launch a video subscription service to rival Netflix and Amazon Video, with original content, after failing to convince the US networks to let it sell bundles of their programming. ""It seems like Apple is going for a worldwide push already, even though it hasn't yet made much headway in the US,"" said Tom Harrington, an analyst at research firm Enders Analysis. ""Jay Hunt is exceptional in the commissioning space. She's exceptional at finding programmes that fit the outlet she's working at. ""She could have worked anywhere she wanted."" Apple is not the only US tech giant investing in the TV industry. Facebook launched its Watch service in the US in August, offering cookery, fitness and travel-themed programmes among other content. Twitter is developing news programming in conjunction with Bloomberg and Buzzfeed, and has also acquired streaming rights to several sports events. Google continues to invest in its YouTube Red service, which produces ad-free films and shows for subscribers. Sherlock was one of Ms Hunt's most successful commissions at the BBC When Jay Hunt missed out on the job of chief executive at Channel 4, where as chief creative officer she had overseen a series of big hits and bought Great British Bake Off from the BBC, everyone in the industry asked the same question. What jobs in British TV might she actually now want? Answer: not many. As television is reinvented - from linear, scheduled programmes watched by families around a single television set, to on-demand shows watched largely on mobile phones and tablets, or sometimes through multiple screens - it is the big American technology companies that are driving innovation. Last week, Netflix showed impressive quarterly growth in subscribers. Many senior figures in the industry say Amazon is changing the rules of the game, by offering massive budgets for drama and documentaries. And there is talk aplenty about social media giants buying up live sports rights. In hiring Ms Hunt, Apple has reinforced the message that it is taking television and original content very seriously. At her leaving party in Channel 4's London headquarters recently, the universal feeling was that it would be to one of these big technology companies that she moved. That has now come to pass. Jay Hunt poached Bake Off from the BBC in a move that was met with widespread scepticism, and plenty of derision. Yet with six million viewers per episode, its switch has been a success. What show might she poach from another broadcaster next - perhaps even her former employers? Given Apple's market capitalisation of more than $800bn (Â£603bn), I suspect money won't be an issue. Ms Hunt is going to enjoy her new budget.

Yes we Canvey? Why the island wants independence,"Occupying seven square miles off the coast of Essex, Canvey Island is home to more than 40,000 people They are two battles for independence taking place 700 miles apart: one fighting for the future of Catalonia, the other for the reclaimed land of Canvey Island. WhileCatalonia's Carles Puigdemont wants to separate from Spain, the aim of the Canvey Island Independence Party is to wrestle back control of the Thames estuary island from the mainland's Castle Point Borough Council. The movements may differ in size and scope, but both share a view that they are different and a resentment that their affairs are being run from elsewhere. So who are Canvey's islanders and what has inspired their fierce sense of pride and tangible community spirit? Councillor Dave Blackwell says others are ""jealous"" of Canvey's community Councillor Dave Blackwell is the leader of the Canvey Island Independence Party (CIIP). Over a pot of tea in the Labworth cafe, just off the seafront, he says Canvey people have always been different. It is partly because Canvey is an island, he says, and partly because of the way they are seen by outsiders. His party currently has 15 of 17 councillors on the island itself. Yet there are 24 other councillors on Castle Point Borough Council from the mainland. This has led to Canvey's councillors being consistently outvoted, Councillor Blackwell says, resulting in the island becoming the ""poor relations"" of the mainland. He claims that following the party's recent election successes, one opposing activist posted a comment online saying they did not mind losing seats in Canvey as it was ""a wart on the landscape"". Councillor Blackwell says people on the mainland like to make Canvey the butt of their jokes. They are, he says, ""jealous"" of the pride locals take in the area. He beams when asked about the work put in to rejuvenate the beaches and facilities through ""Canvey Bay Watch"". ""All we want is to be treated equally,"" he says. Gary Tivey moved from London's East End Gary Tivey, moved to Canvey 28 years ago and still jokes he is a newcomer. He says the high number of islanders who originated from London's East End brought their morals and values to Canvey. He tells a story about when he was having a house built and the sale of his own property fell through. The builder said ""don't worry about it, I know how much you want this house"" and waited for him to remarket his house. ""That wouldn't happen anywhere else,"" he says. For Canvey's population there is ""no next town"" to go to, he adds, ""so you can't fall out with people"". Danielle Low says going to the pub can feel like a therapy session Gary's daughter Danielle Low is a 34-year-old mum of two who has lived on Canvey since she was six. Whenever her 11-year-old son is out and about, she says her ""little spies"" are keeping an eye on him. But she admits living in such a close community does have its downside. ""If I go into to my local pub it can be like a soap opera,"" she says. ""If anyone is in trouble or having an affair everyone knows about it. Going for a drink can be like a therapy session."" If fans of US reality TV really wanted a shock, Danielle says, they should film a series of ""Real Housewives of Canvey Island"". She says her proudest moment was helping to raise more than Â£50,000 with 25 friends on a 70-mile walk. They were greeted by the ""whole island"" on their return, she says, adding: ""That is what Canvey is all about."" Prefab sprout: Canvey has more than 2000 ""park homes"" for over 55s Occupies seven square miles (18km) off the coast of south Essex Settled by Dutch engineers in the early 17th Century who reclaimed the land from the Thames Estuary The island controlled its own affairs until Canvey Island Urban District Council was abolished in 1974 and it became part of Castle Point Borough Council It now has a population of more than 40,000 Canvey is connected to the rest of Essex by two road bridges Joel Friedman (right) and colleagues looking at JCoCI's latest house purchase Despite the deep roots of many residents, Canvey's population is changing. In the last 15 months, the Jewish Congregation of Canvey Island (JCoCI) has been established to find homes for people from north London's strictly orthodox Haredi community. Spiralling property prices have prompted some to look beyond the confines of London. JCoCI trustee Joel Friedman says he could not have received a warmer welcome. ""Other councils didn't want us, but the attitude has been very different [in Canvey], both from the islanders and Castle Point."" Mr Friedman acknowledges there could be challenges ahead. ""We are moving from one of the top Remain areas in the country to one of the top Brexit areas,"" he shrugs. ""We need homes that are available and affordable and the perception of Canvey has perhaps helped in that respect."" His was one of six original families that move to the island in the summer of 2016. There are now 28 families and about 200 people. Mr Friedman estimates eventually there will be 70 to 80 Haredi families, making a community of more than 450. Chris Fenwick has managed the band, Dr Feelgood, for 43 years One of those helping the new community settle down is a man with a complicated CV. Chris Fenwick is probably best known as the manager for the last 43 years of Dr Feelgood, Canvey's best known band. He also owns the Oysterfleet, the largest pub and hotel on the island. He is heavily involved in helping the JCoCI become established and is keen to explain how the island will benefit from their arrival. He laughs at comparisons between Canvey and Catalonia, but says the way the island is seen by people a few miles away is a problem. He talks about going to a business lunch where one speaker described Canvey as the ""biggest open prison in England"". Canvey's sea wall has several murals portraying the 1953 flood ""They despise us,"" he says. ""They look down on us, but they never come here. Canvey has more multi-millionaires per head than anywhere else around."" He says you can't begin to understand why Canvey is different without talking about a flood thathit the island in 1953, killing 59 people and leading to 13,000 more being evacuated. Chris claims to be the product of the flood. ""The storm hit on 31 January and I was born early November. I was a flood baby,"" he says. He says Canvey is now booming because people are making the same calculation that some in the Jewish communities have made. ""House prices mean London has turned into another country,"" he says. ""Canvey is benefitting."" John Huet says in many ways time has stood still in Canvey Seventy-year-old John ""The Professor"" Huet is a former electrical engineer and lecturer.

"Obituary: Fats Domino, rock 'n' roll pioneer","Fats Domino was one of the most influential rock and roll performers of the 1950s and 60s. He was already a star on the R&B circuit in his native New Orleans in the 1950s, but the advent of rock and roll propelled him to global popularity. He sold more than 65 million records, more than any other rock and roller - with the exception of Elvis Presley. His style was a major influence on several important artists, including John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Antoine ""Fats"" Domino Jr was born in New Orleans on 26 February 1928, the son of a violinist. His parents were of Creole origin, and French Creole was spoken in the family. He was musically inclined from an early age and learned piano from his brother in law, the jazz banjo player, Harrison Verrett. By the mid 50s he was one of America's biggest stars He was given his nickname by bandleader Bill Diamond, for whom he was playing piano in honky-tonks as a teenager. He said the youngster's technique reminded him of two other great piano players, Fats Waller and Fats Pichon. Domino left school at the age of 14 to work in a bedspring factory by day, and play in bars by night. He was soon accompanying such New Orleans luminaries as Professor Longhair and Amos Milburn. In the mid-1940s, he joined trumpeter Dave Bartholomew's band, and the two co-wrote Domino's first hit The Fat Man. Suddenly, the New Orleans sound became popular nationwide. Domino had further hits with Every Night About This Time in 1951, Goin' Home in 1952 and Going to the River in the following year. Though Fats Domino never had the personal charisma of Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard or Chuck Berry, his R&B style lent itself ideally to the rhythm of rock, and many of these artists covered his material. It was an era in which a new and exciting sound - born of black America - took over from the established white-dominated pop of Frank Sinatra, Rosemary Clooney and Perry Como. Along with Jerry Lee Lewis and James Brown, he was one of the first inductees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame But it was not until 1955 that Fats Domino finally broke into the mainstream pop world with Ain't That a Shame. The following year, he had his biggest hit with Blueberry Hill, a slow, bluesy sing-along - originally a Louis Armstrong tune - which became Domino's theme song. His popularity soon crossed the Atlantic - along with Bill Haley he was blamed for causing Teddy Boy riots in the UK in the 1950s. His popularity never waned By 1960 - the year he recorded Walkin' to New Orleans - he was rivalling Presley as one of the world's top-selling rock artists. Between 1955 and 1963, Fats Domino had 35 Top 40 US singles, including Whole Lotta Loving, Blue Monday and I'm in Love Again. In 1968, interest in his music was revived after he released a version of The Beatles' Lady Madonna. The era of The Beatles and the Rolling Stones, of guitar bands and outrageous stage performances, was light years away from Fats Domino's laid-back and assured style. The father of eight children, whose first names all began with the letter A, Fats Domino continued to tour into old age - most notably with other rock'n'roll legends like Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry. EMI released a definitive box-set of his recordings in 1991 and two years later came his first recorded album for 25 years, Christmas is a Special Day. His New Orleans house was damaged during Hurricane Katrina Fats Domino lived in style in New Orleans and in later years didn't like to travel far from his native city. However, in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina hit, his house was ruined and most of his possessions, including his gold and platinum discs, were destroyed by the floods. In 2007 he played a benefit concert in aid of the city he was so closely identified with and which remained his home. Universally accepted as a rock and roll legend, an unassuming Fats Domino once said of himself: ""I'm glad that people liked me and my music. I guess it was an interesting life. I didn't pay much attention, and I never thought I'd be here this long.""

JFK assassination: Questions that won't go away,"This video can not be played What will top-secret JFK files tell us about Kennedy's killer? On Thursday, classified files about the Kennedy assassination will be released - but what might they show? Where were you when Kennedy was shot? Toni Glover was there, in Dallas, watching by the side of the road. She was 11 years old. ""I had a troubled childhood,"" she says. ""I thought if I could get Kennedy to look at me, and wave at me, that would mean we had a personal relationship, and everything at home would be perfect. ""It was magical thinking from an 11-year-old."" A recent picture of Toni Glover in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, with the Book Depository building in the background Toni got to the Dealey Plaza early and found a ""perfect"" spot to watch the president's parade. ""He came by, he smiled and waved,"" she says. ""Jackie smiled and waved - she was on my side. ""He turned the corner. I thought, 'I'm going to follow this car until it disappears because it's the president - I'm going to watch every second I can.' ""And then his head exploded. It just exploded."" She told her mother that someone had thrown fireworks into the car. ""But really, I knew different,"" she adds. Now, 54 years later, Dr Toni Glover is an associate professor at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania. ""I believe in facts,"" she says. ""I went to a (JFK) conference where there were a number of conspiracy people. Some of it is insane. Some of it is absolutely crazy."" And yetâ¦ ""There are some legitimate investigators that have a question or two that they've almost answered."" John F Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was shot dead on 22 November 1963. He was travelling in an open-topped limousine. The Governor of Texas John Connally, who was sitting in front of the president, was wounded but survived. Within an hour, Dallas policeman JD Tippit was also killed. Soon afterwards, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested. Within 12 hours, he was charged with the killings of President Kennedy and JD Tippit. Lee Harvey Oswald's mugshot On 24 November, Oswald was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas police department by Jack Ruby, a local nightclub owner. The shooting was captured live on television. Ruby was convicted of killing Oswald and sentenced to death. He appealed but died of cancer in 1967, before the retrial. A week after Kennedy was killed, President Lyndon B Johnson set up a commission to investigate the case. The Warren Commission's report,external, published in September 1964, said that: The shots were fired from the sixth-floor window at the south-east corner of the Texas School Book Depository The shots were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald There was ""no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign"". There were other investigations: In 1968, a panel of four doctors ""supported the medical conclusions of the Warren Commission"" In 1975, the Rockefeller Commission found ""no credible evidence of any CIA involvement"" In 1979, theHouse Select Committee on Assassinations,externallargely supported the Warren Commission - but said there was a ""high probability that two gunmen fired at President Kennedy"". In 1992, a law passed by Congress meant all assassination-related records - around five million pages -were transferred to the National Archives,external. Around 88% of the records are open in full; 11% are open but with ""sensitive portions"" removed; and 1% are withheld in full. According to the 1992 law, all records must be published in full within 25 years, unless the president says otherwise. The deadline is Thursday. Toni Glover - who saw the killing aged 11 - thinks there may have been a second shooter. Some people believe the ""other"" gunman fired from the ""grassy knoll"", which the president's limousine passed. Toni thinks the second shooter - if there was one - could have been on the other side of the road. ""There's fairly substantial evidence,"" she says. ""It has some validity to it."" The view from the sixth floor of the Book Depository, taken one hour after the assassination Jefferson Morley is a former Washington Post reporter who has written several books on the killing - including one, out this week, about former CIA counter-intelligence chief James Angleton. ""I've never written about a conspiracy theory,"" he says. ""I report new facts about the assassination."" He ""tends to doubt"" that Oswald shot JFK. He says it's more likely the fatal shot came from in front of Kennedy - rather than behind. ""Look at the Zapruder film,"" says Morley, referring tothe famous home-movie footage of the killing,external. ""Kennedy's head goes flying backwards. ""I know there's a theory that if you get hit by a bullet from behind, the head goes towards the source of the bullet. But as a common sense explanation, it seems very unlikely. ""That sure looks like a shot from the front."" Trump to allow release of JFK files Reporting JFK's assassination JFK and the rise of conspiracy theories Morley has other reasons to doubt the official story. A paraffin test on Oswald's cheek, after he was arrested, suggested he hadn't fired a rifle (the test's reliability has been questioned). John Connally - the Texas governor who was also travelling in the president's car - said he was not hit by the same bullet as Kennedy, contradicting the Warren Commission's findings. And Morley thinks other parts of the official explanation don't add up. ""The official story - there was this guy Oswald, who nobody knew anything about, who came out of nowhere and shot the president - that story we know, beyond a reasonable doubt, is false,"" he says. ""Oswald was monitored by the counter-intelligence staff of the CIA and by James Angleton for four years - from December 1959 when they opened their first file, to November 1963."" This video can not be played A British nurse was in the Dallas hospital when JFK was shot But Thomas Whalen, an author and associate professor at Boston University, thinks Oswald did shoot JFK. ""And not just me, but in general, historians believe he was the assassin. The big question is - was he involved in a broader conspiracy?"" While the Warren Commission said Oswald acted alone, it did note that he travelled to the Soviet Union in 1959, unsuccessfully applied for Soviet citizenship, and lived there until 1962. It also found that Oswald - a self-proclaimed Marxist - visited the Cuban and Russian embassies in Mexico City in September 1963, two months before Kennedy was shot. Whalen says the newly released documents may shed light on this trip. ""What was Oswald doing in Mexico City weeks before the assassination? Did he meet Cuban and Soviet intelligence officials? Did they give him a green light? ""Certainly Fidel Castro (Cuban prime minister, then president) had motive to kill President Kennedy. We - we being the United States government - were trying to kill him."" Bruce Miroglio, a lawyer from St Helena, California, has read ""many thousands"" of books on Kennedy and his assassination. ""In fact, I'm sitting in my office looking at the 26 volumes of the Warren Report,"" he says. Although he says the report made mistakes, he ""basically supports"" its conclusions. He does not believe there was a second gunman, is ""sceptical"" of conspiracy theories, and is not expecting huge revelations in Thursday's documents. ""The number of people that would be involved in the cover-up is so vast, it seems almost impossible they would keep anything earth-shattering under wraps,"" he says. Toni Glover says it will be ""interesting"" to see what emerges. She, though, will remain a witness, rather than an investigator. ""I can't validate anything,"" she says. ""I was at an exuberant presidential parade, everybody hopping up and down, thrilled out of their mind. ""Fifteen seconds later we were in abject dread.""

"Kamal Ahmed:  Growth up, now get set for the Budget","They are not exactly hanging out the bunting at the Treasury, but today's better-than-expected economic growth figures have put a bit of a spring in the step of the chancellor. And that is not just for economic reasons. Philip Hammond is under increasing political pressure from cabinet colleagues to loosen the purse strings in his Budget on 22 November. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, has gone public, suggesting that the government should borrow more for housebuilding. And another senior cabinet minister I spoke to, with excellent knowledge of the prime minister's thinking, also suggested to me that some fiscal largesse might be just what the country needs. Philip Hammond is not of that view - and the better economic data will give him a little more headroom in the public finances without having to borrow more. His hand has been strengthened. In his interview with me, Mr Hammond made it clear that he remains a fiscal conservative, focused on ""balancing the books"" and bringing the deficit down to zero by the middle of the next decade. I asked him whether he saw any merit in delay. ""Well, we've already moved the target for balancing the books out from 2020 to 2025, but continuing to drive down the deficit in a measured and sensible way over a period of years, so that we are living within our means, and reducing the debt we are passing on to our children, has to be the right way to go,"" Mr Hammond told me. There is certainly a robust argument going on in government. There are those who believe that Mrs May's administration needs some eye-catching initiatives. And given that tax rises are difficult to push through Parliament (just remember what happened to those March plans to increase National Insurance contributions for the self-employed), borrowing more seems the easiest route to paying for popular policies. Should we borrow to build? Many economists believe that the present deficit of 2.6% is low enough to satisfy the markets that the government is fiscally competent and has public debts under a modicum of control. And Mr Javid said that ""taking advantage of record low interest rates can be the right thing if done sensibly"". That does not appear to be the view of Mr Hammond. ""The government's borrowing costs are not at record low levels, they've risen over the last six or eight months,"" he said. That's because higher inflation has increased the cost of servicing the government's debt. ""But the most important point here is that we still have a very large deficit and we have a debt which is 90% of our national income. That leaves us very exposed to any future shocks to the economy. ""So we want to continue to get the deficit down in a measured and sensible way over the medium term, giving ourselves room to support the economy, support our public services, invest in Britain's future through productivity-stimulating investment, but still moving over time to get that deficit down and starting to see our debt shrinking as a share of our GDP, so we don't simply pass on an unsupportable debt to the next generation."" The government's approach to borrowing will be a vital to the tone and feel of the Budget. As far as Mr Hammond is concerned, ""living within our means"" is still the key message he wants to emanate from the Treasury.

Reality Check: Is a last-minute Brexit deal possible?,"This video can not be played David Davis tells MPs Parliament's vote on a Brexit deal may come after March 2019. The Brexit Secretary, David Davis, has suggested that Parliament might not get a vote on a Brexit deal until after March 2019. It's prompted criticism from some MPs, who are worried their votes will be meaningless because by that point, the UK will have already left the EU. Also significant is Mr Davis' claim that the European Parliament might have to wait to have its say too. According to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which the UK triggered seven months ago, the withdrawal agreement must be passed by a majority of members of the European Parliament. Even if a deal was done at ""the 11th hour"" as  Mr Davis suggested when giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, it would be too late for MEPs to debate it and vote it through. So the upshot of a last-minute deal could be no deal at all. The Brexit department later clarified that Mr Davis was talking about ""hypothetical scenarios"" and ministers are working to reach an agreement in ""good time"" before March 2019. It's not entirely clear what ""deal"" Mr Davis was referring to. The European Union has broken down the negotiations into two parts. The first focuses on the issues associated with withdrawal, such as the rights of EU citizens, the Northern Irish border and the UK's financial obligations. The second covers what our future relationship might look like, including areas such as trade, scientific research and consumer rights. The British government says it's not possible to separate the two parts, because in many respects, they're intrinsically linked. If the ""deal"" that Mr Davis was talking about this morning encompasses both, it must be ratified on or before 29 March 2019, which means an agreement would need to be reached in time for that. The future relationship part could be ratified after the deadline, but only if part one is rubber-stamped before the deadline. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is hopeful of reaching a withdrawal agreement by autumn 2018 and the Brexit department said that was their aim as well. Technically it is possible to extend the Article 50 period, currently fixed at two years, if there's unanimous agreement from the 27 remaining member states. But that option would be a hard sell.

Xi and the advent of âawesome Chinaâ,"China's new leadership line-up was the last scene to play in the carefully scripted drama of the Communist Party Congress. Yet again Xi Jinping defied convention. Halfway through one Party chief's decade in power, a leader-in-waiting would normally appear in a red carpet ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. Butthe men beside Mr Xiwere all in their 60s, too old to be an heir. Breaking the mould on the succession, as with so much else, is part of the Chinese president's New Era, as he has termed it. But don't imagine that now the Congress is over, you can forget about Mr Xi's New Era. In the clash of political civilisations, he has put China on the offensive. In his three-and-a-half hourspeech to Congress, he set out a vision not just for the five years ahead but for 30, and talked of a socialist model which provides, ""a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence"". At home China is already a surveillance state accelerating its ability to listen to every call and track every face, online posting, movement and purchase. Expect it now to export not just the governance model but the cyber weapons to make that work. How Chinese authorities censor your thoughts Charting China's 'great purge' under Xi The thoughts of Chairman Xi Mr Xi wants China's socialism to be a model for others to follow Gone is the insistence that China must hide its light under a bushel and be a modest player abroad. Mr Xi told Congress that China must be a ""great power"" with a first class military ""built to fight"". But the president's New Era doesn't rely solely on hard power. Over the past four decades China has built a market economy under a one party state. Now Mr Xi hopes to correct its flaws to deliver his citizens a better quality of life. He dreams of an innovative powerhouse driven by well educated citizens with unshakeable faith in the superiority of their system. Hisspeech to Congresspromised more control of the internet to ""oppose and resist the whole range of erroneous viewpoints"". But he hopes to win the battle for hearts and minds even earlier and his education minister said schoolchildren would soon begin to study ""'Xi Thought'"". The full slogan is ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"". Behind the rhetoric, this means an enormous centralisation of power for Xi and his Party over China's economy and society. 'Xi thought' puts Xi Jinping (left) on par with Mao Zedong Who is China's President Xi Jinping? What's on the agenda at the Communist Party Congress? Analysis: Xi Jinping's speech spells power Official media have dwelled on the ""lies"" of western democracy and the failures of capitalism, a system ""swamped by crisis and chaos"". In the words of one commentary by state news agency Xinhua, ""The wealth gap widens, the working class suffers, and the society remains divided"". In absolute GDP, the United States may still be the world's largest economy, but President Trump has withdrawn American leadership on free trade and climate change and Xi's China has neatly stepped into the gap. Mr Xi talks about guiding the international community ""towards a more just and rational new world order"". The latest Pew opinion survey across 37 countries suggests more people now trust the Chinese leader to do the right thing than the American one. On its current trajectory, the Chinese economy will overtake the US some time in the next decade to become the world's largest. Critics dismiss the challenge of the China model, predicting that rigid politics will cramp innovation and growth will succumb to market distortions. Certainly most countries that make it to the world's rich club go democratic first. This video can not be played What can and can't you say in China? But China has always seen itself as exceptional by virtue of its scale, its history and its culture. Xi Jinping says China's road to a great nation will be ""different from that of traditional great powers"". He is no keener to adopt what he sees as American values than the US is to adopt Chinese ones. Several things follow from this control mission. Firstly, the values of liberal democracy are by definition the enemy. The appeal of  free media, independent judiciary and pluralistic civil society are discredited wherever possible. In fact, since Mr Xi came to power, public discussion of these values has become taboo in China. By contrast, Mr Xi is expanding his formal and informal control network through Communist Party cells. They now operate not just in domestic companies but in more than two thirds of foreign invested ones on Chinese soil. All foreign economic engagement in China is increasingly on the Party's terms, permitted only in sectors and at a pace which is designed to meet China's interests rather than those of its trading partners. And for those partners, the debate over how to respond is likely to become more polarised in this New Era. Mr Xi's admirers will insist that China's ruling party deserves credit for pulling many millions of its citizens out of poverty and point out that at nearly 7% Chinese growth is one of the engines of the global economy. Mr Xi wants China centre stage in a new world order His detractors will argue that his Party deserves little credit for an economic miracle won by the hard work and ingenuity of the Chinese people despite its rulers rather than because of them. Some will even point to the rise of Hitler and Stalin as lessons in the cost of not confronting dictatorships. Four trillion dollars in foreign reserves, and control over the fastest growing consumer market in the world, give Xi Jinping powerful weapons to influence this debate. Even as the Communist Party unveiled its new leadership on Wednesday, it excluded several major western news organisations from the ceremony. Officially no reason was given for barring the BBC, Financial Times, Economist, New York Times and Guardian, but unofficially journalists were told that their reporting was to blame. Another sign of Xi's determination to control the message at home and abroad. As Mr Xi declares China ready ""to move towards centre stage in the world"", it's not clear whether his mission to control will help or hinder him. For his public the slogan of the moment is not ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics For a New Era"". It is the far simpler ""awesome China"" in red and gold on banners, bicycle wheels and social media posts. Few would deny that China is awesome. But exactly how is in the eye of the beholder. For many Chinese patriots, ""awesome China"" signals pride. For many outsiders it means admiration. But for others there's an undercurrent of ambivalence and even fear. The only certainty is that none will be untouched by China in Mr Xi's New Era.

#MeToo hits European Parliament,"This video can not be played An MEP's assistant catalogued three years of harassment in the parliament Jeanne PontÃ© had only been in her job as an assistant to a French member of the European Parliament for two weeks when it happened for the first time. ""During a conference he was watching me with a lot of insistence,"" she says, recalling the behaviour of one German MEP back in 2014. ""After a while I was relieved because I didn't see him anymoreâ¦ [but] he was waiting for me at the exit. ""He stopped me walking past and put his arms around my waist, asking me if I was new."" It was the first time Jeanne, now 27, would experience sexual harassment or sexist comments in her job at the European Parliament. It prompted her to keep a diary of future incidents. Three years on, she has recorded nearly 50 cases involving her and her colleagues, ranging from sexist comments to physical touching and intimidation. The parliament's existing anti-harassment committee deals with any allegations Jeanne is one of several female staff members who have spoken out against sexual harassment in the European Parliament in the wake of the allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. She has been closely supported by her MEP, Edouard Martin, who has joined her in campaigning for change. ""I am horrified by what she has gone through,"" he said. ""We need to find a way to better protect assistants, interns and other administrative staff."" During a debate about sexual harassment at the European Parliament on Wednesday, several MEPs held up 'Me Too' placards in the chamber in solidarity with victims and to demonstrate that they had also had negative experiences. The 'me too' campaign went viral after actress Alyssa Milano tweeted about it amid widespread allegations in Hollywood Among them was Terry Reintke, a Green MEP from Germany, who said she was shocked by the intensity of the harassment described in some of the women's stories. She believes that victims in the parliament are still afraid to make official complaints. ""The stigma is still so high,"" she says. ""We need to do more to encourage women to come forward. It's a general problem that women who report these incidents are still not being trusted - their experiences of assault and harassment are not trusted."" Ms Reintke and her MEP colleagues at the European Parliament have written a letter calling for an external investigation into sexual harassment at the institution in response to the allegations. The letter is addressed to the president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, and asks for a special dedicated committee on sexual harassment to be set up, and for legal and medical support to be provided to victims.

The letter calls for mandatory training on gender awareness and harassment for all parliamentary staff. It also asks for male MEPs and staff in particular to ""show solidarity with victims by disassociating themselves from, and denouncing such behaviour whenever it occurs"". Edouard Martin agrees it is everyone's responsibility to tackle the issue. ""I am not proud to say it now, but I have been part of conversations where sexist comments have been made,' he says. ""I should have taken a stand and said that those comments were unacceptableâ¦ we need to stop normalising this behaviour."" The French Socialist Party MEP was elected in 2014 The parliament's existing anti-harassment committee deals with all forms of harassment. But it consists mostly of MEPs with no independent experts - a set-up that many believe does not go far enough in providing the right support to victims. Catherine Bearder, head of the committee, says that assistants and other staff are represented, but that victims just do not want to come forward. She says this is particularly a problem for assistants who worry about the impact of reporting sexual harassment on their careers. ""We must get better at encouraging the victims to come forward by providing guarantees they will not lose their job,"" she says. Part of the problem is that MEPs personally choose their assistants - a situation which Ms Reintke believes makes it even more difficult for victims to report incidents of concern. ""There is such a direct relationship between MEP and assistantsâ¦ there is a procedure in place for when an MEP wants to let a staff member go, but it's still the case that they can ask to terminate your contract if and when they so wish.""

Why are businesses getting political?,"Fashion label Jigsaw is the latest company to take a political stance with a new, pro-immigration fashion campaign titled Heart Immigration. Its advertising campaign includes a manifesto declaring: ""British style is not 100% British. In fact, there's no such thing as 100% British."" ""As a clothing brand, we couldn't do what we do if people weren't free to move around,"" the advert continues. ""Without immigration, we'd be selling potato sacks."" The campaign has drawn praise from figures including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, but Jigsaw has also come under fire on social media for taking a stance on what is considered a political issue. It's not the first company to feel the heat for expounding its beliefs, and with politics on both sides of the Atlantic becoming increasingly polarised, it's unlikely to be the last either. ""It's not about politics, it's just basic humanity and values for us,"" says Jigsaw chief executive Peter Ruis. He adds: ""Immigration is something very normal, it's living and working in another country. And it seems to have been demonised as a word."" ""It's just basic humanity and values for us"": Jigsaw chief executive Peter Ruis But no matter what the viewpoint of customers, Mr Ruis says ""everyone is welcome in our stores"". ""Our campaign is not about numbers or what are the right border controls,"" says Mr Ruis, whose company employs people from more than 45 countries. ""Our campaign is just celebrating Britain, this country that has welcomed foreigners for thousands of years."" Jigsaw is one of an increasing number of big businesses overtly weighing in on public debates around controversial political issues. No company has positioned itself as anti-immigration, but senior management figures at several firms have made their opinions on Brexit clear. One of the most vocal advocates of the UK leaving the EU is Tim Martin, founder and chairman of the pub chain JD Wetherspoon. During the referendum campaign, Mr Martin donated Â£200,000 to the Leave campaign and had 200,000 beer mats printed and distributed across pubs, bearing messages arguing the UK was better off leaving the EU. More recently, he signed a joint letter urging Theresa May to walk away from Brexit negotiations if the EU refused to start trade talks. Vacuum cleaner magnate James Dyson, one of the UK's leading entrepreneurs, hasalso called Brexit""a liberation and a wonderful opportunity for all of us"". Across the Atlantic, major US companies are increasingly taking public stances on political issues, spurred largely by the Trump administration policies on immigration, climate change and other controversial topics. In an Instagram post, jeweller Tiffany & Co said ""the disaster of climate change is too real"" and called on President Donald Trump to keep the US in the Paris Climate Agreement. Corporate giants including Apple and Facebook also voiced their opposition to Mr Trump's controversial ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries in Africa and the Middle East. Starbucks boss Howard Schultz even pledged to hire 10,000 refugees globally over the next five years. But does this mean that businesses are becoming increasingly moved to act on their conscience, or is something else at play? ""Increasingly, people are looking to companies to fill the role of government around social ills as public trust in institutions falls to new lows,"" says Petah Marian, senior editor at business trend forecaster WGSN. ""We are describing Generation Z as the activist consumer,"" says Ms Marian, referring to the generation often known as post-millennials. ""This cohort will use their smartphone to launch a social media protest or boycott of a product if a brand's values do not meet theirs, which requires brands to think carefully around what it is that they stand for."" While the motives of some companies may be complex, one thing is agreed upon: it's a trend that's here to stay.

Russell Brand: Society is collapsing,"Brand's latest book deals with his own addictions to drugs, alcohol, sex and fame Addiction and mental health may not be the kinds of issues you'd normally expect to be addressed at a stand-up comedy gig. But Russell Brand has never been your conventional comedian - and it's precisely these subjects that he's tackling in his new book and at one of his upcoming London shows. ""Society is collapsing,"" the comedian tells the BBC, ""and people are starting to recognise that the reason they feel like they're mentally ill is that they're living in a system that's not designed to suit the human spirit. ""People are realising 'Hold on a minute, is it natural to work 12 hours a day? Is it natural that I live in an environment that is designed for human beings from one perspective but not from a holistic perspective?' Breathing dirty air, eating dirty food, thinking dirty thoughts. So really what this is, is a time of transition. ""Yes, the conversation is changing because the communication is becoming so much more expedient, but what's really changing is people are starting to notice that the system is not working for them."" The comedian says he prefers theatres to large arenas when it comes to performing comedy The 42-year-old's latest book - Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions - is released this month, and sees him discussing his own addictions, namely drugs, alcohol, sex and fame. But, he says, the book isn't just for people who have had chemical addictions, and argues that pretty much all of us have some kind of vice. ""Everyone's living their lives on addictions really,"" he says. ""Everyone is living their life thinking they've got the answer to their own little problem. If there's something they get, something they do, they're going to feel a little bit better. Brand in trouble over Elvis interview 'Domestic' Russell Brand gets married Russell Brand donates cafe to charity ""Addicts are just a more pronounced version, and end up usually with a drug issue, but look at what people can do to themselves with food. ""People can destroy their lives with food, and so addiction really, we're all on the spectrum, we're all on the scale, it just depends how severe we are, and I think that unless you're happy in your life, there's room for a program. He continues: ""Unless you're like 'I'm really happy with my job, my diet, my relationship, my body', if that's how you feel, that's fine. You deserve to feel like that, people should feel like that. Brand has turned to activism more recently and attended an austerity march in London in 2015 ""I'm not talking about stupid simple pleasures like eating an ice lolly, that's only very temporary, we're looking at peak and contentedness which we can find our way to, if we're willing to change the way we think."" Brand clearly isn't going to be short of material when he discusses the topic at a special gig at the Hammersmith Apollo on 1 November. In addition to his usual stand-up show, he's going to turn up early to do some readings from Recovery. ""It's the only time I'm ever going to do it,"" he explains. ""So if people want to come at 6.30, I'll read from the book, and then do the show, Rebirth."" It's interesting that Brand is playing somewhat smaller venues than the arenas we've seen other A-list comics perform at in recent years. Michael McIntyre and Chris Rock have both toured arenas in recent years The recent generation of ""rock star comedians"" like Michael McIntyre,Chris Rockand Peter Kay are more likely to sell out the O2 than play an impromptu gig at the Comedy Store, but Brand says he prefers the intimacy of slightly smaller venues. ""People that have played both arenas and theatres, most people prefer theatres, and I'd say the same,"" he says. ""It's a great privilege to perform in front of 20,000 people at once like at the O2, it's lovely, but there's all sorts of reasons for not doing it... but I love doing stand-up comedy, so I'm happy to do two nights in Brixton and two nights in Hammersmith rather than one night at the O2, and it is a better experience for the audience and for the performer."" Speaking about his own live dates, Russell adds: ""The stand-up is full of audience interaction. The thing that excites me most is what people create when they come together in groups."" Brand has become increasingly vocal as an activist and campaigner in recent years Despite his recent activism, which has includedcharity work,austerity protestsandendorsing Jeremy Corbyn,external, it's unlikely that Russell will be entering the world of politics anytime soon. ""If you think the political process doesn't work, why would you think, I'm going to get involved with it?"" he asks. ""If you swap the word 'political process' for 'car', you wouldn't think 'I'm going to get in that car and try and drive it in a different direction. If you think people should be riding horses, start riding a horse. ""So just do what you think is the correct thing to do. If you think your school should be run differently, start running your school differently, and then when you find obstacles to that, confront the obstacles, but never alone, always in groups. ""The thing I've learned from recent conversations from people who are experts, like Prof David Harvey, is to start establishing systems you believe in, and operate within them. So the work I'm doing already is the work that I think should be done. ""So I think if people start communicating honestly and openly, they'll realise, 'Everyone is more similar to me than I imagined.'""

""So I feel so lucky that eight years later, I have three wonderful children. I wanted to give something back and help a couple have a baby."" The teacher, from Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham, said she contacted an organisation that matches families with egg donors and underwent numerous tests and counselling to prepare her.

""They managed to get 19 eggs, all of which are for my couple if they want siblings in the future. ""Egg donation is anonymous until the child turns 16 and they can then find out information about me. ""I cried so much when I found out my couple were pregnant with a girl and they are due near Christmas. ""This was not and never will be my baby. I helped a couple have their baby and the happiness I got, and am still getting from this, I can't even describe."" Maggie Joslin and daughter Georgia who was conceived using IVF Hairdresser Maggie Joslin suffered with severe endometriosis after the birth of her first daughter. She turned to IVF to help conceive another child. ""I was quite driven to have [another] baby but my ex-husband felt we already had one daughter,"" says Ms Joslin, 56, from North Bradley in Wiltshire. ""I was quite ill afterwards and also suffered from depression and he couldn't cope. ""It was gruelling emotionally and physically and it led to the end of my marriage. ""I was in hospital for nine weeks after giving birth and have been left with all sorts of health problems. ""I was very lucky to have a beautiful baby girl called Georgia.

We could either have one cycle at a top clinic in Harley Street or look elsewhere."" After researching clinics in London and Greece the couple decided to travel abroad. ""Their success rate was so much higher and not only that but the money would provide us with two full cycles and cover us living in Greece for a month,"" the 34-year-old said.

""We agreed we would not do more than two rounds as we had heard horror stories of people continuously trying and spending fortunes on it. ""Our first round was a positive experience and we were extremely hopeful. When it didn't work it felt horrendous, like we had lost something. ""However, the second time we had zero expectations and it was an awful experience. When it didn't work we didn't even shed a tear and we were glad it was over. ""We tried adoption and now have two wonderful boys who we are so lucky to have.

The couple who've climbed the world's 14 highest mountains,"Husband-and-wife mountaineering team Romano Benet and Nives Meroi were attempting a winter ascent of the world's fifth-highest mountain, Makalu, when things went badly wrong. It was the first of two serious challenges that could have brought their climbing careers, and even their lives, to an end. The biggest problem on Makalu was the freezing wind. Considered one of the most difficult mountains in the world to climb, in early 2008 a relentless gale was making it almost impossible. Two years before, French mountaineer Jean-Christophe Lafaillle had died trying to make a winter ascent. But Benet and Meroi, and their fellow Italian Luca Vuerich, had not yet given up hope of success. ""For a month the gusts knocked us from here to there, and we couldn't even sleep at night,"" Meroi remembers. Despite everything, the trio reached 7,000m (22,966 ft) - about 1,500m below the summit - and decided to hang on, hoping that the wind would die down. ""Instead, the jet stream exploded in a furious crescendo,"" Meroi says. ""We were running for our lives, when a gust of wind picked me up. ""My feet lost their grip on the gravel, I slipped between two big boulders and I fell, with my body twisting on my trapped foot. ""The wind continued to howl while I heard the sharp sound of my bone snapping."" With a broken leg, she could not move unaided. Luca Vuerich carrying Nives Meroi - he died in an avalanche in the Alps two years later So for two days Benet and Vuerich took turns to carry her on their shoulders. They walked through fog and along a glacier to reach Camp Hillary at 4,860m (16,000ft) where a rescue helicopter was able to pick them up and fly them to Kathmandu. ""Despite 40 years of climbing we still fear the mountains,"" Meroi says. Meroi and Benet first met at high school in Italy, and started hiking and climbing together after discovering their shared passion for the outdoors. ""Romano likes to say it was a matter of convenience,"" Meroi says. ""It was easier to have a girlfriend who could also climb, so he didn't have to struggle to find a climbing partner every weekend."" The couple's marriage, in 1989, was actually triggered by their desire to go climbing in the Peruvian Andes, on the Cordillera Blanca range. ""It was a dream we had, but we had no money or leave days,"" Meroi says. ""So we decided to get married because our employers would give us two weeks off, and we asked our friends and family to pay for the trip."" The first successful winter ascent of Makalu was made in 2009 - the year after Meroi, Benet and Vuerich's attempt Listen to Nives Meroi and Romano Benet talking about their extraordinary mountaineering success onOutlook on the BBC World Service. The year after the ill-fated Makalu trip, once Meroi's leg had healed, the couple to set out to climb Kangchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, which straddles India and Nepal. They were closing in on the 8,586m summit when Benet felt unwell. ""I was tired and slower than usual so I decided to stop, but I told Nives to continue,"" he says. If Meroi had climbed the remaining few hundred metres to the summit, she would have stood a good chance of becoming the first woman to climb all of the world's 14 peaks above 8,000m (26,247ft). But she didn't think twice about turning round. ""When I realised there was something wrong with Romano I decided to descend as fast as we could,"" she says. ""I thought, 'What's the point of me going up there alone?' If Romano had waited in the tent at 7,600m while I was trying to climb to the top I might not have found him alive when I came back."" This video can not be played Nives and Romano talk about their self-sufficient approach to tackling the world's eight-thousanders Benet was eventually diagnosed with aplastic anaemia, a very rare and potentially life-threatening condition in which your bone marrow fails to produce enough new blood cells. The couple refer to this as their 15th eight-thousander, and the most difficult one. ""If it wasn't for the difficult situations that we had experienced in the mountains, I don't think I would be able to bear all this,"" Benet used to tell Meroi during the months of his illness. He was to undergo nearly two years of treatment, including dozens of blood transfusions. ""Mountaineering is about facing one problem at a time, and about knowing that every step forward is a step we'll have to take coming back down,"" Meroi says. ""We like to think that climbing mountains gave us the skills to face the disease. It taught us to place one step after the other, to be patient, and to never give up."" But every therapy that the doctors tried on Benet failed. Their last hope was to give him a bone marrow transplant. Finally a matching donor was found and the transplant was carried out. But it didn't work. ""The doctors had run out of ideas,"" Meroi says. ""But then they decided to experiment with something new - in mountaineering terms, to open a new route."" They thought a second bone marrow transplant from the same donor might just work, even though the first had failed. ""The person who had donated the bone marrow in the first place was asked to go through the entire process for a second time,"" Meroi says. ""And, bless him, he agreed to do that."" ""That's what brought Romano back to life. To this day we don't know who this person is, but his silent and generous act really gives us hope in humanity."" It wasn't only the anonymous donor, Benet says, who helped him to overcome his illness. ""For two years Nives was the best partner I could imagine,"" he says. ""She never left my side. We approached it as we always do, as a team, roped together."" A few years later, Benet and Meroi put on their backpacks again and returned to Kangchenjunga for another attempt. ""I was so thrilled to be back on the mountains - it was like unleashing a chained dog,"" Benet remembers. But in their excitement to be back in the mountains the pair accidentally climbed up the wrong gorge. ""I think we are the first mountaineers in the history of the Himalayan ascents to get the wrong peak,"" Benet says. ""But for me being there and knowing that I could still make it was enough."" In 2014 they returned to Kangchenjunga for a third time. ""That time we got the right mountain,"" Meroi says. ""We were the first climbers of the season, so we had to open the route. It was just the two of us, but when we got to the top we realised we weren't alone - the anonymous donor was up there with us, the young man without a name who had chosen to give a stranger a chance of life. We wouldn't have made it without him."" Although Meroi missed out on being the first woman to climb all of the eight-thousanders, in May this year she and Benet became the first couple to climb all 14 - an achievement all the more notable for their method of climbing without Sherpas or bottled oxygen. This brings with it real dangers. Beyond 2,400m, the human body becomes susceptible to altitude sickness, which can progress to life-threatening conditions including high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral oedema (HACE), when blood vessels begin leaking fluid into the lungs or brain. By the time you reach 8,000m you have entered the ""death zone"", where the air is so thin it is insufficient to sustain human life. ""The human body is not designed to live at those altitudes - even a tiny problem can escalate very quickly,"" Meroi says. ""And it's not just a physical challenge - even thinking about your next move is tiring."" Kangchenjunga dominates the skyline above Darjeeling The couple often climb during the night so that they can arrive at a mountain's summit just after dawn, meaning they can make their descent - which technically can be more difficult and dangerous than the ascent - in daylight. ""When you climb at night you're guided by the light of the stars and sometimes it feels like you're actually above them,"" Meroi says. ""And when you get to the top the first thing you experience is a sense of elation,"" says Benet. ""The view from the top of an eight-thousander is something you'll never forget because from up there you can actually see the Earth curving at the horizon."" For Meroi, reaching the summit of one of the world's highest mountains gives her a different perspective on life. ""You really get a sense of how fragile human life is and how small it is compared to the power of nature, and you realise that the ambitions that drive us mad at sea level are completely irrelevant up there,"" she says. ""I feel like I am at peace with nature and that's probably what makes me want to keep climbing, to find that feeling again.""

Labour suspends MP over abusive comments,"MP Jared O'Mara has been suspended by Labour while it investigates misogynistic and homophobic comments he is alleged to have made. The Sheffield Hallam MP has apologised for online remarks from 2002 and 2004 but denies some more recent claims. Labour initially said it would not be suspending the MP while these allegations were investigated. But Jeremy Corbyn had decided to act when yet more comments emerged on Wednesday, a spokesman said. How to 'deep clean' your online activity Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC: ""There will be a full investigation by the Labour Party and then, as a result of that, a final decision will be made about his future."" Asked about Labour colleagues who had defended Mr O'Mara in recent days, Mr McDonnell said: ""They were basing that judgement on the information they had before them and the information that was provided to them by Jared himself and others. ""New information has come to light, so quite rightly the Labour Party has acted swiftly. He's been suspended, the whip has been withdrawn."" Asked about the case at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said: ""All of us in this House should have due care and attention to the way in which we refer to other people and should show women in public life the respect they deserve."" This video can not be played Theresa May says MPs should ""should show women in public life the respect they deserve"" On Monday, Mr O'Mara resigned from the women and equalities committee after political website Guido Fawkes unearthed offensive comments made by the 35-year-old MP online as a younger man. Then on Tuesday, Sophie Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics she had met Mr O'Mara on a dating app and there had been ""no hard feelings"" when things did not work out between them. But in an incident in March, Mr O'Mara, who was DJing in a nightclub, made comments to her that ""aren't broadcastable"" and called her an ""ugly bitch"", she said. A spokesman for Mr O'Mara said the MP ""categorically denies"" the allegation. The Guido Fawkes site has also found another post made by Mr O'Mara in his mid-20s, a review of an Arctic Monkeys gig, in which he calls women ""sexy little slags"". And it has published details of a post to a music forum, allegedly made by Mr O'Mara in 2009, which includes offensive remarks about women. Labour launched an investigation into Mr O'Mara's conduct on Tuesday, saying it was specifically looking at ""comments and behaviour which have been reported from earlier this year"". But it has now said it is also looking at his online remarks from 2002 to 2004 and the newer alleged comments. Labour's shadow education minister Tracy Brabin said Mr O'Mara's suspension was ""probably a wise move"". Before the news broke, she had described his actions as ""unpleasant and unacceptable"", adding that the episode ""doesn't look fantastic"". Conservative MP Mims Davies, chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary group for women in Parliament, said it was ""right"" that Mr O'Mara had been suspended over his ""vile"" comments. But she added: ""Why on earth has it taken so long?"" Pressed on why the party had waited until Wednesday to suspend Mr O'Mara, a Labour spokesman said the MP had gone to the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting on Monday night and made ""a very thorough-going apology and talked about the journey that he'd been on. That was welcomed."" But ""new information about things that he'd allegedly written more recently"" had emerged, prompting Mr Corbyn to take action. The Labour leader had made clear ""this kind of abusive, misogynistic, sexist language is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the Labour Party,"" he added.

In pictures: Rohingya fleeing Myanmar,"Confused and scared, two-year-old Hazera holds on to her mother after reaching Bangladesh from Myanmar Myanmar's military has brutally evicted more than half a million Muslim Rohingya people from the country's northern Rakhine state. The UN human rights office says their homes and villages have been burned down, and their crops and livestock destroyed to stop them coming back. Rohingya who fled to neighbouring Bangladesh say that the security services' ""clearance operations"" involved mass civilian killings, torture, and child rape. The military denies committing genocide, insisting it has only targeted Rohingya militants. But for those who fear being homeless or worse, the semantics are immaterial. Bangladesh's UN ambassador says more than 600,000 people have crossed the border since late August, joining the 300,000 or so who fled earlier outbreaks of violence. They are starving and exhausted. Many are traumatised, and most have children with them. BBC photographer Salman Saeed took these pictures near the refugee camps in Palongkhali, Kutupalong and Balukhali, in the Cox's Bazar area of Bangladesh. These Rohingya families have been walking for more than a week without food, but have finally arrived in Bangladesh after witnessing atrocities in Myanmar's Rakhine state. They carry their few belongings and blankets on sticks over their shoulders. Thirteen-year-old Mobin walked for 12 days to reach safety. UN experts believe it is ""highly likely"" that Myanmar's security forces planted landmines along the border in recent weeks, making an arduous journey yet more fraught with danger. The owner of these weary legs waded through mud to reach a refugee camp. International observers say some Rohingya people have walked for up to three weeks before arriving at government-run settlements like Kutupalong. The children have welts on the soles of their feet. Rohingya people are using any available transport to escape Rakhine. Some are trekking to the Naf River, which forms the border, while others are sailing up the coast. Dozens have already died trying to cross into Bangladesh in small, rickety fishing boats. The Dhaka Tribunereports,externalthat 28 boats have capsized since 24 August, killing 184 people - mostly women and children. The boats are often overcrowded, and the risk of disaster considerable. Some of those on board are unable to swim. This man, Abu Tabel, arrived in Bangladesh with his few salvaged belongings gathered in sacks and a basket. The caged chicken below was his only companion on the long journey to find a new home. When they reach the camps, the displaced people find - and build - makeshift accommodation along the roads and hillsides around the border town of Cox's Bazaar. The settlements are muddy, wet and overcrowded, with a shortage of clean water and poor sanitation. There are very few toilets. Torrential rain has increased the hardships - and the risk of diseases like cholera. Rohingya tell of 'house by house' killings Is refugee crisis 'textbook ethnic cleansing'? Many of those crossing the border already have relatives in Cox's Bazar, whom they are desperate to find. On 16 October, the Red Cross opened a 60-bed field hospital in Cox's Bazar the size of two football fields. It has three wards, an operating theatre, a maternity ward, and a psychosocial support unit. This young Rohingya boy is comparatively lucky - he has received some medical treatment. Bangladesh has announced plans to build a refugee camp that could ultimately accommodate about 800,000 Rohingya. It would be the largest such settlement in the world. This family was photographed resting and having their first meal in several days. Survivors say starvation had helped drive them from their villages, as food markets in Rakhine state have been shut and aid restricted. Rasida, who is nine months pregnant, is one of thousands of mothers-to-be who have fled - knowing they could give birth any day. Drone footage shows thousands fleeing crisis US withdraws military aid from Myanmar The United Nations Population Fund estimates that of the nearly 150,000 Rohingya women of reproductive age (15-49 years), some 24,000 are pregnant and lactating. Some have had no choice but to give birth by the roadside. On 17 October, the United Nations warned that thousands of Rohingya were still stranded near the Myanmar-Bangladesh border. It urged Bangladesh to speed up the vetting of up to 15,000 affected people, and move them inland to safety. Andrej Mahecic, a UN refugee agency spokesman, said it wanted Bangladesh to ""urgently admit these refugees fleeing violence and increasingly difficult conditions back home"". He added: ""Every minute counts, given the fragile conditions they're arriving in."" For now, the influx continues. Thousands on thousands, caught in the world's fastest-growing humanitarian crisis.

Obituary: Fats Domino,"Fats Domino was one of the most influential rock and roll performers of the 1950s and 60s. He was already a star on the R&B circuit in his native New Orleans in the 1950s, but the advent of rock and roll propelled him to global popularity. He sold more than 65 million records, more than any other rock and roller - with the exception of Elvis Presley. His style was a major influence on several important artists, including John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Antoine ""Fats"" Domino Jr was born in New Orleans on 26 February 1928, the son of a violinist. His parents were of Creole origin, and French Creole was spoken in the family. He was musically inclined from an early age and learned piano from his brother in law, the jazz banjo player, Harrison Verrett. By the mid 50s he was one of America's biggest stars He was given his nickname by bandleader Bill Diamond, for whom he was playing piano in honky-tonks as a teenager. He said the youngster's technique reminded him of two other great piano players, Fats Waller and Fats Pichon. Domino left school at the age of 14 to work in a bedspring factory by day, and play in bars by night. He was soon accompanying such New Orleans luminaries as Professor Longhair and Amos Milburn. In the mid-1940s, he joined trumpeter Dave Bartholomew's band, and the two co-wrote Domino's first hit The Fat Man. Suddenly, the New Orleans sound became popular nationwide. Domino had further hits with Every Night About This Time in 1951, Goin' Home in 1952 and Going to the River in the following year. Though Fats Domino never had the personal charisma of Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard or Chuck Berry, his R&B style lent itself ideally to the rhythm of rock, and many of these artists covered his material. It was an era in which a new and exciting sound - born of black America - took over from the established white-dominated pop of Frank Sinatra, Rosemary Clooney and Perry Como. Along with Jerry Lee Lewis and James Brown, he was one of the first inductees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame But it was not until 1955 that Fats Domino finally broke into the mainstream pop world with Ain't That a Shame. The following year, he had his biggest hit with Blueberry Hill, a slow, bluesy sing-along - originally a Louis Armstrong tune - which became Domino's theme song. His popularity soon crossed the Atlantic - along with Bill Haley he was blamed for causing Teddy Boy riots in the UK in the 1950s. His popularity never waned By 1960 - the year he recorded Walkin' to New Orleans - he was rivalling Presley as one of the world's top-selling rock artists. Between 1955 and 1963, Fats Domino had 35 Top 40 US singles, including Whole Lotta Loving, Blue Monday and I'm in Love Again. In 1968, interest in his music was revived after he released a version of The Beatles' Lady Madonna. The era of The Beatles and the Rolling Stones, of guitar bands and outrageous stage performances, was light years away from Fats Domino's laid-back and assured style. The father of eight children, whose first names all began with the letter A, Fats Domino continued to tour into old age - most notably with other rock'n'roll legends like Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry. EMI released a definitive box-set of his recordings in 1991 and two years later came his first recorded album for 25 years, Christmas is a Special Day. His New Orleans house was damaged during Hurricane Katrina Fats Domino lived in style in New Orleans and in later years didn't like to travel far from his native city. However, in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina hit, his house was ruined and most of his possessions, including his gold and platinum discs, were destroyed by the floods. In 2007 he played a benefit concert in aid of the city he was so closely identified with and which remained his home. Universally accepted as a rock and roll legend, an unassuming Fats Domino once said of himself: ""I'm glad that people liked me and my music. I guess it was an interesting life. I didn't pay much attention, and I never thought I'd be here this long.""

Growth figures raise chances of rate rise,"This video can not be played UK economy 'solid' in third quarter, says Hammond The UK's economy had higher than expected growth in the three months to September - increasing the chances of a rise in interest rates in November. Gross domestic product (GDP) for the quarter rose by 0.4%, compared with 0.3% in each of 2017's first two quarters,according to latest Office for National Statistics figures.,external Economists said the figures were a green light for a rate rise next week. If it happens, it will be the first rise since 5 July 2007. The financial markets are now indicating an 84% probability that rates will rise from their current record low of 0.25% when the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets on 2 November. Mark Carney and his team meet next week to decide on interest rates Governor Mark Carney indicated to the BBC last month thatrates could rise in the ""relatively near term"". UK economist Ruth Gregory, of research company Capital Economics, said the figures ""have probably sealed the deal on an interest rate hike next week"". While many economists echo that view, some think the Bank of England will keep rates where they are. ""If all we can muster... is an acceleration in economic growth that's so small you could blink and miss it, the Bank of England could still think better of a rate rise next week,"" said Ross Andrews from Minerva Lending. Economic growth: Five charts that matter Is now the time to raise interest rates? The slightly better growth figures will strengthen the arguments of the interest rate hawks on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Next Thursday, the Bank's rate setting committee meets to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. With inflation at 3%, Mark Carney, the governor, has signalled that an increase is on the cards. And with economic growth more robust than many economists expected, those who support that direction of travel on the MPC will be emboldened. To be clear, any rate rise will be small. And future rate rises will be gradual. But the Bank is sending a clear message - slowly, eventually, the period of historically low interest rates is coming to an end. The pound rose more than a cent against the dollar and nearly a cent against the euro in the first couple of hours of trading after the announcement. Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We have a successful and resilient economy which is supporting a record number of people in employment. ""My focus now, and going into the Budget, is on boosting productivity so that we can deliver higher-wage jobs and a better standard of living."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The UK is not growing as fast as many of our trading partners in the EU or the USA. ""The Chancellor cannot keep hiding from the facts, as his approach of carrying on as usual is seriously putting working people's living standards at risk."" The biggest contributor to growth in the third quarter was the service sector, which expanded by 0.4%. In particular, computer programming, motor traders and retailers were the businesses that showed the strongest performance. Manufacturing expanded by 1% during the quarter - a return to growth after a weak second quarter. However, construction contracted by 0.7% in the quarter, accelerating from the 0.5% decline recorded in the previous three months.

Lockdown police 'misread' traveller threat,"Mobile phone footage showed police in Cromer dealing with trouble on the streets Police failed to properly deal with disorder in a seaside town because senior officers ""misread the significance of events"", a report says. A Norfolk Police review into why Cromer went into ""lawless lockdown"" after 100 travellers visited was instigated by the chief constable. Pubs, shops and restaurants closedover the weekend of 19 August following reports of rape, theft and assault. Poor ""information flow"" was blamed for the failure to deploy extra officers. In a statement, the force outlined the recommendations of its review, identifying four areas of concern over leadership, the sharing of intelligence, not scanning social media correctly and officers failing to utilise powers to deal with unauthorised traveller encampments. The findings said officers were notified by Suffolk Police a group of travellers had left Lowestoft after being involved in a disturbance there, and was heading for the county. However, ""the information and actions were not recorded on official systems"" which meant it was not shared with key senior staff across the Norfolk force. Public information on social media about the level of threat was ignored, with commanders not realising the effect the travellers' presence and behaviour was having on the community and ""as a result insufficient additional resources were deployed"". Officers at the scene were therefore outnumbered and ""unable to take positive action"" to deal with 37 reported offences over the weekend, the report found. The review found senior officers also put out ""an ill-judged statement on social media referring to the disorder as 'low-level'"". Chief Constable Simon Bailey said ""We've truly come to understand the power of social media."" Cromer Pier said its Theatre Bar was closed because of the disorder The travellers arrived in Cromer at the end of the town's festival week. According to the Chief Constable the group are not popular among the wider travelling community. Restaurants and pubs including the Theatre bar on Cromer Pier closed early following reports on social media of thefts and anti-social behaviour. The findings said ""These decisions combined meant that the travellers were not moved on quickly enough."" Chief Constable Simon Bailey held a meeting to discuss the police response to the disorder Chief Constable Simon Bailey said: ""We got this wrong and I feel terribly sorry that the people of Cromer feel let down by our response. ""If we'd drawn together the intelligence that was available and was known at the time and in different pockets of the organisation... we'd be in a very different position,"" he said. The chief constable also said resources were stretched that weekend as the force was ""in the middle of investigating""the killing of dog walker Peter Wrighton, in East Harling, ""which left us exposed"". The review was welcomed by Laurie Scott, of Breakers cafe, who applauded the chief constable's ""openness and honesty"" in admitting they made mistakes. ""If a similar incident were to happen in Cromer tomorrow, I'm confident the police would be all over it like a rash,"" he said. Aryun Nessa Uddin said officers in three cars watched while she and her family tried to remove aggressive people from their restaurant, the Masala Twist Nashim Uddin, of the Masala Twist restaurant, said he hoped ""police stick to what they've recommended and don't brush this under the carpet"". A further independent review of the decisions made by individual commanders is still being carried out by Cumbria Police. ""Any specific recommendations regarding leadership actions and decisions will be implemented once the independent review by Cumbria has been completed,"" the statement said. Norfolk Police said a number of crimes committed over the weekend are still being investigated. Two men have arrested and bailed in connection with a rape. Cromer police admit 'we got it wrong' Police chief 'sorry' for Cromer response More powers wanted to act on travellers Traveller lockdown police review actions Seaside town disorder was 'isolated' Seaside town 'in lockdown' amid disorder Norfolk Constabulary North Norfolk District Council Norfolk MP's gaffe leads to hilarity in House of Commons Shock after human bones left outside church MP raises concerns over 1,000 empty homes in district Radical review of district councils has put plans in limbo Anger grows as councillors get ready for crunch vote to cancel elections Man charged in connection with bike thefts in Norwich At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

'My ex told everyone I had HIV',"This video can not be played 'Helen' says messages she received from her stalker were ""vile"" When Helen was stalked by her ex-partner, she says his abusive messages made her feel ""worthless"". But she felt that the police did not take her seriously. Now one force is developing a new way to help victims. ""I was receiving calls, emails, texts non-stop. One day there were 457 text messages,"" Helen, not her real name, tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She was being stalked by her ex-partner. ""The texts were absolutely vile in nature. Very abusive, calling me a slag, [saying] how dare I end this, that nobody would want me. ""Then it progressed. He posted on social media a sort of lonely hearts column. ""He advertised that I had sexually transmitted infections, which was untrue. He advertised the fact that I had HIV, which was untrue. ""All this abuse was within a very small community. That was horrific to deal with, I felt I could no longer go out in public. ""I felt that everybody knew and was talking about me. It left me very, very scared and paranoid."" Helen decided enough was enough, and went to the police. She says at first they were ""quite responsive"". Her ex-partner was issued with a caution for harassment. But, she says, the term ""stalking"" was never once mentioned to her - even though, at one stage, her stalker ""repeatedly"" drove past her house while a police officer was with her. Her ex breached his caution by posting comments online about her and trying to communicate with her directly. But when she went back to the police, she felt she was not listened to. ""I was getting comments from the police officer such as, 'Well he's from a nice family. Can't you ignore the Facebook stuff, ask your friends not to show you it anymore?' and advising me not to use social media."" She adds that when she rang the non-emergency line to report incidents of stalking, she had to wait ""around five to seven days for an appointment"". An app is being developed to help victims log evidence It is cases like Helen's that have led the National Centre for Cyberstalking Research (NCCR) at the University of Bedfordshire and Bedfordshire Police to develop a set of steps to help victims and those investigating the crimes. An app currently being developed with victims' groups will be given to those considered at ""medium risk"", so that they can record evidence of stalking - from phone calls and screenshots, to videos and audio recordings. The app captures the metadata, so the information behind the messages can be used to track down the offender. It also calculates the hotspots - when the stalker is most actively sending material during the day or week - allowing the victim to plan their life around it, so they can avoid upsetting comments. It comes against the backdrop of a report in July by two watchdogswhich said victims of harassment and stalking were being left at riskbecause of failings by police and prosecutors in England and Wales. It also said too many investigations were poorly run. More than 1.1 million people experience stalking each year, according to the Crime Survey of England and Wales. Dr Emma Short's team has written a guide to help officers identify the risks As part of the scheme with Bedfordshire Police, NCCR has also written a set of specific questions, as part of a risk assessment, for front-line officers to help them determine the level of risk the stalker poses to the victim. NCCR director Dr Emma Short says it is important to have such material for officers who are not technologically advanced. ""It's very hard. If you're listening to a phone call with someone who perhaps isn't communicating the level [of the crime], they're just communicating the content, it's very hard to assess."" Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Frank Farnham says the police's first response is vital, as ""on average it will take someone three months before they go to the police. ""If they trivialise [your experience] you might not go back again,"" he adds. Dr Frank Farnham says in some cases rehabilitation is possible The third part of the scheme involves treating the stalker's behaviour, as well as considering punishment. Bedfordshire Police wants to address why stalkers are committing the crime, and to make them understand the impact on the victim. Dr Farnham says in some instances rehabilitation is possible. ""It depends, to a certain extent, on the underlying motivation and the mental state of the offender,"" he explains. ""There is a group of individuals who understand on some level that their behaviour is unacceptable, but they're backed into a corner and they're lacking the sort of skills to deal with stress - which would allow them to stop their behaviour. ""If you could intervene early with that group, offering therapy and or treatment for mental illness - if they are ill, for example depressed - you might have some beneficial effects."" He says that given that stalkers ""reoffend at such a high rate"", even making a small change in their behaviour would have a large impact on the number of incidents a victim has to deal with. For Helen, this would represent great progress. She says her ex-partner has now not been in contact with her for several months. ""[Being stalked] made me feel like I was worthless. And I'm a very strong independent, bubbly sort of person,"" she says. ""I was so angry at myself for getting into that situation, because I never thought that I'd have been in a relationship that consisted of that. ""I was very angry at him, and I was determined that I was going to get through it."" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

Yes we Canvey? Why Canvey Island wants independence,"Occupying seven square miles off the coast of Essex, Canvey Island is home to more than 40,000 people They are two battles for independence taking place 700 miles apart: one fighting for the future of Catalonia, the other for the reclaimed land of Canvey Island. WhileCatalonia's Carles Puigdemont wants to separate from Spain, the aim of the Canvey Island Independence Party is to wrestle back control of the Thames estuary island from the mainland's Castle Point Borough Council. The movements may differ in size and scope, but both share a view that they are different and a resentment that their affairs are being run from elsewhere. So who are Canvey's islanders and what has inspired their fierce sense of pride and tangible community spirit? Councillor Dave Blackwell says others are ""jealous"" of Canvey's community Councillor Dave Blackwell is the leader of the Canvey Island Independence Party (CIIP). Over a pot of tea in the Labworth cafe, just off the seafront, he says Canvey people have always been different. It is partly because Canvey is an island, he says, and partly because of the way they are seen by outsiders. His party currently has 15 of 17 councillors on the island itself. Yet there are 24 other councillors on Castle Point Borough Council from the mainland. This has led to Canvey's councillors being consistently outvoted, Councillor Blackwell says, resulting in the island becoming the ""poor relations"" of the mainland. He claims that following the party's recent election successes, one opposing activist posted a comment online saying they did not mind losing seats in Canvey as it was ""a wart on the landscape"". Councillor Blackwell says people on the mainland like to make Canvey the butt of their jokes. They are, he says, ""jealous"" of the pride locals take in the area. He beams when asked about the work put in to rejuvenate the beaches and facilities through ""Canvey Bay Watch"". ""All we want is to be treated equally,"" he says. Gary Tivey moved from London's East End Gary Tivey, moved to Canvey 28 years ago and still jokes he is a newcomer. He says the high number of islanders who originated from London's East End brought their morals and values to Canvey. He tells a story about when he was having a house built and the sale of his own property fell through. The builder said ""don't worry about it, I know how much you want this house"" and waited for him to remarket his house. ""That wouldn't happen anywhere else,"" he says. For Canvey's population there is ""no next town"" to go to, he adds, ""so you can't fall out with people"". Danielle Low says going to the pub can feel like a therapy session Gary's daughter Danielle Low is a 34-year-old mum of two who has lived on Canvey since she was six. Whenever her 11-year-old son is out and about, she says her ""little spies"" are keeping an eye on him. But she admits living in such a close community does have its downside. ""If I go into to my local pub it can be like a soap opera,"" she says. ""If anyone is in trouble or having an affair everyone knows about it. Going for a drink can be like a therapy session."" If fans of US reality TV really wanted a shock, Danielle says, they should film a series of ""Real Housewives of Canvey Island"". She says her proudest moment was helping to raise more than Â£50,000 with 25 friends on a 70-mile walk. They were greeted by the ""whole island"" on their return, she says, adding: ""That is what Canvey is all about."" Prefab sprout: Canvey has more than 2000 ""park homes"" for over 55s Occupies seven square miles (18km) off the coast of south Essex Settled by Dutch engineers in the early 17th Century who reclaimed the land from the Thames Estuary The island controlled its own affairs until Canvey Island Urban District Council was abolished in 1974 and it became part of Castle Point Borough Council It now has a population of more than 40,000 Canvey is connected to the rest of Essex by two road bridges Joel Friedman (right) and colleagues looking at JCoCI's latest house purchase Despite the deep roots of many residents, Canvey's population is changing. In the last 15 months, the Jewish Congregation of Canvey Island (JCoCI) has been established to find homes for people from north London's strictly orthodox Haredi community. Spiralling property prices have prompted some to look beyond the confines of London. JCoCI trustee Joel Friedman says he could not have received a warmer welcome. ""Other councils didn't want us, but the attitude has been very different [in Canvey], both from the islanders and Castle Point."" Mr Friedman acknowledges there could be challenges ahead. ""We are moving from one of the top Remain areas in the country to one of the top Brexit areas,"" he shrugs. ""We need homes that are available and affordable and the perception of Canvey has perhaps helped in that respect."" His was one of six original families that move to the island in the summer of 2016. There are now 28 families and about 200 people. Mr Friedman estimates eventually there will be 70 to 80 Haredi families, making a community of more than 450. Chris Fenwick has managed the band, Dr Feelgood, for 43 years One of those helping the new community settle down is a man with a complicated CV. Chris Fenwick is probably best known as the manager for the last 43 years of Dr Feelgood, Canvey's best known band. He also owns the Oysterfleet, the largest pub and hotel on the island. He is heavily involved in helping the JCoCI become established and is keen to explain how the island will benefit from their arrival. He laughs at comparisons between Canvey and Catalonia, but says the way the island is seen by people a few miles away is a problem. He talks about going to a business lunch where one speaker described Canvey as the ""biggest open prison in England"". Canvey's sea wall has several murals portraying the 1953 flood ""They despise us,"" he says. ""They look down on us, but they never come here. Canvey has more multi-millionaires per head than anywhere else around."" He says you can't begin to understand why Canvey is different without talking about a flood thathit the island in 1953, killing 59 people and leading to 13,000 more being evacuated. Chris claims to be the product of the flood. ""The storm hit on 31 January and I was born early November. I was a flood baby,"" he says. He says Canvey is now booming because people are making the same calculation that some in the Jewish communities have made. ""House prices mean London has turned into another country,"" he says. ""Canvey is benefitting."" John Huet says in many ways time has stood still in Canvey Seventy-year-old John ""The Professor"" Huet is a former electrical engineer and lecturer. He moved to Canvey from east London 61 years ago to what he thought was ""a beautiful playground"". ""Canvey isn't part of the mainland and isn't part of the Thames, we're something other,"" he says. He says the island has moved with the times in many ways. But in a lot of other ways it has stayed the same. ""Time has stood still, but 40 years ago my house was in the middle of field, now it's surrounded."" He backs the demands for an ""independent"" Canvey. ""It was taken away by political chicanery,"" he says. ""We need to get it back."" All photographs by Andrew Testa / Panos Pictures Voters look again at referendum choice.

May 'confident' over timing of Brexit vote,"Theresa May has said she is confident there will be enough time for MPs to get a Brexit vote before the UK leaves. During Prime Minister's Questions, she was pressed on comments by David Davis who earlier said a vote might not happen before the March 2019 deadline. He said the vote's timing hinged on when a deal was done and this may be at the ""59th minute of the 11th hour"". But Mrs May said she believed it would happen ""in time for Parliament to have the vote we committed to"". The government agreed earlier this year to give Parliament a ""meaningful"" say on the outcome of the current negotiations but Downing Street has not said when it will be. The Brexit secretary told a Commons committee it had always been the government's goal that the vote would take place before the European Parliament gave its own verdict, expected to be in late 2018 or early 2019. Tusk talks of risks of Brexit 'defeat' Live: David Davis answers questions Business bodies call for Brexit clarity Reality Check: Is a last-minute Brexit deal possible? But he said that ""it can't come before we have the deal"" and pressed on whether this might not happen before the end of March 2019, he replied ""yes that's correct, in the event that we don't do the deal until then"". The comments have been seized on by Labour MPs one of whom - Stephen Kinnock - asked the PM how Parliament ""could have a meaningful vote on something that has already taken place"". Mrs May said it was right that negotiations could continue right until the scheduled date of Brexit but suggested that it was in the interest of all parties to conclude them before then. ""It is not just this Parliament that wants to have a vote on that deal - there will be ratifications by other Parliaments,"" she said. This video can not be played Stephen Kinnock asks PM to explain how it is possible to have a ""meaningful vote on something that has already taken place"" ""I am confident, because it is in the interests of both sides, that we will be able to achieve that agreement and negotiation in time for this Parliament to have the vote we committed to."" But Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said ministers were making up policy ""on the hoof on a daily basis"" while Lib Dem spokesman Tom Brake said not to have a vote before Brexit would be ""an insult to democracy"". Former Tory education secretary Nicky Morgan said it would be ""completely pointless"" to have a vote after the UK had left and was therefore pleased about the PM's reassurances. ""The danger of answering hypothetical questions as David Davis has done this morning is you end up in hotter water,"" she told the BBC's Daily Politics. ""The sovereign Parliament has to have a final meaningful vote."" But former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke said he was not concerned about there being a vote before Brexit as the UK would leave anyway under the terms of the Article 50 process, which he voted against. He told the BBC there was no way a trade deal would be agreed by March 2019 and until that happened - and Parliament approved it - the UK would remain signed up to whatever transition deal came into force. The government, Mr Davis told MPs, was aiming to conclude all its negotiations - including a future trade deal - by the time of its withdrawal and while this was perfectly feasible, it could be a close-run thing. ""It is no secret that the way the union makes its decisions tends to be at the 11th minute... 59th minute of the 11th hour of the 11th day and so on and that's precisely what I expect to happen here."" ""It will be very high stress, very exciting for everyone watching, but that's what will happen. In technical terms, there is no reason why we can't do this in the time available... I am quite sure in my mind we can do this."" Mr Davis suggested the talks could go up to the wire Under the terms of existing EU treaties, the UK would not be able to sign a trade deal with the EU until it becomes a ""third party"" and has left the EU. Mr Davis said ""technically"" this was true, but that a deal could be signed almost immediately, or as he put it, ""a nano second"" afterwards. The Department for Exiting the European Union released a statement afterwards clarifying Mr Davis's position, saying he had been asked about hypothetical scenarios and both the UK and EU hoped to finalise a deal by October 2018, giving time for Parliament to vote on it before the UK leaves. On Monday, Mrs May suggested the two-year implementation period she was hoping for was dependent on details of the final ""partnership"" being clear at the time of exit. This alarmed business groups, which warned earlier this week that the UK risks losing jobs and investment without an interim deal agreed much sooner. Pressed on this during the hearing, Mr Davis said that by the first quarter of next year, it ""should be pretty plain what we are trying to deliver"" in terms of transition, which he said would look ""much like"" the status quo in terms of trade, migration and other arrangements. However, he noted the EU had not yet drawn up their final negotiating guidelines on any transition and both sides needed to know what the UK's final destination would be before this was settled. While the UK wanted a full trade deal, he said there was the possibility of what he described as a ""bare bones"" agreement where there were understandings in key areas but no over-arching agreement. An outcome where the two sides were unable to agree anything was ""off the probability scale"", he added.

MPs debate social care,"Questions to environment ministers Urgent question on Brexit timetable Business statement on week's agenda Debates on Modern Slavery Act and LGBT rights Peers meet for questions at 11am Debates include intergenerational fairness and air and water pollution Esther Webber, Alex Partridge and Gary Connor Urgent question on Brexit vote House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Nicky Morgan has told Brexit Secretary David Davis that Tory MPs who support an amendment requiring a final Brexit deal to be approved by Parliament are ""deadly serious"". She says the government should accept amendment 7 to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which is in the name of the former attorney general Dominic Grieve. David Davis told MPs he won't pre-empt the discussion on the bill but those reports [that the rebel Tory MPs are not being taken seriously] are not true. Mr Davis was answering an urgent question in the Commons about when Parliament might vote on a deal with the EU. That's where we leave our coverage of Parliament for tonight. The House of Lords is sitting on Friday morning, and you can follow eventshere,externaland on BBC Parliament. Don't forget,Today in Parliamentwill be covering Parliamentary proceedings at 11.30pm on Radio 4. We'll be back on Monday for more live blog coverage. Pollution debate House of LordsParliament Environment Minister Lord Gardiner of Kimble winds up for the government, speaking of their ""bold ambition to be first generation to leave environment better condition than that in which we found it"". He highlights the government's clean air zone framework, Â£1m for the infrastructure of ultra-low emission zones and action to tackle the use of microplastics. ""Per capita we have reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation,"" he stresses. Pollution debate House of LordsParliament Labour spokesperson Baroness Jones of Whitchurch tells peers it's now clear that air pollution is a ""huge public health scandal"", affecting asthma and children's lung function. She claims the only people this isn't ringing alarm bells for is the government. The issue ""needs national leadership now"", she urges, before accusing ministers of ""passing this responsibility down to local authorities"". House of CommonsParliament MPs are now listening to today's adjournment debate, on improvements to Junction 10 of the A3. MPs return to the chamber on Monday afternoon at 2:30pm for questions to ministers from the Department of Communities and Local Government. Global LGBT rights debate House of CommonsParliament Minister Nick Gibb is winding up the debate, which he says has been ""excellent"". He says the UK has ""one of the strongest legal frameworks in the world for LGBT people"". He reminds the House that 72 countries around the world ban homosexuality and eight retain the death penalty for it. He says the government ""remains committed to working with right-minded countries"" to stand up for LGBT rights around the world. SNP MP tweets Allow Twitter content?

Global LGBT rights debates House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Joanna Cherry says the UK is ""one of the few countries in Europe"" that detains LGBT people who have come to the country as refugees. She says many detainees have homophobic experiences in detention and find that staff are ill equipped to work with LGBT people. She says that if the UK wants to promote itself as supportive of LGBT rights and criticise countries that aren't, ""disgraceful"" treatment of LGBT refugees must end. Global LGBT rights debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Lloyd Russell-Moyle is the latest speaker in the debate to mention how many anti-gay laws still on the statute books in Commonwealth countries are a legacy of British imperialism. He says former British colonies are more likely to criminalise homosexual acts, saying that 57% of countries around the world that ban homosexuality are former British colonies. He says it is ""our duty, because we were the ones who imposed these laws, to speak up"". Pollution debate House of LordsParliament Lib Dem Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer is opening her debate on the impact of air and water pollution on the environment and public health. She says we already know these are ""killers"" but asks how far the government is going to go to tackle them. She welcomes the move to ban microplastics but points to the need for action on nanomaterials which gather in water and can damage aquatic life. Global LGBT rights debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Gerard Killen says it's ""not enough"" for countries to decriminalise homosexuality, there must also be laws to protect gay people. He also says that the UK must ensure its own house is in order, pointing out that if he takes a plane from Glasgow and lands in Belfast, his own marriage is no longer recognised. It's a ""short journey, but what a change in rights,"" he observes. Northern Ireland doesn't recognise gay marriages, only civil partnerships. He goes on to read out a series of comments from DUP politicians which he believes show ""shocking"" attitudes. He says the prime minister's words are not enough because ""this is the company she is keeping in government"". The DUP have signed a confidence-and-supply agreement to keep the Conservative Party in government. Rohingya refugees debate House of LordsParliament International Development Minister Lord Bates responds to the debate for the government, condemning violence against the Rohingya as ""appalling"". Access to the area remains ""constrained"", he says, noting that the UN has voted to extend its fact-finding mission. He tells peers the UK wants the international community to be aware of the need for humanitarian assistance. He says Aung San Suu Kyi ""has begun to show more leadership"" and ""we stand ready to support her"". Rohingya refugees debate House of LordsParliament Labour spokesman Lord Collins of Highbury calls for more access to Myanmar, particularly for the UN Human Rights Council fact-finding mission. He asks what the government will do next and specifically if it will support UN-mandated sanctions. ""We are witnessing ethnic cleansing and we need to say so loud and clear,"" he declares. Global LGBT rights debate House of CommonsParliament MPs are now debating LGBT rights around the world. Introducing the debate Conservative Nick Herbert talks about the strides made towards equality across the industrialised nations. He says that ""only Japan"" of the G7 industrialised nations does not now recognise gay marriage. He also raises some countries where LGBT people are threatened. He talks about massarrests of gay men and transgender women in Azerbaijan,externaland a crackdown in Egypt where34 people were arrested after a concert where a rainbow flag was flown,external. He says the UK must make it clear that actions like this are ""unacceptable in the eyes of the global community"". He says some have accused the UK of ""neocolonialism"" by forcing other countries to follow its cultural values. He says that Britain in fact has an obligation to ""atone"" for anti-gay laws which in many Commonwealth countries are a ""legacy of Britain's colonial past"". Rohingya refugees debate House of LordsParliament Conservative Baroness Helic, former adviser to William Hague as foreign secretary, is opening her debate on supporting the Rohingya refugees currently displaced in Bangladesh. She tells peers: ""I was born in a country where in the space of a weekend 8,500 men and boys were slaughtered in Srebenica in 1995. ""The term ethnic cleansing was born in Bosnia."" ""It is hard to argue that what is happening in Myanmar is anything but that,"" she adds, and it ""demands decisive action"". She calls for full humanitarian access to Rakhine and the right to return for refugees. Intergenerational fairness debate House of LordsParliament Government spokesman Lord Young of Cookham says he's glad that in today's debate the temptation to pit one generation against another ""has been resisted and this not a zero-sum game"". He says that in some ways the younger generations' future is ""brighter"" as they are ""healthier with far greater access to higher education"". But he acknowledges they do face difficulties, and highlights the government's efforts to improve the situation of renters and students. Modern slavery debate House of CommonsParliament Home Office minister Sarah Newton says the government is always looking at ways to improve the support given to victims of modern slavery. She says it is ""vital"" that victims get access to support ""immediately"". She says adult victims will be allowed a place of safety for at least three days after being rescued followed by, if they choose, at least 90 days of further support. There will also be weekly drop in centres for victims after their support period ends, she says. On child victims, she says they're testing ""new and innovative"" was of helping them, including specialist accommodation. She ends by emphasising that the government is ""totally dedicated to preventing this global trade in human misery"". Modern slavery debate House of CommonsParliament Labour shadow women and equalities minister Carolyn Harris says the Modern Slavery Act risks becoming less effective because of a lack of follow up legislation. She raises a recent report on the police response to trafficking,external, which found variable levels of commitment to tackling slavery in police forces, as well as a belief in many places that offences are rare and not an issue in their specific area. Carolyn Harris says there is a ""real need to improve training for police"". ""No-one is safe"" from exploitation she says, ""worst of all children"". She criticises the lack of specialist support or accommodation for children rescued from modern slavery. This is another example of the legislation going ""stale"", and where it might be updated ""as a matter of urgency"", she says. EU Withdrawal Bill Select CommitteeParliament We did hear evidence that suggested that it would be possible the agreement that was reached could be ""struck down"" by the European courts, says Hilary Benn, in his final question. ""Do you recognise that and are you prepared for that eventuality if it should transpire?"" he asks the minister. ""These are matters that of course we consider through the process,"" says Steve Baker. On that point, the committee's evidence session concludes. Intergenerational fairness debate House of LordsParliament Labour spokesman Lord Hunt of Kings Heath winds up on the debate for the opposition, observing that he thinks that a ""rebuke"" should be offered to Lord Willetts. Conservative ex-minister Lord Willetts earlier argued that student loans are not viewed by mortgage lenders in the same way as other types of debt. ""Debt is a psychological barrier,"" insists Lord Hunt, saying it does put young people off university or from financial commitments after graduating. Â© 2025 BBC.

The government, Mr Davis told MPs, was aiming to conclude all its negotiations - including a future trade deal - by the time of its withdrawal and while this was perfectly feasible, it could be a close-run thing. ""It is no secret that the way the union makes its decisions tends to be at the 11th minute... 59th minute of the 11th hour of the 11th day and so on and that's precisely what I expect to happen here."" ""It will be very high stress, very exciting for everyone watching, but that's what will happen. In technical terms, there is no reason why we can't do this in the time available... I am quite sure in my mind we can do this."" Mr Davis suggested the talks could go up to the wire Under the terms of existing EU treaties, the UK would not be able to sign a trade deal with the EU until it becomes a ""third party"" and has left the EU. Mr Davis said ""technically"" this was true, but that a deal could be signed almost immediately, or as he put it, ""a nano second"" afterwards. The Department for Exiting the European Union released a statement afterwards clarifying Mr Davis's position, saying he had been asked about hypothetical scenarios and both the UK and EU hoped to finalise a deal by October 2018, giving time for Parliament to vote on it before the UK leaves. On Monday, Mrs May suggested the two-year implementation period she was hoping for was dependent on details of the final ""partnership"" being clear at the time of exit. This alarmed business groups, which warned earlier this week that the UK risks losing jobs and investment without an interim deal agreed much sooner. Pressed on this during the hearing, Mr Davis said that by the first quarter of next year, it ""should be pretty plain what we are trying to deliver"" in terms of transition, which he said would look ""much like"" the status quo in terms of trade, migration and other arrangements. However, he noted the EU had not yet drawn up their final negotiating guidelines on any transition and both sides needed to know what the UK's final destination would be before this was settled. While the UK wanted a full trade deal, he said there was the possibility of what he described as a ""bare bones"" agreement where there were understandings in key areas but no over-arching agreement. An outcome where the two sides were unable to agree anything was ""off the probability scale"", he added.

Labour suspends MP over alleged comments,"MP Jared O'Mara has been suspended by Labour while it investigates misogynistic and homophobic comments he is alleged to have made. The Sheffield Hallam MP has apologised for online remarks from 2002 and 2004 but denies some more recent claims. Labour initially said it would not be suspending the MP while these allegations were investigated. But Jeremy Corbyn had decided to act when yet more comments emerged on Wednesday, a spokesman said. How to 'deep clean' your online activity Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC: ""There will be a full investigation by the Labour Party and then, as a result of that, a final decision will be made about his future."" Asked about Labour colleagues who had defended Mr O'Mara in recent days, Mr McDonnell said: ""They were basing that judgement on the information they had before them and the information that was provided to them by Jared himself and others. ""New information has come to light, so quite rightly the Labour Party has acted swiftly. He's been suspended, the whip has been withdrawn."" Asked about the case at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said: ""All of us in this House should have due care and attention to the way in which we refer to other people and should show women in public life the respect they deserve."" This video can not be played Theresa May says MPs should ""should show women in public life the respect they deserve"" On Monday, Mr O'Mara resigned from the women and equalities committee after political website Guido Fawkes unearthed offensive comments made by the 35-year-old MP online as a younger man. Then on Tuesday, Sophie Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics she had met Mr O'Mara on a dating app and there had been ""no hard feelings"" when things did not work out between them. But in an incident in March, Mr O'Mara, who was DJing in a nightclub, made comments to her that ""aren't broadcastable"" and called her an ""ugly bitch"", she said. A spokesman for Mr O'Mara said the MP ""categorically denies"" the allegation. The Guido Fawkes site has also found another post made by Mr O'Mara in his mid-20s, a review of an Arctic Monkeys gig, in which he calls women ""sexy little slags"". And it has published details of a post to a music forum, allegedly made by Mr O'Mara in 2009, which includes offensive remarks about women. Labour launched an investigation into Mr O'Mara's conduct on Tuesday, saying it was specifically looking at ""comments and behaviour which have been reported from earlier this year"". But it has now said it is also looking at his online remarks from 2002 to 2004 and the newer alleged comments. Labour's shadow education minister Tracy Brabin said Mr O'Mara's suspension was ""probably a wise move"". Before the news broke, she had described his actions as ""unpleasant and unacceptable"", adding that the episode ""doesn't look fantastic"". Conservative MP Mims Davies, chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary group for women in Parliament, said it was ""right"" that Mr O'Mara had been suspended over his ""vile"" comments. But she added: ""Why on earth has it taken so long?"" Pressed on why the party had waited until Wednesday to suspend Mr O'Mara, a Labour spokesman said the MP had gone to the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting on Monday night and made ""a very thorough-going apology and talked about the journey that he'd been on. That was welcomed."" But ""new information about things that he'd allegedly written more recently"" had emerged, prompting Mr Corbyn to take action. The Labour leader had made clear ""this kind of abusive, misogynistic, sexist language is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the Labour Party,"" he added.

The secrets behind Blue Planet II,"Earlier this week, it was reported that some of the close-up shots in Blue Planet II, which returns on Sunday, were filmed in a lab, rather than in the wild. The Guardian,externalsaid some crucial footage could only have been captured on film in ""controlled laboratory conditions"". Attenborough defended the use of these shots, saying they are ""not in anyway misleading"", and makers say the series was overwhelmingly shot on location. It's not the first time this issue has come up - back in 2011, a Frozen Planet programme, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, used somefilm footage of polar bear cubs in a Dutch animal park. Sir David Attenborough defends use of clips shot in labs One segment of Blue Planet II includes close-up lab footage of coral bleaching, which producers said could only be filmed with lights and specialised cameras. We spoke to executive producer James Honeyborne about how much is filmed in the wild and the techniques involved in capturing those critical moments. The overwhelming majority of Blue Planet II has been filmed in the wild. Blue Planet II is a natural history series, led by the latest scientific discoveries and we've collaborated with hundreds of scientists around the world's oceans. When working in the field, studying the smaller marine creatures, scientists sometimes set-up marine labs. We've been lucky enough to access these for our 'macro' filming, to bring the full wonder and detail of marine life to our audience. In the episode Coasts, we filmed rock pools with a marine lab in Vancouver. To film in the wild would have been too disruptive for the wildlife, and it would have been impossible to film close-ups of this magical world, so we worked with scientists to accurately recreate a rock pool in the controlled conditions of the lab. In the episode Deep, by collaborating with scientists based on a number of research vessels who were sampling the deep sea, we were able to film portraits of creatures such as fangtooth, that would otherwise be impossible to see. Filming took place at sea in pitch-black, refrigerated filming chambers on board the ships. The fangtooth has the largest teeth relative to body size for any fish in the entire ocean. And in the episode Green Seas, the underground burrow of a zebra mantis was recreated by scientists and film makers, to reveal the full story of the mantis shrimp's behaviour. Macro-filming is done on location - on board boats, or by the coast. We have made short films for those who are interested, and because as you'll see, it's still a real challenge for the filmmakers! You can check out the Making Of... films on theprogramme pagefor those who wish to delve deeper into the filming techniques. To compile a full portrait of the oceans, we need to tell the amazing story of tiny creatures, as well as the big ones.  Sometimes we have to film in controlled conditions to protect the welfare of the animals.  In others instances, it's to protect the safety of the scientists and crew. A Blue Planet producer uses a multi-directional hydrophone to record the sounds of the reef The vast majority of our audience prefer for us not to 'break the spell' in the commentary, so we don't explain how we achieved shots during the film itself. And we only have time for one making-of sequence at the end of each episode. We try to choose the one which was the most challenging to achieve, or the one in which the story of the crew's endeavours is most likely to engage the audience. But online, we share in-depth insight into all of our filming techniques, through 'making of' films, blogs, interviews and Q&As. That way we can maintain the trusting relationship with our audience that we enjoy. Absolutely not. On every episode we have a minimum of half a dozen scientific advisors who help us ensure that what we show is true to nature. That's the point of it all. To represent nature the best we can.

Russell Brand on addiction and activism,"Brand's latest book deals with his own addictions to drugs, alcohol, sex and fame Addiction and mental health may not be the kinds of issues you'd normally expect to be addressed at a stand-up comedy gig. But Russell Brand has never been your conventional comedian - and it's precisely these subjects that he's tackling in his new book and at one of his upcoming London shows. ""Society is collapsing,"" the comedian tells the BBC, ""and people are starting to recognise that the reason they feel like they're mentally ill is that they're living in a system that's not designed to suit the human spirit. ""People are realising 'Hold on a minute, is it natural to work 12 hours a day? Is it natural that I live in an environment that is designed for human beings from one perspective but not from a holistic perspective?' Breathing dirty air, eating dirty food, thinking dirty thoughts. So really what this is, is a time of transition. ""Yes, the conversation is changing because the communication is becoming so much more expedient, but what's really changing is people are starting to notice that the system is not working for them."" The comedian says he prefers theatres to large arenas when it comes to performing comedy The 42-year-old's latest book - Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions - is released this month, and sees him discussing his own addictions, namely drugs, alcohol, sex and fame. But, he says, the book isn't just for people who have had chemical addictions, and argues that pretty much all of us have some kind of vice. ""Everyone's living their lives on addictions really,"" he says. ""Everyone is living their life thinking they've got the answer to their own little problem. If there's something they get, something they do, they're going to feel a little bit better. Brand in trouble over Elvis interview 'Domestic' Russell Brand gets married Russell Brand donates cafe to charity ""Addicts are just a more pronounced version, and end up usually with a drug issue, but look at what people can do to themselves with food. ""People can destroy their lives with food, and so addiction really, we're all on the spectrum, we're all on the scale, it just depends how severe we are, and I think that unless you're happy in your life, there's room for a program. He continues: ""Unless you're like 'I'm really happy with my job, my diet, my relationship, my body', if that's how you feel, that's fine. You deserve to feel like that, people should feel like that. Brand has turned to activism more recently and attended an austerity march in London in 2015 ""I'm not talking about stupid simple pleasures like eating an ice lolly, that's only very temporary, we're looking at peak and contentedness which we can find our way to, if we're willing to change the way we think."" Brand clearly isn't going to be short of material when he discusses the topic at a special gig at the Hammersmith Apollo on 1 November. In addition to his usual stand-up show, he's going to turn up early to do some readings from Recovery. ""It's the only time I'm ever going to do it,"" he explains. ""So if people want to come at 6.30, I'll read from the book, and then do the show, Rebirth."" It's interesting that Brand is playing somewhat smaller venues than the arenas we've seen other A-list comics perform at in recent years. Michael McIntyre and Chris Rock have both toured arenas in recent years The recent generation of ""rock star comedians"" like Michael McIntyre,Chris Rockand Peter Kay are more likely to sell out the O2 than play an impromptu gig at the Comedy Store, but Brand says he prefers the intimacy of slightly smaller venues. ""People that have played both arenas and theatres, most people prefer theatres, and I'd say the same,"" he says. ""It's a great privilege to perform in front of 20,000 people at once like at the O2, it's lovely, but there's all sorts of reasons for not doing it... but I love doing stand-up comedy, so I'm happy to do two nights in Brixton and two nights in Hammersmith rather than one night at the O2, and it is a better experience for the audience and for the performer."" Speaking about his own live dates, Russell adds: ""The stand-up is full of audience interaction. The thing that excites me most is what people create when they come together in groups."" Brand has become increasingly vocal as an activist and campaigner in recent years Despite his recent activism, which has includedcharity work,austerity protestsandendorsing Jeremy Corbyn,external, it's unlikely that Russell will be entering the world of politics anytime soon. ""If you think the political process doesn't work, why would you think, I'm going to get involved with it?"" he asks. ""If you swap the word 'political process' for 'car', you wouldn't think 'I'm going to get in that car and try and drive it in a different direction. If you think people should be riding horses, start riding a horse. ""So just do what you think is the correct thing to do. If you think your school should be run differently, start running your school differently, and then when you find obstacles to that, confront the obstacles, but never alone, always in groups. ""The thing I've learned from recent conversations from people who are experts, like Prof David Harvey, is to start establishing systems you believe in, and operate within them. So the work I'm doing already is the work that I think should be done. ""So I think if people start communicating honestly and openly, they'll realise, 'Everyone is more similar to me than I imagined.'""

MP's Brexit letter 'was research for book',"This video can not be played Jo Johnson is quizzed on Radio 4's Today whether Chris Heaton-Harris should have sent Brexit letter Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris ""should probably not have sent"" a letter to universities asking for details of Brexit courses, a minister has said. Universities minister Jo Johnson said his colleague, a government whip, was ""regretting very much"" his decision, He said the MP was ""pursuing inquiries of his own"" which may lead to a book on ""the evolution of attitudes"" to Europe rather than acting for the government. Universities enjoyed ""24 carat academic freedom"" in the UK, he insisted. Lecturers reacted with anger to the letter, calling it a ""sinister"" attempt to censor them and accusing Mr Heaton-Harris of conducting a ""McCarthyite"" witch hunt. Downing Street distanced itself from the letter by Mr Heaton-Harris, a member of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MP, after he wrote to universities asking for the names of professors teaching Brexit-related courses and details of their syllabuses. Mr Heaton-Harris has not said himself what his intentions were, but said he believed in ""open"" debate about the UK's departure from the EU. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today Mr Johnson, who said he had spoken to Mr Heaton-Harris, said: ""Chris was acting in an individual capacity as an MP rather than as a government ministerâ¦ Chris has a very longstanding interest in European affairs and the history of European thought. ""He was pursuing inquiries of his own which may, in time, lead to a book on these questions. It was more of an academic inquiry rather than an attempt to constrain the freedom that academics rightly have."" Asked if the letter should have been sent, he said Mr Heaton-Harris ""probably didn't appreciate the degree to which this would be misinterpreted"". He said: ""I am sure Chris is regretting this very much. The critical thing is that the government is absolutely committed to academic freedom and to freedom of speech in our universities. ""A letter which could have been misinterpreted should probably not have been sent."" The letter was sent to universities across the UK Opposition parties have suggested that Mr Heaton-Harris was seeking to compile a list of ""Brexit heretics"" and called for him to be stripped of his role as a whip. Former Conservative chairman Lord Patten, Chancellor of Oxford University, said the letter should be chucked in the bin, describing it as an act of ""offensive and idiotic Leninism"". Mr Johnson suggested this was something of an ""over-exaggeration"" given the independence of universities was protected under the law and the government had extended the statutory duty to secure free speech earlier this year so that it will apply to all providers of higher education. Chris Heaton-Harris is facing calls to explain why he wanted the information ""There is 24 carat academic freedom in this country. We have entrenched it in statute, only as recently as April. ""Academic staff are free to test and challenge received wisdom and free to put forward new ideas and controversial or unpopular opinions. That is the law and we support it."" A number of Tory MPs have backed Mr Heaton-Harris, Philip Davies condemning what he said was the ""false outrage"" from academics and suggesting universities had been ""rumbled"". He told the Daily Telegraph that universities were full of ""left wing lecturers forcing their opinions on their students"" and they should be ""more balanced in their teaching"" And tweeting a picture of a flyer for a stop-Brexit rally, Paul Scully said: ""This is what a lecturer was handing out to my daughter who spends Â£9k per annum for him to be teaching engineering, not politics.""

No heir apparent as Xi cements his power,"This video can not be played China congress: The precision of the party China has revealed its new senior leadership committee, breaking with tradition by not including a clear successor to President Xi Jinping. The omission cements Mr Xi's grip on leadership for the next five years, a day after his name and his teachings were written into the constitution. But it raises questions over whether Mr Xi, 64, intends to rule beyond 2022. Five new appointments were made to the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, China's most powerful body. Mixed feelings about 'awesome China' How the line-up was revealed The committee is the top body of China's all-powerful Communist Party. Its role is to discuss and decide on major policy issues. The party's constitution says China's top leader must also be a member of the standing committee. So appointments are keenly watched. In the new line-up, Premier Li Keqiang, 62, is the only member to retain his position, apart from  Mr Xi. Chinese leaders have traditionally hinted at possible heirs through committee reshuffles at the beginning of their final term. There had been speculation that Mr Xi would elevate his protÃ©gÃ© Chen Miner and Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua, both of whom are in their 50s - young enough to be credible successors. But the fact that the new appointees were all in their 60s, and likely to retire at the end of this five-year term, sends a different signal. The absence of any younger members will fuel speculation about Mr Xi's long-term intentions. Meet China's new leaders Where are the women? Politburo boy band? Could Xi break the 10-year rule? The tradition emerged in the 1990s, when veteran leader Deng Xiaoping sought to avoid a repeat of the chaos that had marked the Mao era and its immediate aftermath. Mr Xi's two predecessors have followed the orderly pattern of succession. But since he came to power in 2012, he has shown his readiness to write his own rules. The change to the constitution puts Xi Jinping (left) on a par with party founder Mao Zedong (right) The party voted on Tuesday to entrench Mr Xi's name and ideology. The unanimous vote to incorporate ""Xi Jinping Thought"" into the constitution significantly strengthens Mr Xi's political control. Even if he decided to stand down in 2022, his influence is now so great that he could continue to effectively rule the country. Economic record: Xi vs Deng How China's Communist Party picks leaders Carrie Gracie, BBC News, Beijing Breaking the mould on the succession, as with so much else, is part of the Chinese president's New Era, as he has termed it. But don't imagine that now the Congress is over, you can forget about Mr Xi's New Era. In the clash of political civilisations, he has put China on the offensive. In his speech to Congress, he set out a vision not just for the five years ahead but for 30, and talked of a socialist model which provides, ""a new option for other countries and nations"". At home China is accelerating its ability to listen to every call and track every face, online posting, movement and purchase. Expect it now to export not just the governance model but the cyber weapons to make that work. Even as the party unveiled its new leadership, it excluded major Western news organisations from the ceremony. Officially no reason was given for barring the BBC, Financial Times, Economist, New York Times and Guardian, but unofficially journalists were told that their reporting was to blame - another sign of Xi's determination to control the message at home and abroad. Mr Xi has assumed an unprecedented number of positions since coming to power in 2012, including the title of a ""core"" leader of China. His first term has been marked by significant development, a push for modernisation and increasing assertiveness on the world stage. It has also seen growing authoritarianism, censorship and a crackdown on human rights. He has spearheaded a sweeping anti-corruption campaign which has seen more than a million officials disciplined. It has been seen by some as a massive internal purge of opponents. At first glance, ""Xi Jinping Thought"" may seem like vague rhetoric, but it describes the communist ideals Mr Xi has continuously espoused throughout his rule. Its 14 main principles emphasise the Communist Party's role in governing every aspect of the country, and also include: A call for ""complete and deep reform"" and ""new developing ideas"" A promise of ""harmonious living between man and nature"" - this is a call for improved environmental conservation, and could refer to the stated aim to have the bulk of China's energy needs supplied by renewables An emphasis on ""absolute authority of the party over the people's army"" - which comes amidwhat analysts callthe largest turnover of senior military officials in modern Chinese history An emphasis on the importance of ""'one country two systems"" and reunification with the motherland - a clear reference to Hong Kong and Taiwan The Thoughts of Chairman Xi Players âclapâ Chinese president in game China's all-powerful leader Xi Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Russell Brand: We're all on the spectrum,"Brand's latest book deals with his own addictions to drugs, alcohol, sex and fame Addiction and mental health may not be the kinds of issues you'd normally expect to be addressed at a stand-up comedy gig. But Russell Brand has never been your conventional comedian - and it's precisely these subjects that he's tackling in his new book and at one of his upcoming London shows. ""Society is collapsing,"" the comedian tells the BBC, ""and people are starting to recognise that the reason they feel like they're mentally ill is that they're living in a system that's not designed to suit the human spirit. ""People are realising 'Hold on a minute, is it natural to work 12 hours a day? Is it natural that I live in an environment that is designed for human beings from one perspective but not from a holistic perspective?' Breathing dirty air, eating dirty food, thinking dirty thoughts. So really what this is, is a time of transition. ""Yes, the conversation is changing because the communication is becoming so much more expedient, but what's really changing is people are starting to notice that the system is not working for them."" The comedian says he prefers theatres to large arenas when it comes to performing comedy The 42-year-old's latest book - Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions - is released this month, and sees him discussing his own addictions, namely drugs, alcohol, sex and fame. But, he says, the book isn't just for people who have had chemical addictions, and argues that pretty much all of us have some kind of vice. ""Everyone's living their lives on addictions really,"" he says. ""Everyone is living their life thinking they've got the answer to their own little problem. If there's something they get, something they do, they're going to feel a little bit better. Brand in trouble over Elvis interview 'Domestic' Russell Brand gets married Russell Brand donates cafe to charity ""Addicts are just a more pronounced version, and end up usually with a drug issue, but look at what people can do to themselves with food. ""People can destroy their lives with food, and so addiction really, we're all on the spectrum, we're all on the scale, it just depends how severe we are, and I think that unless you're happy in your life, there's room for a program. He continues: ""Unless you're like 'I'm really happy with my job, my diet, my relationship, my body', if that's how you feel, that's fine. You deserve to feel like that, people should feel like that. Brand has turned to activism more recently and attended an austerity march in London in 2015 ""I'm not talking about stupid simple pleasures like eating an ice lolly, that's only very temporary, we're looking at peak and contentedness which we can find our way to, if we're willing to change the way we think."" Brand clearly isn't going to be short of material when he discusses the topic at a special gig at the Hammersmith Apollo on 1 November. In addition to his usual stand-up show, he's going to turn up early to do some readings from Recovery. ""It's the only time I'm ever going to do it,"" he explains. ""So if people want to come at 6.30, I'll read from the book, and then do the show, Rebirth."" It's interesting that Brand is playing somewhat smaller venues than the arenas we've seen other A-list comics perform at in recent years. Michael McIntyre and Chris Rock have both toured arenas in recent years The recent generation of ""rock star comedians"" like Michael McIntyre,Chris Rockand Peter Kay are more likely to sell out the O2 than play an impromptu gig at the Comedy Store, but Brand says he prefers the intimacy of slightly smaller venues. ""People that have played both arenas and theatres, most people prefer theatres, and I'd say the same,"" he says. ""It's a great privilege to perform in front of 20,000 people at once like at the O2, it's lovely, but there's all sorts of reasons for not doing it... but I love doing stand-up comedy, so I'm happy to do two nights in Brixton and two nights in Hammersmith rather than one night at the O2, and it is a better experience for the audience and for the performer."" Speaking about his own live dates, Russell adds: ""The stand-up is full of audience interaction. The thing that excites me most is what people create when they come together in groups."" Brand has become increasingly vocal as an activist and campaigner in recent years Despite his recent activism, which has includedcharity work,austerity protestsandendorsing Jeremy Corbyn,external, it's unlikely that Russell will be entering the world of politics anytime soon. ""If you think the political process doesn't work, why would you think, I'm going to get involved with it?"" he asks. ""If you swap the word 'political process' for 'car', you wouldn't think 'I'm going to get in that car and try and drive it in a different direction. If you think people should be riding horses, start riding a horse. ""So just do what you think is the correct thing to do. If you think your school should be run differently, start running your school differently, and then when you find obstacles to that, confront the obstacles, but never alone, always in groups. ""The thing I've learned from recent conversations from people who are experts, like Prof David Harvey, is to start establishing systems you believe in, and operate within them. So the work I'm doing already is the work that I think should be done. ""So I think if people start communicating honestly and openly, they'll realise, 'Everyone is more similar to me than I imagined.'""

BBC wrong to not challenge climate sceptic,"Former Chancellor Lord Lawson's claims on climate change were made on BBC Radio 4's Today programme The BBC should have challenged the views of climate sceptic Lord Lawson in an interview in August, the complaints unit for the corporation has ruled. The ex-chancellor claimed in an interview with the Today programme that ""official figures"" showed average world temperatures had ""slightly declined"". This view, shown to be false by the Met Office, was not challenged on air. The BBC admitted it had breached its ""guidelines on accuracy and impartiality"". Conservative peer Lord Lawson's appearance on Radio 4's flagship Today programme sparked a number of complaints from listeners. He had been invited on to discuss the latest film on climate change byformer US Vice President Al Gore. During the interview, Lord Lawson said ""official figures"" showed that ""during this past 10 years, if anything... average world temperature has slightly declined"". He also claimed the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had confirmed there had not been an increase in extreme weather events for the last 10 years. Dr Peter Stott, of the Met Office, came on the programme the following day to confirm that Lord Lawson's statistics, which he did not cite at the time, were incorrect. Dr Stott also said the IPCC has clearly indicated an increase in extreme weather events across the globe were linked to human use of fossil fuels. The Global Warming Policy Foundation, a campaign group chaired by Lord Lawson, later confirmed his statistics were ""erroneous"". Anger over 'untrue' climate claims What is climate change? The BBC's media editor Amol Rajan said the Today programme had a remit to offer dissenting opinions, aimed at challenging lazy thinking and consensus views. But he said the BBC's complaints department ruled that a lack of scrutiny of Lord Lawson's claims meant the interview fell short of editorial standards. It ruled that the peer's statements ""were, at the least, contestable and should have been challenged"". This video can not be played Lord Lawson's claims about climate change are ""simply not true"", says the Met Office's Peter Stott A paper by Skeptical Science,externalclaims that 97% of scientists across the globe believe climate change is caused by humans.

Your experiences of going through IVF treatment,"""When I had my third child I knew my family was complete and I wanted to help another couple,"" said Rena Miras When Sophie Sulehria and husband Jonny Bakershared their struggle with IVFmany readers got in touch with their own experiences. Here are some of their stories. Rena Miras getting ready to have her eggs harvested ""I had struggled to conceive our first child and my first pregnancy was an ectopic,"" said Rena Miras. ""So I feel so lucky that eight years later, I have three wonderful children. I wanted to give something back and help a couple have a baby."" The teacher, from Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham, said she contacted an organisation that matches families with egg donors and underwent numerous tests and counselling to prepare her. ""In January, I started injecting [IVF drugs] and 10 days later I had egg retrieval,"" the mum-of-three said. ""They managed to get 19 eggs, all of which are for my couple if they want siblings in the future. ""Egg donation is anonymous until the child turns 16 and they can then find out information about me. ""I cried so much when I found out my couple were pregnant with a girl and they are due near Christmas. ""This was not and never will be my baby. I helped a couple have their baby and the happiness I got, and am still getting from this, I can't even describe."" Maggie Joslin and daughter Georgia who was conceived using IVF Hairdresser Maggie Joslin suffered with severe endometriosis after the birth of her first daughter. She turned to IVF to help conceive another child. ""I was quite driven to have [another] baby but my ex-husband felt we already had one daughter,"" says Ms Joslin, 56, from North Bradley in Wiltshire. ""I was quite ill afterwards and also suffered from depression and he couldn't cope. ""It was gruelling emotionally and physically and it led to the end of my marriage. ""I was in hospital for nine weeks after giving birth and have been left with all sorts of health problems. ""I was very lucky to have a beautiful baby girl called Georgia. I say she cost me as much as small car but she's worth every penny."" An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born On average, IVF fails 70% of the time The highest success rates are for women under 35, one-third of treatment cycles are successful On average, it takes almost four and a half years to conceive with IVF Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK Chris and Stacy Hayter say they look forward to telling daughter Athena her Grecian name was inspired by the country where they had IVF ""My partner Stacy and I had to have IVF after discovering she had polycystic ovary syndrome,"" said Chris Hayter, from Yeovil in Somerset. ""After two rounds of IVF and four frozen cycles we were left heartbroken that we still did not have the baby we so badly wanted. ""We had one last roll of the dice. We could either have one cycle at a top clinic in Harley Street or look elsewhere."" After researching clinics in London and Greece the couple decided to travel abroad. ""Their success rate was so much higher and not only that but the money would provide us with two full cycles and cover us living in Greece for a month,"" the 34-year-old said. ""We went through the first cycle and finally got the positive we were looking for. We now have a beautiful 18-month-old daughter who we have called Athena.

""We agreed we would not do more than two rounds as we had heard horror stories of people continuously trying and spending fortunes on it. ""Our first round was a positive experience and we were extremely hopeful. When it didn't work it felt horrendous, like we had lost something. ""However, the second time we had zero expectations and it was an awful experience. When it didn't work we didn't even shed a tear and we were glad it was over. ""We tried adoption and now have two wonderful boys who we are so lucky to have. ""We have a number of friends for whom IVF has worked and others who, like us, it hasn't and the emotional rollercoaster is so painful and traumatic. ""The mental support needed is completely underplayed and often people are woefully under-prepared for what they are about to undertake."" About 5,500 children are adopted every year in the UK ""After four devastating failed attempts at IVF over about six years my husband and I decided to go down the adoption route,"" said Katie, whose name has been changed. ""It was the best decision ever. We adopted a little girl at the age of 15 months, she is now eight years old and is a dream come true. ""I honestly feel like I gave birth to her but just can't remember that part. I couldn't love her any more if I tried. IVF is so painful and expensive.

NZ party ordered to pay Eminem damages,"The track Lose Yourself is one of Eminem's biggest hits A New Zealand political party has been ordered to pay NZ$600,000 ($412,000) in compensation in a breach of copyright suit filed by US rapper Eminem. The National Party used a track with a similar melody and rhythm to Eminem's Lose Yourself in an election advert. The song, entitled Eminem-esque, bore only minimal differences to the original, according to a court ruling. The case, which began in May, is the latest to test the legality of so-called sound-alike music. Eminem's music publisher, Eight Mile Style, filed proceedings after the National Party used an unlicensed version of the Oscar-winning song in a 2014 campaign advert. The party's lawyers had argued that the track used was not actually Lose Yourself, but a song called Eminem-esque, which they bought from a stock music library. However the court ruled on Wednesday that the track was ""sufficiently similar"" to Eminem's ""highly original work"", adding that it did indeed infringe copyright laws. Watch: Eminem's takedown of Trump Eminem cover inspires millions online Thejudgment,externalconsidered the drum patterns, background chords and violin tones of each version, all of which it said bore ""close similarities"". ""The nature of the use is not what Eminem or Eight Mile Style would endorse,"" the judgment added. Eminem's Lose Yourself, which appeared in the rapper's 2002 film 8 Mile, is one of his biggest hits. The backing track used in the National Party's advert, which appeared more than 100 times on TV during the 2014 campaign, had been taken from a library made by production music company Beatbox. Songs which sound similar to famous tracks - but different enough to avoid breaching copyright - routinely feature in free-to-use commercial music libraries.

Economy grows by 0.4% in third quarter,"This video can not be played UK economy 'solid' in third quarter, says Hammond The UK's economy had higher than expected growth in the three months to September - increasing the chances of a rise in interest rates in November. Gross domestic product (GDP) for the quarter rose by 0.4%, compared with 0.3% in each of 2017's first two quarters,according to latest Office for National Statistics figures.,external Economists said the figures were a green light for a rate rise next week. If it happens, it will be the first rise since 5 July 2007. The financial markets are now indicating an 84% probability that rates will rise from their current record low of 0.25% when the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets on 2 November. Mark Carney and his team meet next week to decide on interest rates Governor Mark Carney indicated to the BBC last month thatrates could rise in the ""relatively near term"". UK economist Ruth Gregory, of research company Capital Economics, said the figures ""have probably sealed the deal on an interest rate hike next week"". While many economists echo that view, some think the Bank of England will keep rates where they are. ""If all we can muster... is an acceleration in economic growth that's so small you could blink and miss it, the Bank of England could still think better of a rate rise next week,"" said Ross Andrews from Minerva Lending. Economic growth: Five charts that matter Is now the time to raise interest rates? The slightly better growth figures will strengthen the arguments of the interest rate hawks on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Next Thursday, the Bank's rate setting committee meets to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. With inflation at 3%, Mark Carney, the governor, has signalled that an increase is on the cards. And with economic growth more robust than many economists expected, those who support that direction of travel on the MPC will be emboldened. To be clear, any rate rise will be small. And future rate rises will be gradual. But the Bank is sending a clear message - slowly, eventually, the period of historically low interest rates is coming to an end. The pound rose more than a cent against the dollar and nearly a cent against the euro in the first couple of hours of trading after the announcement. Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We have a successful and resilient economy which is supporting a record number of people in employment. ""My focus now, and going into the Budget, is on boosting productivity so that we can deliver higher-wage jobs and a better standard of living."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The UK is not growing as fast as many of our trading partners in the EU or the USA. ""The Chancellor cannot keep hiding from the facts, as his approach of carrying on as usual is seriously putting working people's living standards at risk."" The biggest contributor to growth in the third quarter was the service sector, which expanded by 0.4%.

MPs launch inquiry into e-cigarettes,"MPs are to carry out an inquiry into e-cigarettes amid concerns there are ""significant gaps"" in what is known about them and how they are regulated. The science and technology committee will look at their effectiveness as a stop-smoking tool and the impact of their growing use on health. Nearly three million people in the UK now ""vape"" regularly - four times more than in 2012. But committee chair Norman Lamb said there was mixed messaging on vaping. The Liberal Democrat MP said: ""They are seen by some as valuable tools that will reduce the number of people smoking 'conventional' cigarettes, and seen by others as 're-normalising' smoking for the younger generation. ""We want to understand where the gaps are in the evidence base, the impact of the regulations, and the implications of this growing industry on NHS costs and the UK's public finances."" The announcement comes after e-cigarettes were included in this year's Stoptober campaign - aimed at helping people stop smoking -  for the first time. The government-backed campaign, which has been running during October, now features vaping in its TV adverts. It came after the smoking devices proved to be the most popular tool for quitting during the 2016 campaign. But despite this, e-cigarettes are not yet officially prescribed on the NHS. 10 charts on how smoking ban changed UK E-cigs 'definitely' safer than smoking Quit smoking campaign backs e-cigs New draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not list e-cigarettes as a recommendation to help people quit either. But it does say patients should be told some smokers have found them helpful when they want to give up. NICE advises that patients should be told that there ""is currently little evidence on the long-term benefits or harms of these products"". The cross-party group of MPs has asked for written evidence to be submitted by 8 December.

The blogger who 'disappeared' in Pakistan,"This video can not be played Aasim Saeed says he was taken to a secret detention facility and beaten A Pakistani blogger who went missing earlier this year has applied for asylum in Britain after alleging he was tortured by a ""state intelligence agency"" during his disappearance. Aasim Saeed was one of a group of five liberal social media activists who were abducted in Pakistan in January 2017 before beingreleased after several weeks. The Pakistani military has repeatedly denied any involvement in the case. Mr Saeed told the BBC that prior to his abduction he had been involved in running a Facebook page critical of Pakistan's military establishment, called Mochi, ""because since the inception of Pakistan they've always been ruling us directly or indirectly"". Pakistan has been ruled by the military for nearly half of its 70 years. Mr Saeed was working in Singapore but visiting Pakistan for his brother's wedding in January 2017 when he says a number of men in plain clothes arrived at his house and ordered him into a car. ""'Do you know why you've been picked up?' they asked. I said, 'I have no idea'. Then he started to slap me. They said, 'Let's talk about Mochi'."" Mr Saeed told the BBC he had been ordered to hand over the passwords to his email accounts and mobile phone before being taken to a secret detention facility where he was held alongside men he believed to be ""religious terrorists."" Activist says Pakistan tortured him Hardliners 'torture Pakistan student' Pakistan tackles Facebook on blasphemy The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that 728 people were forcibly ""disappeared"" in 2016. Pakistan's intelligence services have been accused of ""disappearing"" social and ethnic nationalist activists, as well as those accused of links to militant groups, instead of producing them in court. Authorities in Pakistan have often said the security services are unfairly blamed for disappearances and that the number of missing people is inflated. Few first-hand accounts have ever emerged of what happens to those in detention. Mr Saeed alleges he was beaten with a leather strap. ""I don't remember what happened, I fell down and someone was holding my neck in his feet, and the other guy kept beating and beating and beating."" He describes his arms and back being left ""shades of purple, blue and back"". Pakistani rights activists wave pictures of missing bloggers during a January 2017 protest in Lahore At another detention facility which he believes to be near the capital Islamabad, Mr Saeed says he was made to undergo polygraph tests whilst being repeatedly questioned about links to the Indian intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). ""Have you ever been associated with RAW? Who is your handler? Have you ever received money from RAW?"" He denies any links to any foreign intelligence services and says interrogators also analysed his Facebook posts and questioned him about why he was ""critical of the army"". In May 2017 Human Rights Watch raised concerns that the Pakistani government was ""clamping down on internet dissent at the expense of fundamental rights"". Protests were held across cities in Pakistan by other liberal activists calling for the release of Mr Saeed and the other ""missing bloggers"", as they came to be known. Mr Saeed, though, says he believed while in detention that he would be killed, because normally ""missing persons don't go home"". Whilstpressure was building on the Pakistani authoritiesto provide information about the whereabouts of the bloggers, a counter-campaign was begun by right-wing religious clerics and TV anchors accusing them of having committed blasphemy. Religious students and activists have previously demanded the removal of all ""blasphemous"" content from social media Blasphemy is legally punishable by death in Pakistan and a number of those accused of it have been murdered by lynch mobs. Mr Saeed returned home after several weeks in detention. He told the BBC it was only then that he realised he had been accused of blasphemy. He denies any involvement in writing blasphemous material. One of the other missing bloggers has alleged the blasphemy allegations were an attempt ""to shut us down - to threaten our families - to build pressure on us"". Mr Saeed returned to Singapore shortly after being released and arrived in the UK in September to visit friends. He told the BBC he had then decided to apply for asylum as the terms of his employment visa in Singapore meant he had no guarantee he would be allowed to keep living there if he ever lost his job, and his life would be in danger if he returned to Pakistan. Nonetheless, Mr Saeed told the BBC he did not regret his activism, as ""people have to stand up"".

No heir as Xi cements grip on China,"This video can not be played China congress: The precision of the party China has revealed its new senior leadership committee, breaking with tradition by not including a clear successor to President Xi Jinping. The omission cements Mr Xi's grip on leadership for the next five years, a day after his name and his teachings were written into the constitution. But it raises questions over whether Mr Xi, 64, intends to rule beyond 2022. Five new appointments were made to the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, China's most powerful body. Mixed feelings about 'awesome China' How the line-up was revealed The committee is the top body of China's all-powerful Communist Party. Its role is to discuss and decide on major policy issues. The party's constitution says China's top leader must also be a member of the standing committee. So appointments are keenly watched. In the new line-up, Premier Li Keqiang, 62, is the only member to retain his position, apart from  Mr Xi. Chinese leaders have traditionally hinted at possible heirs through committee reshuffles at the beginning of their final term. There had been speculation that Mr Xi would elevate his protÃ©gÃ© Chen Miner and Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua, both of whom are in their 50s - young enough to be credible successors. But the fact that the new appointees were all in their 60s, and likely to retire at the end of this five-year term, sends a different signal. The absence of any younger members will fuel speculation about Mr Xi's long-term intentions. Meet China's new leaders Where are the women? Politburo boy band? Could Xi break the 10-year rule? The tradition emerged in the 1990s, when veteran leader Deng Xiaoping sought to avoid a repeat of the chaos that had marked the Mao era and its immediate aftermath. Mr Xi's two predecessors have followed the orderly pattern of succession. But since he came to power in 2012, he has shown his readiness to write his own rules. The change to the constitution puts Xi Jinping (left) on a par with party founder Mao Zedong (right) The party voted on Tuesday to entrench Mr Xi's name and ideology. The unanimous vote to incorporate ""Xi Jinping Thought"" into the constitution significantly strengthens Mr Xi's political control. Even if he decided to stand down in 2022, his influence is now so great that he could continue to effectively rule the country. Economic record: Xi vs Deng How China's Communist Party picks leaders Carrie Gracie, BBC News, Beijing Breaking the mould on the succession, as with so much else, is part of the Chinese president's New Era, as he has termed it. But don't imagine that now the Congress is over, you can forget about Mr Xi's New Era. In the clash of political civilisations, he has put China on the offensive. In his speech to Congress, he set out a vision not just for the five years ahead but for 30, and talked of a socialist model which provides, ""a new option for other countries and nations"". At home China is accelerating its ability to listen to every call and track every face, online posting, movement and purchase. Expect it now to export not just the governance model but the cyber weapons to make that work. Even as the party unveiled its new leadership, it excluded major Western news organisations from the ceremony. Officially no reason was given for barring the BBC, Financial Times, Economist, New York Times and Guardian, but unofficially journalists were told that their reporting was to blame - another sign of Xi's determination to control the message at home and abroad. Mr Xi has assumed an unprecedented number of positions since coming to power in 2012, including the title of a ""core"" leader of China. His first term has been marked by significant development, a push for modernisation and increasing assertiveness on the world stage. It has also seen growing authoritarianism, censorship and a crackdown on human rights. He has spearheaded a sweeping anti-corruption campaign which has seen more than a million officials disciplined. It has been seen by some as a massive internal purge of opponents. At first glance, ""Xi Jinping Thought"" may seem like vague rhetoric, but it describes the communist ideals Mr Xi has continuously espoused throughout his rule. Its 14 main principles emphasise the Communist Party's role in governing every aspect of the country, and also include: A call for ""complete and deep reform"" and ""new developing ideas"" A promise of ""harmonious living between man and nature"" - this is a call for improved environmental conservation, and could refer to the stated aim to have the bulk of China's energy needs supplied by renewables An emphasis on ""absolute authority of the party over the people's army"" - which comes amidwhat analysts callthe largest turnover of senior military officials in modern Chinese history An emphasis on the importance of ""'one country two systems"" and reunification with the motherland - a clear reference to Hong Kong and Taiwan The Thoughts of Chairman Xi Players âclapâ Chinese president in game China's all-powerful leader Xi Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

All UK schools 'should have sprinklers',"This video can not be played Should all schools be fitted with sprinklers? All new and refurbished schools in the UK should be fitted with sprinklers, fire chiefs say. Currently, sprinklers are mandatory in new school buildings in Scotland and Wales, but not in England and Northern Ireland - and the National Fire Chiefs Council says that must change. London Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton accused the government of ""playing with children's lives"". The Department for Education said the safety of children was their priority. Fire safety in public buildings like schools has come under close scrutiny since theGrenfell Tower firein west London in June. There are about 700 school fires a year in England. Rift House in Hartlepool had no sprinkler system Last year, the DfE in England began a consultation on new draft guidance which said building regulations no longer required ""the installation of fire sprinkler suppression systems in school buildings for life safety"". ""Therefore,"" it added, ""[guidelines] no longer include an expectation that most new school buildings will be fitted with them."" Grenfell fire chiefs call for sprinklers Sprinklers 'would have saved tower' A tale of two towers Ms Cotton told BBC Breakfast she was appalled when she saw that draft guidance. ""I think it was outrageous,"" she said. ""I thought, 'How can we play with children's lives like that?' ""I just do not understand why it wouldn't be made compulsory and wouldn't be made a requirement to fit sprinklers in schools at new-build stage. ""And what I don't want to see is a very large school fire to be the thing that brings about that change."" The consultation was dropped after Grenfell so the guidance was never changed. It continues to state that it is the DfE's ""expectation that all new schools will have sprinklers fitted"", unless a school is ""low risk"" and installation ""would not be good value for money"". Despite this, less than a third of the 260 schools built since 2014 under the Schools Building Programme have sprinklers. Ms Cotton said the London Fire Brigade recommended sprinklers in 184 new or refurbished schools last year, and yet advice was taken in only four of these cases. Other fire services have given BBC Breakfast equivalent figures, following a similar pattern. The National Fire Chiefs Council said the proportion of new schools built with sprinklers had dropped from about 70% a decade ago to a third last year - and overall, in England and Wales, just 5% of schools have sprinklers. London fire chief Dany Cotton said sprinklers should be compulsory in all schools The construction industry says schools can be designed to be low fire risk with exit routes, fire doors and reinforced walls. Andrew Alsbury, from construction firm Willmott Dixon, told the BBC: ""I think if there were more money involved in school buildings I'd be looking at the need for new school places around the country - the bits of the school estate which are in really poor condition - rather than say that sprinklers was the first call. ""Because intrinsically, pupils are safe in their schools today."" The DfE says all schools must have a Fire Risk Assessment and new schools undergo an additional safety check while being designed. ""It has always been the case that where the risk assessment recommends sprinklers in a school building, they must be installed,"" a spokesman added. The Local Government Association said it ""fully supports the installation of sprinklers in new school buildings as a cost-effective measure which can help save lives, protect property and improve firefighter safety"".

What Kenya's vote means for Africa,"This video can not be played Kenya's election re-run explained This week's presidential election re-run in Kenya has implications not only for the country but also for much of the continent, says the BBC's new Africa editor, Fergal Keane. The last days have passed in a swirl of chanting crowds, arguments in the courts, and meetings between powerful politicians and election commissioners. The tension ahead of the polls crackles like static on the streets of Nairobi. At the Githurai junction on the city's outskirts, several thousand people gathered to cheer President Uhuru Kenyatta. Passing cars were surrounded and plastered with party stickers. Briefly enmity flared. A man leaned out of a passing coach and drew his finger across his throat, shouting abuse at the President's supporters. They surged forward but bus and man were quickly gone. The days tremble with rumours. The election may happen. Or it may not. The Independent Election Boundaries Commission has warned it can't guarantee a credible poll in the prevailing circumstances. Old friends I have spoken with express alarm at the rise in ethnic antagonism. International diplomats seem in a quandary - fearful of election day violence while acknowledging that the fresh poll was ordered by the country's highest court. A billboard urges Kenyans to support President Uhuru Kenyatta in the forthcoming election When I first reported from Africa, back in the Cold War days of the 1980s, there were only very occasional elections, usually resulting in the return of the incumbent with 90% or more of the vote. So when Kenya had its first democratic election in 1992, it was easy to be carried along by enthusiasm for the new age. After all, President Daniel arap Moi had been in power for 14 years, during which time there had been a long spree of looting of state assets, worth billions, by an entrenched elite connected to the ruling party. Political enemies were locked up and worse.  But Moi was elected - twice. He knew how to manipulate tribal rivalries to his advantage - and his party machine had very deep pockets. Still there was now at least the possibility of democratic change. President Daniel arap Moi, pictured in 1992 Across Africa it seemed as if a new order of accountability was coming. The great kleptocrat Mobutu Sese Seko had been swept from power in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The apartheid state in South Africa was transformed into a multi-racial democracy. I had met Mobutu and Moi and the leaders of the apartheid regime in South Africa and witnessed the brutality and bribery through which power was maintained in much of the continent. I had also listened to diplomats, among them representatives of Her Majesty's government, tell me that President Moi at least guaranteed stability in Kenya. He kept the tribes from tearing each other asunder. The French would have told you the same thing about any of the despots they supported in Francophone Africa. It was an attitude of mind rooted in deeply patronising attitudes towards Africans, and it ignored the role of foreign interests in creating much of the mess. Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories The brave judge who made Kenyan history Raila Odinga - love him or loathe him Uhuru Kenyatta: Kenya's 'digital president' Full election coverage But Africans were hungry for change. The Cold War had ended and with it the sorry history of support for despotic regimes by both the West and the Soviet bloc. Some of the new leaders came to power through war, but in those heady days of the late 1990s all the talk was of democratising. The most remarkable movement in the continent's post-colonial history was not led by warlords or tribal chiefs but by a generation of Africans who believed their destiny would be shaped by their own actions. From Accra to Johannesburg to Nairobi, and thousands of points in-between, civil society began to mobilise. I watched the Kenyan campaigner John Githongo forensically detail the corruption of the ruling elite and publish his results. In the remote Congolese village of Kachanga I met a women's association treating victims of mass rape and gathering evidence against the perpetrators. The idealistic and energetic also mobilised around issues like the environment, economy, health and free media. The pace and dynamics of change were dictated by the internal realities of each state. But an overarching theme became apparent - the one-party state was becoming the exception. Nairobi, August 2017: Voters queuing for the polling booths The essential change was psychological. Young Africans saw themselves becoming agents of change much as their forebears had done in the years around, and just after, the end of colonialism.  Two decades ago I could not have imagined the recent peaceful elections in Liberia, a state written off as irredeemably ""failed"". But in a large swathe of the continent - central, eastern and much of southern Africa - I underestimated how efficiently the elites would take control of the machinery of modern democracy. In different places they used different tactics - some buying up media outlets to promote their cause, others bribing enemies so that they became friends or manipulating ethnic antagonism into a weapon to be used on the campaign trail, and still more changing the law to extend presidential terms or silence outspoken opponents. Some members of the new governments merely continued the corrupt practices of the old, siphoning off millions as the moribund economies of one-party states made the transition to a free market. In South Africa it gave rise to a new class - the so called ""tenderpreneurs"" - whose connections to the powerful guaranteed lucrative government contracts. Across much of this region - from the Democratic Republic of Congo, to Uganda, Rwanda, Eritrea and others - authoritarianism is on the rise. Elections are postponed, independent media are silenced, presidential term limits are expanded and opposition figures locked up. Kenyan Chief Justice David Maraga It is in this regional context that Kenya's Chief Justice, David Maraga, emerges for many - if not for President Kenyatta's supporters - as a man of great courage. The Supreme Court'sdecision to annul the elections because of irregularities in the electoral process,told the world that this Kenyan court would not accept a second-class democracy. Across Africa there was a sense of pride in this singular decision. Maraga was seen as speaking for the many who still stand for and demand accountable rulers and an independent civil service. Since the Supreme Court decision tension has steadily risen. Elections are set for Thursday, but the opposition leader Raila Odinga refuses to take part. It is possible to simultaneously take heart from the courage of the chief justice and the changed Africa he represents, and to be deeply worried about the escalating tension gripping the country in the wake of the court's decision. Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga is refusing to take part in the election For Kenyans know that political violence often goes unpunished, particularly when the instigators are powerful people. So, often, does brazen corruption. The long struggle is not between political elites at the polling booth. It is a fight waged by a still resourceful civil society, independent judges and honest political campaigners to demand accountability. The conduct of these elections and what happens in their aftermath matters hugely to Kenyans, millions of other Africans and the broader international community. An unstable Kenya has serious implications for the fight against terrorism in Somalia and, potentially, for the aid operations in South Sudan. A peaceful resolution to this democratic crisis would be an example to the continent. Mr Githongo told me that ""democracy is entering a dark tunnel but there might just be light at the other side"". The struggle to protect the gains made by honest men and women across this region is entering a critical phase.

"O'Mara should be suspended, Labour MP says","Former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell, right, said Labour MP Jared O'Mara should be suspended while being investigated for misogynistic and homophobic language by the Labour Party A prominent Labour MP says Jared O'Mara should be suspended from the party while claims he made misogynistic and homophobic remarks are investigated. Former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell made the comments on ITV after Mr O'Mara was accused of making offensive comments in March 2017. Labour has launched an investigation into his behaviour. The Sheffield Hallam MPapologised for remarks made online in 2002 and 2004, but denies the more recent allegations. On Monday Mr O'Mara resigned from the women and equalities committee after political website Guido Fawkes unearthed offensive comments made by the 35-year-old MP. Then on Tuesday, Sophie Evans told the BBC's Daily Politics she had met Mr O'Mara on a dating app and there had been ""no hard feelings"" when things didn't work out between them. But in an incident in March 2017 Mr O'Mara, who was DJing in a nightclub, made comments to her that ""aren't broadcastable"" and called her an ""ugly bitch"", she said. This video can not be played Sophie Evans on Jared O'Mara comments: ""I just thought wow, he is not a very nice man"" Mr O'Mara said this was ""categorically untrue"". Ms Powell, MP for Manchester Central, told ITV's After The News: ""One of the key questions you're asked when you become a candidate for the Labour Party - and you have to sign a contract to say this - is there anything in your past that would bring the party into disrepute? ""And I don't understand, in all honesty, how Jared could have signed that paper. That's why I think he should be suspended while that investigation is taking place."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has also called for Mr O'Mara to have the Labour whip removed. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""He has apologised for what we knew yesterday. He issued a profuse apology. ""Any language like that we know is unacceptable and I'm hoping he will apologise for that."" The offensive comments published by Guido Fawkes included messages where he claimed singer Michelle McManus only won Pop Idol ""because she was fat"" and it would be funny if jazz star Jamie Cullum was ""sodomised with his own piano"". More comments, involving homophobic language, then emerged dating back to 2002.
