The horse that saved his own life by painting,"This video can not be played  He was once a well-known racehorse, but it looked as though ill health would soon mean the end for Metro. Then his artist owner, Ron, had an unusual idea. It's said that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink. So when Ron Krajewski first introduced his horse, Metro, to an easel there was no guarantee he would paint. After all, this horse had been struggling with health problems since he was adopted by Ron and his wife in 2009. Metro had once been a successful racehorse - as Metro Meteor, he won eight races and $300,000 (Â£234,000) prize money at the prestigious Belmont Park. However, he was retired by his stable after bone chips in his knees caused permanent damage. ""We were looking for a horse Wendy could ride and were probably quite naive,"" Ron says. ""We soon discovered Metro had worse race injuries than we had bargained for."" Metro Meteor won eight races in his career, but it took a toll on his knees Metro had months of rehab and medication. Special horse shoes helped for a time, but in 2012 X-rays revealed his knee joints were closing up. A vet said they would lock up within two years, at which point Ron and Wendy would have to put their horse down. ""I didn't just want to put him out to pasture and forget about him. I was thinking about how we could spend time together,"" Ron says. He had noticed that his spirited horse liked to bob his head to get attention and pick things up in his mouth. A professional artist himself, Ron wondered if he could convince Metro to hold a paintbrush. ""I taught him to touch his nose to the canvas for horse treats, then to hold a paint brush,"" Ron says. Metro tackles the canvas assisted by Ron - he paints from left to right ""He could have just touched the paint brush to the canvas and then dropped it and that would have been the end of it. Luckily for us he started making up and down strokes and seemed to enjoy it."" Metro was soon creating works that Ron judged were good enough to put on sale at a local gallery. The first four paintings sold out the week they were put on display. Metro's unbridled style has been compared to Jackson Pollock, a painter famous for his splatter and drip technique. ""Metro's brush strokes are nothing a human can make, because he doesn't think about what he will do before he does it. His strokes are thick, random and sometimes broken, which lets other colours show through. It all just vibrates on the canvas,"" Ron says. Metro's unusual ability caught the attention of local TV news in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and his story was picked up nationwide. By 2014, there were 150 people on a waiting list for his works. Ron sometimes set up an easel for Metro to paint outside Sales of the paintings helped fund a new experimental treatment for Metro. His vet created a technique to apply a drug called Tildren directly to his knees. ""Within a few months X-rays showed the bone growth had receded. It has added years to his life,"" Ron says. Ron and Wendy keep Metro and their other horse, Pork Chop, at a stable four miles from their home. They visit them about five days a week and on two of those Ron and Metro have a painting session. Metro (left) and Pork Chop ""Metro has got a little section in the barn that we call his studio. It's all set up ready for him to paint,"" Ron says. ""I did try to get Pork Chop to paint once, but he just wasn't interested."" Ron acts as both art director and assistant. He picks the colour and loads the paintbrush before handing it over. Metro then makes the strokes. ""I always stand on his left so he paints from left to right. If I hand him the brush in the upper right hand corner, that's where he will go."" Pork Chop (right) observes Metro at work Ron and Metro will work on three or four canvases at once during a 20-minute session. ""We'll spend two minutes on one canvas and then swap it for another. He tends to smear things together so we'll do some blues and then let it dry, then let's say some orange. This builds up the layers."" Ron and Wendy spoke to Outlook on the BBC World Service -listen again on iPlayer Get the Outlook podcastfor more extraordinary real-life stories Metro, who Ron says has an ""A-list extroverted personality"", is in his element at the easel. ""I can put out the easel in the field and he will stop eating grass and stand right in front of it. ""He loves to paint. I'm not sure how much he can see as horses have a blind spot right in front of their noses. I think he likes the feel of running a brush over the canvas."" Metro's large paintings sell for a few hundred dollars Like Metro, art wasn't Ron's first vocation. Raised in a fishing family that caught salmon in Alaska he went on to serve in the US Air Force. He became a professional artist at the age of 40. ""I mainly do pet portraits, which are very lifelike and controlled. When I paint with Metro it's the opposite. You can't predict what he's going to do when he gets the brush in his mouth. It's controlled chaos."" Metro's paintings continue to sell well. ""We have different sizes that vary in price from $50 to $500. We're selling one or two a week,"" Ron says. Ron and Wendy donate half of Metro's earnings to a charity called New Vocations, which retrains and rehomes former race horses. So far they have donated $80,000 (Â£62,000), which will have helped 50 to 60 other horses. And now aged 14, it seems Metro has no inclination to slow down. ""There's something about painting which really interests Metro,"" Ron says. ""I don't think he'll ever get tired of it.""

'I went to the web to find a new kidney',"Matthew Pietrzyk found a kidney donor online Eleven-year-old Matthew Pietrzyk can now swim, run, have a bath and eat chocolate, all impossible before his kidney transplant. But he might still be on the waiting list, enduring 12 hours of dialysis each day, if his mother, Nicola, had not run a Facebook campaign to find him a living donor. Matthew is one of a number of UK patients who have bypassed the traditional NHS system of organ allocation, instead harnessing the power of the internet to find their own. Transplant doctors fear this development could result in an unsavoury competition to attract donors online, in what some have called an ""organ beauty pageant"". And they worry that it rips up the traditional health service ethos of equal access to treatment for all. Consultant nephrologist Dr Adnan Sharif, from Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, says: ""Somebody who is well-to-do, a professional, will be very good at promoting themselves,"" whereas poorer patients, perhaps from minority ethnic communities, will not have the same opportunities. The woman donating organs to strangers Woman with 100-year-old kidney from mum 'still going strong' But Matthew's mother is unrepentant. ""I'm not going to lie, I think on Matthew's side was the fact he was a child,"" she says. ""In all walks of life, we use things to our advantage. ""If it meant that he didn't have to spend his life on dialysis, then I'd take it - I don't care."" There are 28,000 people on dialysis in the UK. Some 5,000 patients are on the national waiting list for an organ transplant from a dead donor. There is a permanent shortage of such kidneys. But there is another option; they may get a kidney from a living donor, because most of us can live healthily with just one. Alison Thornhill donated her kidney to an anonymous recipient Living donors now make up a third of all kidney transplants in the UK. Some are donated anonymously through a very successful NHS scheme. But social media campaigns such as Matthew's can bring dozens of would-be donors to be tissue-tested for just one patient, squeezing resources. Sue Moore, the lead NHS living donor coordinator in Birmingham, says: ""You'd get people call out of the blue, and it was quite overwhelming really."" However, since Matthew's appeal was launched in 2013, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the biggest renal centre in Europe, has adjusted to handling such pressures. Matthew's mother argues publicity for his campaign increased awareness of kidney donation. And some of the people initially tested for Matthew went on to give a kidney to someone else. One was Alison Thornhill, who was touched by his Facebook appeal. ""If one of my grandchildren was in that situation, I would want somebody to step forward and be tested to see if they were a match for him,"" she says. Alison wasn't a match for Matthew, but since she ""was prepared to give a kidney to a little boy who I didn't know, it made sense just to go on and give it to somebody else who I didn't know who needed it"". Eighteen months ago, she went into hospital and became an anonymous donor. Unexpectedly, she later got letters from the recipient, and from his mother, who wrote: ""I don't know anything about you apart from the fact that you are a very kind and compassionate person. ""I will be eternally grateful to you. ""Kindest regards, a loving and thankful mother."" Gemma Coles wants to chose who to donate her kidney to But some would-be donors want to choose precisely who receives their kidney. Searching online, Gemma Coles identified a series of patients she wanted to donate to, though for various reasons it has not yet happened. Asked why she wants to choose the recipient, she replies she has only one kidney to give. ""You have to be judgemental,"" she says. ""There's thousands of people, literally, needing a kidney, and more and more now their stories are available on social media, and it can feel you're being very critical of people's lives, trying to decide who to give and who not to."" If the transplant community was disturbed by Facebook kidney appeals, it was shocked by websites offering to match donors and patients, who can browse through profiles and photos. Matchingdonors.com was set up in the US by businessman Paul Dooley as a non-profit venture. It charges $595 (Â£464) for US patients seeking a donor. In 2012, he brought the website to the UK, but this time, without charging any fees. According to the regulator, the Human Tissue Authority, transplant centres must refuse operations involving a website that does charge fees. Since Matchingdonors.com is free to use in the UK, there is no regulatory barrier to stop it brokering a transplant. But chief executive Mr Dooley says not one such transplant has taken place in five years in the UK. There are 73 UK patients waiting - some have found matches with potential donors, but none has had permission from their hospital to go ahead. Prof Vassilios Papalois says doctors must be allowed to make ethical decisions In 2015, he stopped stopped signing up British patients, because ""there's no use them going to a gas station if there's no gas"". It seems the transplant community simply decided organ-matching websites were beyond the pale. But is this fair? Prof Vassilios Papalois, who formerly chaired the British Transplantation Society's ethics committee, says the views of transplant teams must be respected. ""They have the autonomy to say that for us it's ethically objectionable,"" he says. Asked if he is trying to provide the catwalk for an organ beauty pageant, Mr Dooley replies: ""Every single person on our website who's an organ donor wants to choose. ""They want to say, 'I want to give to an old grandfather, 'I want to give to a single father,' and if that's what they consider a beauty contest, that's not a beauty contest, it's the choice of who you want to donate to."" The Organ Beauty Pageant is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday, 2 May, at 20:00 BST,  and repeated on Sunday, 7 May, at 17:00 BST.

How did Blair change the country after becoming PM?,"This video can not be played Watch: How the BBC covered this day 20 years ago On Monday, it was 20 years to the day that Tony Blair won a landslide general election victory for Labour - how did he change the country and what is left of his legacy? ""A new dawn has broken, has it not?"" With these words, spoken to a cheering crowd of supporters as the sun rose over London's South Bank, Tony Blair ushered in the first Labour government in 18 years. It was a typically snappy Blair phrase, yet also slightly hesitant, as if he could not quite believe what he had just done. Blair was, by all accounts, a nervy companion on election night, refusing to believe he was on course to a stunning victory even as it was becoming obvious to all around him. He did not share the euphoric mood of supporters. ""I was scared,"" he later wrote in his memoirs. It was a Labour landslide of historic proportions, handing Blair a Commons majority of 179, although the collapse in the Tory vote made it appear more dramatic. John Major's Conservatives had won more votes in 1992 - 14,093,007 - than Blair's 1997 total of 13,518,167. But none of that mattered to the ecstatic crowd at the Royal Festival Hall, as Blair sketched out, in vague but confident terms, his vision of a modern, united country fit for a new millennium. A country for the ""many not the few"". It is striking now to hear how much of his eight-minute speech was directed at the party's old guard. ""We have been elected as New Labour and we will govern as New Labour,"" he told his audience, as a warning shot across the bows of those who had opposed his ""modernisation"" of the party every step of the way. Blair came to power at a time of almost giddy optimism, in contrast with what was to come. The end of the Cold War and booming economies in the West, driven by advances in technology, created a brief window where peace, stability and rising living standards looked like they might become the norm. Britain was in the middle of a pop culture revival, built around swaggering self-confidence and semi-ironic celebrations of Britishness. The Union Jack was back - on Noel Gallagher's guitar and Geri Halliwell's mini dress at that year's Brit awards. The Cross of St George had also been rehabilitated, as a new breed of middle class football fan cheered England to the semi-finals of the Euro 96 tournament. Blair rode the ""Cool Britannia"" wave for all it was worth. At 43, the former lead singer of Ugly Rumours - his student band - badly wanted to be seen as the first rock and roll prime minister. And for the briefest of moments, it seemed to work, as he played host to the stars of Britain's ""creative industries"" at a Downing Street reception weeks after taking office. The voting public might have bought into New Labour's blend of Thatcherite free market economics and social justice, but it never had very deep roots in the Labour Party itself. It was the product of a tight-knit group headed by Blair, Gordon Brown, Peter Mandelson and media chief Alastair Campbell. Blair's first cabinet was a mix of old and new Labour figures (although the hard left was banished to the wilderness). ""Traditional values in a modern setting"", as John Prescott, a man who straddled the new/old divide with more agility than he was often given credit for, would say with a knowing smirk. They were a diverse bunch - with more women than had ever sat in a British cabinet before and the first openly gay cabinet minister, Chris Smith. There were some big hitters, such as Robin Cook at the Foreign Office and Jack Straw at the Home Office, even though very few - including Blair himself - had ever sat behind a ministerial desk before. And it quickly became clear that only Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown really mattered when it came to the big decisions. But rather like Oasis's Gallagher brothers, their successes were quickly followed by growing stories about their rivalry. But despite their increasingly fractious relationship - the TBGBs as they became known - there was no official split as they dominated Britain's political landscape for the next decade. Ministers seemed to come and go with dizzying speed, as the cabinet reshuffle became Blair's signature move, but the Blair/Brown axis somehow stayed in place. Twenty years on and only three MPs - Harriet Harman, Margaret Beckett and Nick Brown - from that first Cabinet line-up are still in the Commons. Mo Mowlam, Donald Dewar and Robin Cook are no longer with us. Most of the rest, including the now Lord Prescott, Alistair Darling and David Blunkett, have taken up seats in the House of Lords. Did they achieve what they set out to do? The Blair government came to power on the back of relatively modest proposals on a pledge card brandished relentlessly through the 1997 election campaign. They were cutting class sizes, ""fast track"" punishment for young offenders, cutting NHS waiting lists, getting 250,000 under-25-year-olds ""off benefit and into work"" and ""no rise in income tax rates"". But the new government did not lack ambition. Labour's 1997 manifesto also included a minimum wage and plans for devolved government in Scotland and Wales. And on the day after their election victory, Gordon Brown surprised everyone by handing control of interest rates to the Bank of England - a move that would have far-reaching consequences for the economy. Blair was also determined, like many a prime minister before and since, to fix some of the country's longstanding social problems. One of his top priorities was reform of the UK's social security system to make work pay. He appointed Labour MP Frank Field to ""think the unthinkable"" on welfare and promptly sacked him when he did just that (although it was Field's falling out with his boss Harriet Harman that probably sealed his fate). Twenty years on and welfare reform remains a work in progress. The gap between rich and poor remained more or less the same during the Blair years,according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation,external, although there was a big increase in pay at the top end of the income scale. Education was Blair's other top priority. He oversaw a big expansion in higher and further education, and poured money into early years learning, as well as pioneering academy schools. His first term was characterised by caution on tax and public spending, thanks to Labour's commitment to stick to tight Conservative spending limits for the first two years. That changed after the party's second landslide election victory in 2001, when billions began to pour into the health service and education, on the back of a booming economy. Outcomes improved as a result. But perhaps the biggest change that happened to Britain during his time in power was never explicitly spelled out in a Labour manifesto. The UK, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland were the only EU nations not to temporarily restrict the rights of people from eight new member countries, including Poland and the Czech Republic, to live and work in their countries. Blair's 2004 decision to open the door to East European migration was entirely in keeping with his values as an ardent pro-European, who had championed the eastward expansion of the EU and who believed globalisation and flexible labour markets were the answer to industrial decline. The plentiful supply of cheap labour arguably helped the UK economy to expand without facing the issue of spiralling wages - and this in turn held inflation and interest rates down, contributing to a decade-long boom in property prices, adding to the feelgood factor among middle income home owners, even if fewer people could afford to get on the property ladder in the first place. But it also sowed the seeds of discontent in Labour's heartlands, as growing numbers felt left behind and marginalised by the pace of change in their communities, and a growing anti-EU feeling began to take hold. And then there was Iraq. In 2003, Blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for joining the US-led invasion to MPs and the wider public. He had become convinced of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims and the need to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the US, in the wake of 11 September, 2001. But the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction appeared to confirm many people's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted. It did not prevent him from winning a third term, in 2005, but he was forced to hand over to Gordon Brown earlier than he had wanted, in 2007. Like Mrs Thatcher in 1990, he had won three elections but ended up being forced out by his own side. The Blair family leave Downing Street in 2007 The years that followed were not kind, as the incoming Brown administration, and the Ed Miliband Labour team that followed seemed to do their best to talk down the Blair years - and then there was the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war, as well as the ongoing consequences of the invasion, for the region and global security as a whole. Blair's supporters point to his domestic achievements - the minimum wage and all the new schools, hospitals and Sure Start children's centres that were built during his time in power  - and they insist that his reputation will one day recover. But with Britain on its way out of the European Union, and the Labour Party back in the hands of the left, it seems like much of what Blair stood for has been swept away. His centrist brand of politics, characterised as the Third Way, a philosophy shared by his friend and political soulmate Bill Clinton, has fallen out of fashion in many Western countries and even Blair's style of politics, with its rigid emphasis on ""message discipline"", looks antiquated in the more freewheeling age of social media. And despite winning three general elections, with big majorities, making him Labour's most electorally successful leader, his name has become a dirty word among many current active party members, guaranteed to generate boos and cat calls when it comes up at meetings. It is very far from the future he must have imagined for himself on that cloudless spring morning in May 1997. Yet Blair's supporters claim that his vision of a self-consciously modern, multicultural, socially liberal country, has endured - and that David Cameron's six years in government were shaped by it. It is there in the Conservatives' commitments on foreign aid and promotion of gay rights, they say, as well as Britain's continued commitment to a health service free at the point of delivery, funded by taxation. And, at 63, the man himself is still in the game. He has ditched his business interests - that had generated so much negative publicity for him - to work full time on promoting moderate, centrist policy solutions, fighting battles that 20 years ago he must have hoped would have been won by now.

Trump's next 100 days: What happens now?,"What will happen for the rest of Trump's presidency? You might as well ask a Magic Eight ball The first 100 days of Donald Trump's presidency are now behind him. Time for a deep breath, a quick review and then a look ahead. As I explainedlast week, the results so far are decidedly mixed. While there has been a paucity of legislative achievements, Mr Trump has notched some successes through executive action, particularly in the realm of immigration enforcement and regulatory rollback. The verdict on Trump so far He's also already made his mark on the Supreme Court, although that's more a reflection of the circumstances of inheriting an open seat (thanks to Republican intransigence last year) rather than any particular accomplishment on the part of the president. While the 100-day mark has garnered a significant amount of attention from the media and the White House itself, it represents just a fraction of his first term. Mr Trump still has more than 1,350 days ahead of him. The story of roughly 90% of his presidency has yet to be written. Whether Mr Trump is deemed a success or failure as president, and if he has hopes of winning a second term in office, will be determined over the coming months and years. The first 100 days: Two faces of Trump's America 100 voters reflect on Trump's 100 days But what happens next? Given what we've seen over the past 100 days, anything could be possible. Sometimes it feels like a Magic 8-ball would be just as good at making predictions. The Economy When asked about the White House's tax cut plan, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said it ""is all about jobs, jobs, jobs"". When it comes right down to it, jobs - and the economy writ large - will be the defining issue of the Trump presidency. With the 2008 Great Recession still casting a long shadow over the American conscience, Mr Trump's voters flocked to him in large part because he promised economic growth and financial security, particularly for many of the white working class voters who are still recovering from the last downturn. As with many of his campaign promises, Mr Trump has set a very high bar for his administration to meet, repeatedly pledging an annual 4% economic growth rate that is well above current trend lines. Mr Trump inherited an economy that was stable, with low unemployment and steady if unspectacular growth. Over the course of his first 100 days in office, the US stock market has flourished and consumer confidence increased, but the recently announced economic growth rate - 0.7% for the first quarter of 2017 - may signal an uncertain future. In the end, Mr Trump's presidency, and all his trade, tax and regulatory policies, will be judged on what it does for the nation's bottom line - not just for Wall Street, but for average Americans as well. Can he win?Presidents invariable get more credit, and blame, for the nation's financial health than they deserve, given that policy decisions can be greatly outweighed by macroeconomic factors beyond their control. Four years is a long time, but Mr Trump is starting from a solid position, tilting the odds in his favour. Presidents have broad authority over immigration policy, and Mr Trump hasn't shied away from using it. Two of his most high-profile moves, however, have been stalled in the courts. His second effort to impose a temporary moratorium on refugee resettlement and a ban on entry into the US for citizens of six predominantly Muslim nations is set to be heard by the Ninth Circuit US Court of Appeals later this month. In addition, his executive order instructing the federal government to withhold funds from municipalities that do not fully co-operate with immigration officials - so-called ""sanctuary cities"" -  was derailed by a district court judge in California last week. Trump's 'criminal alien' hotline trolled There's also the continuing battle over how to construct Mr Trump's promised wall along the US-Mexico border. It looked like the administration would make appropriating funds a condition of recently concluded budget negotiations, but the White House has since retreated from that position and appears willing to fight that particular battle in the autumn budget discussions, instead. As a candidate Mr Trump also pledged to reform legal immigration, reducing the number of new arrivals, changing the types of individuals who are granted priority and restructuring the work visa programme, which could affect visas for high-skilled workers. Can he win?The president has the power and the obvious desire to exercise it - and a conservative-dominated Supreme Court will be the final arbiter of the legality of his actions. One of the most remarkable characteristics of the Trump presidency has been how slowly the White House is filling out its administration. While Mr Trump relentlessly bashed Senate Democrats for what he (mistakenly) perceived as unprecedented foot-dragging in confirming his cabinet picks, he has been even tardier in appointing lower-level positions. Under secretaries, deputies and ambassadors may not get much national attention, but they are largely responsible for the day-to-day grind of running agencies and departments and representing the US in embassies abroad. The people around Donald Trump Some of this may be by intent. An understaffed bureaucracy is less able to defend itself against proposed budget cuts, and the Trump administration appears set on diminishing the influence of career employees at the State Department. In other areas, such as economic, social and trade policy, however, the lack of staffing has limited the administration's ability to move toward its goals. Can he win?Sure he can - it's just a matter of giving a list of names to Congress. Sometimes, however, it seems like he'd rather have chaos. Mr Trump campaigned on making a significant shift in US foreign policy - putting ""America first"". Now, however, his administration faces two potential international flashpoints that could challenge the president's stated desire to avoid global entanglements. As a result of the US missile strike on a Syrian government airfield, the US has committed itself to punishing violations of international law - particularly the use of chemical weapons - in that nation's civil war. If Syrian President Basahr al-Assad decides to act against his civilian population again, Mr Trump will face pressure for a military response that goes beyond a ship-based missile strike. Trumplomacy: Bromance with an autocrat Meanwhile, the situation over North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes continues to grow tense. ""The era of 'strategic patience' is over,"" Vice-President Mike Pence recently said, referencing the stated policy of the Obama administration. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, however, seems undeterred - and could respond to a US strike with a massive attack on South Korea, whose capital, Seoul, lies 55km from the demilitarised zone. In both Syria and North Korea, the president could be faced with the choice of either escalation to back up his sharpening rhetoric or the perception that his threats are hollow. Then there are the foreign policy crises we don't see coming. Ukraine, Yemen, Afghanistan and the South China Sea ... there's no telling where Mr Trump could face his most daunting challenge. Can he win?Mr Trump has been all over the map so far as president, sabre-rattling at some nations and shrugging at others. Mr Trump talked a tough game on trade issues as a candidate, and he'll have opportunities in the coming days to back that up. Recent disputes with Canada over soft lumber and dairy products appear to be a prelude to contentious Nafta renegotiations. On Thursday Mr Trump told reporters had been days away from ordering a withdrawal from the ""horrible"" trade deal, but changed his mind after conversations with leaders of Mexico and Canada. This video can not be played Dairy wars: Why is Trump threatening Canada over milk? In an ironic twist, some of Mr Trump's trade concerns - such as dairy exports to Canada - would have been addressed by the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement he abandoned early in his presidency. China was another punching bag for Mr Trump during campaign, but the president has considerably softened his tone. There's certainly no indication of an impending economic showdown with the US's largest trading partner at this point. Can he win?With China apparently off the table, he'll have to find a way to get his ""better deal"" through Nafta renegotiations - which will be long and complex. There's at least a glimmer of hope that a deal on repealing and replacing Obamacare could be reached in the House of Representatives soon. Whatever they come up with, however, will face an even bigger hurdle in the Senate, where numerous Republicans are opposed to portions of the House proposal. Tax reform - Mr Trump's next big legislative priority - is in its early stages, and given the vagueness of the administration's proposal so far, it appears congressional Republicans will once again have to do the heavy lifting on policy. That didn't work out too well with healthcare. Trump seeks tax windfall for business Then there are the Trump campaign promises on infrastructure spending and new childcare benefits. Both areas could prove fertile ground for bipartisan co-operation - at least, if Democrats can be coaxed to the negotiating table after the president has spent his first 100 days relentlessly bashing them. In some alternate universe, Mr Trump led with an infrastructure plan instead of healthcare repeal, fracturing the Democratic resistance instead of his own party. That ship, however, has sailed. He still has a Republican majority, however, and the closer it gets to the congressional elections next year, the more pressure the party will be under to come together and post some accomplishments on the board. Can he win?Republicans hold the White House and both chambers of Congress. Surely they will stumble into a legislative accomplishment at some point. Ah, yes, the midterm elections. Looming on the horizon for Mr Trump and the Republican Party is voting that will take place in November 2018, with a third of the Senate seats, all of the House of Representatives and 36 governorships (Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and California, to name a few) on the ballot. Traditionally the party controlling the presidency is at a disadvantage during these elections, as the out-of-power partisans tend to be more motivated to vote and the political pendulum that brought a president to office swings the other direction. Barack Obama and the Democrats suffered significant defeats in 2010 and 2014, for instance, as did Republican George W Bush in 2006. Mr Trump is at least somewhat fortunate, however, in that the Senate seats in play in 2018 largely come from states he carried handily - places like Indiana, West Virginia, Montana and Missouri. Although Republicans have a narrow, two-seat Senate majority right now, Democrats will be forced to defend many more at-risk incumbents than the Republicans. This video can not be played Can Democrats 'make Trump furious'? The House of Representatives could be another matter, however. While demographics and the way in which congressional districts have been drawn favour Republicans, if Mr Trump is unpopular come 2018 and Democrats turn out in high numbers, they could pick up the 24 seats necessary to win back the lower chamber of Congress for the first time since 2010. All this is important not only because Democratic control of even half of Congress would significantly impede Mr Trump's ability to notch any legislative accomplishments, but also because it would give Democrats a platform for more vigorous oversight of the president's actions. Recall the litany of hearings and investigations conducted by Republicans in Congress during the Obama administration. Now imagine how Democrats would gleefully sink their teeth into issues like Mr Trump's tax returns, alleged ties to Russia and possible conflicts of interest within his business empire. For a preview of how things may turn out next year, keep an eye on gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey this November, as well as upcoming House special elections in Montana and Georgia later this spring. Can he win?History is not on the president's side. The question is likely how big a bloodbath it will be.

All change on Greater Manchester's 'insane' bus system?,"The bus network in the capital is regulated by Transport for London ""Insane"". That's one Londoner's view of Greater Manchester's bus system. Some routes have lots of buses vying for passengers while others only have one, if that. It's a major issue for voters and one which the mayor, once elected, will have the power to change. It's not unusual to see rows of buses in popular places such as Oxford Road, in Manchester's university district, but fewer in areas such as Monton in Salford. The reason? Huge differences in demand and no regulation. More than 30 years ago the then Conservative government passed a law that meant private companies could run services on previously local authority-controlled routes, which were profitable based on passenger numbers. London was the exception. Buses were privatised but the city's service was not deregulated. Maintaining regulation in the capital has meant passengers pay set fares, the buses look the same and changes such aspassengers needing prepaid or concessionary tickets,an Oyster card or a contactless payment card to travel were introduced across the board. Greater Manchester, like many other urban areas, has no such system. The main three bus operators in Greater Manchester are First, Stagecoach and Arriva But with an estimated 210 million passenger journeys taking place by bus in Greater Manchester every year - 79% of all public transport journeys, ahead of 9% by train and 12% by tram - there is a belief that something needs to change to ""fulfil basic customer requirements"". This is what the transport authority - Transport for Greater Manchester - is aiming to achieve with the mayor. Passengers across the region are using buses run by more than 20 bus operators (competing to serve 500 bus services) and are faced with 100 different ticketing types with varying prices and offers. This video can not be played Gay Williams, from Monton, says bus services can be ""dangerous"" Gay Williams, from Monton says four bus services from her home to the city centre have been reduced to one over the past 15 years. ""I have been stranded from 5:30pm to 7:30pm because buses have been taken off the route and it can be dangerous,"" she says. ""When I inquired about it I was told it was no longer a government-funded route. How does that help people get to and from work?"" What messages did young people have for the mayors? Find out in our Listen Up podcasts Ticket prices, bus timings and the multitude of different companies were highlighted as issues by young people who took part in the BBC's Listen Up project, which canvassed opinions on what young people wanted to see from their elected mayors. At one workshop, university student Lauren Barclay, 19, from Trafford, reveals how she gave up on buses. ""It was actually cheaper to buy a car and get insurance and drive in every day than get a bus to a tram stop and get a tram into Manchester,"" she says. Others detail other problems - how they've missed buses because they didn't take cards, how seasonal tickets couldn't be used on buses run by different firms and how some annual student passes didn't include the summer holiday period at the end of the year. Femi Oyeniran said Manchester's bus network is ""counter-intuitive, unfair and inefficient"" Listening in is workshop leader and London-based actor/film producer Femi Oyeniran. ""That makes no sense,"" he says. ""The fact that you are better off driving in the second most congested city in the country than catching public transport to university. That's insane. ""I find it really confusing to hear that there's no streamlined bus system and there's clearly no streamlined ticketing system. You have to do research before you have to catch a bus down the road, it's incredible. ""It is counter-intuitive, unfair and inefficient."" Firms are under no obligation to run services just to meet a social responsibility, says Richard Knowles, Emeritus Professor of Transport Geography at the University of Salford. ""Deregulation was a very radical experiment and it has not been replicated across the world,"" he adds. ""London was specifically excluded because it was seen as too risky at that moment. London would have had to have further legislation."" He says deregulation was implemented after an 18-month trial in rural areas, with the largest being in an area of 30,000 people. As a result, passengers in Greater Manchester have seen a disparity in fares, inconsistencies in services, routes being axed and one operator'sonboard ticket prices increase while those bought via its own app were frozen. Transport for Greater Manchester hopes to create an ""integrated"" bus system But the bus network is on the verge of change after Greater Manchester agreed to elect a mayor if the successful candidate could take control of local transport and implement changes, which would go out to public consultation. So it could mean fares are set, an end to multiple bus companies competing for passengers on busy routes, and even a return to more buses on routes that are not commercially profitable. Prof Knowles says: ""The elected mayor will have the power to bring in bus franchising and put them out to tender. Fares might not go up as fast, but they might be fairer."" When local councils operated bus services, before deregulation, they ""weren't terribly efficient"", he adds. If there are changes in how buses are run, he believes the mayor and the local transport authority ""should use private bus companies' expertise"". ""You would always maintain the expertise but have some control of the routes, frequencies and fares. But it's not a panacea,"" he adds. There is a strategy for bus services in the future for a system that ""fulfils basic customer requirements"" Transport for Greater Manchester, which is responsible for implementing local transport policy, says it's one that is ""integrated, safe, secure, healthy, low-emission, accessible, resilient and affordable"". The Bus Services Bill was given Royal Assent making it law Phil Medlicott, managing director at bus company First Manchester, says operators and regulators have the same aim: ""To get more people out of their cars and using buses"". ""We recognise that there is still much to do to make this a reality, but we are convinced that the quickest, cheapest and best way to improve bus services throughout Greater Manchester is through positive and proactive partnerships,"" he says. Once a mayor is elected a new law would give them power - and enable other English local transport authorities - to introduce franchising, new partnership arrangements and to offer multi-operator ticketing services. TheBus Services Bill was passedin April after it was given Royal Assent making it a new law. Lianna Etkind, from the Campaign for Better Transport, says this is important for all those frustrated passengers. ""It means that cities like Manchester will be able to introduce a smart ticketing scheme, so instead of people having to work out different fares they would be able to tap in and tap out of buses,"" she says. ""Socially valuable services which might not be profitable... could be cross subsidised. ""It's time that other cities were able to benefit from a system that really works and links up as a whole.""

Six priorities for George Osborne at the Standard,"Like many a journalist, George Osborne arrived for work clutching a selection of the day's newspapers George Osborne has had countless exhilarating moments in his career - and plenty of grim ones too. He will have felt a surge of adrenaline when, this morning, he sat in the editor's chair at the Evening Standard for the first time. And thank goodness, because his new working hours mean he has to wake up at about 5am. Here are six priorities in his new role. Leadership is about vision, articulating where you want your team to reach - perhaps some shining city upon a hill. Management is the daily trudge to get there. The first thing any new editor has to do is set out very clearly where he wants to take the organ. Who is it for, where will it sit politically, what key changes is he intent on making, and so on. I can imagine Osborne saying, when he addresses staff after the first edition is sent to the printers, that London is his home city, the place of his birth, and that he wants the Standard to be a paper for London, by Londoners. He might say: ""For the past 20 years I've been a Conservative, but always a liberal one, and now I want us to fight for the liberal mainstream majority in this city."" Since leaving No 11, Osborne has missed running things. He'll enjoy being a boss again. The former chancellor previously made headlines - now he has to write them Editors depend for their efficacy on authority, and specifically the authority to make things happen - that is, power. The sources of authority are several: First, natural authority, which comes from your manner, reputation, and character. Second, the intellectual force of your leadership and vision. Third, a strong mandate from the proprietor. And fourth, knowledge of the craft you now practise. And here Osborne is starting with - to use a term he knows well - a deficit. Since his student days, he hasn't rewritten a picture caption, designed a front page, or converted the seventh paragraph of his most pompous columnist's weekly contribution into an intro. All this will take time, as will getting comfortable with some of the jargon beloved by old print hands, who talk of widows and orphans constantly (don't ask). Osborne needs to impose himself intellectually and journalistically to persuade his colleagues he isn't an amateur. A masterstroke of a splash headline this week would help. So too would a gentle redesign. Readers can get annoyed at redesigns, but given this paper is free, they might forgive it, and for Osborne it could be an unbeatable way to excite staff, show he cares about the small print (literally), and break with the past. George Osborne had met the Evening Standard staff before his first day Osborne has done this several times of course, not least at the Treasury. Newspapers are generally very hierarchical places. He will quickly discover that if one of his specialists or a desk editors is off sick, the paper will still come out, but when the lowest-paid among the production staff catches a flu, the paper is full of errors, he gets a nasty fine for being late, and the darn thing nearly fails to be printed. Aside from getting to know junior staff in editorial and production, Osborne will need to get to know all the commercial staff too, because the Standard's business model is so dependent on selling ads. He went round and introduced himself to them all when he went into the office a few months ago, and ought to do that again. The Standard's business model is under immense pressure. Being free, it has no cover price revenue and is therefore funded mainly by print display advertising. But that market is disappearing fast and, although the Standard has mostly fixed distribution costs, Osborne needs to find new revenues - quickly. Bringing in high-profile speakers for big events is one way to achieve this and he will need to call in some big favours very soon. Mike Bloomberg, Christine Lagarde, David Cameron and even his chum Emmanuel Macron should expect calls. As chancellor, Osborne grasped the importance of a turnaround, or crisis-and-resolution, narrative. This is not unique to UK politics: Mitt Romney wrote a book called Turnaround. Just as, years ago, the austerity chancellor left voters in no doubt that Britain's economy was on the brink, so as to justify some harsh medicine, so he may talk openly in coming weeks about why the crisis in the advertising market makes it necessary for him to make painful decisions, including any sackings. Theresa May was once George Osborne's ally - could that relationship now become strained? I spoke to one Standard hack over the weekend who said ""Theresa May has done us a massive favour!"" The fact that Osborne is no longer MP for Tatton in Cheshire means he'll have more time available, will be less dogged by controversy over his split loyalties, and will evade (some) censure for holding too many jobs. But he still has to prove his independence from government. To be seen as a Tory lackey would be fatal for his authority. So expect a major assault on the government's handling of Brexit, or perhaps the announcement of a new columnist from the Left. Jeremy Corbyn could be prime minister in a few weeks but if he isn't then, as a veteran London MP, perhaps he could be a candidate for the editor's favour? Goodness knows whether his prose is elegant, though. As I've argued several times now, it is very hard to see how Osborne can reconcile being in charge of the City pages with his work for BlackRock. Aside from the time commitment, if any of BlackRock's clients are in the news Osborne faces a choice: Even if he doesn't realise it. Is he covering them as an impartial, ferocious editor, prepared to stand up to the mighty? Or is the fact that he gets paid Â£650,000 for four days' work every month going to enter his mind, as his fingers hover over the keyboard and he formulates a headline?

Italian name row dredges up memories of fascism,"German place names persist on signs in South Tyrol - sitting next to the Italian versions imposed after Italy annexed the region nearly 100 years ago The names of thousands of streams, hills and meadows are causing a political row in Italy's mainly German-speaking province of South Tyrol. The roots of the dispute date back to the fascist era, after the region, once part of Austria, was annexed by Italy after World War One. In the corner of a cemetery near the town of Montagna (Montan in German) in the foothills of the Alps, is the tomb of a man known to some as the gravedigger of South Tyrol. Ettore Tolomei was a fervent Italian nationalist and fascist, who was determined to Italianise the traditionally German-speaking region. As well as making Italian the only official language in 1923, he invented and adapted around 8,000 Italian geographical place names to replace the German ones. Tolomei asked to be buried facing north, so that he could watch the last German-speaking South Tyrolean leave for Austria. That didn't happen. Ettore Tolomei invented many of the Italian names in South Tyrol After World War Two, German was reinstated as an official language along with Italian. Having bilingual place names for towns and cities is standard practice today in South Tyrol, but many of the names of hills, woods, fields and smaller mountains are still only official in Italian - even though they are situated in mainly German-speaking areas. From his garden in the village of Glen/Gleno near Tolomei's grave, Hansi Weissensteiner pointed at a neighbouring vineyard. ""In German, it's been called Planggn for hundreds of years and it should stay that way,"" he told me. ""But it's not official."" This beautiful vineyard is referred to by its German name, Planggn - but the name is not official Political parties have been unable to reach agreement on a settlement of the geographical place-name issue - and the row has inflamed old resentments between German and Italian speakers. Some groups, like the Suedtiroler Freiheit, a small opposition party seeking independence from Italy, want all the Tolomei names removed. ""Everything that fascism did with the aim of rewriting South Tyrolean history, with the aim of making South Tyrol Italian - which it never was - is a cultural crime and has no right to exist,"" Stefan Zelger from the Suedtiroler Freiheit told me. ""No more Tolomei names."" The governor of South Tyrol, Arno Kompatscher of the conservative South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP), agrees that what Tolomei did should be condemned. But his view is that ""life goes on"". He says none of the Italian names of towns and cities will be removed. But his party proposes getting rid of those Tolomei geographical names that are not commonly used. A decision will be taken by a commission of experts. South Tyrol in German is SÃ¼dtirol, in Italian it is Alto Adige Neumarkt is Egna; Auer is Ora Gschnon is Casignano; Glen is Gleno ""We say let's use the names that are really used by the people,"" says Mr Kompatscher. ""Of course we have to use some Italian names which were originally fascist inventions but are in the meantime just used as names of places by the Italian speaking people living here, maybe 1,000 or 2,000 names. The commission should decide. Our position is the only one ensuring we live in peace together."" In Obereggen, not even Italians use the official name of San Floriano But that proposal has upset some Italian speakers, concerned about German dominance in the province. Alessandro Urzi from the L'Alto Adige nel Cuore (Alto Adige in the heart) party says Italian place names should stay, and that it is wrong to link the modern Italian community to fascism. ""How can a local ethic majority like the German one cancel part of the identity of the Italian minority here? And in what other part of the world would it be possible to outlaw the language of the state?"" he says. Francesco Palermo, a cross-party member of the Italian Senate, says a compromise solution has to be negotiated - for both languages. At the ski-resort of Obereggen in the Dolomites near Bolzano, it was hard to find anyone who knew its Italian name of San Floriano. ""No-one calls it that, not even the Italians,"" says Barbara Varesco, a journalist at the Dolomiten newspaper. Overlooking the vineyards and mountains near his residence in Glen/Gleno, Mr Weissensteiner shrugs philosophically. ""We are South Tyrolean, with German as our mother tongue - and Italian citizens. You can't turn the clock back one or two hundred years. Four generations here have grown up bilingual. ""We should keep our German language. But you can't send the Italians away. That's impossible. ""We respect the Italians. So many people have a German mother and an Italian father or vice versa. This has always been a mixed border region.""

Athletics world records 'to be rewritten',"This video can not be played Radcliffe criticises plans to wipe records All athletics world records set before 2005 could be rewritten under a ""revolutionary"" new proposal from European Athletics. The credibility of records was examined following the sport'sdoping scandal. Britain's Paula Radcliffe, who faces losing her 2003 marathon world record, called the proposals ""cowardly"". ""I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity,"" she said, adding that the governing bodies had""again failed clean athletes"".,external Svein Arne Hansen, the European Athletics president, said world records ""are meaningless if people don't really believe them"". However, Radcliffe said the changes were ""heavy handed"" and ""confusing to the public"". European Athleticsset up a taskforceto look into the credibility of world records in January. Its ruling council has now ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce, and it wants the sport's world governing body, the IAAF, to adopt the changes it sets out. This video can not be played Desperate times call for desperate measures - Euro taskforce chief If the proposals are accepted by the IAAF, a world record would only be recognised if it meets all three of the following criteria: It was achieved at a competition on a list of approved international events where the highest standards of officiating and technical equipment can be guaranteed; The athlete had been subject to an agreed number of doping control tests in the months leading up to it; The doping control sample taken after the record was stored and available for re-testing for 10 years. The IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an ""all-time list"", but not be officially recognised as records. This would include Jonathan Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m - set in 1995 - and Colin Jackson's 1994 indoor 60m hurdles world record of 7.30secs, as well as Radcliffe's marathon mark of two hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds, set in 2003 using two male pacemakers. Mary Keitany of Kenya broke Radcliffe's women's-only world record to win the 2017 London Marathon in two hours 17 minutes one second, the second-fastest time in history. The council also recommended that a performance should be wiped from record books if the athlete had committed a ""doping or integrity violation, even if it does not directly impact the record performance"". The proposals are a response to last year's McLaren report, which uncovered widespread doping in sport - and athletics in particular. Russian athletes are currently banned from international competition unless they can satisfy strict criteria to show they are clean. More than 100 Olympic athletes who competed at the 2008 and 2012 Games have been sanctioned for doping after the International Olympic Committee embarked on a programme of retesting old samples. ""There are records in which people in the sport, the media and the public do not have complete confidence,""added taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan.,external Colin Jackson, who held the 110m hurdles record for 10 years, set the record for the 60m indoor hurdles in 1994 IAAF president Lord Coe said the changes were ""a step in the right direction"". ""There will be athletes, current record holders, who will feel that the history we are recalibrating will take something away from them, but if organised and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area,"" he said. European Athletics president Hansen said he would encourage the IAAF to adopt the proposal at its August council meeting. ""What we are proposing is revolutionary and not just because most world and European records will have to be replaced,"" Hansen added. ""We want to raise the standards for recognition to a point where everyone can be confident that everything is fair and above board."" Former decathlete Daley Thompson was disappointed by the news Radcliffe haspreviously criticised plans,externalto wipe records from the books and last month told BBC Sport she favouredmaking doping a criminal offenceinstead to deter cheats. She issued a statement on Monday criticising the new proposals and athletics governing bodies. ""I worked extremely hard for my PBs and they will always be valid to me. I know they were set through hard work and best effort and abiding by all the rules and am proud of them,""Radcliffe wrote.,external ""Governing bodies have a duty to protect every clean athlete, here they again fail those athletes. We had to compete against cheats, they couldn't provide us a level playing field, we lost out on medals, moments and earnings due to cheats, saw our sport dragged through the mud due to cheats and now, thanks to those who cheat we potentially lose our World and Area records. ""Although we are moving forward I don't believe we are yet at the point where we have a testing procedure capable of catching every cheat out there, so why reset at this point? Do we really believe a record set in 2015 is totally clean and one in 1995 not? ""I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity. It is a heavy handed way to wipe out some really suspicious records in a cowardly way by simply sweeping all aside instead of having the guts to take the legal plunge and wipe any record that would be found in a court of law to have been illegally assisted. ""It is confusing to the public at a time when athletics already struggles to market itself. How do they explain how stadium, club and national records are better than the Area or World marks or will they force all those to be to wiped out too?""
