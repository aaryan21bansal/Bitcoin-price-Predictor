Truss backs Britons who want to fight for Ukraine,"This video can not be played Watch: The foreign secretary supports Britons who want to fight in Ukraine Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she supports individuals from the UK who might want to go to Ukraine to join an international force to fight. She told the BBC it was up to people to make their own decisions, but argued it was a battle ""for democracy"". She said Ukrainians were fighting for freedom, ""not just for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe"". Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged foreign nationals ""to join the defence of security in Europe"". Earlier on Sunday, he said Ukraine was setting up an ""international"" legion of volunteers for foreigners wishing to join the Ukrainian army in its fight against Russian forces. ""This is not just Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this is the beginning of a war against Europe. Against European unity,"" Mr Zelensky was quoted as saying on his official website. ""Everyone who wants to join the defence of security in Europe and the world may come and stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians against the invaders of the 21st Century."" The UK government has stressed thatBritish troops will not be sent to fighton the ground. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Ukraine would instead be supported to ""fight every street with every piece of equipment we can get to them"". Ukrainian forces say they haverepelled an attack on the country's second city Kharkivafter fierce clashes with Russian forces. Regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said the city was now rid of Russian troops after street-to-street fighting overnight. Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko said an ""overwhelming"" number of foreign nationals were ""demanding to be allowed to fight"" for Ukraine - as the Russian invasion reaches its fourth day. Ukraine has said it will arm all volunteers. by Vitaliy Shevchenko, in Folkestone, Kent As missiles rain down on Ukrainian cities and Russian tanks are pouring in, Ukrainians in London are giving up their jobs to return home and fight for their country. I spent Saturday with some of them. I met Viktor, Oleh, and Yevhen - who asked to be identified with just their first names - as they drove to the seaside town of Folkestone in Kent, which has become the unlikely hub for Ukrainians returning home to fight. The reason is a local military surplus store with a sympathetic owner. ""The West hasn't done enough to help Ukraine, so I'm more than happy to,"" the owner, who calls himself Wozzer, told me. His discounts were good, and some of his kit - such as boots - was free to take. The place was swarming with Ukrainians, their sense of purpose palpable. As Viktor stocked up on basic supplies like flak jackets, helmets and tourniquets, I asked him what made him think of going back to face Russia's overwhelming military force. ""When I saw what Russia was doing to our country, I simply realised that it was my duty,"" he said. After Viktor and his friends loaded up their van, they were keen to have a quick look at the sea. As they were sipping coffees and chatting cheerfully on the promenade, you would never believe they were going into battle. But what they will face in a few days - after a long drive in their van across Europe - is very different from the peaceful seaside in Kent. Asked on BBC One's Sunday Morning programme if she would support individuals from Britain going over to Ukraine to help in the fight, Ms Truss said: ""I do support that, and of course that is something that people can make their own decisions about. ""The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy not just for Ukraine, but for whole of Europe because that's what President Putin is challenging."" A Ukrainian soldier observes smoke rising from a petrol storage depot near Kyiv which was hit by a Russian missile She said the UK government was ""doing all it can"" to support Ukraine with defensive weapons on the ground and with ""far more severe sanctions"" against Russia, to stop Putin from funding his ""war machine"". ""We are seeing a huge united effort, across the G7, across our allies, to challenge Vladimir Putin,"" she said. ""Because this is Putin's war. This is pre-fabricated, pre-ordained aggression to try and subvert a sovereign democracy. ""We simply cannot allow him to succeed."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? ZELENSKY:Comedian president rises to the moment DNIPRO:Terrified residents jolt into action PHOTOS:Ordinary lives turned upside down The foreign secretary said she feared the invasion of Ukraine would be a ""bloody and long-running conflict"" - with consequences felt far beyond Ukraine itself. She said the UK ""will need to do more [and] spend more"" - citing the unprecedented sanctions announced by the government earlier this week, and Saturday's decision by the EU, US and their alliesto cut off a number of Russian banks from the main international payment system, Swift. ""The aim is to degrade the Russian economy - to stop the money Putin has used to fund his war machine,"" she said. She said the UK government had compiled a ""hit list"" of Russian billionaires and said there would be a ""rolling programme of sanctions"" against individual oligarchs. ""We will be targeting oligarchs' private jets, we will be targeting their properties, we will be targeting other possessions that they have - and there will be nowhere to hide,"" said Ms Truss. But Labour's David Lammy called on the government to name those on its hit list - and questioned why there were some being sanctioned by the US but not the UK. Mr Lammy also told the BBC the Russian insurance industry should  be targeted by sanctions. Ukrainian forces secured control of Kharkiv on Sunday afternoon after hours of fighting Ms Truss acknowledged that there was likely to be an ""economic cost"" to the UK ""in terms of access to oil and gas markets"" - anda likely rise in the cost of living, with the conflict expected to drive energy and fuel prices even higher. The foreign secretary warned of ""dire consequences"" if the conflict was allowed to escalate. ""I firmly believe that the British public understand the price we will pay if we don't stand up to Putin now"". She told Sky's Trevor Philips the UK and allies needed to be prepared for Russia to use chemical or nuclear warfare, if President Putin's invasion plan looked as if it was failing, adding: ""We need to avoid this at all costs."" It comes asPresident Putin ordered his military commandto put nuclear forces on a ""special"" state of alert in an effort. Speaking on Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised Ukrainians for ""fighting heroically"" and with ""great success"" in some places, but said more had to be done to ""change the heavy odds that Ukraine faces"" from the Russian invasion. A Ukrainian government official said more than 210 Ukrainian civilians had been killed so far and more than 1,100 wounded in Russia's invasion. The number of people fleeing Ukraine has now reached 368,000, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. What questions do you have about the Russian invasion of Ukraine?

How badly will Russia be hit by new sanctions?,"Excluding Russian banks from Swift and the Russian central bank from international operations has, up until now, been considered a last resort. Shutting it out of Swift, the international payment system, creates potentially substantial collateral damage for companies and financial institutions owed money - either now or in longer term financial contracts - by Russian counterparties. What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant? In 2018, America managed to force Swift to ditch Iranian banks but even that was a far smaller economy and was opposed at the time by most European governments. Germany is particularly sensitive as it has relies on Russia for two thirds of its gas supply. It also feels it has already ""taken one for the team"" by suspendingthe certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, built to transport gas from Russia to Germany. Authorities in US, Europe and the UK appear to have agreed a way to minimise these vulnerabilities by excluding the banks least involved in energy transactions or finding a way of filtering transactions to allow through energy and food payments. The details of how they will do this have not been disclosed. Although it would be very disruptive to Russia, there is an alternative system called SPFS - or System for Transfer of Financial Messages - that Russia set up after Crimea in 2014. China also has a secondary system called the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System or CIPS. Many have thought that expelling Russia might push it closer to China and play into the hands of a Xi administration keen to undermine the dominance of the global US dollar-based financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and/or ambition. Having said that, one banking contact told me that China might be unwilling at this stage to help Russia given its import-export relationship with the rest of the world is enormous - unlike Russia's. Perhaps even more damaging to Russia than shutting it out of Swift  is a move to isolate Russia's central bank. Preventing it from using its $630bn international dollar reserves to support the rouble could see its value collapse with dire consequences for the Russian economy. What seems clear is that the UK government has acknowledged it can no longer be seen to be soft pedalling on its approach to Russian financial interests in the UK. The government recently turned down an application to build an electricity pipeline between Northern France and the UK on the basis that other alternatives had not been fully explored but sources close to the process told the BBC that the escalating situation in Ukraine had a bearing on the decision given the project was backed by one Ukrainian and one Russian born backer. This decision is nowthe subject of a legal challenge. HMRC is also being encouraged to make the most of its powers to seize assets of individuals which fail Unexplained Wealth Orders. Roman Abramovich's decision to transfer ""stewardship"" of Chelsea FC to a charitable foundation is more symbolic than legally significant but it shows he understands which way the wind is now blowing in the UK. This story was updated on 15 March to add that there has been a legal challenge to the government's decision to turn down an application to build an electricity pipeline.

Day four of Russia's war in Ukraine explained,"This video can not be played Watch: ''People have swapped their pens and keyboards for guns'' The EU is taking the unprecedented step of sending arms to Ukraine following Russia's invasion. Speaking at a news conference, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the move marked a ""watershed moment"". The EU is also closing its airspace to Russian planes and will ban Russian state media outlets. ""We are shutting down EU airspace for Russian-owned, Russian-registered or Russian-controlled aircraft,"" Ms von der Leyen said. All such planes, including the private jets of oligarchs, will now be unable to land in, take off from or fly over any EU nation. Russian planes have also been banned from UK airspace. The EU ban on state-owned news outlets will affect news agency Sputnik and the TV network Russia Today, widely seen as a mouthpiece for the Kremlin.""We are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe,"",externalMs von der Leyen said. EU shuts its airspace to Russian planes EU countries will also fast-track Ukrainian refugees and set aside the usual bureaucracy. The move was announced by the German interior minister, who said member states had agreed unanimously to admit refugees for up to three years without asking them to apply for asylum first. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians have been displaced by the Russian attack on their country and many are seeking refuge in the EU. Vladimir Putin has ordered Russia's military to put its deterrence forces, which include nuclear weapons, on ""special alert"". He told defence chiefs it was because of ""aggressive statements"" by the West, amid widespread condemnation of his invasion of Ukraine. The announcement does not mean Russia intends to use the weapons. The US immediately condemned his decision, calling it an ""unacceptable escalation"". Mr Putin described Western economic sanctions against his country as illegal Last week, Mr Putin had warned that ""whoever tries to hinder us"" in Ukraine would see consequences ""you have never seen in your history"". Those words were widely interpreted as signalling a threat to use nuclear weapons if the West stood in his way. Putin puts Russian nuclear forces on 'special alert' Ukrainian forces say they have repelled an attack on the country's second city, Kharkiv, after fierce clashes with Russian forces. Regional governor Oleh Synehubov said the city was now rid of Russian troops after street-to-street fighting. The BBC has not corroborated this, and the situation on the ground remains tense. This video can not be played WATCH: Ukrainian troops street fighting in Kharkiv Thousands spent the night in basements and shelters, with heavy shelling described by one resident as ""something like Star Wars above your head"". ""The wave of the blast was so strong that my ears popped,"" another said. Daria Samoilyk, who with others has been forced to hide in the basement of her apartment building, told the BBC she had barely slept for three days. ""It's maximum one, two hours a night. There's shooting all day long and all night long, without any pauses."" She said the fighting had left parts of the city badly damaged. ""I have lots of friends who lost their homes yesterday. ""I'm not sure if I feel safe, because a missile can fall anywhere and destroy any building. It's like roulette."" Kharkiv residents describe intense battle to defend city The war in Ukraine has prompted Germany to pledge a massive hike in defence spending, in a major change in policy. During an emergency parliamentary session on Ukraine on Sunday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced an additional $113bn (Â£84bn) for the German army. Berlin police estimate more than 100,000 people attended an anti-war demonstration in the German capital on Sunday There was an audible ripple of shock in parliament. Some MPs clapped, some booed, others looked stunned. Undeterred, Mr Scholz went on to announce drastic measures that would have been unthinkable a week ago, including a constitutional commitment to Nato's military spending target of 2% of GDP - and he confirmed that Germany would be sending weapons directly to Ukraine. Within a few days, Vladimir Putin has managed to do what Nato allies have spent years trying to achieve: a massive increase of military spending in Germany. Putin's war prompts dramatic German U-turn The full extent of casualties in Ukraine is very hard to confirm. The country's human rights commissioner says 210 civilians have been killed. The Ukrainian health ministry has said 352 civilians, including 14 children, have died so far. The United Nations has recorded 64 confirmed civilian deaths and many more wounded, and says it expects the true number to be much higher. Military deaths are also extremely hard to verify. The UN said by Saturday at least 134 Ukrainian military had been killed. Russia censors details of its casualties, and has not released figures. Its defence ministry conceded on Sunday that ""there have been killed and wounded among the Russian military"" - but claimed the losses were ""several times less than the number of exterminated nationalists"". Ukraine claims 4,300 Russian servicemen have so far died. Russia's central bank has issued an appeal for calm amid fears that new financial sanctions could spark a run on its banks. It said it ""has the necessary resources and tools to maintain financial stability and ensure the operational continuity of the financial sector"". The EU, the US, the UK and Canada have announced that the assets of Russia's central bank will be frozen. Some Russian banks will also be excluded from the Swift payment system. A run on Russian banks would see too many people trying to withdraw money. On Friday, Russia's central bank was forced to increase the amount of money it supplies to ATMs after demand for cash reached the highest level since March 2020.

Liverpool beat Chelsea on penalties to win Carabao Cup,"Kepa Arrizabalaga missed the decisive penalty for Chelsea Liverpool won a dramatic penalty shoot-out to secure the first domestic trophy of the season after a classic Carabao Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley. Kepa Arrizabalaga, brought on in the closing moments of extra time as a penalty specialist, missed the decisive spot-kick after a magnificent game came down to a shoot-out between Chelsea's keeper and his Liverpool counterpart Caoimhin Kelleher. Kelleher made it 11 penalties from 11 for Liverpool but Kepa blazed wildly over the top as a high-class showpiece was decided by the finest of margins after 21 successful attempts. Chelsea, who had three goals disallowed for offside, were left to rue two big misses by Mason Mount but they were also grateful for a magnificent display from keeper Edouard Mendy, who produced a string of outstanding saves. Liverpool created a host of chances and had a Joel Matip goal ruled out for a foul and offside in an incident-packed game that went right down to the wire before Jurgen Klopp's side prevailed, for a record ninth League Cup success. Carabao Cup final reaction This video can not be played Liverpool's cup final shootout win was 'spectacular' - Klopp Manager Jurgen Klopp made it clear as soon as Liverpool reached Wembley that Kelleher would retain his place as the Reds' goalkeeper in this competition ahead of first-choice Alisson. It was a decision laced with an element of risk but the 23-year-old repaid Klopp with a complete performance that included scoring Liverpool's 11th and final penalty. This was a small element of a remarkably assured performance that started with a crucial early save from Christian Pulisic and also saw him deny Chelsea a last-gasp win with a near-post block from Romelu Lukaku in the closing seconds of extra time. Kelleher was composed in every aspect of his game as he dominated his area and handled everything that came his way, confirming his growing reputation as a goalkeeper of high promise. Liverpool had to go all the way to win this trophy for the first time since 2012. Klopp was forced into a late reshuffle after a tearful Thiago Alcantara was injured in the warm-up, drafting in Naby Keita as a late replacement. Liverpool traded near misses with Chelsea as both teams refused to take a backward step and it was right that only penalties could separate the sides after an outstanding Wembley occasion. Mount will have a sleepless night after this EFL Cup final after missing two glorious chances either side of half-time that could have proved pivotal. He somehow steered wide with the goal at his mercy just before the interval then, with time and space to spare, struck a finish against the post with Kelleher badly exposed. On such small details this game was decided, although Chelsea will also look back on the most marginal of offside decisions that saw substitute Lukaku have a goal disallowed. Manager Thomas Tuchel took an understandable gamble when he sent on Kepa in the final moments in the hope he would live up to his reputation as a penalty expert but he could not stop 11 spot-kicks from Liverpool before sending his own effort horribly high into the celebrating supporters behind Kelleher's goal. Tuchel may wonder whether he should have kept the unbeatable Mendy on for penalties after his heroic performance but it is easy to be wise after the event and Kepa has proved his quality from penalties in the past. There can be no complaints about the quality and effort in Chelsea's performance other than the failure to take the chances that came their way. They demonstrated they belong in the Premier League's elite company alongside Liverpool and Manchester City and no-one would dismiss their chances of making amends for this disappointment by winning a different piece of silverware this season.

What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant?,"The European Commission has proposed excluding three more Russian banks from Swift, an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions. It comes after the EU and its allies suspended seven institutions from the system in March. The move aims to hit the country's banking network and its access to funds via Swift, which is pivotal for the smooth transaction of money worldwide. Swift is the global financial artery that allows the smooth and rapid transfer of money across borders. It stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Created in 1973 and based in Belgium, Swift links 11,000 banks and institutions in more than 200 countries. But Swift is not your traditional High Street bank. It is a sort of instant messaging system that informs users when payments have been sent and arrived. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? It sends more than 40 million messages a day, as trillions of dollars change hands between companies and governments. More than 1% of those messages were thought to involve Russian payments. In March, seven Russian banks were removed from Swift including Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB) and VTB Bank. The European Commission now wants to exclude a further three including the country's biggest lender, Sberbank, which accounts for more than a third of Russia's banking sector. The package still has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. The EU, US, UK and others have said that cutting banks out of Swift will ensure they ""are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally"". The aim is for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Banks now have to deal directly with one another, adding delays and extra costs, and ultimately cutting off revenues for the Russian government. Russia was threatened with a Swift expulsion before - in 2014 when it annexed Crimea. Russia said the move would be tantamount to a declaration of war. Western allies did not go ahead, but the threat did prompt Russia to develop its own, very fledgling, cross-border transfer system called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS) as an alternative to Swift. Few foreign countries currently use SPFS, but India is reportedly considering a Russian proposal to use it for payments in roubles. Separately, Moscow is working with Beijing to connect to China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) - another alternative to Swift which processes payments in Chinese yuan. Some nations - such as Germany, France and Italy - were initially reluctant to take action against Russia's use of Swift. There were concerns that companies owed money by Russia would have to find alternative ways to get paid. There were also fears it could impact the global banking system, although there is no evidence of this yet. Alexei Kudrin, Russia's former finance minister, has suggested being cut off from Swift could shrink Russia's economy by 5%. However, there are doubts about the lasting impact on Russia's economy, particularly if banks find sustainable ways to reroute payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions. Swift was created by American and European banks, which did not want a single institution developing their own system and having a monopoly. The network is now jointly-owned by more than 2,000 banks and financial institutions. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in partnership with major central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Swift helps make secure international trade possible for its members, and is not supposed to take sides in disputes. However, Iran was banned from Swift in 2012, as part of sanctions over its nuclear programme. It lost almost half of its oil export revenues and 30% of foreign trade. Swift says it has no influence over sanctions and any decision to impose them rests with governments.

Anger over Russian oil tanker due in Orkney,"The NS Champion is expected at Flotta oil terminal on Tuesday Russian ships could have their access to UK ports restricted, under plans being considered at Westminster. It follows concerns that a Russian-owned tanker is due at an Orkney oil terminal within days. Orkney Islands Council has said it is powerless to prevent the NS Champion accessing Flotta oil terminal, despite growing anger on the islands. The tanker is owned by Sovcomflot (SCF Group), a large shipping company majority-owned by the Russian state. It is due at Flotta to collect crude oil on Tuesday. The prime minister has been urged to take action to deny Russian-owned vessels access to all UK ports. A UK government spokesman said: ""We are aware of concerns about Russian-connected ships potentially docking in the UK and we are working rapidly to explore a range of measures to restrict access for them. ""We are already discussing this issue with the Scottish government and the sanctions being considered are part of a wider package being worked up across the UK government."" What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant? Russia has been subject to a series of increasingly severe sanctions since invading Ukraine, includinga ban on its planes in EU and UK airspace. Sovcomflot is also currentlysubject to US sanctions limiting its ability to raise money through the US markets,external. However Orkney Islands Council, which is responsible for the islands' ports and harbours, said it had been advised by the UK government that the tanker was not covered by current UK sanctions. ""As a council we are in an extremely difficult position,"" a spokesman said. ""We recognise the strength of feeling around this - feelings that we share -  but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK government tells us otherwise."" At an anti-war demonstration in Orkney on Saturday, locals voiced their anger about the oil tanker Angus Robertson,Â Scotland's cabinet secretary for external affairs, toldBBC Scotland's Sunday Show: ""The UK authorities have got a big decision to take, on whether we are going to allow Russian-owned or charted vessels to dock in UK ports. ""The Scottish government is in discussions with the UK authorities about this particular case but there will be others. ""This is a very fast moving situation and we're going to have to act decisively in my view."" At a protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Orkney on Saturday, demonstrators spoke of their anger over the Russian tanker plans. Nataliia Kuzmina's parents live in Ukraine Nataliia Kuzmina, a Ukrainian living in Orkney, said her parents will not leave Ukraine. Her 56-year-old father has volunteered to join the fight to defend his town - but they don't have any weapons. She said she was disgusted that the oil tanker was due to arrive in the islands. ""I feel that we have to do something about it,"" she added. ""This is a very real way for Orcadians to play their role in this whole situation and to show that they support Ukraine in this way. ""Every little thing matters now. Hundreds of people around Europe will do some small act like this, stopping buying Russian products, stopping tankers being filled up with oil. ""It matters and I feel it's my duty to turn away this tanker from Scapa Flow."" Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael has written to Boris Johnson urging him to take action. ""Like right thinking people across the United Kingdom, the people of Orkney have been sickened by what we have seen on our television screens of the Russian attack on Ukraine,"" he wrote. ""We expect you, as our prime minister, to act to stop this continued trade that is earning money to fund the slaughter of Ukrainian citizens."" He added: ""It is imperative... that you should act without delay to ensure that Sovcomflot is sanctioned and denied access for their vessels to British ports."" The NS Champion is due at the Flotta oil terminal on Tuesday Scapa Flow played a key role during World War Two, and it is where 835 men and boys drowned when theRoyal Oak was torpedoed by a German U-boat. Mr Carmichael said: ""To allow Sovcomflot to operate without let or hindrance in Scapa Flow would be to dishonour the memory of the sacrifice that the crew of the Royal Oak made in their fight against fascism of the sort that is currently engaged in attacking the people of Ukraine."" A spokeswoman for Repsol Sinopec, which operates the Flotta oil terminal said the NS Champion was due to arrive on Tuesday. ""We are liaising with regulatory authorities regarding the appropriate provision of access to facilities,"" she added. Sovcomflot has been approached for a comment.

Kharkiv residents describe intense battle to defend city,"This video can not be played WATCH: Ukrainian troops street fighting in Kharkiv Ukrainian forces say they have repelled an attack on the country's second city Kharkiv after fierce clashes with Russian forces. Regional governor Oleh Synehubov said the city was now rid of Russian troops - after street-to-street fighting. Thousands spent the night in basements and shelters, with intense shelling described by one resident as ""something like Star Wars above your head"". ""The wave of the blast was so strong that my ears popped,"" another said. A nine-storey residential tower was hit, emergency services said,killing an elderly woman,externalwhile about 60 people survived after hiding in the basement. Russian troops also blew up a natural gas pipeline nearby, according to a Ukrainian state communications agency. Live updates as Russian troops enter key Ukrainian city West to cut some Russian banks off from Swift Terrified but coping: A key city jolts into action Kharkiv residents who spoke to the BBC told of their fear and apprehension as the attack raged on, as well as their pride in Ukrainian forces and reservists in holding back Russian troops. Just before an explosion in the Saltivka district, one woman said her neighbour was instructing their young children on what to do in the event of a blast. ""Listening to this was horrific, my hairs were standing on end at the thought that three-year-old children were having to be taught what to do during shelling,"" she said. ""Throughout the night one young girl kept waking up her mum. She'd sit up crying screaming: 'Mom, I'm scared, please save me, save me now.' ""She only calmed down by  the morning after her mum had sat holding her all through the night."" The 34-year-old, who requested anonymity, added: ""Right now, the offensive against the city is still going on. I hear the blasts all the time - even though I know Kharkiv is controlled by Ukraine, 100%."" The Ukrainian military repelled Russian forces, with light vehicles destroyed in some parts of the city For university professor Dmitry Shabanov, the fighting came uncomfortably close. ""Tanks were fighting only a few kilometres from our home, and the operation to counter some saboteurs that entered Kharkiv was just next to our yard,"" he said. ""We are staying in our house with a cellar, it's my wife and me, two sons who are seven and 11 years old, and my 80-year-old mum. We keep the boys in the cellar most of the time,"" he added. Maria Avdeev, another resident, said groups of Russian troops were eliminated ""one by one"" by the Ukrainian military. ""Also, a number of Russian soldiers and officers were captured, so they did not basically fight back, when they saw that they had no other option,"" she said. Oleksii Svid, 30, managed to travel to buy food for his family and his pets, Kuzya the cat and Larry the dog, on Saturday but found supplies were running low. Nonetheless, he said many local people remained resilient - with talk about how to prevent Russian troops from entering the city and ways to help the Ukrainian army. ""The main issue right now it to gain access to the food, as most shops don't have a way to refill stock of sugar, flour, dairy, and meat,"" he said. ""There's also a shortage of fuel in gas stations in the city."" The BBC has verified a video on the Telegram messaging platformwhich shows Russian trucks,externaldriving into Kharkiv early on Sunday. Another video verified by the BBC showed a group of Ukrainian soldiers taking cover behind a wall, while one launched a shoulder-fired missile. In the north-eastern city of Okhtyrka, 100km (60 miles) from Kharkiv, the local governor said at least six Ukrainians - including a seven-year-old girl - had died as a result of a Russian attack on Friday. A kindergarten and an orphanage were among the buildings reportedly hit, which Russia has denied. The full extent of casualties in Ukraine is very hard to confirm. The country's human rights commissioner says 210 civilians have been killed. So far the United Nations has recorded 64 confirmed civilian deaths and many more wounded, and says it expects the true number to be much higher. Military deaths are also very hard to verify. The UN said by Saturday at least 134 Ukrainian military had been killed. Russia conceded on Sunday that it has suffered losses, but has not released a figure. Ukraine says 4,300 Russian servicemen have so far died.

Ericsson strategy got workers kidnapped by IS,"IS militants seized control of Mosul in June 2014 before advancing across northern Iraq The telecoms company Ericsson put contractors' lives at risk by insisting they continued working in territory controlled by the Islamic State [IS] group in Iraq, according to a leaked Ericsson report seen by BBC News Arabic. This resulted in them being kidnapped by IS militants, the report finds. Ericsson is one of the world's biggest telecoms companies and a key player in the rollout of 5G networks in the UK, having replaced Chinese telecoms firm Huawei after security concerns. The latest revelations followlast week's admission by Ercisson Chief executive Borje Ekholm- in response to the leaked document - that money had been paid by the company to access quicker transport routes in Iraq at the time, and that IS may have been the recipients. More than $5bn was wiped from Ericsson's market value after Mr Ekholm's comments. The document, obtained by the International Consortium of International Journalists [ICIJ] and shared with the BBC and 29 other media partners, is from a 2019 internal investigation into corrupt activities and bribery in 10 countries. The most serious findings centred on its operations in Iraq. When IS seized Iraq's second-city, Mosul, in June 2014, a senior Ericsson lawyer recommended shutting down the company's operation in Iraq, but senior managers ignored this, the report found. They felt such an action was ""premature"", and would ""destroy"" Ericsson's business in the country, the document says. Its insistence that the company's contractors continued to work in IS-held territory put lives at risk because the militant group then took a number of contractors hostage, the report found. Affan was among a group of engineers doing fieldwork for Ericsson at the time IS took over the city. He was sent with a letter on behalf of the company seeking permission from the terror group for them to continue working there. But as soon as he arrived, they were met by a pick-up truck full of gunmen who seized him, he told German public broadcaster NDR, another of ICIJ's media partners. Then an IS fighter used his phone to call Ericsson managers and demanded the company pay $2.4m to work in the area, he says. ""He [the IS member]  said that if you [Ericsson] do not pay, this person you sent and everyone else who works for you will be hunted down by us, we will bring them here. One by one"". Affan was placed under house arrest and says an Ericsson manager then stopped answering his calls. ""He abandoned me, he turned off the phone and disappeared."" The BBC and ICIJ contacted the Ericsson managers - one of whom still works with the company - who received the call from IS, but they refused to comment. Affan, who is named in the Ericsson report, was released after a month. While Affan maintains he was abandoned by Ericsson, the report says that one of the company's partners ""made arrangements"" with IS to secure his release and let the company continue its work in Mosul. The report doesn't identify what those arrangements were. This wasn't Ericsson's only possible interaction with IS. The company's transport contractor used a fast route through the country called the ""Speedway"" which avoided government checkpoints but passed through IS territory, the report found. Ericsson investigators said they found evidence of likely bribe payments to militants along this route. One senior government telecoms official in Mosul who doesn't want to be named for fear of losing his job told the ICIJ: ""Ericsson knew well what was going on. There is not a sane person who would deal directly with IS, they all do it through the subcontractors. Militants would take a percentage from every cent paid in Mosul on any project or work. This is how they accumulated millions."" The internal Ericsson document reveals a widespread culture of corrupt activities and paying bribes totalling millions of dollars in 10 separate countries. The corruption extended to a slush fund for Lebanese officials over a number of years totalling nearly $1m alongside gifts such as a $50,000 luxury trip to Stockholm for the former Lebanese Minister of Telecoms, Boutros Harb. Mr Harb told the BBC he had gone on a three-day business trip to Sweden paid for by Ericsson. But he hasn't received any gifts or benefits. He added that he was unaware of any internal investigation by Ericsson. Investigators also uncovered a $50,000 payment to a charity connected to the billionaire Barzani family, who rule the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan and own the mobile phone network Korek. The report couldn't establish where the money went. A spokesman for the Sirwan Barzani didnt respond to our specific questions but said ""Sirwan Barzani looks forward to the day when Daesh (IS) no longer pose a threat and he and his fellow Peshmerga can spend more time with their families."" In 2019, Ericsson reached a $1bn settlement with the US authorities following allegations of widespread corruption in five countries. Ericsson has not clarified whether the new revelations were disclosed to the US Department of Justice at the time of the settlement. The Department of Justice declined to comment on the Ericsson case. Ericsson did not respond to the BBC's specific questions but said it is continuing to work with external counsel - to review the findings and remediation resulting from the 2019 investigation to identify any additional measures that the company should take.

Russia central bank urges calm amid cash run fears,"Customers of Russia's Sberbank last week queued outside a branch in Prague to withdraw their money Russia's central bank has issued an appeal for calm amid fears that new financial sanctions could spark a run on its banks. It said it ""has the necessary resources and tools to maintain financial stability and ensure the operational continuity of the financial sector"". The EU, the US, the UK and Canada have announced that the assets of Russia's central bank will be frozen. Some Russian banks will also be excluded from the Swift payment system. A run on Russian banks would see too many people trying to withdraw money. On Friday, Russia's central bank was forced to increase the amount of money it supplies to ATMs after demand for cash reached the highest level since March 2020. Russia's central bank has reserves of around $630bn (Â£470bn). The aim of sanctions against the Bank of Russia would stop it from selling assets overseas to support its own banks and companies. Announcing the measures, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said: ""The European Union and its partners are working to cripple Putin's ability to finance his war machine."" Market analysts predict that on Monday the value of the rouble will drop and Russians may rush to remove their money from banks. ""These new sanctions are likely to cause serious damage to the Russian economy and its banking system"", said Clay Lowery, executive vice president at the Institute of International Finance. ""This will most likely exacerbate ongoing bank runs... causing a sharp sell-off and a drain on reserves."" But on Sunday, the Bank of Russia insisted: ""The Russian banking system is stable, has sufficient capital and liquidity to function smoothly in any situation. All customer funds on the accounts are saved and available at any time."" It also said that it will use its own network, called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (STFS) , for payments within Russia. On Saturday, leaders from the EU, the UK, the US and Canada announced that some Russian banks will be excluded from Swift, an international payment system that is used by thousands of financial institutions across the world, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The system is key for the smooth transactions of money globally. Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at financial consultancy Corpay, said: ""With newly announced sanctions likely to cripple the Russian economy and diminish the attractiveness of anything that can be traced back to Moscow, investors will abandon ship en masse. ""And with the central bank likely to face severe constraints on currency intervention, the rouble will struggle to find a bottom. No-one wants to catch a falling knife."" Prior to the most recent measures, Western states had announced sanctions against Russian banks and some individuals. Russia's central bank said that customers of sanctioned banks would be unable to use their bank cards outside Russia. It also said it will be ""impossible"" to use cards issued by sanctioned banks for Google Pay or Apple Pay. Last week, customers of Sberbank, the Russian state-owned bank, queued outside a branch in Prague to withdraw their money after it was named as one of a number of lenders to face sanctions. Sberbank temporarily closed its branches in the Czech Republic, citing security concerns for its staff. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

Liverpool beat Chelsea on penalties to win Carabao CupLiverpool beat Chelsea 11-10 on penalties to win the Carabao Cup after a breathless final ended in a goalless draw at Wembley.,"Kepa Arrizabalaga missed the decisive penalty for Chelsea Liverpool won a dramatic penalty shoot-out to secure the first domestic trophy of the season after a classic Carabao Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley. Kepa Arrizabalaga, brought on in the closing moments of extra time as a penalty specialist, missed the decisive spot-kick after a magnificent game came down to a shoot-out between Chelsea's keeper and his Liverpool counterpart Caoimhin Kelleher. Kelleher made it 11 penalties from 11 for Liverpool but Kepa blazed wildly over the top as a high-class showpiece was decided by the finest of margins after 21 successful attempts. Chelsea, who had three goals disallowed for offside, were left to rue two big misses by Mason Mount but they were also grateful for a magnificent display from keeper Edouard Mendy, who produced a string of outstanding saves. Liverpool created a host of chances and had a Joel Matip goal ruled out for a foul and offside in an incident-packed game that went right down to the wire before Jurgen Klopp's side prevailed, for a record ninth League Cup success. Carabao Cup final reaction This video can not be played Liverpool's cup final shootout win was 'spectacular' - Klopp Manager Jurgen Klopp made it clear as soon as Liverpool reached Wembley that Kelleher would retain his place as the Reds' goalkeeper in this competition ahead of first-choice Alisson. It was a decision laced with an element of risk but the 23-year-old repaid Klopp with a complete performance that included scoring Liverpool's 11th and final penalty. This was a small element of a remarkably assured performance that started with a crucial early save from Christian Pulisic and also saw him deny Chelsea a last-gasp win with a near-post block from Romelu Lukaku in the closing seconds of extra time. Kelleher was composed in every aspect of his game as he dominated his area and handled everything that came his way, confirming his growing reputation as a goalkeeper of high promise. Liverpool had to go all the way to win this trophy for the first time since 2012. Klopp was forced into a late reshuffle after a tearful Thiago Alcantara was injured in the warm-up, drafting in Naby Keita as a late replacement. Liverpool traded near misses with Chelsea as both teams refused to take a backward step and it was right that only penalties could separate the sides after an outstanding Wembley occasion. Mount will have a sleepless night after this EFL Cup final after missing two glorious chances either side of half-time that could have proved pivotal. He somehow steered wide with the goal at his mercy just before the interval then, with time and space to spare, struck a finish against the post with Kelleher badly exposed. On such small details this game was decided, although Chelsea will also look back on the most marginal of offside decisions that saw substitute Lukaku have a goal disallowed. Manager Thomas Tuchel took an understandable gamble when he sent on Kepa in the final moments in the hope he would live up to his reputation as a penalty expert but he could not stop 11 spot-kicks from Liverpool before sending his own effort horribly high into the celebrating supporters behind Kelleher's goal. Tuchel may wonder whether he should have kept the unbeatable Mendy on for penalties after his heroic performance but it is easy to be wise after the event and Kepa has proved his quality from penalties in the past. There can be no complaints about the quality and effort in Chelsea's performance other than the failure to take the chances that came their way. They demonstrated they belong in the Premier League's elite company alongside Liverpool and Manchester City and no-one would dismiss their chances of making amends for this disappointment by winning a different piece of silverware this season.

Terrified but coping: A key city jolts into action,"This video can not be played Watch: The Ukrainian women hand-making Molotov cocktails On the day Vladimir Putin ordered his soldiers into Ukraine, Arina had planned a dance class after work and then a party. Three days later, the English teacher was making Molotov cocktails in a park. I found her crouching on the grass with dozens of other women, grating polystyrene chunks as if they were cheese and ripping sheets into rags for homemade bottle-bombs. Such scenes are unimaginable to most in Europe. They were unthinkable here too, once. But Dnipro is now preparing to defend itself against advancing Russian troops. ""No-one thought this is how we'd spend our weekend, but it seems like the only important thing to do now,"" Arina told me, the young teacher's face and hair sprinkled in white dust from the polystyrene. ""It's pretty terrifying. I think we don't really realise what it is we're doing; we just need to be doing something,"" she said. A few metres away, Elena and Yulia told me they'd left their children with grandparents in order to come and help make these weapons. ""Sitting home doing nothing would be even scarier,"" Elena said, not pausing her grating even for a second. She laughs that she's a good cook and this process is not so different. ""I can't believe this is happening to us, but what choice do we have? No-one consulted us on anything,"" Elena said. English teacher Arina is now spending her weekend making Molotov cocktails in a park It feels like this whole city has been jolted into action. The steps of a nearby hall are heaped with donated clothes, blankets and buckwheat. A stream of people keep arriving with more - including petrol, water and toiletries - as volunteers yell instructions on where to take it all. The supplies are for Ukrainian fighters, as well as anyone forced to flee to Dnipro from fighting elsewhere. But it's also a stockpile for if the strategic city comes under siege itself. The giant effort was launched by five women and a handful of social media posts. Now, dozens of people are coordinating a major aid effort that looks chaotic but is anything of the sort. There's a whole separate area for those who want to get a weapon and sign up to fight; that queue stretches far off into the distance. ""The official organisations couldn't cope, so we created this centre,"" Katerina Leonova told me, her phone unglued from her ear for a brief moment. ""Does [Putin] really believe he can take over Ukraine, and make Russia out of Ukraine? We are not scared here. We are angry,"" she said. Donations for the city's war effort - including petrol, water and toiletries - and the volunteers who are coordinating it all Dnipro has already felt the cost of this war. All 400 beds at the military hospital are full and staff are now receiving hundreds of casualties every day. They've set up camp beds in the corridors to cope with the influx. ""We're at a peak, I think. There's fighting on all sides of us,"" hospital spokesman Sergei Bachinsky told me, his voice quietly urgent. ""Before, we used to know exactly where the clashes were taking place and could prepare to receive the injured even before they were evacuated to us. Now, the flow is constant."" The military can't use helicopters - Russian forces will shoot them down. By road, it takes much longer to reach urgent care. But Sergei insisted that morale was high, even among the injured. ""Even men with burns or concussion want to go back to their units to carry on the fight,"" he said. As we spoke, two buses pulled out of the hospital gates full of soldiers. The walking wounded were being transferred to facilities elsewhere in Ukraine, freeing up beds closer to the front lines. There's no shortage of supplies for them. People bring bags of medicines, syringes and bandages to the hospital, non-stop. I saw one man handing over an old set of crutches. Nothing was refused. Dnipro is coping.

Putin puts Russian nuclear forces on 'special alert',"Mr Putin described Western economic sanctions against his country as illegal Vladimir Putin has ordered Russia's military to put its deterrence forces, which include nuclear weapons, on ""special alert"". He told defence chiefs it was because of ""aggressive statements"" by the West, amid widespread condemnation of his invasion of Ukraine. The announcement does not mean Russia intends to use the weapons. The US immediately condemned his decision, calling it an ""unacceptable escalation"". Last week, Mr Putin had warned that ""whoever tries to hinder us"" in Ukraine would see consequences ""you have never seen in your history"". ANALYSIS: Would Putin press the nuclear button? Those words were widely interpreted as signalling a threat to use nuclear weapons if the West stood in his way. That warning became sharper on Sunday when he ordered the Russian defence minister and the chief of the military's general staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces on a ""special regime of combat duty"". This video can not be played Watch Russian police carry an anti-war protester into a vehicle parked on the streets of St Petersburg The US permanent representative to the United Nations said Mr Putin's nuclear deterrent order showed he was escalating the Ukraine conflict in an unacceptable manner, while the White House said Russia had not been under threat from Nato at any point. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC on Mondaythat the heightened alert was an attempt by the Kremlin to remind the world that it had a nuclear deterrent and to distract from what was going wrong on the ground in Ukraine. ""We will not do anything to escalate in that area... but at the moment this is a battle of rhetoric that President Putin is deploying,"" he said. Mr Wallace added that Mr Putin knew that ""anything involving a nuclear weapon has a greater or equal response from the West"". The very public shift to high alert status is a way for Moscow to send a warning. Moving to alert status likely makes it easier to launch weapons more quickly. But it does not mean there is a current intent to use them. Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world but also knows that Nato has enough to destroy Russia if they were used. But Vladimir Putin's aim is likely to try to deter Nato support for Ukraine by creating fears over how far he is willing to go - and creating ambiguity over what kind of support for Ukraine he would consider to be too much. After Mr Putin's announcement, the EU announced an unprecedented new raft of sanctions and actions against Russia, including The financing of weapons for Ukraine A total ban on Russian planes using EU airspace Barring state media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today from EU territory. Also on Sunday, the government of Belarus said a referendum had approved constitutional changes that would allow Russian forces and nuclear weapons to be stationed in the country. Western powers have accused Belarus of supporting and facilitating its ally's invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops have crossed its southern border to attack Kyivand Ukrainian officials have said that Russia is launching ballistic missiles towards Ukraine from Belarusian territory. US media have cited senior US officials as saying that Belarus is expected to send troops into Ukraine as soon as Monday. ""It's very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin,""one official told the Washington Post,external. President Alexander Lukashenko denied last week that Belarusian troops were involved in the Russian operation, but he also said that they could take part ""if necessary"".

What happened on day three?,"This video can not be played Watch: The Ukrainian women hand-making Molotov cocktails The Ukrainian capital Kyiv has been under Russian missile fire, but remains in the hands of the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Zelensky says Ukrainians had been fighting Russian troops in Kyiv, as well as Odesa in the south and Kharkiv in the north-east. ""The occupiers wanted to block the centre of our state,"" the president said. ""We broke their plan."" As Russians close in, though, Kyiv residents have been asked to stay indoors until Monday morning. The invasion has killed at least 198 Ukrainians so far and the UN says more than 120,000 have fled the country in the past 48 hours. Ukraine said 137 people - civilians and soldiers - have been killed, while Russia has not admitted any deaths on its side. New financial sanctions have been levelled against Russia - the most severe so far - after the EU, US and their allies agreed to cut off a number of Russian banks from the main international payment system, Swift. Russia is heavily reliant on the Swift system for its oil and gas exports, and analysts say its economy will be hit hard. The assets of Russia's central bank will also be frozen, limiting the Kremlin's ability to access its overseas reserves. This will stop it using its currency to limit the impact of sanctions. The measures will ""further isolate Russia from the international financial system"", a joint statement said. West to cut some Russian banks off from Swift Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich says he is ""giving trustees of Chelsea's charitable foundation the stewardship and care"" of the club. Mr Abramovich is one of Russia's richest people and believed to be close to President Vladimir Putin - who is facing personal sanctions by a number of Western countries over the invasion. Abramovich has owned Chelsea since 2003 It is not known yet if Abramovich might be sanctioned as part of the UK government's measures against Russia. Abramovich hands over Chelsea 'stewardship' France intercepted and impounded a Russian-flagged cargo ship suspected of breaching sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine. The ship, the Baltic Leader, was heading from the north-western French city of Rouen to St Petersburg in Russia with a cargo of new cars. The US Treasury Department has issued blocking sanctions against the vessel, saying it is owned by a subsidiary of Promsvyazbank, one of the Russian financial institutions hit by sanctions. France seizes Russian ship over Ukraine sanctions We saw men, in jeans and trainers, taking up position: the luxury of camouflage protection not possible in this moment of crisis.  Makeshift roadblocks had been assembled. A tractor and a delivery truck had parked at strategic angles to block the path of any incoming attacker. In other cities, steelworkers are reported to have welded new obstructions into place: forging their own defences. And workers in a sewing factory who normally stitch uniforms have been making sandbags. Across the country, patriotic Ukrainians are weaving their own narrative and hoping their collective effort will count for something in the face of Moscow's military might. The urgency of all this tells you many fear it is a question of when - not if - they'll be face-to-face with the advancing Russian forces.

What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant?Some Russian banks will be banned from the Swift financial network but what impact will this have?,"The European Commission has proposed excluding three more Russian banks from Swift, an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions. It comes after the EU and its allies suspended seven institutions from the system in March. The move aims to hit the country's banking network and its access to funds via Swift, which is pivotal for the smooth transaction of money worldwide. Swift is the global financial artery that allows the smooth and rapid transfer of money across borders. It stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Created in 1973 and based in Belgium, Swift links 11,000 banks and institutions in more than 200 countries. But Swift is not your traditional High Street bank. It is a sort of instant messaging system that informs users when payments have been sent and arrived. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? It sends more than 40 million messages a day, as trillions of dollars change hands between companies and governments. More than 1% of those messages were thought to involve Russian payments. In March, seven Russian banks were removed from Swift including Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB) and VTB Bank. The European Commission now wants to exclude a further three including the country's biggest lender, Sberbank, which accounts for more than a third of Russia's banking sector. The package still has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. The EU, US, UK and others have said that cutting banks out of Swift will ensure they ""are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally"". The aim is for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Banks now have to deal directly with one another, adding delays and extra costs, and ultimately cutting off revenues for the Russian government. Russia was threatened with a Swift expulsion before - in 2014 when it annexed Crimea. Russia said the move would be tantamount to a declaration of war. Western allies did not go ahead, but the threat did prompt Russia to develop its own, very fledgling, cross-border transfer system called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS) as an alternative to Swift. Few foreign countries currently use SPFS, but India is reportedly considering a Russian proposal to use it for payments in roubles. Separately, Moscow is working with Beijing to connect to China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) - another alternative to Swift which processes payments in Chinese yuan. Some nations - such as Germany, France and Italy - were initially reluctant to take action against Russia's use of Swift. There were concerns that companies owed money by Russia would have to find alternative ways to get paid. There were also fears it could impact the global banking system, although there is no evidence of this yet. Alexei Kudrin, Russia's former finance minister, has suggested being cut off from Swift could shrink Russia's economy by 5%. However, there are doubts about the lasting impact on Russia's economy, particularly if banks find sustainable ways to reroute payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions. Swift was created by American and European banks, which did not want a single institution developing their own system and having a monopoly. The network is now jointly-owned by more than 2,000 banks and financial institutions. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in partnership with major central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Swift helps make secure international trade possible for its members, and is not supposed to take sides in disputes. However, Iran was banned from Swift in 2012, as part of sanctions over its nuclear programme. It lost almost half of its oil export revenues and 30% of foreign trade. Swift says it has no influence over sanctions and any decision to impose them rests with governments.

BP to offload stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft,"BP is to offload its 19.75% stake in Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft after Russia's ""act of aggression in Ukraine"". The oil giant had come under pressure from the UK government to make the move since Thursday's invasion. It has held the shareholding in the Russian company since 2013. Meanwhile, Norwegian energy giant Equinor says it will start the process of divesting from its joint ventures in Russia. BP chief executive Bernard Looney has resigned ""with immediate effect"" from the Rosneft board, as has fellow BP-nominated director Bob Dudley. Rosneft said thirty years of successful cooperation had been ruined and blamed BP's decision on ""unprecedented political pressure"", according to reports from Russian news agencies. Mr Looney had been on the Rosneft board since 2020, alongside its chairman Igor Sechin, who is a close friend and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Why the Ukraine conflict could push up prices Russia central bank urges calm amid cash run fears What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant? The PA News agency reported Mr Looney was in Russia as recently as October, when he appeared on a panel with Mr Putin, which he later described as a ""privilege"". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng spoke to the BP boss on Fridayand left him in ""no doubt about the seriousness of government concerns about BP's overexposure to Russian interests"" according to an official. BP chairman Helge Lund said that, while BP had operated in Russia for more than 30 years and had ""brilliant Russian colleagues"", Russia's attack on Ukraine was ""having tragic consequences across the region"" and represented a fundamental change. ""It has led the BP board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue."" BP's share in Russian state oil giant Rosneft has long felt uncomfortable; this week under heavy political pressure it became untenable. The chairman of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, is a close ally of President Putin.  Rosneft supplies fuel to the Russian army. Immediately offloading the stake to a potentially inappropriate buyer was not an option. The company has decided to ""divest"" - meaning it will sever its financial ties with Rosneft, stop taking a dividend and step back from its two seats on the board. Company officials say it is too soon to say exactly how this stake will be disposed of. It could potentially be seized, or sold. It will mean a significant financial hit, but a price BP had little choice but to pay. Mr Looney said that he had been ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the situation in Ukraine and it had caused BP to fundamentally rethink its position with Rosneft. ""I am convinced that the decisions we have taken as a board are not only the right thing to do, but are also in the long-term interests of BP,"" he said. Mr Kwarteng welcomed the move, saying: ""Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine must be a wake-up call for British businesses with commercial interests in Putin's Russia."" A Rosneft oil rig drilling the first exploration well in the Khatanga Bay, Russia BP's latest annual results, published two weeks ago, revealed Rosneft accounted for $2.7bn (Â£2bn) of its profits, about a fifth of its total. The multinational, which has its headquarters in London, admitted last year that sanctions on Russia could be problematic for its business and the relinquishing of the  Rosneft stake comes after western countries imposed a series of economic sanctions on Russia - includingseveral banks being excluded from the Swift international payment system. BP said it is too early to say how or to whom its stake in Rosneft will be offloaded. The firm will pay a $11bn charge when it writes off foreign exchange losses that have accumulated over the last few years and another charge relating to the value of its stake. Rosneft has been under sanctions from the US and EU since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. On Monday, Norwegian energy group Equinor became the second major European oil and gas producer to announce its exit from Russia, as it said it would begin the process of divesting from its joint ventures in the country. ""In the current situation, we regard our position as untenable,""Equinor's chief executive Anders Opedal said in a statement,external. It came after Norway's $1.3 trillion (Â£970bn) sovereign wealth fund, which is the world's largest, also announced on Sunday that it would freeze and divest its Russian assets. ""We have decided to freeze the fund's investments and have begun a process of selling out,"" Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said. The fund's Russian assets were worth $2.83bn (Â£2.11bn) at the end of 2021. It is the fourth largest shareholder in Russian bank Sberbank and has stakes in Russian energy firms Gazprom and Lukoil. Oil prices surged past $100 (Â£74) a barrel tohit their highest level for more than seven yearsafter Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. The shipping firms FedEx and UPS have also suspended all their services in and out of Russia. United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said that packages in transit to Ukraine and Russia will be returned to their senders for no additional cost where possible. What questions do you have about the Russian invasion of Ukraine?

BP chairman Helge Lund said that, while BP had operated in Russia for more than 30 years and had ""brilliant Russian colleagues"", Russia's attack on Ukraine was ""having tragic consequences across the region"" and represented a fundamental change. ""It has led the BP board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue."" BP's share in Russian state oil giant Rosneft has long felt uncomfortable; this week under heavy political pressure it became untenable. The chairman of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, is a close ally of President Putin.  Rosneft supplies fuel to the Russian army. Immediately offloading the stake to a potentially inappropriate buyer was not an option. The company has decided to ""divest"" - meaning it will sever its financial ties with Rosneft, stop taking a dividend and step back from its two seats on the board. Company officials say it is too soon to say exactly how this stake will be disposed of. It could potentially be seized, or sold. It will mean a significant financial hit, but a price BP had little choice but to pay. Mr Looney said that he had been ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the situation in Ukraine and it had caused BP to fundamentally rethink its position with Rosneft. ""I am convinced that the decisions we have taken as a board are not only the right thing to do, but are also in the long-term interests of BP,"" he said. Mr Kwarteng welcomed the move, saying: ""Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine must be a wake-up call for British businesses with commercial interests in Putin's Russia."" A Rosneft oil rig drilling the first exploration well in the Khatanga Bay, Russia BP's latest annual results, published two weeks ago, revealed Rosneft accounted for $2.7bn (Â£2bn) of its profits, about a fifth of its total. The multinational, which has its headquarters in London, admitted last year that sanctions on Russia could be problematic for its business and the relinquishing of the  Rosneft stake comes after western countries imposed a series of economic sanctions on Russia - includingseveral banks being excluded from the Swift international payment system. BP said it is too early to say how or to whom its stake in Rosneft will be offloaded. The firm will pay a $11bn charge when it writes off foreign exchange losses that have accumulated over the last few years and another charge relating to the value of its stake. Rosneft has been under sanctions from the US and EU since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. On Monday, Norwegian energy group Equinor became the second major European oil and gas producer to announce its exit from Russia, as it said it would begin the process of divesting from its joint ventures in the country. ""In the current situation, we regard our position as untenable,""Equinor's chief executive Anders Opedal said in a statement,external. It came after Norway's $1.3 trillion (Â£970bn) sovereign wealth fund, which is the world's largest, also announced on Sunday that it would freeze and divest its Russian assets. ""We have decided to freeze the fund's investments and have begun a process of selling out,"" Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said. The fund's Russian assets were worth $2.83bn (Â£2.11bn) at the end of 2021. It is the fourth largest shareholder in Russian bank Sberbank and has stakes in Russian energy firms Gazprom and Lukoil. Oil prices surged past $100 (Â£74) a barrel tohit their highest level for more than seven yearsafter Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. The shipping firms FedEx and UPS have also suspended all their services in and out of Russia. United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) said that packages in transit to Ukraine and Russia will be returned to their senders for no additional cost where possible. What questions do you have about the Russian invasion of Ukraine?

What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant?Some Russian banks will be banned from the Swift financial network but what impact will this have?Business,"The European Commission has proposed excluding three more Russian banks from Swift, an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions. It comes after the EU and its allies suspended seven institutions from the system in March. The move aims to hit the country's banking network and its access to funds via Swift, which is pivotal for the smooth transaction of money worldwide. Swift is the global financial artery that allows the smooth and rapid transfer of money across borders. It stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Created in 1973 and based in Belgium, Swift links 11,000 banks and institutions in more than 200 countries. But Swift is not your traditional High Street bank. It is a sort of instant messaging system that informs users when payments have been sent and arrived. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? It sends more than 40 million messages a day, as trillions of dollars change hands between companies and governments. More than 1% of those messages were thought to involve Russian payments. In March, seven Russian banks were removed from Swift including Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB) and VTB Bank. The European Commission now wants to exclude a further three including the country's biggest lender, Sberbank, which accounts for more than a third of Russia's banking sector. The package still has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. The EU, US, UK and others have said that cutting banks out of Swift will ensure they ""are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally"". The aim is for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Banks now have to deal directly with one another, adding delays and extra costs, and ultimately cutting off revenues for the Russian government. Russia was threatened with a Swift expulsion before - in 2014 when it annexed Crimea. Russia said the move would be tantamount to a declaration of war. Western allies did not go ahead, but the threat did prompt Russia to develop its own, very fledgling, cross-border transfer system called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS) as an alternative to Swift. Few foreign countries currently use SPFS, but India is reportedly considering a Russian proposal to use it for payments in roubles. Separately, Moscow is working with Beijing to connect to China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) - another alternative to Swift which processes payments in Chinese yuan. Some nations - such as Germany, France and Italy - were initially reluctant to take action against Russia's use of Swift. There were concerns that companies owed money by Russia would have to find alternative ways to get paid. There were also fears it could impact the global banking system, although there is no evidence of this yet. Alexei Kudrin, Russia's former finance minister, has suggested being cut off from Swift could shrink Russia's economy by 5%. However, there are doubts about the lasting impact on Russia's economy, particularly if banks find sustainable ways to reroute payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions. Swift was created by American and European banks, which did not want a single institution developing their own system and having a monopoly. The network is now jointly-owned by more than 2,000 banks and financial institutions. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in partnership with major central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Swift helps make secure international trade possible for its members, and is not supposed to take sides in disputes. However, Iran was banned from Swift in 2012, as part of sanctions over its nuclear programme. It lost almost half of its oil export revenues and 30% of foreign trade. Swift says it has no influence over sanctions and any decision to impose them rests with governments.

Truss backs Britons who want to fight for UkraineForeign Secretary says volunteers must make their own decision but calls it a fight for democracy.UK,"This video can not be played Watch: The foreign secretary supports Britons who want to fight in Ukraine Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she supports individuals from the UK who might want to go to Ukraine to join an international force to fight. She told the BBC it was up to people to make their own decisions, but argued it was a battle ""for democracy"". She said Ukrainians were fighting for freedom, ""not just for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe"". Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged foreign nationals ""to join the defence of security in Europe"". Earlier on Sunday, he said Ukraine was setting up an ""international"" legion of volunteers for foreigners wishing to join the Ukrainian army in its fight against Russian forces. ""This is not just Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this is the beginning of a war against Europe. Against European unity,"" Mr Zelensky was quoted as saying on his official website. ""Everyone who wants to join the defence of security in Europe and the world may come and stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians against the invaders of the 21st Century."" The UK government has stressed thatBritish troops will not be sent to fighton the ground. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Ukraine would instead be supported to ""fight every street with every piece of equipment we can get to them"". Ukrainian forces say they haverepelled an attack on the country's second city Kharkivafter fierce clashes with Russian forces. Regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said the city was now rid of Russian troops after street-to-street fighting overnight. Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko said an ""overwhelming"" number of foreign nationals were ""demanding to be allowed to fight"" for Ukraine - as the Russian invasion reaches its fourth day. Ukraine has said it will arm all volunteers. by Vitaliy Shevchenko, in Folkestone, Kent As missiles rain down on Ukrainian cities and Russian tanks are pouring in, Ukrainians in London are giving up their jobs to return home and fight for their country. I spent Saturday with some of them. I met Viktor, Oleh, and Yevhen - who asked to be identified with just their first names - as they drove to the seaside town of Folkestone in Kent, which has become the unlikely hub for Ukrainians returning home to fight. The reason is a local military surplus store with a sympathetic owner. ""The West hasn't done enough to help Ukraine, so I'm more than happy to,"" the owner, who calls himself Wozzer, told me. His discounts were good, and some of his kit - such as boots - was free to take. The place was swarming with Ukrainians, their sense of purpose palpable. As Viktor stocked up on basic supplies like flak jackets, helmets and tourniquets, I asked him what made him think of going back to face Russia's overwhelming military force. ""When I saw what Russia was doing to our country, I simply realised that it was my duty,"" he said. After Viktor and his friends loaded up their van, they were keen to have a quick look at the sea. As they were sipping coffees and chatting cheerfully on the promenade, you would never believe they were going into battle. But what they will face in a few days - after a long drive in their van across Europe - is very different from the peaceful seaside in Kent. Asked on BBC One's Sunday Morning programme if she would support individuals from Britain going over to Ukraine to help in the fight, Ms Truss said: ""I do support that, and of course that is something that people can make their own decisions about. ""The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy not just for Ukraine, but for whole of Europe because that's what President Putin is challenging."" A Ukrainian soldier observes smoke rising from a petrol storage depot near Kyiv which was hit by a Russian missile She said the UK government was ""doing all it can"" to support Ukraine with defensive weapons on the ground and with ""far more severe sanctions"" against Russia, to stop Putin from funding his ""war machine"". ""We are seeing a huge united effort, across the G7, across our allies, to challenge Vladimir Putin,"" she said. ""Because this is Putin's war. This is pre-fabricated, pre-ordained aggression to try and subvert a sovereign democracy. ""We simply cannot allow him to succeed."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? ZELENSKY:Comedian president rises to the moment DNIPRO:Terrified residents jolt into action PHOTOS:Ordinary lives turned upside down The foreign secretary said she feared the invasion of Ukraine would be a ""bloody and long-running conflict"" - with consequences felt far beyond Ukraine itself. She said the UK ""will need to do more [and] spend more"" - citing the unprecedented sanctions announced by the government earlier this week, and Saturday's decision by the EU, US and their alliesto cut off a number of Russian banks from the main international payment system, Swift. ""The aim is to degrade the Russian economy - to stop the money Putin has used to fund his war machine,"" she said. She said the UK government had compiled a ""hit list"" of Russian billionaires and said there would be a ""rolling programme of sanctions"" against individual oligarchs. ""We will be targeting oligarchs' private jets, we will be targeting their properties, we will be targeting other possessions that they have - and there will be nowhere to hide,"" said Ms Truss. But Labour's David Lammy called on the government to name those on its hit list - and questioned why there were some being sanctioned by the US but not the UK. Mr Lammy also told the BBC the Russian insurance industry should  be targeted by sanctions. Ukrainian forces secured control of Kharkiv on Sunday afternoon after hours of fighting Ms Truss acknowledged that there was likely to be an ""economic cost"" to the UK ""in terms of access to oil and gas markets"" - anda likely rise in the cost of living, with the conflict expected to drive energy and fuel prices even higher. The foreign secretary warned of ""dire consequences"" if the conflict was allowed to escalate. ""I firmly believe that the British public understand the price we will pay if we don't stand up to Putin now"". She told Sky's Trevor Philips the UK and allies needed to be prepared for Russia to use chemical or nuclear warfare, if President Putin's invasion plan looked as if it was failing, adding: ""We need to avoid this at all costs."" It comes asPresident Putin ordered his military commandto put nuclear forces on a ""special"" state of alert in an effort. Speaking on Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised Ukrainians for ""fighting heroically"" and with ""great success"" in some places, but said more had to be done to ""change the heavy odds that Ukraine faces"" from the Russian invasion. A Ukrainian government official said more than 210 Ukrainian civilians had been killed so far and more than 1,100 wounded in Russia's invasion. The number of people fleeing Ukraine has now reached 368,000, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. What questions do you have about the Russian invasion of Ukraine?

"Ukrainians fighting heroically, says Boris JohnsonPM says more must be done to change ""heavy odds"" against Ukraine, as Russians enter city of Kharkiv.UK","Boris Johnson says Ukrainians are ""fighting heroically"" and with ""great success"" in some places. Following a call with the Ukrainian president, the prime minister said things ""are not going all the way of President [Vladimir] Putin"". But he said more had to be done to ""change the heavy odds that Ukraine faces"" from the Russian invasion. Tougher sanctions, including a move to shut Russia out of the global payments system Swift, were needed, he said. Shortly after Mr Johnson's comments on Saturday night the European Commission alongside the US, Canada and UK announced thatselected Russian banks would be removed from the Swift messaging system. On Sunday morning, local officials reportedRussian troops had entered Ukraine's second cityKharkiv, where they are battling Ukrainian forces in the streets. Residents have been urged to stay indoors. The advance came after missiles rained down across the city overnight. A nearby natural gas pipeline and an oil terminal outside Kyiv have also been hit by the Russians. A strict curfew is in place in capital Kyiv until Monday - only police, military and volunteers are currently on the streets. So far, the fighting across Ukraine has resulted in at least 240 civilian casualties, including 64 deaths, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ireland and Finland are the most recent countries to announce they are closing their airspace to Russian planes. Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney urged other EU partners to do the same, and called for ""new wide-ranging sanctions to be agreed"" on Sunday.

""Things are not going all the way of President Putin. Very far from it, the Ukrainians are fighting heroically, and in some places with great success,"" Mr Johnson said.

Day 3: Tracking Russia's invasion in maps What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant? So far, sanctions have included freezing the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as halting Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Liz Truss announced that the Foreign Office is preparing a ""hit list"" of Russian oligarchs to be targeted by sanctions in the coming months, with new names added every few weeks. The foreign secretarytold the Sunday Times,external: ""We have to make it deeply painful for the oligarchs that support the Putin regime. There are over 100 Russian billionaires. ""Nothing is off the table in terms of who or what we are targeting. We are very clear about that - we are very prepared to do what it takes."" It comes days after Mr Johnsontargeted a handful of oligarchs and said major Russian banks will be excluded from the UK financial system. Ukrainian servicemen have a meal at the military airbase Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region Mr Johnson also said that ""of course"" the UK would take Ukrainian refugees, saying the country had a ""historic and proud role of taking refugees from all conflicts"". It comes after some criticism from opposition MPs that the government had continued to apply the existing rules for Ukrainians seeking to come to the country. Mr Johnson suggested that there was ""fake news"" on the internet about the government's willingness to help refugees. Immigration minister Kevin Foster was criticised on social media after writing, in a later deleted tweet, that there were a number of routes to the UK which Ukrainians could qualify for, ""not least our seasonal worker scheme"". The prime minister also said that it was ""inconceivable"" to imagine that normal sporting relations could continue with ""Putin's Russia"" after Poland and Swedenrefused to play world cup play-off fixtures with Russia.

Miles of queues at borders to flee invasion,"A long queue lies behind - and a long and uncertain wait to cross into the unknown Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are pouring towards neighbouring countries to flee the Russian invasion. In the three days since the invasion began, more than 115,000 have crossed into Poland alone - some travelling for more than two days, others joining queues 15km (10 miles) long at border points. Those fleeing are mostly women and children, as all Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are being told to stay and fight - in some cases separated from their families. BBC correspondents met them at the borders. Ana had to leave her husband behind in Ukraine By Lucy Williamson, Palanca, Moldova Seen from the Moldovan border, Ukraine is a nation of women.  Mothers and grandmothers, wheeling suitcases to safety, leading their children into the unknown. Ana arrived at the Palanca crossing point after more than 24 hours waiting in a queue on the Ukrainian side of the border - her little yellow car stuffed with bags, her six-year-old granddaughter singing to herself in the backseat. Ana and her stepdaughter had driven straight from the southern city of Odesa - some 50km away and now a key target for Russia in the war. But Ana's calm smiling manner crumbled as soon as she began to speak.  Breaking down in tears, she described how she'd had to leave her husband behind to defend their country. ""I hope the West will help us get out of this terrible situation, because right now we're facing the Russian aggressor alone."" Around her, local volunteers from Moldova's towns and villages waited to offer lifts to Ukrainians arriving here on foot. But, like Ana, many who turn up here have thought only of escaping Ukraine, and have little idea of what happens now - for their country or themselves. Tea, coffee and guidance at makeshift stalls at the Ukraine-Moldova border By Mark Lowen, Przemysl, Poland The overnight train from Kyiv, via Lviv, pulled in carrying Europe's new refugees. They arrived at the 19th Century train station at Przemysl, which is now a modern-day reception centre. Kateryna Leontieva's journey was long - her return to Ukraine could be a lot longer ""It took us 52 hours to get here,"" said Kateryna Leontieva, who had travelled from Kharkiv with her teenage daughter. Clutching their Ukrainian passports, and carrying a rucksack of belongings, they stepped out into eastern Poland - and safety. When I asked how it felt to be here, Kateryna welled up with emotion. ""I don't know yet - the tears are just coming,"" she said. ""I didn't feel anything - but now I'm starting to realise. I hope it's just a short trip and we'll be back soon."" In the waiting room, we found Irene and her two young children. Her husband had remained in Lviv to defend their homeland. ""Only women and children are allowed to go,"" she said. ""The men want to stay, fight, and give blood. They are heroes."" How did she feel about her husband staying behind, I asked? ""I'm afraid,"" she replied, her voice beginning to break. ""We believe everything will be alright. And we're praying for them."" Women say they are afraid, but proud their men are staying behind to fight By Nick Thorpe, Beregsurany, Hungary Victoria came from Irshava, in western Ukraine. ""I came to Hungary with my two daughters. I'm leaving them with relatives who are waiting here at the border and returning to my husband,"" she says amidst nervous laughter. Are you afraid to go back? ""Honestly, I'm not afraid. I only worry about my daughters, that's all. I see that things are not good for Ukraine, but I cannot leave my country. We have to be patriotic."" And her defiance continues. ""My husband is ready if necessary to protect Ukraine for the future, for our children. I don't want it but we must save our country. ""He will go to the military office because he has received a letter."" By Rob Cameron, Vysne Slamence, Slovakia In the tiny village of Velke Slamence, the latest gaggle of refugees walked briskly down the road, eyes searching anxiously for a familiar face, followed by a shout of recognition, a hug, a kiss. For a fleeting moment the scene felt joyful - light-hearted almost. But then it was punctured by a sharp, piercing cry. A woman's face crumpled in anguish before she was led swiftly away. ""Uzhhorod,"" said a teenage girl, when I asked where she was from, a city of 100,000 just across the border. Before World War Two that city was part of Czechoslovakia. There are bonds of kinship and solidarity in these plains beneath the Carpathian Mountains that go back a century. That was almost all she would tell me. She clutched the hand of her little brother, a shy boy. Their parents had stayed behind. It was unclear who they were waiting for. The men are the ones waiting for the displaced Ukrainians to come Tanya left Kyiv 20 years ago, and now lives with her partner in Stuttgart. But here she was, standing by the roadside, waiting to rescue an old friend as their home city was engulfed by chaos. Surveying the scene was villager Jan Toth. ""They're not letting men leave, Putin or Zelensky,"" he told me. ""It's a catastrophe."" THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

But he said more had to be done to ""change the heavy odds that Ukraine faces"" from the Russian invasion. Tougher sanctions, including a move to shut Russia out of the global payments system Swift, were needed, he said. Shortly after Mr Johnson's comments on Saturday night the European Commission alongside the US, Canada and UK announced thatselected Russian banks would be removed from the Swift messaging system. On Sunday morning, local officials reportedRussian troops had entered Ukraine's second cityKharkiv, where they are battling Ukrainian forces in the streets. Residents have been urged to stay indoors. The advance came after missiles rained down across the city overnight. A nearby natural gas pipeline and an oil terminal outside Kyiv have also been hit by the Russians. A strict curfew is in place in capital Kyiv until Monday - only police, military and volunteers are currently on the streets. So far, the fighting across Ukraine has resulted in at least 240 civilian casualties, including 64 deaths, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ireland and Finland are the most recent countries to announce they are closing their airspace to Russian planes. Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney urged other EU partners to do the same, and called for ""new wide-ranging sanctions to be agreed"" on Sunday.

ZELENSKY:Comedian president rises to the moment DNIPRO:Terrified residents jolt into action PHOTOS:Ordinary lives turned upside down Speaking during a visit to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Saturday, Boris Johnson said the UK was sending humanitarian, military and financial supplies to Ukraine. He added that 1,000 troops were being sent to the region to help with the influx of refugees and he said the government would ""of course help people fleeing for their lives"". ""Things are not going all the way of President Putin. Very far from it, the Ukrainians are fighting heroically, and in some places with great success,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said some ""terrible atrocities"" were being committed and there would be some ""very grim days ahead for Ukraine"". He added Europe had to face the ""hideous reality"" that previous attempts at diplomacy with Mr Putin were ""a charade"". People take cover as an air-raid siren sounds near an apartment building damaged by shelling in Kyiv on Saturday During a call with Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday evening, Mr Johnson paid tribute to the ""incredible heroism and bravery"" of the Ukrainian president and his people, Downing Street said. They expressed concern for the role Belarus was playing in the violence and agreed on the need for ""the international community to isolate Russia completely diplomatically and financially"". In a tweet Mr Zelensky said he was grateful to Mr Johnson and said they had agreed on further steps to ""counter the aggressor"". Day 3: Tracking Russia's invasion in maps What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant? So far, sanctions have included freezing the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as halting Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Liz Truss announced that the Foreign Office is preparing a ""hit list"" of Russian oligarchs to be targeted by sanctions in the coming months, with new names added every few weeks. The foreign secretarytold the Sunday Times,external: ""We have to make it deeply painful for the oligarchs that support the Putin regime. There are over 100 Russian billionaires. ""Nothing is off the table in terms of who or what we are targeting. We are very clear about that - we are very prepared to do what it takes."" It comes days after Mr Johnsontargeted a handful of oligarchs and said major Russian banks will be excluded from the UK financial system. Ukrainian servicemen have a meal at the military airbase Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region Mr Johnson also said that ""of course"" the UK would take Ukrainian refugees, saying the country had a ""historic and proud role of taking refugees from all conflicts"". It comes after some criticism from opposition MPs that the government had continued to apply the existing rules for Ukrainians seeking to come to the country. Mr Johnson suggested that there was ""fake news"" on the internet about the government's willingness to help refugees. Immigration minister Kevin Foster was criticised on social media after writing, in a later deleted tweet, that there were a number of routes to the UK which Ukrainians could qualify for, ""not least our seasonal worker scheme"". The prime minister also said that it was ""inconceivable"" to imagine that normal sporting relations could continue with ""Putin's Russia"" after Poland and Swedenrefused to play world cup play-off fixtures with Russia. It comes after Chelsea owner Roman Abramovichhanded over ""stewardship"" of the football clubto the trustees of its charitable foundation.

Germany to send weapons directly to UkraineThe move reverses Germany's long-standing policy banning weapon exports to conflict zones.,"The German government has come under public pressure to get tough on Russia Germany's Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has announced that Germany will deliver weapons directly to Ukraine. He said Germany would be sending 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles. Berlin has also dropped some restrictions on German-made weapons being sent to conflict zones, meaning that third countries will be able to send more arms to Ukraine. Mr Scholz said the Russian invasion marked a turning point. The move reverses Germany's long-standing policy of banning weapon exports to conflict zones. At the same time, German ministers have said they are working on restrictingRussia's access to the Swift global interbank payment systemin a ""targeted"" way that ""hits the right people"" and avoids collateral damage. Germany's three-party coalition government, made up of socialists, liberals and Greens, has faced challenges in formulating a coherent response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But there is a dawning realisation here that Germany may have to rely not just on trade and diplomacy for its security, but also on military might. And those public figures who in the past have expressed sympathy for Moscow have either fallen silent or said they were wrong. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, herself a Green, tweeted: ""Our world is different after Putin's war of aggression. While we are stunned by this breach of international law, we are not powerless. ""That's why we will help the Ukrainian soldiers fighting for their country with anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles."" Germans have been shocked by Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine and have been demanding that their government take tougher action against the Kremlin. Now it has.

Explosions rock Kyiv and Ukraine second city Kharkiv,"This video can not be played WATCH: Ukrainian troops street fighting in Kharkiv Ukrainian forces say they have repelled an attack on the country's second city Kharkiv after fierce clashes with Russian forces. Regional governor Oleh Synehubov said the city was now rid of Russian troops - after street-to-street fighting. Thousands spent the night in basements and shelters, with intense shelling described by one resident as ""something like Star Wars above your head"". ""The wave of the blast was so strong that my ears popped,"" another said. A nine-storey residential tower was hit, emergency services said,killing an elderly woman,externalwhile about 60 people survived after hiding in the basement. Russian troops also blew up a natural gas pipeline nearby, according to a Ukrainian state communications agency. Live updates as Russian troops enter key Ukrainian city West to cut some Russian banks off from Swift Terrified but coping: A key city jolts into action Kharkiv residents who spoke to the BBC told of their fear and apprehension as the attack raged on, as well as their pride in Ukrainian forces and reservists in holding back Russian troops. Just before an explosion in the Saltivka district, one woman said her neighbour was instructing their young children on what to do in the event of a blast. ""Listening to this was horrific, my hairs were standing on end at the thought that three-year-old children were having to be taught what to do during shelling,"" she said. ""Throughout the night one young girl kept waking up her mum. She'd sit up crying screaming: 'Mom, I'm scared, please save me, save me now.' ""She only calmed down by  the morning after her mum had sat holding her all through the night."" The 34-year-old, who requested anonymity, added: ""Right now, the offensive against the city is still going on. I hear the blasts all the time - even though I know Kharkiv is controlled by Ukraine, 100%."" The Ukrainian military repelled Russian forces, with light vehicles destroyed in some parts of the city For university professor Dmitry Shabanov, the fighting came uncomfortably close. ""Tanks were fighting only a few kilometres from our home, and the operation to counter some saboteurs that entered Kharkiv was just next to our yard,"" he said. ""We are staying in our house with a cellar, it's my wife and me, two sons who are seven and 11 years old, and my 80-year-old mum. We keep the boys in the cellar most of the time,"" he added. Maria Avdeev, another resident, said groups of Russian troops were eliminated ""one by one"" by the Ukrainian military. ""Also, a number of Russian soldiers and officers were captured, so they did not basically fight back, when they saw that they had no other option,"" she said. Oleksii Svid, 30, managed to travel to buy food for his family and his pets, Kuzya the cat and Larry the dog, on Saturday but found supplies were running low. Nonetheless, he said many local people remained resilient - with talk about how to prevent Russian troops from entering the city and ways to help the Ukrainian army. ""The main issue right now it to gain access to the food, as most shops don't have a way to refill stock of sugar, flour, dairy, and meat,"" he said. ""There's also a shortage of fuel in gas stations in the city."" The BBC has verified a video on the Telegram messaging platformwhich shows Russian trucks,externaldriving into Kharkiv early on Sunday. Another video verified by the BBC showed a group of Ukrainian soldiers taking cover behind a wall, while one launched a shoulder-fired missile. In the north-eastern city of Okhtyrka, 100km (60 miles) from Kharkiv, the local governor said at least six Ukrainians - including a seven-year-old girl - had died as a result of a Russian attack on Friday. A kindergarten and an orphanage were among the buildings reportedly hit, which Russia has denied. The full extent of casualties in Ukraine is very hard to confirm. The country's human rights commissioner says 210 civilians have been killed. So far the United Nations has recorded 64 confirmed civilian deaths and many more wounded, and says it expects the true number to be much higher. Military deaths are also very hard to verify. The UN said by Saturday at least 134 Ukrainian military had been killed. Russia conceded on Sunday that it has suffered losses, but has not released a figure. Ukraine says 4,300 Russian servicemen have so far died.
