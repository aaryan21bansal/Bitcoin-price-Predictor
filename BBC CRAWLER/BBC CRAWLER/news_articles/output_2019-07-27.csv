Mr Trump attacked Democratic Rep Elijah Cummings and his Maryland district on Twitter. The presidentdescribed Mr Cummings' majority-black district in Baltimore as a ""rodent-infested mess"",external.

The message was aimed at four lawmakers of colour - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar - all of whom are US citizens.

Just Eat in merger talks with Dutch company,"Food delivery service Just Eat has confirmed it is in talks to be taken over by Dutch company Takeaway.com. A statement released by Just Eat said: ""The possible combination may be implemented by way of an offer for Just Eat by Takeaway.com."" Based on current market value, Just Eat and Takeaway.com would have combined worth of roughly Â£9bn ($11bn). Earlier in the year, Just Eat was put under pressure by a shareholder to merge with a rival. Activist shareholder Cat Rock, which owns 1.7% of the firm, has been pressing for a merger with Takeaway.com, in which it also has a stake. Just Eat is involved in a home delivery battle with rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats, with each continuing to grab market space from one another. In May Amazon announced a Â£575m investment in rival Deliveroo, hitting Just Eat's share price. That investment has been blocked for now by the competition watchdog, pending an inquiry. Just Eat said in its statement on Saturday there was ""no certainty"" that any transaction would take place. It added: ""A further announcement will be made if and when appropriate."" Takeaway.com has until 1700 BST on 24 August to announce a firm intention to press on with the deal. Just Eat listings include takeaways given zero ratings for hygiene Uber-Deliveroo 'talks' hit Just Eat's share price In March, Just Eat said a fifth of the adult population in the UK used its services, while its delivery business in Canada - Skip The Dishes - was growing rapidly after the introduction of a bilingual service. Peter Duffy, the interim chief executive, said four million new customers joined the business last year. Despite this, US fund manager Cat Rock said it ""believed that a merger with a well-run industry peer is a very attractive avenuefor securing world-class leadership, delivery expertise, and a premium"". Just Eat was founded by a group of five Danish entrepreneurs in 2000 and launched a year later. It employs 3,600 staff globally, As well as the Just Eat brand in Europe, it trades as Skip The Dishes in Canada, iFood in Mexico and Brazil, and Menulog in Australia and New Zealand. A merger would create a company with 40 million customers across 20 countries. Just Eat is listed on the FTSE 100 stock exchange in London, where its shares closed up 2% on Friday, at 635 pence. The firm saw its group revenue grow by 43% in 2018 to Â£779.5m. Underlying earnings were up 6% to Â£173.9m in the year to 31 December. Meanwhile pre-tax profits were Â£101.7m, compared with a Â£76m loss in 2017. Just Eat is considered by analysts to have a market leading position in the UK food courier business, particularly given its strength in smaller towns. Just Eat's half yearly financial results are due on Wednesday, 31 July. Its quarterly results, announced in April, saw a slowdown in UK growth, with orders rising by 7.4% to 31.9 million. But sales across the Just Eat group as a whole were up 21%, helped by good growth in Canada, Italy, Switzerland and Ireland. Group revenues for the first quarter jumped 28% from a year earlier to Â£227.9m.

Bernal set to win Tour de France,"Thomas congratulated Ineos team-mate Bernal as they crossed the finish line together at the end of stage 20 Egan Bernal is poised to become the first Colombian to win the Tour de France after finishing Saturday's penultimate stage in the yellow jersey. Tradition dictates that the race leader is not challenged on Sunday's largely processional final stage to Paris. Bernal, 22, will become the youngest Tour winner for 110 years, with Ineos team-mate Geraint Thomas in second. Dutchman Steven Kruijswijk moved up to third as Julian Alaphilippe faded on an Alpine stage won by Vincenzo Nibali. Italian Nibali, winner of the Tour de France in 2014, was in the day's break and attacked again on the climb to the finish at Val Thorens, winning by 10 seconds from Spain's Alejandro Valverde. Bernal and Thomas, who won last year's Tour, finished stage 20 a few seconds later, crossing the line arm-in-arm, with huge grins on their faces. They came into the race as joint leaders for Ineos and, providing they both reach the finish in Paris on Sunday, will end it first and second in the general classification. ""We're now close to making it official,"" said Bernal. ""There's one stage left but, normally, if everything goes well, I can say that I've won my first Tour. ""It's incredible. I just want to get to the finish line in Paris and after I'll be calmer. ""Colombia is on the verge of winning its first Tour, We already had won the Giro d'Italia and La Vuelta a Espana, but the Tour was missing and it's a great honour to think that I'm the one achieving this."" Welshman Thomas, who ended the stage trailing in the overall standings by one minute, 11 seconds, wrote on Twitter: ""Congrats Egan Bernal. What a rider. The first of many."" Bernal, who will also collect the white jersey as the best young rider in the race, will put to an end a run of four successive British winners - Chris Froome winning three of his four titles from 2015 and Thomas triumphing last year. Listen: BeSpoke at the Tour: Stage 20 - Bernal victorious Tour 'night and day' compared to 2018 - Thomas Joint team leadership 'worked to perfection' Three-time world champin Sagan pulls a trademark wheelie as he crosses the finish line on stage 20 The green points jersey classification will be won for a record seventh time by Slovakian Peter Sagan, who pulled a wheelie as he rode over the finish line several minutes after the stage winner, while the polka dot King of the Mountains jersey will go to Frenchman Romain Bardet. That will be some consolation for the French supporters who had been hoping to see a home victory for the first time since Bernhard Hinault won his record-equalling fifth Tour in 1985. Alaphilippe, the world's number one-ranked male cyclist, had led the race for 14 days, and after holding the yellow jersey through the Pyrenees in week two also retained it after the first day in the Alps. However, he finally cracked on Friday's storm-shortened 19th stage and he again fell away on Saturday's final climb of the three-week race. He is set to finish fifth overall. France's other big hope, Thibaut Pinot, had also looked strong in the Pyrenees, but a freak injury, caused when his thigh hit his handlebar on stage 17, saw him eventually abandon the race from fifth place during stage 19. Saturday's stage was reduced by 71km to just 59.5km, with one major climb - the 19.9km ascent of the Cormet de Roselend - chopped from the race because a landslide, caused by stormy weather in the Alps, had blocked the road. That left the riders facing an unusual race along a dual carriageway across the valley from Albertville to the bottom of the day's solitary 33km climb to the ski resort of Val Thorens. More than 20 broke clear and opened a lead of around two minutes, 30 seconds as they reached the ascent but with the race for the overall title happening in the peloton behind them, their lead was gradually eroded. The Jumbo-Visma team of Kruijswijk, who started the stage in fourth, 88 seconds adrift of Bernal, set a furious pace from the bottom of the ascent. Kruijswijk started the day just 12 seconds behind third-placed Thomas and 40 behind Alaphilippe and his team's efforts were rewarded when Alaphilippe cracked with around 13km of the race remaining. However, Kruijswijk was unable to break the Ineos riders with Thomas and Bernal content to sit and ride tempo all the way to the finish line, Dutch rider Kruijswijk eventually finished eight seconds behind Thomas to cement third place overall, one minute, 31 seconds behind Bernal. Bernal (right) was a key domestique for Thomas when he won his Tour title last year The climbing specialist, who was born on 13 January, 1997 in Zipaquira in central Colombia at an altitude of 2,650m, showed his potential at last year's Tour, when he rode as a domestique to Thomas and four-time champion Chris Froome. After pacing Thomas to victory on Alpe d'Huez and ultimately the overall title, Froome said: ""He's got an amazing engine. You only have to look at what he did on Alpe d'Huez, for a 21-year-old, that's amazing. ""There is a lot in Egan that reminds me of myself when I was younger. It's great having him on the team and he brings a lot of young, new energy to the group."" He joined Team Sky for the 2018 season, after winning the prestigious Tour de l'Avenir - a stage race for under-23 riders that has seen many of its winners go on to Tour de France success. He won the Tour Colombia and Tour of California last year before making his Tour de France debut as a domestique to Thomas and four-time winner Chris Froome. This year, three crashes helped Bernal arrive at the Tour as joint leader of the Ineos team. The first was his own, on a training ride in Andorra, and it ruled him out of May's Giro d'Italia, where he had been due to lead the team for the first time in a Grand Tour. Froome'sseason-ending crashat June's Criterium du Dauphine then pushed Bernal up the Ineos pecking order for the Tour de France, while Thomas' spill at the Tour de Suisse later that month saw Bernal take over as the sole leader of that team and he went on to win the race. And he twice rode away from Thomas in the Alps this week to position himself as Ineos' strongest rider at the Tour and secure his first Grand Tour win in only his second attempt. Bernal will become the third youngest winner of the Tour. The youngest is France's Henri Cornet, who was 19 when he wascontroversially awarded victory in the second edition of the race in 1904,while Luxembourg's Francois Faber was a few days younger than Bernal when he took the 1909 title.

Noel Edmonds reaches deal with Lloyds over scam,"Noel Edmonds fell victim to a multi-million pound fraud Lloyds Banking Group has apologised to Noel Edmonds and agreed a compensation deal with him following a fraud case. The TV star said a scam involving staff at the Reading branch of HBOS, which was subsequently bought by Lloyds, destroyed his business Unique Group. Lloyds apologised for the ""distress"" suffered by Mr Edmonds but would not disclose details of the agreement. But theDaily Mail reported he is thought to have received around Â£5m,externalfrom the banking group. HBOS: A highly unusual case Ex-HBOS banker 'sold his soul for swag' A statement from Lloyds, on behalf of both parties, said: ""Mr Edmonds and Lloyds Banking Group have reached an agreement in their dispute."" It said the group will continue to assist the ongoing police investigation into matters relating to Unique Group and HBOS Reading. Corruptstaff from the Reading branch were jailed in 2017for a Â£245m loans scam between 2003 and 2007 which destroyed several businesses. It was revealed they squandered the profits on high-end prostitutes and luxury holidays. Clockwise from top left: Michael Bancroft, David Mills, John Cartwright, Mark Dobson and Alison Mills were all jailed for the HBOS scam Mr Edmonds, 70, was one of the most high profile victims of the scam and took action against the bank, saying in 2018 they will ""have to pay up"". He initially sought a compensation claim of more than Â£60m. He previously revealed he considered taking his own life as a result of his financial situation thanks to the scam. Lloyds rescued HBOS at the height of the financial crisis and the Reading scandal has loomed large over the bank. The group set aside Â£100m for victims of the fraud. An independent inquiry chaired by Dame Linda Dobbs is investigating whether the fraud was properly investigated and reported to authorities by Lloyds following its acquisition of HBOS and whether any individuals sought to cover it up. The statement from Lloyds added ""both parties also agree to place their trust in the independent inquiry"". The BBC has contacted Mr Edmonds for comment.

Bernal set to win Tour de FranceEgan Bernal is set to become the youngest winner for 110 years after finishing Saturday's stage in the lead.,"Thomas congratulated Ineos team-mate Bernal as they crossed the finish line together at the end of stage 20 Egan Bernal is poised to become the first Colombian to win the Tour de France after finishing Saturday's penultimate stage in the yellow jersey. Tradition dictates that the race leader is not challenged on Sunday's largely processional final stage to Paris. Bernal, 22, will become the youngest Tour winner for 110 years, with Ineos team-mate Geraint Thomas in second. Dutchman Steven Kruijswijk moved up to third as Julian Alaphilippe faded on an Alpine stage won by Vincenzo Nibali. Italian Nibali, winner of the Tour de France in 2014, was in the day's break and attacked again on the climb to the finish at Val Thorens, winning by 10 seconds from Spain's Alejandro Valverde. Bernal and Thomas, who won last year's Tour, finished stage 20 a few seconds later, crossing the line arm-in-arm, with huge grins on their faces. They came into the race as joint leaders for Ineos and, providing they both reach the finish in Paris on Sunday, will end it first and second in the general classification. ""We're now close to making it official,"" said Bernal. ""There's one stage left but, normally, if everything goes well, I can say that I've won my first Tour. ""It's incredible. I just want to get to the finish line in Paris and after I'll be calmer. ""Colombia is on the verge of winning its first Tour, We already had won the Giro d'Italia and La Vuelta a Espana, but the Tour was missing and it's a great honour to think that I'm the one achieving this."" Welshman Thomas, who ended the stage trailing in the overall standings by one minute, 11 seconds, wrote on Twitter: ""Congrats Egan Bernal. What a rider. The first of many."" Bernal, who will also collect the white jersey as the best young rider in the race, will put to an end a run of four successive British winners - Chris Froome winning three of his four titles from 2015 and Thomas triumphing last year. Listen: BeSpoke at the Tour: Stage 20 - Bernal victorious Tour 'night and day' compared to 2018 - Thomas Joint team leadership 'worked to perfection' Three-time world champin Sagan pulls a trademark wheelie as he crosses the finish line on stage 20 The green points jersey classification will be won for a record seventh time by Slovakian Peter Sagan, who pulled a wheelie as he rode over the finish line several minutes after the stage winner, while the polka dot King of the Mountains jersey will go to Frenchman Romain Bardet. That will be some consolation for the French supporters who had been hoping to see a home victory for the first time since Bernhard Hinault won his record-equalling fifth Tour in 1985. Alaphilippe, the world's number one-ranked male cyclist, had led the race for 14 days, and after holding the yellow jersey through the Pyrenees in week two also retained it after the first day in the Alps. However, he finally cracked on Friday's storm-shortened 19th stage and he again fell away on Saturday's final climb of the three-week race. He is set to finish fifth overall. France's other big hope, Thibaut Pinot, had also looked strong in the Pyrenees, but a freak injury, caused when his thigh hit his handlebar on stage 17, saw him eventually abandon the race from fifth place during stage 19. Saturday's stage was reduced by 71km to just 59.5km, with one major climb - the 19.9km ascent of the Cormet de Roselend - chopped from the race because a landslide, caused by stormy weather in the Alps, had blocked the road. That left the riders facing an unusual race along a dual carriageway across the valley from Albertville to the bottom of the day's solitary 33km climb to the ski resort of Val Thorens. More than 20 broke clear and opened a lead of around two minutes, 30 seconds as they reached the ascent but with the race for the overall title happening in the peloton behind them, their lead was gradually eroded. The Jumbo-Visma team of Kruijswijk, who started the stage in fourth, 88 seconds adrift of Bernal, set a furious pace from the bottom of the ascent. Kruijswijk started the day just 12 seconds behind third-placed Thomas and 40 behind Alaphilippe and his team's efforts were rewarded when Alaphilippe cracked with around 13km of the race remaining. However, Kruijswijk was unable to break the Ineos riders with Thomas and Bernal content to sit and ride tempo all the way to the finish line, Dutch rider Kruijswijk eventually finished eight seconds behind Thomas to cement third place overall, one minute, 31 seconds behind Bernal. Bernal (right) was a key domestique for Thomas when he won his Tour title last year The climbing specialist, who was born on 13 January, 1997 in Zipaquira in central Colombia at an altitude of 2,650m, showed his potential at last year's Tour, when he rode as a domestique to Thomas and four-time champion Chris Froome. After pacing Thomas to victory on Alpe d'Huez and ultimately the overall title, Froome said: ""He's got an amazing engine. You only have to look at what he did on Alpe d'Huez, for a 21-year-old, that's amazing. ""There is a lot in Egan that reminds me of myself when I was younger. It's great having him on the team and he brings a lot of young, new energy to the group."" He joined Team Sky for the 2018 season, after winning the prestigious Tour de l'Avenir - a stage race for under-23 riders that has seen many of its winners go on to Tour de France success. He won the Tour Colombia and Tour of California last year before making his Tour de France debut as a domestique to Thomas and four-time winner Chris Froome. This year, three crashes helped Bernal arrive at the Tour as joint leader of the Ineos team. The first was his own, on a training ride in Andorra, and it ruled him out of May's Giro d'Italia, where he had been due to lead the team for the first time in a Grand Tour. Froome'sseason-ending crashat June's Criterium du Dauphine then pushed Bernal up the Ineos pecking order for the Tour de France, while Thomas' spill at the Tour de Suisse later that month saw Bernal take over as the sole leader of that team and he went on to win the race. And he twice rode away from Thomas in the Alps this week to position himself as Ineos' strongest rider at the Tour and secure his first Grand Tour win in only his second attempt. Bernal will become the third youngest winner of the Tour. The youngest is France's Henri Cornet, who was 19 when he wascontroversially awarded victory in the second edition of the race in 1904,while Luxembourg's Francois Faber was a few days younger than Bernal when he took the 1909 title.

What next for northern rail?,"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling risked turning himself into a hate figure for train passengers in the north of England, Wales and the Midlands when he ditched long-promised rail electrification schemes last month. What angered many people,including newly-elected mayors Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, was Mr Grayling's simultaneous decision to get behind a Â£30bn scheme to build a new electric railway in London. It seemed like a classic case of the regions being starved of investment in favour of the south-east of England. Mr Grayling hopes to redeem himself by delivering faster, more reliable train services, with far less disruption to passengers while the work is being carried out, by using ""smarter"" technology. But he faces scepticism from political and business leaders, particularly in the north of England, home of the much-vaunted Northern Powerhouse. Campaigners plan to step up pressure on Mr Grayling when MPs return from their summer break. They want guarantees he is not softening up northern England for a let-down on the promise of a fast, modern transport network that will enable the region to compete with London and the South East for global business. Manchester MP Graham Stringer, a member of the transport committee, has written to its new Labour chairman Lillian Greenwood to ask her to invite Mr Grayling and Network Rail bosses in for a grilling. The Labour MP wants reassurances that plans to extend the new HS2 high speed line to Manchester and Leeds will not be sidelined by Crossrail 2, the new Â£30bn electric railway planned for London. Chris Grayling has insisted the north of England will not lose out Mr Stringer fears the mammoth ""hybrid bills"" required to get the two projects into law will lead to a parliamentary log jam, with the north ultimately losing out. ""I am worried that resources and parliamentary time are being sucked into the South East,"" Mr Stringer told BBC News. He also wants reassurances that revised plans to modernise east-west rail links in the north of England will be up to the job of dealing with extra passengers set to be delivered by HS2. One scheme that is definitely happening is the Â£85m project to link Piccadilly with Manchester's other main railway stations, Victoria and Oxford Road, which is due to be completed by the end of the year. But Mr Stringer is concerned that the government will pull the plug on plans for two new platforms at Manchester's Piccadilly station, to cope with the increase in passengers passing through it. Mr Graylinghas reportedly asked Network Rail,externalif they can ""do something with digital technology"" to increase capacity without building new platforms. How the new HS2 station at Leeds might look Former chancellor George Osborne's plan to link up northern English cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds into a single economic ""powerhouse"" hinged on faster trains and better connections. Work is under way to electrify the Transpennine rail route, from Liverpool to Newcastle - but although the final investment decision is not due until next year, Mr Grayling has suggested overhead wires will not now be installed along the entire route. Hitachi trains have been ordered for bi-mode routes He has also scrapped plans to electrify routes between Cardiff and Swansea; Kettering, Nottingham and Sheffield; and Windermere and Oxenholme. He says new ""bi-mode"" trains, which can transfer seamlessly from electric to diesel power, mean there is no need to spend money on ""difficult"" work to fit Victorian tunnels and track with overhead power cables. Network Rail has promised the bi-mode trains will ""deliver faster, longer, more frequent and more reliable services across the north of England, from Newcastle, Hull and York towards Manchester and Liverpool via Leeds"" by 2022. When the plan was to electrify the entire line, estimates were made of improved journey times, with the 50 minute to an hour's trip from Manchester to Leeds predicted to be cut by 15 minutes. But Network Rail has declined to issue new estimates for ""bi-mode"" journey times until it has completed a ""scoping exercise"" on the different options, which it will deliver to the Department for Transport in December. Bi-mode trains, such as those built by Hitachi Rail at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, are capable of running at 140mph in electric mode, although they will initially be limited to 125mph. They tend to be heavier than electric-only or diesel-only trains, which can hamper acceleration on routes with steep gradients such as the Leeds to Manchester route. But Hitachi said its bi-mode trains are just 5% heavier and have more power and better acceleration rates than the trains they are replacing. Journey times will depend on how many stops the trains make and the route they take. HS2 electric trains are set to improve journey times Think tank IPPR North is urging the government to commit to a high speed all-electric rail link between Manchester and Leeds, that would dramatically cut journey times, as part of a broader Northern Powerhouse Rail programme. They are also calling for Â£59bn in ""catch up cash"" over the next 10 years to fund schemes drawn up by Transport for North, an alliance of local authorities and business groups, as well as new powers for the group to raise private finance. IPPR North director Ed Cox said: ""Businesses and commuters in the north have been outraged by recent government announcements about transport in the north [of England], so much so that over 50,000 people have signed our online petition demanding fresh commitments to transport spending and devolution. ""This is not simply about fairness, it's about unlocking the potential of the northern economy and finally realising that northern prosperity is national prosperity."" Business groups are expected to step up their lobbying of ministers at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester at the start of October. Damian Waters, the CBI's North West director, said: ""It's vital that projects in different parts of the country are not seen as 'either or'. ""Improving the north of England's infrastructure should come at the same time as enhancements in the south."" Rail union the TSSA is also running a Rally for Rail campaign, calling on the government to reverse the decision to cancel electrification in northern England, Midlands and Wales, which has been backed by Labour MPs and regional development organisations. A Department for Transport spokesman said the government was committed to improving journey times and connecting communities in the north of England. ""Major upgrades to the Manchester - Leeds - York route are currently being designed and developed, to enable us to deliver more improvements for rail passengers from 2022. ""We are also working with the region to develop plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail, which aims to dramatically improve journey times between the major cities of the north. ""Passengers expect high quality rail services and we are committed to electrification where it delivers benefits, but will also take advantage of new technology to improve journeys.""

Third day of disruption for St Pancras passengers,"Rail passengers between London St Pancras and Nottingham and Sheffield have been urged not to travel as disruption caused by hot weather enters a third day, and conductors strike. Engineers are still trying to fix overhead line equipment near West Hampstead, north-west London. The damage was caused by the heat on Thursday - when the UK recorded its second hottest day ever. Train companies told customers to expect a reduced service until Monday. East Midlands Trains said it was running a heavily amended service on the route. Meanwhile, a second successive Saturday walkout by members of the RMT union over pay and conditions is also taking place, affecting local journeys on East Midlands Trains. Some services have been replaced by revised timetables and coach services. Some East Midlands services have been replaced by coaches The power line repairs mean tickets on East Midlands Trains and Thameslink - which runs services in and around London - are being acceptedon alternative routes,external. National Rail advised those travelling between London and Sheffield to use the line linking London King's Cross with Doncaster. It said passengers in Nottingham should travel via Grantham to King's Cross, while passengers in Leicester should travel to London Euston via Nuneaton. Thameslink told customers Network Rail has been ""unable to completely fix"" the damaged wires between St Pancras and Elstree. A reduced service is expected to run for the rest of Saturday, and Thameslink says it has requested extra rail replacement buses for Sunday. Eurostar - which runs services out of St Pancras International - was not reporting problems on its route to the Continent. Was Thursday the UK's hottest day on record?

"Trump: US and UK working on 'very substantial' dealThe deal could lead to a five-times increase in trade, Mr Trump says after speaking to Boris Johnson.UK Politics","This video can not be played Mr Trump says he and Mr Johnson will create a ""substantial"" US-UK trade agreement US President Donald Trump has said talks about a ""very substantial"" trade deal with the UK are under way. He said a bilateral post-Brexit deal could lead to a ""three to four, five times"" increase in current trade. There are no details about how this would be achieved. After a phone call with Boris Johnson on Friday, Mr Trump said the new prime minister would be ""great"". He added US-UK trade had previously been ""impeded"" by Britain's membership of the EU. Once the UK leaves, he said, the UK can expect to do ""much more"" trade with the US, he said. Mr Johnson and Mr Trump said they would begin formal negotiations ""as soon as possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. While the UK is in the EU, it cannot sign its own trade deals. Brexit is due to happen on 31 October. Trade deals involve two or more countries agreeing a set of terms by which they buy and sell goods and services from each other. Deals are designed to increase trade by eliminating or reducing trade barriers. These barriers might include import or export taxes (tariffs), quotas, or differing regulations on things such as safety or labelling. In short, because the US and EU do not have one. The EU customs union forbids members negotiating trade agreements separately from the EU. Instead, trade agreements are negotiated collectively. In 2013, under President Barack Obama, the US and the EU launched a programme of negotiations known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP. That proposed trade agreement was put on hold by the US after Mr Trump was elected as president, but the EU has approved new talks. A trade deal between the EU and a bloc of South American countries, including Brazil, took 20 years to finalise The EU-Canada agreement - which removed 99% of tariffs - wasseven years in the making, while theEU-South America deal agreed in Junetook 20 years to negotiate. The EU and US have been having a stop-start conversation about trade for years but a fresh round of formal talks wereonly recently approved by the EU. So even though both Mr Trump and Mr Johnson seem keen to do a deal, it could still take years, although - in theory - it is easier to negotiate with one country than a multi-national bloc. Barack Obama said in 2016a UK-US trade deal could take 10 years to negotiate if the UK left the EU. The US is a major trade and investment partner for the UK - by some measures the biggest of all. According to the Office for National Statistics'latest available figures,external, the US (including Puerto Rico) is our top trading partner. The UK-US trade relationship in five charts UK says it won't cut food standards for US Total trade (imports and exports) between the UK and US was worth Â£183.2bn in 2017, which made up 14.6% of total UK trade. The Office of the United States Trade Representative estimated thetotal trade figure for 2018,externalat $262.3bn (Â£211.9bn). TheUS Chamber of Commerce,externalsays the UK is the US' seventh largest trading partner and the fourth largest export destination for American goods and services. The UK-Swiss agreement signed in February also applies to neighbouring Liechtenstein As a member of the EU, the UK is part of about 40 trade agreements the EU has with more than 70 countries. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would lose these trade deals immediately -worth about 11% of total UK trade,external. So far the UK has agreed ""continuity"" deals with 12 countries and regions:Central America,external,Andean countries,external,Norway and Iceland,external,Caribbean countries,external,Pacific Islands,external,Liechtenstein,external,Israel,external,Palestinian Authority,external,Switzerland,external,the Faroe Islands,external,Eastern and Southern Africa,externalandChile,external. These areas account for 64% of trade currently covered by EU agreements for which the UK is seeking continuity, the government says. The agreements mostly replicate EU trade deals. In addition, the UK has also announceda deal in principle with South Korea, which is ""expected to be signed shortly"".

Noel Edmonds reaches deal with Lloyds over scamThe TV star says his former business was destroyed in a banking scam a decade ago.Business,"Noel Edmonds fell victim to a multi-million pound fraud Lloyds Banking Group has apologised to Noel Edmonds and agreed a compensation deal with him following a fraud case. The TV star said a scam involving staff at the Reading branch of HBOS, which was subsequently bought by Lloyds, destroyed his business Unique Group. Lloyds apologised for the ""distress"" suffered by Mr Edmonds but would not disclose details of the agreement. But theDaily Mail reported he is thought to have received around Â£5m,externalfrom the banking group. HBOS: A highly unusual case Ex-HBOS banker 'sold his soul for swag' A statement from Lloyds, on behalf of both parties, said: ""Mr Edmonds and Lloyds Banking Group have reached an agreement in their dispute."" It said the group will continue to assist the ongoing police investigation into matters relating to Unique Group and HBOS Reading. Corruptstaff from the Reading branch were jailed in 2017for a Â£245m loans scam between 2003 and 2007 which destroyed several businesses. It was revealed they squandered the profits on high-end prostitutes and luxury holidays. Clockwise from top left: Michael Bancroft, David Mills, John Cartwright, Mark Dobson and Alison Mills were all jailed for the HBOS scam Mr Edmonds, 70, was one of the most high profile victims of the scam and took action against the bank, saying in 2018 they will ""have to pay up"". He initially sought a compensation claim of more than Â£60m. He previously revealed he considered taking his own life as a result of his financial situation thanks to the scam. Lloyds rescued HBOS at the height of the financial crisis and the Reading scandal has loomed large over the bank. The group set aside Â£100m for victims of the fraud. An independent inquiry chaired by Dame Linda Dobbs is investigating whether the fraud was properly investigated and reported to authorities by Lloyds following its acquisition of HBOS and whether any individuals sought to cover it up. The statement from Lloyds added ""both parties also agree to place their trust in the independent inquiry"". The BBC has contacted Mr Edmonds for comment.

Backing for 'Northern Crossrail',"A proposal for a Â£39bn high-speed rail project is being considered by the government More than 5,000 businesses are calling on the government to invest in a high-speed railway link across the north of England. Theproposed Â£39bn project, dubbed the ""Crossrail of the North"", would see journey times halved between major northern cities. A survey by the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) found companies believed the upgraded network would boost productivity and investment. The government is considering the plan. The report's findings have been backed by former chancellor George Osborne, who is the chair of the NPP. He said improving rail links and connecting to the proposed HS2 rail network from London to the north had the ""potential to revolutionise the Northern economy"". ""The message coming loud and clear is that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) are critical for businesses to remain, grow and invest in the North,"" he said. ""Government must hear that message and provide the funding the Northern Powerhouse so badly needs."" The report calls for the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme to be linked in with HS2 Businesses surveyed ranged from small enterprises to large multinational corporations, including Siemens and Manchester Airports Group. More than 70% of the companies said they would ""commit to new investment if NPR was confirmed"" and 85% believed that NPR would increase investment across the north. The report cites Manchester Airport as an example of how businesses could benefit from improved rail links. The airport's owners claim NPR, which was first mooted in 2014 and has also been called ""HS3"", would ""treble the number of passengers within a two-hour rail journey of Manchester Airport from 3.5 million to 10 million"". Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of Liverpool City Region said the proposal would deliver a ""boost to our economy"". ""I will ensure that we keep up the pressure on the Government to deliver the connectivity to maximise the potential in our City Region and throughout the North of England."" D-Day- A French horse called George was an unlikely hero Fracas at bell-ringing contest over parking Truck tribute to teen after Stobart snub Rail Minister Andrew Jones said: ""It's brilliant to see widespread business support for NPR, and a recognition of the importance of linking it to HS2."" The Department of Transport would not confirm when a decision on the rail line will be made. It did say the funding required for the improvements would come from the public purse. It is thought the project will cost up to Â£39bn. In 2017, more than 70,000 people signed a petition calling for Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to back the NPR rail improvements.

PM pledges new northern high-speed rail route,"Boris Johnson said the full details of the Leeds-Manchester route would be published in the autumn Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised a faster rail route between Leeds and Manchester, claiming the benefits would be ""colossal"". In a speech in Manchester he gave his backing to the trans-Pennine transport link to ""turbo-charge the economy"". Standing in front of Stephenson's Rocket he said mass transport systems enabled people to prosper. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said he wanted ""to see real action now to back up the prime minister's words"". Mr Johnson said the full details of the Leeds-Manchester route would be published in the autumn following the review into HS2. Businesses back 'Northern Crossrail' plan HS3 for northern England 'will happen' HS2 cost 'not worth it to create some jobs' An audience of about 100 people gathered at the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester to listen to Mr Johnson's speech. The prime minister set out the four ""ingredients"" for the success of the UK as liveability, connectivity, culture, and power and responsibility. He said this meant areas having great public services, enough affordable homes, safe streets, fast broadband, and more responsibility and accountability for local areas. HS2 would connect London, the Midlands and up to Wigan, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds using trains capable of travelling at 250mph. The north-to-south rail line is budgeted to cost Â£56bn. The first segment - between London and Birmingham - is due to open in 2026, with the second - to Leeds and Manchester - expected to be completed by 2033. HS3 - a high-speed east-west rail link between Liverpool and Hull - and north to Newcastle was first announced by the government in 2014 but no firm commitments have been made since. In June 2019, the Department for Transport would not confirm when a decision on HS3 would be made, but estimated it could cost up to Â£39bn. He added: ""We are going to give greater powers to council leaders and communities. ""We are going to level up the powers offered to mayors so more people can benefit from the kind of local structures seen in London and here in Manchester."" Mr Johnson said young people growing up ""a few miles away"" from the centre of Manchester had felt ""hopelessness, or the hope that one day they will get out and never come back"". ""The crucial point is it certainly isn't really the fault of the places, and certainly isn't the fault of the people growing up there,"" he said. ""They haven't failed. It's we, us, the politicians, our politics has failed them."" This video can not be played The prime minister spoke of the need to ""inject some pace"" into rail plans The Northern Powerhouse rail project was part of Mr Johnson's wider commitment to deliver a high-speed railway link across the north of England, which would cost about Â£39bn. Mr Burnham said what he heard from the prime minister ""certainly sounded good"" but warned he heard ""something very similar in almost the same spot from [then Chancellor] George Osborne five years ago and, in those five years, rail services here have gone in reverse"". The mayor added: ""The focus on buses too and a London-style transport system for Greater Manchester sounded very good to me but we will have to see real action now to back up the prime minister's words. ""What about Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle? All of those places need a commitment. ""Commuting is a daily nightmare for people in large parts of the North - it costs Â£4 here for a single bus journey, Â£1.50 in London. How can that be right?"" Rail journeys between Leeds and Manchester are regarded as too slow and are often overcrowded National Infrastructure Commission chairman Sir John Armitt said: ""The PM's decision today must be integrated with plans for HS2, and matched with devolved funding and powers for city leaders in the North - as set out in our National Infrastructure Assessment."" Mr Johnson wore a badge saying ""Northern Powerhouse"" during the speech. Mr Johnson is backing the route between Manchester and Leeds Labour's shadow transport secretary Mr McDonald said the plans had been ""announced time and time again by the Conservatives"". He added: ""With Boris Johnson's staggering failure to build a bridge across the Thames and an estuary airport I'm not confident he'll be able to deliver better train services between Leeds and Manchester. ""What we really need is Labour's Crossrail for the North, from Liverpool to Hull and up to the North East to unleash the economic potential of the region. ""Just upgrading the rail between Leeds and Manchester - the same distance as the Central Line on the London Underground - won't achieve that."" By Spencer Stokes, BBC Look North transport correspondent Theresa May's government had said that it supported the idea of a new, fast rail route across the Pennines in principle - but it had not found the money to make it a reality. The new rail line has been claimed to have a significant impact on journey times. Leeds to Manchester could be cut from about 50 minutes to less than 30 minutes. Local authorities in the North have campaigned for extra funds for railways following years of investment in big transport projects in London such as Crossrail - and the rebuilding of several of the capital's rail stations.

Third day of disruption for St Pancras passengersEngineers say repairs on heat-damaged equipment on the London line may not be finished until Monday.UK,"Rail passengers between London St Pancras and Nottingham and Sheffield have been urged not to travel as disruption caused by hot weather enters a third day, and conductors strike. Engineers are still trying to fix overhead line equipment near West Hampstead, north-west London. The damage was caused by the heat on Thursday - when the UK recorded its second hottest day ever. Train companies told customers to expect a reduced service until Monday. East Midlands Trains said it was running a heavily amended service on the route. Meanwhile, a second successive Saturday walkout by members of the RMT union over pay and conditions is also taking place, affecting local journeys on East Midlands Trains. Some services have been replaced by revised timetables and coach services. Some East Midlands services have been replaced by coaches The power line repairs mean tickets on East Midlands Trains and Thameslink - which runs services in and around London - are being acceptedon alternative routes,external. National Rail advised those travelling between London and Sheffield to use the line linking London King's Cross with Doncaster. It said passengers in Nottingham should travel via Grantham to King's Cross, while passengers in Leicester should travel to London Euston via Nuneaton. Thameslink told customers Network Rail has been ""unable to completely fix"" the damaged wires between St Pancras and Elstree. A reduced service is expected to run for the rest of Saturday, and Thameslink says it has requested extra rail replacement buses for Sunday. Eurostar - which runs services out of St Pancras International - was not reporting problems on its route to the Continent. Was Thursday the UK's hottest day on record?

What trade deals has the UK done?,"The UK has formally suspended trade talks with Canada despite nearly two years of negotiations, in a row over agricultural products including beef. Following Brexit and the departure from the EU's trading system in 2021, the UK has been trying to strike trade deals with countries around the world. This is the first time the UK has formally suspended talks with a potential trading partner since then. UK halts trade negotiations with Canada over hormones in beef ban It means tariffs - or taxes - may have to be paid on some UK exports to Canada such as cheese, of which the UK exported Â£18.7m worth in 2022,according to the Food and Drink Federation,external. The ability to strike free trade deals was cited by Brexit supporters as one of the benefits of leaving the EU. A free trade deal aims to encourage trade between countries by making it cheaper and simpler. It normally applies to the exchange of goods, but occasionally to services as well. Making trade cheaper is usually achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs. These are government taxes or charges for trading goods across borders and can help protect a country's manufacturers from cheap imports. A car importer might have to pay a 20% tariff on top of the vehicle's price, for example, to bring it into a country. Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs or food safety requirements. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be inspected. The UK-Japan deal was signed in October 2020 Since Brexit, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU. However, the majority of these are simply ""rollovers"" - meaning they copied the terms of deals the UK previously had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new trading arrangements. And some of them are with countries with which the UK does very little trade. A deal withJapanwas signed in October 2020. It was the first that differed from the existing EU trade deal. TheAustralia dealwas thefirst trade agreementnegotiated from scratch by the UK since it left the EU. UK farmerswarned they could be undercut by cheap imports, which could cost jobs. However, the UK government insists the deal contains protections for the sector. An agreement withNorway, Iceland and Liechtensteinwasannounced in June 2021and builds on the previous agreement the UK had with these countries. British farmers are worried about competing with cheap foreign imports, such as beef The UKsigned a new deal,externalwithNew Zealandon 28 February 2022. New Zealand is a small trading partner, accounting for less than 0.2% of total UK trade. While the deal is unlikely to boost the UK economy by much, it could lead to more New Zealand lamb being sold in the UK. The UK has also agreed to join an existing trade agreement between11 Pacific Rim nations. The governmentexpects to become a member,externalof the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in the second half of 2024. Talks withIndiabegan in early 2022, although no deal has been reached. And there has not been a deal agreed with theUS, although it had been set as a priority in the Conservative 2019 manifesto. Rishi Sunak said in June 2023that a full free trade agreement had not in fact been a priority for either country ""for a while now"", although a more limited economic agreement called the Atlantic Declaration was signed. After Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU needed to decide the rules for their future trading relationship. This was important because the EU was the UK's largest and closest trading partner. After months of negotiation - which went down to the wire - a UK-EU trade deal came into force on 1 January 2021. The deal prevented any tariffs and quotas being introduced, which would have made it more expensive to trade goods between the two partners. The UK-EU trade deal went down to the wire, with fishing proving to be one of the major sticking points But not everything is the same as it was before Brexit. As the UK no longer has to follow EU rules on product standards, new checks have been introduced. The deal also does not completely eliminate the possibility of tariffs in future. Both sides will need to stay close to shared rules in areas such as workers' rights and environmental protection. If either the UK or the EU shift their rules too far, the other side could introduce tariffs. What's in the UK-EU trade deal?

Businesses back 'Northern Crossrail',"A proposal for a Â£39bn high-speed rail project is being considered by the government More than 5,000 businesses are calling on the government to invest in a high-speed railway link across the north of England. Theproposed Â£39bn project, dubbed the ""Crossrail of the North"", would see journey times halved between major northern cities. A survey by the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) found companies believed the upgraded network would boost productivity and investment. The government is considering the plan. The report's findings have been backed by former chancellor George Osborne, who is the chair of the NPP. He said improving rail links and connecting to the proposed HS2 rail network from London to the north had the ""potential to revolutionise the Northern economy"". ""The message coming loud and clear is that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) are critical for businesses to remain, grow and invest in the North,"" he said. ""Government must hear that message and provide the funding the Northern Powerhouse so badly needs."" The report calls for the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme to be linked in with HS2 Businesses surveyed ranged from small enterprises to large multinational corporations, including Siemens and Manchester Airports Group. More than 70% of the companies said they would ""commit to new investment if NPR was confirmed"" and 85% believed that NPR would increase investment across the north. The report cites Manchester Airport as an example of how businesses could benefit from improved rail links. The airport's owners claim NPR, which was first mooted in 2014 and has also been called ""HS3"", would ""treble the number of passengers within a two-hour rail journey of Manchester Airport from 3.5 million to 10 million"". Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of Liverpool City Region said the proposal would deliver a ""boost to our economy"". ""I will ensure that we keep up the pressure on the Government to deliver the connectivity to maximise the potential in our City Region and throughout the North of England."" D-Day- A French horse called George was an unlikely hero Fracas at bell-ringing contest over parking Truck tribute to teen after Stobart snub Rail Minister Andrew Jones said: ""It's brilliant to see widespread business support for NPR, and a recognition of the importance of linking it to HS2."" The Department of Transport would not confirm when a decision on the rail line will be made. It did say the funding required for the improvements would come from the public purse. It is thought the project will cost up to Â£39bn. In 2017, more than 70,000 people signed a petition calling for Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to back the NPR rail improvements.

Trump-Johnson 'will be sensational',"Relations between the UK and the US are going to be ""sensational"" now Boris Johnson is in Downing Street, America's ambassador to the UK has said. Woody Johnson told the BBC the two had a lot in common in their leadership style and desire to ""get things done"". He played down the PM's criticism of Mr Trump when he was London mayor,when he called him ""stupefyingly ignorant"". And he said a no-deal Brexit would not affect the UK's ability to strike a trade deal with the US. The US president has welcomed Mr Johnson's rise to power, saying he would do a ""great job"" and even suggesting he was ""Britain Trump"". A supporter of Brexit, Mr Trump was critical of former Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiations with the EU. There have also been tensions over climate change and the US president's views on race and immigration, while a recent row over the leaking of British diplomatic cables led to the resignation of Sir Kim Darroch, the UK's ambassador in Washington. Six foreign policy issues the UK's new PM will face Trump: Johnson 'will do a great job as PM' Woody Johnson told Radio 4's Today his job was to focus on the ""things we agree on"". ""We're going to have bumps in the road, no question, but we are two great countries,"" he said. ""If we look forward optimistically between our two countries, we're going to lift all the people in this country - to independence and all the things you voted for in the referendum."" ""I think that's what the president wants and what your new prime minister wants too,"" he added. Woody Johnson said the UK would be ""front of the line"" for a trade deal with the US In 2015, Boris Johnson, as London Mayor, said Mr Trump's claim that parts of the city were ""no-go areas"" showed ""quite stupefying ignorance"" and made him unfit to be president. But Woody Johnson suggested Mr Trump was not bothered by the comments. ""The new relationship between your new prime minister and our president... it's going to be sensational,"" he said. ""Their leadership has a lot in common. Both have their own style but similarities - a clear vision of what they want to accomplish."" He said the UK would be at the ""front of the line"" for a trade deal once Brexit had happened and it was ""not imperative"" for the UK to leave the EU with an agreement to make progress. ""The president is going to try and move the ball forwards - the UK is our most important ally in security and prosperity. He knows that."" Most experts believe a free trade deal with the US will take years to complete and could be beset by difficulties over issues like food standards, environmental regulations and access to healthcare services for each other's companies. And one of the most powerful politicians in the US has said its Congress would not support any trade agreement which undermined the peace settlement in Northern Ireland. Angela Merkel has invited Boris Johnson to Berlin Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives,told the Irish Times,externalthere could be no return to physical border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, something Dublin has said would be inevitable if the UK left without a deal. ""We made it clear in our conversations with senior members of the Conservative Party earlier this year that there should be no return to a hard border on the island,"" she said. ""That position has not changed. Any trade deal between the US and Great Britain would have to be cognisant of that."" The new prime minister has not yet revealed when he will hold his first face-to-face leaders' meeting with Mr Trump. No 10 confirmed that Mr Johnson had spoken to the French President Emmanuel Macron over the phone on Thursday and they had discussed Brexit. A German government spokesperson also said the PM had discussed Brexit with Chancellor Angela Merkel during a phone call on Friday.

What happened to free-trade nirvana?,"If tariffs on cheddar go up, it's hard cheese for exporters ""There's a tariff of 20% on cars,"" is the shout at the front of the frenzied room near Westminster, where Trade Secretary Liam Fox and his chief trade negotiator Crawford Falconer look on at what they hope is a next generation of UK trade negotiators. The sixth-formers of the Harris Academy are used to meeting members of the cabinet: the sixth form is nestled among the ministries. They buzz around exchanging cardboard blue cars for red ones and for Monopoly money, mindful of the negative impact of Britain's terms of trade of a tax on UK exports of its cars. This is the return of an old dimension to Britain's statecraft and its economic levers. The hope of Mr Fox and his chief trade negotiator Mr Falconer is that such trade negotiation will offer a new career path for this generation to serve their nation. But it is not just the wheeling and dealing sixth-formers here who are on a steep learning curve. The Department was set up three years ago, carved out of a wing of what was then Boris Johnson's Foreign Office. Alongside David Davis at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU), this was the signal of intent from the new administration of Theresa May, Brexit meant the ""Three Brexiteers"" in charge of ""global Britain's"" external political and economic diplomacy and negotiations. Now, in the last days of the May administration, it is only Mr Fox who has remained in post. He shows me his collection of international trade diplomacy memorabilia: a Stars and Stripes from the US Congress, digitally printed steel from an UK exporter of high-tech metals to India, various sets of cufflinks and his own centuries-old insignia - the flag of the president of the Board of Trade. Under a very old convention, the Navy are obliged to fly his flag when he is on board one of their vessels, he tells me, and they did in New York last autumn. But it is his framed copy of the 2016 EU referendum ballot paper that he appears to cherish the most. He picks it up, shows it to me and declares: ""To remind us all about our democratic duty to deliver Brexit - this is the spare,"" he tells me. And for many, the entire point of Brexit is what his department has been set up to do - negotiate new trade deals for the UK alone after regaining an independent trade policy. The record so far has not lived up to the confident predictions made during the referendum about the ease of such deals. On one level, this is simply down to not having left the EU. But it is also about the continuing uncertainty about the nature of our relationship going forward with the EU. And it isn't even just that. Liam Fox says his department's role is largely to promote exports When I ask Mr Fox about the rather mixed bag on trade deals, he points out that 80% of what his department does is about promoting exports and inward investment. And on that measure, Â£30.5bn extra exports and 50,000 jobs created or protected by his department's promotion of foreign direct investment shows it's value for money. But on trade policy? ""We have a whole range of frustrations, you're quite right. Every time we have to play Grand Old Duke of York once again and we have to march our trading partners up to the point of no deal and then it comes back down again. It frustrates them and it frustrates us. ""We aren't able to negotiate any new trade agreements until after we've left the EU, so we get ready for the point of exit and twice it hasn't come, so we're better prepared than we were, the country in general is better prepared than we were, but there are still legal hurdles we have to get over if we want to get new trade agreements,"" he tells me. But it isn't quite as simple as that. In lieu of the actual big new trade deals that have to wait until after Brexit, the department has focused on the important work of keeping the existing terms British businesses enjoy as part of the European Union, with 70 countries through 40 EU deals. Only 12 have been ""rolled over"". South Korea was an important success. It signed up partly to protect its car exports to the UK from the imposition of a 10% no deal tariff, but also to gain first-mover advantage on Japan. But this is trade whack-a-mole - the same publication of the no-deal tariffs in March also led the Canadians to calculate they simply did not need to accept the UK offer of a continuity deal at all. There is a separate but related ""Rules of Origin"" problem too. EU manufacturers have been told by their governments that UK parts will not count as ""made in the EU"". If they use too many UK parts, their products risk not qualifying for tariff-free treatment when exported to those same countries such as South Korea. Those supply chains, manufacturers say, are beginning to break. Even rollover deals can't really help here. The impact of all this can be seen at Combe Castle dairy exporters in Melksham, Wiltshire. ""It's a disaster,"" Peter Mitchell, the operations director tells me. Just under a third of its business is exporting cheese to Canada, zero-tariff under the EU-Canada Ceta deal. He points to a giant block of cheddar worth about Â£500 in sales, just about to be shipped to Toronto. The tariff under no-deal Brexit, now that the Canadians have turned down a rollover continuity deal, is an incredible Â£1,200 or 245%. Their cream products face an increase from 0% to 293%. This is literally what trading on WTO terms means for a business that has successfully exported globally for three-and-a-half decades. He questions whether cabinet ministers really understand the detail. The PM's trade envoy to Canada, Andrew Percy MP, resigned on Monday for other reasons. But he was known to be frustrated by the impact of no-deal tariffs on the rollover. One calculation is that it will lead to Â£800m in lost business for UK exporters. The trade secretary acknowledges that Canada did not need to do a deal, but warns them that a new UK administration could change the no-deal tariffs only recently announced. ""In the case of Canada, we set out what would be emergency Day 1 [no-deal] tariffs, which allow 87% of goods coming into the UK to be tariff-free,"" says Mr Fox. ""The Canadians not unreasonably said, why should we put even more resource into a trade agreements when we can get access to your markets for nothing. The point here is they are temporary, and we will have a new PM and a new cabinet and they may take a different view on that. ""My advice to my Canadian colleagues and others is, get the safety net in place. Your businesses will criticise you for being over-prepared, but they will criticise you for being under-prepared if the worst happens and we introduce trade frictions that wouldn't otherwise be there."" Changing the no-deal tariffs, however, risks setting off another round of whack-a-mole. Many retailers, importers and other trade partners have acted and planned on the basis of the numbers published in March. ""Of course they can change. We've made very clear from the outset that these were tariffs that would probably last six to 12 months before the government would review them. And therefore our advice was and is to our trading partners - don't take the risk of there being trading friction that you don't need to have, let's have a continuity agreement,"" Mr Fox told me. There has been something of a mystery around how the original no-deal tariffs emerged. They were considered by a cabinet sub-committee, and full cabinet, but there was a not a proper and full process of consultation with tens of thousands of affected businesses, nor a real debate about their impact in Parliament. Some Commonwealth allies pushed back against sharing out existing EU quotas, fearing a restriction on their exports of lamb and beef Mr Fox says they were designed to keep price rises down and protect some selected businesses from foreign competition. ""The no-deal tariffs we set out were designed to not produce an inflationary shock to the UK, because we had to ensure that people on lower pay would not find their wages bought less in the shops, so that was the main priority of the government,"" he says. ""And we wanted to ensure that these goods that come to the UK and then incorporated into our exports don't become more expensive and make us less competitive. Clearly there are some of our industries that need protecting - we've looked at ceramics and elements of farming that we will need to continue to give protection."" They have also tried to keep trade preferences for developing countries. But that has led to odd distortions, with retailers pondering why men's shirts will have a tariff of 12%, but women's blouses 0%. The department did make quick progress with the regularisation of the UK's membership of the World Trade Organisation. But then some countries, including Commonwealth allies, pushed back hard against the exercise to share out existing EU quotas, fearing a restriction on their exports of lamb and beef. Mr Fox says ""very few countries objected"" to the laying of the new UK goods schedule - the list of applicable tariffs - and that there are now ""some small details on access to quotas"" which are currently being dealt with at the WTO. One nation objected to the services schedule - Russia. ""It was hardly a big surprise to us. all these things happened within the predictable range."" Is this not the fundamental predictable outcome of trying to do trade deals with the whole world at the same time, at a time when they know the UK government is desperate to do so? Mr Fox says no, that in terms of the new trade deals, that can only get going after the UK has left the EU and its Common Commercial Policy, ""We are only going to do three - the US, Australia and New Zealand."" The government has also consulted on joining the rebranded Trans-Pacific Partnership, the CPTPP, but ""that's not possible to join because all the countries there have not yet ratified it"". The US deal is another story. But Mr Fox has sought to calm down the haste over a transatlantic deal, which he wants ""as soon as possible"". ASAP has ""a number of logistical wrinkles"", he says, principally that the US will be in the final year of a presidential term ""when it is notoriously difficult to get the attention of the Administration"". ""It's also the position now in the US that the Democrats have a majority in the House of Representatives and might not want to give the president a trade agreement this side of a presidential election. So there are a number of real-world problems."" He also acknowledged other geopolitical issues in the US-UK relationship. The role of Chinese telecoms provider Huawei, the UK tech tax, even the leaked cables from resigned former ambassador Sir Kim Darroch have all complicated the relationship. The Irish border is 310 miles long Mr Fox also revealed to BBC News that those Democrats in Congress had raised a specific and very thorny issue with him at a meeting in Washington DC this month. Asked whether the government was conscious that Democrats in the key committee were saying they could block a US-UK trade deal if there was any impact on the Irish border or Good Friday agreement, the Trade secretary replied: ""We need to be aware of it - I spoke to a number of the Democrat members of the Ways and Means committee [a key Congressional committee with oversight on trade deals] when I was in Washington two weeks ago and they did raise those issues with me, ""I was able to reassure them that both the UK government and Irish government do not want any hard border infrastructure at all to be in place, so I think they will wait and see."" A member of the US Congress confirmed to the BBC that several Democrats on the key committee raised the same point directly to the trade secretary that they would block a US-UK trade deal which saw any hardening of the Irish border. For many of the keenest advocates of junking the Irish border backstop, and leaving the customs union and single market, the entire point is to do a quick free trade deal with the US. So the clearly articulated prospect of a Congressional quagmire creates rather a paradox. All of this occurs against the backdrop of choppy global trade waters, with the US squaring up to China, and to some degree the EU too. The UK does not expect and is not getting favours. Trade deals are about brutal self-interest. Eventually they can and will be done. But there is little doubt that the ease, comfort and generosity of the rest of the world was oversold. Boris Johnson himself will remember necking some peach juice from Fukushima for his then counterpart the Japanese Foreign Minister's Twitter campaign to demonstrate safety of produce from the area of the nuclear power disaster. The UK, at the time seeking a Japanese deal, agreed to lobby the EU to lift its ban on produce from the area. There may be many more such examples to come. Does the Trade Secretary himself acknowledge it's been much harder to do these deals than sold? ""I'm not sure harder, but it's certainly more complex and it's also more interesting,"" he says. He says as the UK leaves the EU, it does so more confidently and optimistically than he could have imagined at the time of the referendum. ""But we have to do it with our eyes open and understand the problems as well as the opportunities that we might face."" The fledgling Department of International Trade certainly has had a number of wins. But it was never going to be easy to do even the basic rollover deals, and certainly not as easy as some of his political colleagues had claimed. Matters may not settle for a while yet, as the high-level trade-offs over trade policy become very high politics indeed. What trade deals has the UK done so far?

What next for high-speed northern rail?,"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling risked turning himself into a hate figure for train passengers in the north of England, Wales and the Midlands when he ditched long-promised rail electrification schemes last month. What angered many people,including newly-elected mayors Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, was Mr Grayling's simultaneous decision to get behind a Â£30bn scheme to build a new electric railway in London. It seemed like a classic case of the regions being starved of investment in favour of the south-east of England. Mr Grayling hopes to redeem himself by delivering faster, more reliable train services, with far less disruption to passengers while the work is being carried out, by using ""smarter"" technology. But he faces scepticism from political and business leaders, particularly in the north of England, home of the much-vaunted Northern Powerhouse. Campaigners plan to step up pressure on Mr Grayling when MPs return from their summer break. They want guarantees he is not softening up northern England for a let-down on the promise of a fast, modern transport network that will enable the region to compete with London and the South East for global business. Manchester MP Graham Stringer, a member of the transport committee, has written to its new Labour chairman Lillian Greenwood to ask her to invite Mr Grayling and Network Rail bosses in for a grilling. The Labour MP wants reassurances that plans to extend the new HS2 high speed line to Manchester and Leeds will not be sidelined by Crossrail 2, the new Â£30bn electric railway planned for London. Chris Grayling has insisted the north of England will not lose out Mr Stringer fears the mammoth ""hybrid bills"" required to get the two projects into law will lead to a parliamentary log jam, with the north ultimately losing out. ""I am worried that resources and parliamentary time are being sucked into the South East,"" Mr Stringer told BBC News. He also wants reassurances that revised plans to modernise east-west rail links in the north of England will be up to the job of dealing with extra passengers set to be delivered by HS2. One scheme that is definitely happening is the Â£85m project to link Piccadilly with Manchester's other main railway stations, Victoria and Oxford Road, which is due to be completed by the end of the year. But Mr Stringer is concerned that the government will pull the plug on plans for two new platforms at Manchester's Piccadilly station, to cope with the increase in passengers passing through it. Mr Graylinghas reportedly asked Network Rail,externalif they can ""do something with digital technology"" to increase capacity without building new platforms. How the new HS2 station at Leeds might look Former chancellor George Osborne's plan to link up northern English cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds into a single economic ""powerhouse"" hinged on faster trains and better connections. Work is under way to electrify the Transpennine rail route, from Liverpool to Newcastle - but although the final investment decision is not due until next year, Mr Grayling has suggested overhead wires will not now be installed along the entire route. Hitachi trains have been ordered for bi-mode routes He has also scrapped plans to electrify routes between Cardiff and Swansea; Kettering, Nottingham and Sheffield; and Windermere and Oxenholme. He says new ""bi-mode"" trains, which can transfer seamlessly from electric to diesel power, mean there is no need to spend money on ""difficult"" work to fit Victorian tunnels and track with overhead power cables. Network Rail has promised the bi-mode trains will ""deliver faster, longer, more frequent and more reliable services across the north of England, from Newcastle, Hull and York towards Manchester and Liverpool via Leeds"" by 2022. When the plan was to electrify the entire line, estimates were made of improved journey times, with the 50 minute to an hour's trip from Manchester to Leeds predicted to be cut by 15 minutes. But Network Rail has declined to issue new estimates for ""bi-mode"" journey times until it has completed a ""scoping exercise"" on the different options, which it will deliver to the Department for Transport in December. Bi-mode trains, such as those built by Hitachi Rail at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, are capable of running at 140mph in electric mode, although they will initially be limited to 125mph. They tend to be heavier than electric-only or diesel-only trains, which can hamper acceleration on routes with steep gradients such as the Leeds to Manchester route. But Hitachi said its bi-mode trains are just 5% heavier and have more power and better acceleration rates than the trains they are replacing. Journey times will depend on how many stops the trains make and the route they take. HS2 electric trains are set to improve journey times Think tank IPPR North is urging the government to commit to a high speed all-electric rail link between Manchester and Leeds, that would dramatically cut journey times, as part of a broader Northern Powerhouse Rail programme. They are also calling for Â£59bn in ""catch up cash"" over the next 10 years to fund schemes drawn up by Transport for North, an alliance of local authorities and business groups, as well as new powers for the group to raise private finance. IPPR North director Ed Cox said: ""Businesses and commuters in the north have been outraged by recent government announcements about transport in the north [of England], so much so that over 50,000 people have signed our online petition demanding fresh commitments to transport spending and devolution. ""This is not simply about fairness, it's about unlocking the potential of the northern economy and finally realising that northern prosperity is national prosperity."" Business groups are expected to step up their lobbying of ministers at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester at the start of October. Damian Waters, the CBI's North West director, said: ""It's vital that projects in different parts of the country are not seen as 'either or'. ""Improving the north of England's infrastructure should come at the same time as enhancements in the south."" Rail union the TSSA is also running a Rally for Rail campaign, calling on the government to reverse the decision to cancel electrification in northern England, Midlands and Wales, which has been backed by Labour MPs and regional development organisations. A Department for Transport spokesman said the government was committed to improving journey times and connecting communities in the north of England. ""Major upgrades to the Manchester - Leeds - York route are currently being designed and developed, to enable us to deliver more improvements for rail passengers from 2022. ""We are also working with the region to develop plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail, which aims to dramatically improve journey times between the major cities of the north. ""Passengers expect high quality rail services and we are committed to electrification where it delivers benefits, but will also take advantage of new technology to improve journeys.""

Business backs 'Northern Crossrail',"A proposal for a Â£39bn high-speed rail project is being considered by the government More than 5,000 businesses are calling on the government to invest in a high-speed railway link across the north of England. Theproposed Â£39bn project, dubbed the ""Crossrail of the North"", would see journey times halved between major northern cities. A survey by the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) found companies believed the upgraded network would boost productivity and investment. The government is considering the plan. The report's findings have been backed by former chancellor George Osborne, who is the chair of the NPP. He said improving rail links and connecting to the proposed HS2 rail network from London to the north had the ""potential to revolutionise the Northern economy"". ""The message coming loud and clear is that HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) are critical for businesses to remain, grow and invest in the North,"" he said. ""Government must hear that message and provide the funding the Northern Powerhouse so badly needs."" The report calls for the Northern Powerhouse Rail scheme to be linked in with HS2 Businesses surveyed ranged from small enterprises to large multinational corporations, including Siemens and Manchester Airports Group. More than 70% of the companies said they would ""commit to new investment if NPR was confirmed"" and 85% believed that NPR would increase investment across the north. The report cites Manchester Airport as an example of how businesses could benefit from improved rail links. The airport's owners claim NPR, which was first mooted in 2014 and has also been called ""HS3"", would ""treble the number of passengers within a two-hour rail journey of Manchester Airport from 3.5 million to 10 million"". Steve Rotheram, Metro Mayor of Liverpool City Region said the proposal would deliver a ""boost to our economy"". ""I will ensure that we keep up the pressure on the Government to deliver the connectivity to maximise the potential in our City Region and throughout the North of England."" D-Day- A French horse called George was an unlikely hero Fracas at bell-ringing contest over parking Truck tribute to teen after Stobart snub Rail Minister Andrew Jones said: ""It's brilliant to see widespread business support for NPR, and a recognition of the importance of linking it to HS2."" The Department of Transport would not confirm when a decision on the rail line will be made. It did say the funding required for the improvements would come from the public purse. It is thought the project will cost up to Â£39bn. In 2017, more than 70,000 people signed a petition calling for Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to back the NPR rail improvements.

"Sports Direct regrets House of Fraser rescueThe retailer outlines the problems at the department store, as its delayed results reveal a â¬674m tax bill.Business","Sports Direct says it regrets rescuing House of Fraser inits much-delayed results,external, which revealed a â¬674m (Â£605m) tax bill from Belgian authorities. The firm, which bought the department store out of administration a year ago, said: ""If we had the gift of hindsight we might have made a different decision in August 2018."" It described problems at House of Fraser as ""nothing short of terminal"". It added it was in talks with Belgian officials to resolve the tax bill. The full-year results had been due to be published on 15 July but were delayed until 26 July, in part, because of uncertainty over the future trading performance of House of Fraser. How Mike Ashley built Sports Direct into a retail empire Mike Ashley: The saviour of the High Street? Mike Ashley tells Debenhams execs to take lie detector test Those results had been expected to be published on Friday morning, but were subject to continuous delays throughout the day. It has now emerged that Sports Direct, which is majority-owned and run by billionaire Mike Ashley, was hit by the tax bill by Belgian authorities on 25 July. The company said the request for back taxes is linked to the way its goods are moved throughout the European Union and are taxed in Belgium. Meanwhile, it also said that its chief financial officer of two years, Jon Kempster, is stepping down and will be succeeded by his deputy, Chris Wootton. Commenting on House of Fraser, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: ""It's a House of horrors, more like."" He said Sports Direct had ""every reason to regret buying House of Fraser now"". ""It's such a shame as there were such high hopes,"" he added. Mr Ashley had vowed to turn House of Fraser into the ""Harrods of the High Street"" when he bought the department store chain out of administration for Â£90m last August. However, on Friday he said: ""In the short-term you can't justify it. It's like buying a broken down car at the roadside - you have to get it to the garage to fix it."" But he said: ""Long-term, we'd like to think we are hopeful of where we are going."" By Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance reporter With the benefit of hindsight, buying House of Fraser looks to Mike Ashley like buying a millstone and tying it around his own neck. He paid Â£90m to the administrators and has seen his Sports Direct profits reduced by Â£51m since then. That's been the cost of keeping House of Fraser going. Now a cull of the stores is about to start. There are still 54. Not many have gone while he tested which ones had a future. Some carried on losing money even after he had bullied the landlords into charging zero rent. Mr Ashley warned that there is going to be ""a lot of store closures"" in the coming months, with smaller outlets in smaller towns most at risk. When I asked him if that meant most House of Fraser stores would be shut down, he answered ""no"" but it is clear that thousands of jobs could be in danger. Before House of Fraser went into administration last year - it was planning to shut 31 of its 59 stores.  Sports Direct said it could close some stores - but didn't say how many. It said: ""There are still a number of stores which are currently paying zero rent and that are still unprofitable, and unfortunately this is not sustainable. ""We are continuing to review the longer-term portfolio and would expect the number of retained stores to reduce in the next 12 months."" Sports Direct said that it is working hard to turn House of Fraser around, but said ""it will not be easy"". ""On a scale out of five, with one being very bad and five being very good, House of Fraser is a one,"" the company added. For the year to 28 April, underlying profits at Sports Direct dropped by 6% to Â£287.8m. However, taking out House of Fraser, Sports Direct's income rose by 10.9%. Total full-year sales grew by 10.2% to Â£3.7bn.
