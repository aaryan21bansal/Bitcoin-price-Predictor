Warm winter ruins German ice wine harvest,"Ice wine is a dessert wine produced from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine Germany's harvest of ice wine - a dessert wine produced from grapes that have frozen while still on the vine - has failed for the first time because the winter has been too warm. None of Germany's 13 wine-growing regions had the necessary temperatures of -7C to produce the wine in 2019. 2019 was the second-warmest year on record globally, according to the US National Oceans and Air Administration. The amount of ice wine produced has been dropping in recent years. ""The 2019 vintage will go down in history here in Germany as the first year in which the ice harvest has failed nationwide,"" the German Wine Institute (DWI) said in a statement. ""If the warm winters continue in the next few years, ice wines from German wine regions will soon become even more of a rarity than they already are,"" said Ernst BÃ¼scher from the DWI. Last decade confirmed as warmest on record Another problem for ice wine production is that, in recent years, the dates for a possible ice harvest have shifted later - to January and February - while the grapes are ripening earlier, the DWI said. As a result, the grapes need to survive for longer. The biggest ice wine markets include Japan and China as well as the Scandinavian countries and the US. Due to their inherently low yields, ice wines have a very small share of the total harvest, often less than 0.1%.

S Korea sect leader faces coronavirus murder probe,"This video can not be played 'We're often persecuted': Spokesman for virus-hit S Korean church defends secrecy (March 2020) The leader of a religious sect in South Korea will be investigated over some of the country's coronavirus deaths. The city government of the capital Seoul has asked prosecutors to charge Lee Man-hee, the founder of the Shincheonji Church, and 11 others. They are accused of hiding the names of some members as officials tried to track patients before the virus spread. South Korea is battling the worst coronavirus outbreak outside China. The country has reported 3,730 cases and 21 deaths so far. More than half of all infections involve members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a fringe Christian group. Authorities say Shincheonji members infected one another in the southern city of Daegu last month, before fanning out around the country. This video can not be played Watch how germs spread and how you can prevent it One senior member, Kim Shin-chang, told the BBC's Laura Bicker that the church was ""very sorry for causing concern"". He admitted that some church members had been afraid to reveal their identities but said the church had now revealed all of its information, including all its locations and members. ""We were worried about releasing this kind of information because of the safety of our members, but we believe right now the most important thing is to fully cooperate with the government,"" he said. On Sunday the Seoul City government filed a legal complaint to prosecutors against 12 leaders of the sect. They are accused of homicide, causing harm and violating the Infectious Disease and Control Act. All 230,000 members of the church have been interviewed. Nearly 9,000 said they were showing symptoms of coronavirus. A 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive for the virus was among the first to be infected. She initially refused to be taken to a hospital to be tested and is known to have attended several church gatherings before testing positive. The sect's leader, Lee Man-hee, claims he is the Messiah. He has also been tested for the virus and is awaiting the results. Roman Catholic churches remain closed, major Protestant groups have cancelled Sunday services and all Buddhist events have been called off. Growing anger over the sect's handling of the outbreak has sparked a petition calling for the church to be disbanded. Nearly 1.2m people have signed it. This investigation has been sparked by Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon, who urged the Chief Prosecutor to detain the sect leader. He warned that he would request a criminal investigation for homicide by wilful negligence and, on Sunday evening, he filed the claim with the prosecutor's office. But this does not mean the church leaders will face murder charges. It means prosecutors will have to look into the case. Once prosecutors have finished their investigation they will decide which charges, if any, to bring against the sect. Lee Man-hee, 88, claims he is the second coming of Jesus Christ and identifies as ""the promised pastor"" mentioned in the Bible. He founded the Shincheonji Church in 1984. In Korean, Shincheonji means ""new heaven and earth"". The group is considered a cult by many. Mr Lee's followers believe he will take 144,000 people to heaven with him. The church says it has more than 20,000 followers outside of South Korea including in China, Japan and areas of Southeast Asia. The group is known for packing its followers tightly together during services. Glasses, necklaces and earrings are reportedly banned from services.

A 78-year-old Australian man died after being infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan last month. Thailand, which has had 42 cases of the virus, said a 35-year-old man who died was also suffering from dengue fever. In Paris, the Louvre museum did not open on Sunday. The museum said on Twitter a meeting was being held on the public health situation and ""the museum cannot open at the moment"". France has banned all indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people, as part of efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

NHS gender clinic 'should have challenged me more',"This video can not be played Keira Bell: 'I should have been challenged on my transition' A 23-year-old woman who is taking legal action against an NHS gender clinic says she should have been challenged more by medical staff over her decision to transition to a male as a teenager. A judge gave the go-ahead for a full hearing of the case against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. Lawyers will argue children cannot give informed consent to treatment delaying puberty or helping them to transition. The Tavistock said it always took a cautious approach to treatment. Gender identity charity Mermaids said that people face a long wait for access to such services, that they can save lives and that very few people regret their decision. The clinic based in Hampstead, north-west London, which runs the UK's only gender-identity development service (GIDS), added that it welcomed an examination of the evidence in this contentious area. NHS use of puberty blockers legal challenge begins What are puberty blockers? Transgender people face NHS waiting list 'hell' Keira Bell is one of the claimants and will give evidence in the judicial review, which is likely to be heard in early summer. The second claimant, known only as Mum A, is the mother of a 15-year-old girl with autism, who is awaiting treatment at the clinic. Keira describes being a tomboy as a child. When asked how strongly she felt the need to change her gender identity, she replied that it gradually built up as she found out more about transitioning online. Then as she went down the medical route, she said ""one step led to another"". She was referred to the Tavistock GIDS clinic at the age of 16. She said after three one-hour-long appointments she was prescribed puberty blockers, which delay the development of signs of puberty, like periods or facial hair. She felt there wasn't enough investigation or therapy before she reached that stage. ""I should have been challenged on the proposals or the claims that I was making for myself,""  she said. ""And I think that would have made a big difference as well. If I was just challenged on the things I was saying."" What are puberty blockers? They are drugs which can pause the development of things like breasts, periods, facial hair and voice breaking They can be prescribed to children with gender dysphoria who feel their sex at birth doesn't match up with their gender. This is meant to give them more time to weigh up their options before they go through the physical changes of puberty. Although puberty blockers are described by the NHS as reversible, GIDS acknowledgesthat their impact on brain development and psychological health is not fully known,external. A year after starting the puberty-blockers she said she was prescribed the male hormone testosterone, which developed male characteristics like facial hair and a deep voice. Three years ago, she had an operation to remove her breasts. ""Initially I felt very relieved and happy about things, but I think as the years go on you start to feel less and less enthusiastic or even happy about things. ""You can continue and dig yourself deeper into this hole or you can choose to come out of it and have the weight lifted off your shoulders."" She decided to stop taking cross-sex hormones last year and said she was now accepting of her sex as a female. But she was also angry about what had happened to her in the last decade. ""I was allowed to run with this idea that I had, almost like a fantasy, as a teenager.... and it has affected me in the long run as an adult. ""I'm very young. I've only just stepped into adulthood and I have to deal with this kind of burden or radical difference - in comparison to others at least."" Keira's lawyers will argue that children cannot weigh up the impact such a treatment might have on their future life, including for instance, on their fertility. Former staff at the clinic have raised concerns that teenagers who want to transition to a different gender are being given puberty blockers without adequate assessment or psychological work. It has been claimed that children as young as 12 have received the drugs, which block the hormones that lead to puberty-related changes like periods or facial hair. But she also understands why teenagers arrive at the clinic deeply distressed and desperate to change their gender. ""I did say the same thing years ago when I went to the clinic. I would say it was saving me from suicidal ideation and depression in general and at the time I felt it relieved all those mental health issues I was feeling, alongside gender dysphoria."" This video can not be played Gender transitioning 'saves lives', says charity chief She described her family life as difficult. She also believes if she had felt more accepted by society as she was then, she might not have wanted to change her gender. She added that she wouldn't have wanted to listen to voices of caution when she was younger. ""I feel I could say anything to my 16-year-old self and I might not necessarily listen at that time. And that's the point of this case, when you are that young you don't really want to listen. ""So I think it's up to these institutions, like the Tavistock, to step in and make children reconsider what they are saying, because it is a life-altering path."" Dr Polly Carmichael is the consultant clinical psychologist who runs the Gender Identity Development Service. She praised Keira for speaking out, but insisted the clinic did have a thorough assessment process. She described their approach as cautious and said they work closely with children and their families to reach the right decisions for them, with fewer than half of those seen going onto take puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones. ""This is a really complex area with strong feelings on all sides. And at its centre, the young people we work with - they come to us in often really great distress around their sense of themselves. ""We're talking about identity here, their identity, and a feeling that their gender identity does not match that body."" She believes the judicial review, when it happens, will be an important opportunity to ensure the evidence around treatment and a child's ability to consent is thoroughly examined. ""This is a heated debate at the moment. And I think taking a step back - and having an external considered review of the evidence and people's feelings about the most appropriate way to support young people - can be nothing but beneficial at this point."" Gender identity charity Mermaids provides support to trans and gender-diverse young people and their families. Its chief executive, Susie Green, has defended the current process, which she said was based on years of research, and said she hoped the judicial review would ""shine a light"" on young people's experiences. She told BBC News that many people who approached the charity were ""very distressed"" and that research had suggested puberty blockers could help reduce rates of self-harm and suicide. And she said it was ""not proportionate"" to take away services because of ""a very small number"" of people who regretted undergoing medical intervention. ""In the first instance the waiting time is well over two years and when young people get into the service there is then a process which takes well into a year before medical intervention is considered,"" she told BBC News. ""The process is very detailed they get a lot of information about the benefits, the pitfalls and the projected outcomes of what comes of any kind of medication. So they make informed consent and that underpins the NHS."" NHS England is an interested party in the legal case. It has alreadyannounced an independent review of its policies,externalon the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. It describes this as part of a planned examination, which will be undertaken by a panel of independent experts.

Storm Jorge: New floods 'won't be as extreme',"Dave Throup, from the Environment Agency, said there was ""miles and miles of water"" on the Severn's floodplains south of Worcester Further floods are expected in parts of the West Midlands after Storm Jorge, the Environment Agency (EA) has said. However, these floods will be ""less extreme"" than those seen along the River Severn earlier in the week. Hundreds of homes were evacuated and there were two severe flood warnings in Shropshire, meaning a danger to life. Dave Throup, from the EA, said the river was due to peak overnight and into Monday but would be up to a metre below the levels seen previously. Flood defences in Ironbridge that were damaged by the deluge are ""good to go,"" he added. ""Herculean efforts"" saw damaged flood defences in Ironbridge repaired in time for Storm Jorge The temporary barriers were pushed back by up to two metresdue to the force of the water on Wednesday, meaning water was able to seep beneath them. The EA said at nearby Buildwas 300 tonnes of water was flowing through the Severn every second on Sunday morning and water levels were starting to rise. An average of 202.1mm rainfall fell last month, data from the Met Office shows,making it the wettest February since records began. River levels along the Severn will be high but not as ""extreme"" as earlier in the week The Severn is expected to peak in Shrewsbury overnight with the peak moving downstream through Monday and Tuesday. The EA, expects the river to peak at up to 5.7m in Ironbridge on Monday afternoon - one metre less than the levels it reached on Wednesday. ""It's still very high but not the absolutely extreme levels we saw this week,"" Mr Throup said. The river will get ""high enough to be on our defences,"" he added, and there are still flood warnings in place. In Bewdley, Worcestershire, where flood defences were overtopped on Tuesday, the river is expected to reach its highest peak on Tuesday morning at around 4.5m. Residents in Ironbridge have been able to return home after the ""extreme"" flooding Vicki Gaffney's home in Tenbury Wells, which is along the River Teme, is one of more than 100 that was flooded in the town earlier this week. ""We've just been given the very depressing news that we've got a timeline of about six to nine months to be back in the house,"" she said.  ""I'm finding that really hard."" Tenbury Wells was flooded during Storm Dennis and has no defences to protect it The town has no flood defences and Ms Gaffney said that has to change. Her thoughts were echoed by Olivia and Stephen Higgins who run a shop on the high street. ""You feel totally alone,"" Ms Higgins said. ""We're no less important than the bigger towns that flood, but that's how we're made to feel - bottom of the list."" Residents in Bewdley had to be rescued from floods after the Severn overtopped defences on Tuesday In Worcester, the EA said ""everything is expected to stay stable"" - levels aren't looking likely to increase but nor is the river expected to go down ""until probably mid week"". ""It is very high water levels,"" Mr Throup said, but the city is coping and ""fully open for business"". Along the River Wye in Herefordshire, levels have peaked about a metre and a half below what was recorded earlier in the week. Despite incredible amounts of water, Upton-upon-Severn is ""fully open,"" Mr Throup said ""I don't think that's going to cause too many problems,"" Mr Throup said. ""We're hoping for the best during this week but we'll be monitoring the situation closely.""

Mr Biden, a former vice-president, won decisively in South Carolina's primary, where voters chose which Democrat they want to be the party's candidate. Left-winger Bernie Sanders came second in South Carolina - the fourth state to vote in the months-long primary season - and remains in the lead overall. Another 14 states vote on Super Tuesday this week. By the end of Super Tuesday, it could become much clearer who the nominee will be. This is Mr Biden's first-ever victory in a primary in what is his third run for US president. In his speech welcoming the result, the 77-year-old said: ""Just days ago the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead. Now, thanks to all of you - the heart of the Democratic Party - we just won, and we've won big."" Mr Biden won 48.4% of the share, ahead of Mr Sanders on 19.9% and billionaire hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer on 11.3%. It is Mr Steyer's best performance of the primaries, but he will now end his campaign, leaving seven candidates in the running. Mr Biden had been pinning his hopes on a strong result in the southern state, after performing poorly in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. He regularly cited his strong support among African-Americans, and polls suggest an endorsement by influential black congressman James Clyburn significantly influenced voting patterns. This video can not be played The biggest myth about the ""black vote"" Victory allows Mr Biden to make the case that he is the best-placed moderate Democrat to take on Mr Trump. The winners and losers from South Carolina The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts Candidates who have won more than 15% of the vote in South Carolina are awarded delegates, who will then go to the party's convention in July to support their Democratic candidate. In his speech, Mr Biden attacked Mr Sanders without naming him. ""Folks, win big or lose, that's the choice,"" he said. ""Most Americans don't want the promises of revolution. They want more than promises. They want results."" Super Tuesday is the most important date in the race to pick the nominee. Democrats in 14 states will vote (as well as American Samoa and Democrats Abroad). A massive1,357 delegateswill be distributed - almost a third of all those available through the entire primary season, and the two most populous states, California and Texas, will be voting. The candidates hoping to unseat Trump What are primaries and how do they work? The entire picture could change in one day. Or we could see Mr Sanders cement his lead as the front-runner - and even extend into a near-unbeatable lead. This will also be the first time that New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg will be on the ballot. The performance of moderates like Mr Biden on Super Tuesday will be determined to some degree by that of Mr Bloomberg. We've pulled together a guide on what to look out for in each state on Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday explained (with moose, cod and dinosaurs) WHO IS HE?Third White House run for 'Middle Class Joe Biden' WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS SAY:Is this Joe Bidenâs big comeback? ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL:Watch Biden on 'No Malarkey' tour WHERE HE STANDS:Against other Democrats like Obama A SIMPLE GUIDE:All you need to know about the presidential race South Carolina had been billed as Joe Biden's last stand - where he poured time and resources into securing a positive result. Just a few weeks ago, as his poll numbers sank across the nation, it also appeared it would be his campaign's final resting place. Instead, after a week of furious effort, South Carolina gave Biden his first primary victory of the year - his first win in any of his three presidential bids, in fact. Biden may have one man in particular to thank for his success: Congressman James Clyburn, a powerful voice in the state's black community, who endorsed the vice-president on Wednesday. Exit polls indicate Clyburn's backing was an important factor for about half of the primary voters - and probably one of the reasons Biden posted such a dominating performance among the state's black voters. If he can match that kind of showing in states to come, he's going to give Bernie Sanders a tough fight. Biden is going to have to hope his success in South Carolina translates into a surge on Super Tuesday without much assistance from his campaign, however. He only recently began advertising in the upcoming states, and a Saturday afternoon trip to North Carolina was the first time he left South Carolina in almost a week. He's still running on a wing and a prayer, but at least for one night and in one state, those prayers were answered.

How is the UK planning for an outbreak?,"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

S Korea sect leader to face charges over virus,"This video can not be played 'We're often persecuted': Spokesman for virus-hit S Korean church defends secrecy (March 2020) The leader of a religious sect in South Korea will be investigated over some of the country's coronavirus deaths. The city government of the capital Seoul has asked prosecutors to charge Lee Man-hee, the founder of the Shincheonji Church, and 11 others. They are accused of hiding the names of some members as officials tried to track patients before the virus spread. South Korea is battling the worst coronavirus outbreak outside China. The country has reported 3,730 cases and 21 deaths so far. More than half of all infections involve members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a fringe Christian group. Authorities say Shincheonji members infected one another in the southern city of Daegu last month, before fanning out around the country. This video can not be played Watch how germs spread and how you can prevent it One senior member, Kim Shin-chang, told the BBC's Laura Bicker that the church was ""very sorry for causing concern"". He admitted that some church members had been afraid to reveal their identities but said the church had now revealed all of its information, including all its locations and members. ""We were worried about releasing this kind of information because of the safety of our members, but we believe right now the most important thing is to fully cooperate with the government,"" he said. On Sunday the Seoul City government filed a legal complaint to prosecutors against 12 leaders of the sect. They are accused of homicide, causing harm and violating the Infectious Disease and Control Act. All 230,000 members of the church have been interviewed. Nearly 9,000 said they were showing symptoms of coronavirus. A 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive for the virus was among the first to be infected. She initially refused to be taken to a hospital to be tested and is known to have attended several church gatherings before testing positive. The sect's leader, Lee Man-hee, claims he is the Messiah. He has also been tested for the virus and is awaiting the results. Roman Catholic churches remain closed, major Protestant groups have cancelled Sunday services and all Buddhist events have been called off. Growing anger over the sect's handling of the outbreak has sparked a petition calling for the church to be disbanded. Nearly 1.2m people have signed it. This investigation has been sparked by Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon, who urged the Chief Prosecutor to detain the sect leader. He warned that he would request a criminal investigation for homicide by wilful negligence and, on Sunday evening, he filed the claim with the prosecutor's office. But this does not mean the church leaders will face murder charges. It means prosecutors will have to look into the case. Once prosecutors have finished their investigation they will decide which charges, if any, to bring against the sect. Lee Man-hee, 88, claims he is the second coming of Jesus Christ and identifies as ""the promised pastor"" mentioned in the Bible. He founded the Shincheonji Church in 1984. In Korean, Shincheonji means ""new heaven and earth"". The group is considered a cult by many. Mr Lee's followers believe he will take 144,000 people to heaven with him. The church says it has more than 20,000 followers outside of South Korea including in China, Japan and areas of Southeast Asia. The group is known for packing its followers tightly together during services. Glasses, necklaces and earrings are reportedly banned from services.

The global death toll is more than 2,900. The vast majority of infections and deaths are in China. On Sunday, Australia and Thailand also recorded their first fatalities from the coronavirus. A 78-year-old Australian man died after being infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan last month. Thailand, which has had 42 cases of the virus, said a 35-year-old man who died was also suffering from dengue fever. In Paris, the Louvre museum did not open on Sunday. The museum said on Twitter a meeting was being held on the public health situation and ""the museum cannot open at the moment"". France has banned all indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people, as part of efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak. The US on Saturday reported the first death in the country, in the state of Washington. Officials said the patient was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions Iran reported 385 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing the total to 978 so far.

What is the UK advice for me?,"A respiratory infection originating in China and known as the ""new coronavirus"" is now spreading faster outside the country than inside. More than 80 countries have been affected, including the UK. With further infections now likely, here are five graphics and the latest practical advice on what to do - based on information from the World Health Organization, Public Health England and the UK National Health Service (NHS). It is not yet known exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person. However, similar viruses are spread via respiratory droplets, such as those produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Therefore, there are things you can do to minimise your risk of catching it. The NHS advises you, among other things, to wash your hands regularly, cover your mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean. You only need to stay away from public places if advised to by the NHS's specialist 111online coronavirus service,externalor by a medical professional. There is currently no evidence that you can catch coronavirus from parcels and letters or from food. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live for very long outside the body. NHS advice,external How to wash your hands thoroughly In the UK, the country's chief medical officers have raised the public risk level from low to moderate. But, the NHS says,the risk to individuals remains low.,external However, there are some countries and areas where there's a higher chance of coming into contact with someone with coronavirus. Therefore, there isextra advice for UK travellers,external, including those who have returned from affected areas, including China, Italy and Iran. But even if you do get it, you are likely to experience mild symptoms and recover. Scientists currently think the proportion of people dying from the disease is low (between 1% and 2%) and evidence suggests those who have died were elderly or had pre-existing conditions. But with the virus in its early stages, and many milder cases not yet counted, the figures are still unreliable. What are the chances of dying from coronavirus? How close are we to a pandemic? Government foreign travel advice,external The new coronavirus -  often referred to as Covid-19 - seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. But these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. The symptoms are similar to other viruses that are much more common, such as colds and flu. In more severe cases of Covid-19, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) are more likely to become severely ill. What are the symptoms? If there's a chance you could have coronavirus, you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, the NHS says you should contact its dedicated 111online coronavirus service,external, operating in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of Wales, which can tell you if you need medical help and advise you what to do next. You should contact the NHS 111 service if: You think you might have the virus You've been toCambodia, China, Hong Kong,northernItaly, Iran, Japan, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, ThailandorVietnamin the past 14 days You've been in close contact with someone with coronavirus As a result, you may be asked to stay away from other people (self-isolate). You may also be passed onto your local health protection team for testing. NHS 111 online coronavirus service,external Northern Ireland coronavirus advice,external You only need to be tested for coronavirus if you have been tocertain affected areas within a certain time period,externalor you have been in close contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus. But if health professionals think you could have coronavirus, you will be put in touch with your local health protection team and directed to a testing location. Here, health professionals will take some samples. This may include: Mucus from your nose, throat or lungs Blood Faeces Coronavirus pod at The John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford Samples will then be sent to specialist testing laboratories.

How deadly is the coronavirus?,"The UK government's scientific advisers believe that the chances of dying from a coronavirus infection are between 0.5% and 1%. This is lower than the rate of death among confirmed cases - which is 4% globally in WHO figures and 5% in the UK as of March 23 - because not all infections are confirmed by testing. Each country has its own way of deciding who gets tested, so comparing case numbers or apparent death rates across countries can also be misleading. Death rates also depend on a range of factors like your age and general health, and the care you can access. The elderly and the unwell are more likely to die, if they contract coronavirus. Current estimates from Imperial College London are that the death rate is almost 10 times higher than average for those over 80, and much lower for those under 40. The UK government's chief medical advisor, Professor Chris Whitty, says even though the rates are higher for older people, ""the great majority of older people will have a mild or moderate disease"". He also warns that we should not think it's a trivial infection for younger people, pointing out that there are some young people who have ended up in intensive care. It's not just age that determines the risk of infections. In the first big analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, deaths were at least five times more common among confirmed cases with diabetes, high blood pressure or heart or breathing problems. All of these factors interact with each other and we don't yet have a complete picture of the risk for every type of person in every location. And even though patterns in the death rates among confirmed cases can tell us who is most at risk, they can't tell us about the precise risk in any single group. Most cases of most viruses go uncounted because people tend not to visit the doctor with mild symptoms. On 17 March, the chief scientific adviser for the UK, Sir Patrick Vallance, estimated there were about 55,000 cases in the UK, when the confirmed case count was just under 2,000. Dividing deaths by 2,000 will give you a much higher death rate than dividing by 55,000. That's one of the biggest reasons why the death rates among confirmed cases are a bad estimate of the true death rates: overestimating the severity by missing cases. But you can also get it wrong in the other direction: underestimating the death rate by not taking into account those people currently infected who may eventually die. The first big studies into death rates were done in China According to research by Imperial College,external, it's because different countries are better or worse at spotting the milder, harder to count cases. Countries use different tests for the virus, have different testing capacity and different rules for who gets tested. All of these factors change over time. The UK government plans to increase testing to 10,000 a day initially, with a goal of reaching 25,000 a day within four weeks. It currently restricts testing mainly to people in hospitals. Germany has been testing more than 20,000 people a day Germany has a daily testing capacity of more than 20,000 cases and has been testing people with mild symptoms. So their counts of confirmed infections could capture different sections of the pyramid of cases shown above. The death rate among confirmed cases in Germany (less than half a per cent) is among the lowest in Europe, but is expected to rise as the mix of patients getting tested changes. Your prognosis also depends on the treatment that's available and whether the health service can deliver it. In turn, that depends on the stage of the epidemic. If a healthcare system gets swamped with cases and intensive care units can't treat people who need ventilation, then the death rate would go up. Social distancing has left some London landmarks empty Scientists combine individual pieces of evidence about each of these questions to build a picture of the death rate. For example, they estimate the proportion of cases with mild symptoms from small, defined groups of people who are monitored very tightly, like those on repatriated flights. But slightly different answers from these targeted pieces of evidence will add up to big changes in the overall picture. And the evidence will change over time. Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, points out that death rates could go down as well as up. ""With Ebola, they came down over time as people got better at treating the disease"" but they can go up too: ""If a healthcare system is overrun, then we see death rates rising"". So scientists give a an upper and a lower figure, as well as a best current estimate. What is the coronavirus advice in the UK? Have you been affected by the coronavirus?

US confirms first coronavirus death,"This video can not be played More coronavirus cases in the United States ""likely"" The US has reported the first death from the new coronavirus in the country, in the state of Washington. Officials said the patient was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions. President Donald Trump said more cases were ""likely"" but added that the country was prepared for any circumstance. On Sunday, Australia and Thailand also recorded their first fatalities from coronavirus. A 78-year-old Australian man died after being infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan last month. Thailand, which has had 42 cases of the virus, said a 35-year-old man who died was also suffering from dengue fever. How deadly is the coronavirus? Visual guide to the outbreak How worried should we be? More than 85,000 coronavirus cases have been reported in 57 countries around the world and almost 3,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of infections and deaths are in China, where the virus emerged late last year. Local health officials confirmed on Saturday that the man in his 50s died in Washington state's King County. They said he had not travelled to any high-risk areas. Washington Governor Jay Inslee has declared a state of emergency in response to new cases in the state. It comes as officials on the US West Coast - in California, Oregon and Washington - expressed concerns about cases appearing in patients who had not visited an area where there was an outbreak or been in contact with anyone who had. Two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed at a nursing home in Washington Officials in Washington state on Saturday said they were investigating a possible outbreak of the coronavirus at a local nursing home. Dr Jeffrey Duchin, a health official for Washington's Seattle and King County, said there were two cases associated with the long-term care facility Life Care Center of Kirkland - one a healthcare worker and the other a resident in her 70s. Dr Duchin said about 27 residents and 25 staff members at the centre had ""some sort of symptoms"". Officials said more positive cases were expected. In total, the WHO says there have been 62 cases in the US so far. A US citizen previously died in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus first appeared. While acknowledging that more cases were expected, President Trump sought to quell fears over the outbreak, saying that ""there is no reason to panic at all"". Vice-President Mike Pence also announced that an existing ban on travel from Iran had been expanded to include any foreign national who has visited the country within the last 14 days. Iran has reported the most coronavirus deaths outside China. He also urged Americans not to visit hard-hit areas in global hot-spots Italy and South Korea. American Airlines has said it is suspending flights to the northern Italian city Milan. The airline will operate a single daily flight from the US to Italy, between Philadelphia and Rome. The first Australian to die of coronavirus is a man from Perth. He was one of around 160 Australians to be evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship last month. At least 621 people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan His 79-year-old wife, who was also infected, remains in hospital. More than 600 of the Diamond Princess's 3,700 passengers became infected on the ship which has been held in quarantine off the Japanese port of Yokohama since the beginning of February. On Saturday, a British man who had also been on board the ship, was the first UK citizen - as well as the sixth passenger from the ship - to die from Covid-19. On Sunday, another 573 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in China, in the highest daily increase in a week. The latest figures bring the total number of infections to 79,824. Thirty-five deaths were also announced in China, all but one in the worst-affected Hubei province. China pollution clears amid coronavirus slowdown Outside China, South Korea has reported another 376 cases, bringing the total of infections in the country to more than 3,500.

The UK plans for an outbreak,"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"Coronavirus surge halts S Korea religious servicesCatholic churches are closed across the country, which is battling the worst outbreak outside China.Asia","This video can not be played 'We're often persecuted': Spokesman for virus-hit S Korean church defends secrecy (March 2020) The leader of a religious sect in South Korea will be investigated over some of the country's coronavirus deaths. The city government of the capital Seoul has asked prosecutors to charge Lee Man-hee, the founder of the Shincheonji Church, and 11 others. They are accused of hiding the names of some members as officials tried to track patients before the virus spread. South Korea is battling the worst coronavirus outbreak outside China. The country has reported 3,730 cases and 21 deaths so far. More than half of all infections involve members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a fringe Christian group. Authorities say Shincheonji members infected one another in the southern city of Daegu last month, before fanning out around the country. This video can not be played Watch how germs spread and how you can prevent it One senior member, Kim Shin-chang, told the BBC's Laura Bicker that the church was ""very sorry for causing concern"". He admitted that some church members had been afraid to reveal their identities but said the church had now revealed all of its information, including all its locations and members. ""We were worried about releasing this kind of information because of the safety of our members, but we believe right now the most important thing is to fully cooperate with the government,"" he said. On Sunday the Seoul City government filed a legal complaint to prosecutors against 12 leaders of the sect. They are accused of homicide, causing harm and violating the Infectious Disease and Control Act. All 230,000 members of the church have been interviewed. Nearly 9,000 said they were showing symptoms of coronavirus. A 61-year-old female member of the sect who tested positive for the virus was among the first to be infected. She initially refused to be taken to a hospital to be tested and is known to have attended several church gatherings before testing positive. The sect's leader, Lee Man-hee, claims he is the Messiah. He has also been tested for the virus and is awaiting the results. Roman Catholic churches remain closed, major Protestant groups have cancelled Sunday services and all Buddhist events have been called off. Growing anger over the sect's handling of the outbreak has sparked a petition calling for the church to be disbanded. Nearly 1.2m people have signed it. This investigation has been sparked by Seoul City Mayor Park Won-soon, who urged the Chief Prosecutor to detain the sect leader. He warned that he would request a criminal investigation for homicide by wilful negligence and, on Sunday evening, he filed the claim with the prosecutor's office. But this does not mean the church leaders will face murder charges. It means prosecutors will have to look into the case. Once prosecutors have finished their investigation they will decide which charges, if any, to bring against the sect. Lee Man-hee, 88, claims he is the second coming of Jesus Christ and identifies as ""the promised pastor"" mentioned in the Bible. He founded the Shincheonji Church in 1984. In Korean, Shincheonji means ""new heaven and earth"". The group is considered a cult by many. Mr Lee's followers believe he will take 144,000 people to heaven with him. The church says it has more than 20,000 followers outside of South Korea including in China, Japan and areas of Southeast Asia. The group is known for packing its followers tightly together during services. Glasses, necklaces and earrings are reportedly banned from services.

Warm winter ruins German ice wine harvestTemperatures in Germany's wine-growing regions were not cold enough to produce the dessert wine.Europe,"Ice wine is a dessert wine produced from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine Germany's harvest of ice wine - a dessert wine produced from grapes that have frozen while still on the vine - has failed for the first time because the winter has been too warm. None of Germany's 13 wine-growing regions had the necessary temperatures of -7C to produce the wine in 2019. 2019 was the second-warmest year on record globally, according to the US National Oceans and Air Administration. The amount of ice wine produced has been dropping in recent years. ""The 2019 vintage will go down in history here in Germany as the first year in which the ice harvest has failed nationwide,"" the German Wine Institute (DWI) said in a statement. ""If the warm winters continue in the next few years, ice wines from German wine regions will soon become even more of a rarity than they already are,"" said Ernst BÃ¼scher from the DWI. Last decade confirmed as warmest on record Another problem for ice wine production is that, in recent years, the dates for a possible ice harvest have shifted later - to January and February - while the grapes are ripening earlier, the DWI said. As a result, the grapes need to survive for longer. The biggest ice wine markets include Japan and China as well as the Scandinavian countries and the US. Due to their inherently low yields, ice wines have a very small share of the total harvest, often less than 0.1%.

Home Office boss quits over 'campaign against him',"This video can not be played Sir Philip Rutnam says there has been a ""vicious, orchestrated briefing campaign"" against him The top civil servant in the Home Office has resigned and said he intends to claim for constructive dismissal by the government. Sir Philip Rutnam said there had been a ""vicious and orchestrated"" campaign against him in Home Secretary Priti Patel's office. Reported tensions between the pair included claims she mistreated officials - which she has denied. The prime minister has ""full confidence in his cabinet"", Downing Street said. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Sir Philip's move was ""highly unusual"", adding: ""I can't remember a senior public official taking a step like this."" Sir Philip said he received allegations that Ms Patel's conduct towards employees included ""swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands"". He said that behaviour had ""created fear and needed some bravery to call out"". It was his duty to ""protect the health, safety and wellbeing"" of 35,000 Home Office workers, he said, but that doing so had ""created tension"" between him and Ms Patel. Sir Philip Rutnam's resignation statement in full 'Nothing remotely normal about this resignation' Priti Patel 'tried to force out top civil servant' Sir Philip, who has had a career spanning 33 years, added he had attempted a ""reconciliation"" with Ms Patel but that she had ""made no effort to engage with me to discuss this"". He said he believed his experience was ""extreme"" but part of a ""wider pattern"" in government. Ms Patel has not yet commented on Sir Philip's statement. Sir Mark Sedwill, cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, thanked Sir Philip for his ""long and dedicated career of public service"" and said Shona Dunn, who had been Mr Rutnam's deputy, will become acting permanent secretary. He said he received the resignation ""with great regret"", adding: ""The Home Office's vital work to keep our citizens safe and our country secure continues uninterrupted."" Priti Patel has not yet commented on Sir Philip's resignation It comes days after the home secretary and Sir Philip released a joint statement saying they were ""deeply concerned"" by various""false allegations"" made about Ms Patel. Allegations the pair dismissed included reports that Ms Patel, who has been home secretary since Boris Johnson became prime minister, bullied her staff and was not trusted by MI5 bosses. Priti Patel rejects 'false' MI5 claims 'No excuses for not cutting crime', police told But in a statement given to BBC News, Sir Philip said: ""In the last 10 days, I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign."" He said allegations that he had briefed the media against the home secretary were among many ""completely false"" claims against him. Sir Philip said he did not believe Ms Patel's denial of any involvement in the false claims, adding that she had not ""made the efforts I would expect to dissociate herself from the comments"". Sir Philip's departure, and the manner of it, goes way beyond any normal policy problems or clashes. He took aim not just at Priti Patel, but alluded to what he said was a ""wider pattern"" in government. Add this tothe resignation of Sajid Javid,the former chancellor who expressed concerns about how the government is behaving, there is mounting evidence of unhappiness with how Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his team are running things. Certainly it is a government in a hurry, willing to rattle cages in order to get things done. But governments who want to get things done need an effective civil service to make things happen. A very public breakdown in trust like this does not help that cause. Indications at this early stage are that Ms Patel's position is secure. But with an employment tribunal in the offing, pressure may well build in the coming weeks. If Sir Philip pursues his case as he says he will, exactly what happened behind closed doors may soon be out there for all to see. Read more from Laurahere. Sir Philip said he intended to issue a claim against the Home Office for constructive dismissal. He added that the Cabinet Office had offered him a financial settlement ""that would have avoided this outcome"" - but he turned it down. For a claim of constructive dismissal to be successful at an employment tribunal, an individual must prove their employer seriously breached their contract and that they resigned in response to the breach. Reasons for claiming constructive dismissal can include employers allowing bullying or harassment at work, or failing to support an employee in their job,according to Citizens Advice,external. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said Sir Philip's departure was ""quite extraordinary"" and ""unprecedented"". ""For him to have done this - he must have been pushed to the limit and beyond,"" he said. ""I think it will send shock waves through the civil service."" Jon Trickett, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, said driving a professional civil servant out of office ""is the clearest sign yet of the underlying right-wing, authoritarian - but incompetent - nature of the Johnson government"". ""They will not tolerate dissent, yet can't cope with flooding or a possible pandemic,""he said on Twitter,external. Earlier this week, when a Downing Street spokesman refused to say whether the prime minister had full confidence in Sir Philip Rutnam, his departure became inevitable. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill was consulted ahead of negotiations to agree a settlement. A financial package was on offer, but the stumbling block was apparently the public statement accompanying it. Sir Philip wanted recognition for his work in Whitehall and an acknowledgement of the difficulties he'd encountered at the Home Office. According to those close to him that was not forthcoming. Critics of the former permanent secretary claim he was sometimes obstructive and difficult to work with; some believe he was fortunate to keep his job after the Windrush affair, when Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary; a report into the scandal, to be released soon, may have put his position under further scrutiny. Nevertheless, for one of the country's most senior civil servants to resign in such a dramatic way suggests he has concerns that go well beyond safeguarding his own reputation. For the government, the prospect of more damaging headlines is clear: Sir Philip's statement may embolden others to come forward with concerns, while legal proceedings would mean the internal workings of the Home Office - including discussions involving Priti Patel and her advisers - being made public. Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons home affairs committee, said it was ""appalling"" and reflected badly on the whole government that the situation at the Home Office was allowed to deteriorate to such an extent. She said: ""To end up with one of the most senior public servants in the country taking court action against one of the great offices of state shows a shocking level of breakdown in the normal functioning of government."" The home affairs spokeswoman for the Liberal Democrats said ""serious questions"" must be asked about the ""culture that is being created in the Home Office"". Christine Jardine added: ""The way these Conservatives are treating public servants and trying to undermine the rule of law is outrageous."" The FDA union for senior public servants said Sir Philip's resignation was a consequence of people making anonymous claims about those ""who are unable to publicly defend themselves"".

Coronavirus 'battleplan' role for retired doctors,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock on isolating cities: ""We don't take anything off the table at this stage"" No tactics will be ""off the table"" in the UK government's plan to contain coronavirus, the health secretary says. Matt Hancock said an emergency ""battle plan"", drawn up if the virus spreads further, includes banning big events, closing schools and dissuading people from using public transport. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr the plans were for the ""worst-case scenario"". Mr Hancock said the UK remained in the ""containment"" phase with 23 confirmed cases - but more are expected. The government contingency plans, which will be published this week, include that newly-retired doctors and nurses could be asked to return to the NHS. If the outbreak worsens, people could also be urged to work from home. A minister in every government department will focus on tackling the virus, which causes the Covid-19 disease, while a team of experts will drive a public health campaign. Speaking onthe BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hancock said there were four phases to the plan: Containment- caring for any infected people and identifying their close contacts Delay- deciding what actions to take to slow down the spread Mitigation- damage limitation if the virus spreads widely Research- constant and ongoing work to inform the three other phases Currently, the UK is in the ""containment"" phase - which health leaders say may still be sufficient. But the next phase could see broader ""social distancing"" measures. Rules around class sizes in schools could also be relaxed in the event of widespread staff shortages. Official health advice is to wash your hands more often and catch sneezes in a tissue Asked if UK cities could be shut down, as has happened where the virus originated in China, Mr Hancock said: ""There is clearly a huge economic and social downside to that. But we don't take anything off the table at this stage because you have to make sure you have all the tools available if that is what is necessary."" He added: ""Under the worst-case scenario we would have to take some quite significant actions that would have social and economic disruption."" Coronavirus: What is the UK advice for me? How is the UK getting ready for coronavirus? How deadly is the coronavirus? China pollution clears amid coronavirus slowdown Surveillance testing system for Covid-19 begins in Scotland First case of coronavirus in Republic of Ireland Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mr Hancock must give more detail of any emergency powers he wants to bring in so that MPs ""can properly scrutinise"" the plans. Emergency powers designed to restrict the virus if it became endemic would only be ""temporary"", Mr Hancock said - adding that it was ""inevitable"" the scale of the virus would worsen. He also said ""a lot more resources"" were being put into the NHS 111 helpline as the number of calls rose by 50% over the last week. 'I waited four days for NHS 111 to call back' On Saturday evening, Willow Bank Infant School in Woodley, Berkshire,issued a statement,externalsaying one of its members of staff had tested positive for coronavirus - and it would be closing for a deep clean. Meanwhile, more than 200 British holidaymakers locked down at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife have been told they will be allowed to fly home, if they test negative for the virus. Tourists at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel have been quarantined and tested for the virus The travellers have been quarantined at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel since Tuesday after four Italians contracted the virus. Some have already been allowed to leave but others are awaiting test results. The Foreign Office is in contact with operators and travel agents about their plans to return Britons to the UK. While the virus can be present but undetectable in a test, BBC correspondent Dan Johnson said advice for the hotel guests was that there is a 24-hour window after a negative test when people are not infectious, and are therefore safe to fly. The government's response is based on existing plans for a pandemic flu outbreak - but has been adapted for the coronavirus. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide WAYS TO PREVENT CATCHING IT:How to wash your hands WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR MY HOLIDAY?Your rights as a traveller The plan includes holding extra meetings for the government's emergency committee, Cobra, which is already scheduled to meet on Monday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will chair Monday's meeting, said: ""Coronavirus may very well be a challenge in the weeks and months ahead. ""But I have no doubt that with the help of the NHS and its incomparable staff this country will get through it and beat it."" This video can not be played Coronavirus in the UK: 5 things you need to know about Covid-19 A team of scientists and media experts will also be set up to work on a public information campaign from a so-called ""war room"" in the Cabinet Office. This will see posters and social media adverts telling people to wash their hands for 20 seconds or more with soap and water. Whitehall officials say they will be working closely with their counterparts in the devolved administrations. Meanwhile, theScottish government said it was increasing testsfor coronavirus to all people with flu-like symptoms, even those who have not travelled to an affected area. No one in Scotland has so far tested positive. Face masks - which are not recommended by the government - are being worn by some in the UK, including football fans at Premier League matches on Saturday Mr Hancock said ""every part of government"" was working together to tackle ""the health, economic, and social impacts"" of the virus - ""but cannot do this alone"". ""Every single person has a role to play in helping to manage the spread of the virus - whether that's washing your hands more often, catching your sneezes, and following clinical advice,"" he said. More than 10,000 people have now been tested for the virus in the UK. The Berkshire school staff member is thought to be amongthree UK coronavirus cases confirmed on Saturday. Ten more cases of the virus in the UK in just over two days might raise eyebrows, but health officials say all but one can be easily explained because the patients have travelled from the most affected countries, including northern Italy and Iran. Since the first UK cases were confirmed in York - two Chinese nationals - positive tests have been recorded in the south of England, Derbyshire, south Wales and Northern Ireland. Of potential concern is the case in Surrey, a man who had not travelled abroad. Public health officials are tracing his contactsto see if his infection can be explained by another individual who has arrived in the UK from abroad. In other developments: Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has tested negative for the virus. The Foreign Office said he self-isolated after feeling unwell this week - and has returned to work since the test result The Foreign Office has called on Iran to ""immediately allow"" health officials to examine Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran - as state television reports the number of deaths in the country has risen to 54 The Republic of Ireland hasconfirmed its first case.Health officials said the man was associated with travel from an affected area in northern Italy The first person in the US to die from coronaviruswas a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions, officials say Australia and Thailand also recorded their first fatalities from the virus on Sunday. A 78-year-old Australian man died after being infected on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Thailand said the 35-year-old man who died of the virus had also been suffering from dengue fever France has temporarily banned gatherings of more than 5,000 people ""in confined spaces""as it reported a jump in cases There has been a jump of cases in a South Korean religious sectwhich has been identified as a coronavirus hotbed. Some 8,946 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus are now showing symptoms of the virus, according to officials And Nasa images have shownair pollution in China has cleared dramaticallyin part because of the economic slowdown prompted by the virus On Friday the World Health Organizationraised its global risk assessment of the virusto its top level, ""very high"". Globally, more than 86,000 people have been infected, with cases in more than 50 countries. About 3,000 people have died - the vast majority in China's Hubei province, where the outbreak originated in December. Have you been affected by coronavirus?

Joe Biden to win South Carolina vote - US media,"This video can not be played âI believe we can beat Donald Trump' Joe Biden has been handed a huge boost in the race to challenge President Donald Trump in November's election. Mr Biden, a former vice-president, won decisively in South Carolina's primary, where voters chose which Democrat they want to be the party's candidate. Left-winger Bernie Sanders came second in South Carolina - the fourth state to vote in the months-long primary season - and remains in the lead overall. Another 14 states vote on Super Tuesday this week. By the end of Super Tuesday, it could become much clearer who the nominee will be. This is Mr Biden's first-ever victory in a primary in what is his third run for US president. In his speech welcoming the result, the 77-year-old said: ""Just days ago the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead. Now, thanks to all of you - the heart of the Democratic Party - we just won, and we've won big."" Mr Biden won 48.4% of the share, ahead of Mr Sanders on 19.9% and billionaire hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer on 11.3%. It is Mr Steyer's best performance of the primaries, but he will now end his campaign, leaving seven candidates in the running. Mr Biden had been pinning his hopes on a strong result in the southern state, after performing poorly in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. He regularly cited his strong support among African-Americans, and polls suggest an endorsement by influential black congressman James Clyburn significantly influenced voting patterns. This video can not be played The biggest myth about the ""black vote"" Victory allows Mr Biden to make the case that he is the best-placed moderate Democrat to take on Mr Trump. The winners and losers from South Carolina The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts Candidates who have won more than 15% of the vote in South Carolina are awarded delegates, who will then go to the party's convention in July to support their Democratic candidate. In his speech, Mr Biden attacked Mr Sanders without naming him. ""Folks, win big or lose, that's the choice,"" he said. ""Most Americans don't want the promises of revolution. They want more than promises. They want results."" Super Tuesday is the most important date in the race to pick the nominee. Democrats in 14 states will vote (as well as American Samoa and Democrats Abroad). A massive1,357 delegateswill be distributed - almost a third of all those available through the entire primary season, and the two most populous states, California and Texas, will be voting. The candidates hoping to unseat Trump What are primaries and how do they work? The entire picture could change in one day. Or we could see Mr Sanders cement his lead as the front-runner - and even extend into a near-unbeatable lead. This will also be the first time that New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg will be on the ballot. The performance of moderates like Mr Biden on Super Tuesday will be determined to some degree by that of Mr Bloomberg. We've pulled together a guide on what to look out for in each state on Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday explained (with moose, cod and dinosaurs) WHO IS HE?Third White House run for 'Middle Class Joe Biden' WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS SAY:Is this Joe Bidenâs big comeback? ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL:Watch Biden on 'No Malarkey' tour WHERE HE STANDS:Against other Democrats like Obama A SIMPLE GUIDE:All you need to know about the presidential race South Carolina had been billed as Joe Biden's last stand - where he poured time and resources into securing a positive result. Just a few weeks ago, as his poll numbers sank across the nation, it also appeared it would be his campaign's final resting place. Instead, after a week of furious effort, South Carolina gave Biden his first primary victory of the year - his first win in any of his three presidential bids, in fact. Biden may have one man in particular to thank for his success: Congressman James Clyburn, a powerful voice in the state's black community, who endorsed the vice-president on Wednesday. Exit polls indicate Clyburn's backing was an important factor for about half of the primary voters - and probably one of the reasons Biden posted such a dominating performance among the state's black voters. If he can match that kind of showing in states to come, he's going to give Bernie Sanders a tough fight. Biden is going to have to hope his success in South Carolina translates into a surge on Super Tuesday without much assistance from his campaign, however. He only recently began advertising in the upcoming states, and a Saturday afternoon trip to North Carolina was the first time he left South Carolina in almost a week. He's still running on a wing and a prayer, but at least for one night and in one state, those prayers were answered.
