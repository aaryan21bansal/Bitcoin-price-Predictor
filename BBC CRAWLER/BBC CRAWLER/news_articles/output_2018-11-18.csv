'Indiana Jones of art' strikes again,"Arthur Brand says tracking down the mosaic felt very special The man nicknamed ""the Indiana Jones of the art world"" has done it again - this time tracking down a precious sixth-Century mosaic stolen from Cyprus. Finding the 1,600-year-old piece in a flat in Monaco had felt very special, Dutchman Arthur Brand said. He handed the work over to the Cypriot embassy in The Hague on Friday. Mr Brand has achieved fame recovering stolen artwork since 2015 whenhe found Hitler's Horses- two Nazi statues that stood outside Hitler's office. The Byzantine depiction of Saint Mark was stolen in the 1970s from Panayia Kanakaria church, about 105km (65 miles) north-east of the Cypriot capital, Nicosia. Mr Brand spent nearly two years chasing the work across Europe, finally tracking it down in the possession of a British family. They had ""bought the mosaic in good faith more than four decades ago"", the investigator told AFP news agency. ""They were horrified when they found out that it was in fact a priceless art treasure, looted from the Kanakaria church after the Turkish invasion,"" Mr Brand said. ""It was one of the greatest moments of my life,"" the investigator said. The newest instalment of the Indiana Jones franchise, which stars Harrison Ford in the title role, is scheduled for release in 2020. A grown-up viewing of Indiana Jones The 2002 Van Gogh museum raid was one of a series of thefts that shocked the art world. Munch's 1893 work The Scream was found two years after it was torn from a museum wall in Oslo in 2004 In 2004, two Edvard Munch masterpieces, The Scream and Madonna, were seized by armed men who raided the Munch museum in Oslo.  Several men were jailed and the paintings later recovered after painstaking detective work in 2006. Another version of The Scream was stolen from the National Art Museum in Oslo in 1994 and that too was later recovered in a sting operation by UK detectives. In 2012, seven artworks were stolen from Rotterdam's Kunsthal museum, including paintings by Picasso, Monet and Matisse.Two thieves were later jailed, telling a Bucharest court that security at the museum had been lax. Some of the paintings were destroyed in an oven. Earlier this year, four paintings out of a haul of 24 stolen from a Dutch gallery in 2005 were recovered in Ukraine.

Rare 'stingray' attack kills Australian,"Stingrays are not usually aggressive and fatal attacks on humans remain rare A 42-year-old man has died after a suspected stingray attack off the Tasmanian coast, Australian police say. They saidthe man developed a cardiac arrest after ""sustaining a puncture to his lower abdomen"",externalat Lauderdale Beach. The statement said the wound was ""possibly inflicted by a marine animal"". Officials told local media it was consistent with a stingray attack. Stingrays are not considered dangerous, even though one killed Australian conservationist Steve Irwin in 2006. Steve Irwin poses with an alligator at the San Francisco Zoo in 2002 Known as the Crocodile Hunter after his wildlife television show, Irwin died when a stingray's tail stabbed him in the heart. There have been, however, more reports of shark attacks in Australia recently and the Tasmanian police were keen to stress the Lauderdale Beach incident was not shark-related.

Trump 'won't listen' to Khashoggi tape,"This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at what could happen to the man known as MBS US President Donald Trump says he has been briefed on a recording of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder - but will not listen to it himself. ""It's a suffering tape, it's a terrible tape,"" he told Fox News Sunday. The CIA has reportedly concluded the powerful Saudi Crown Prince ordered the killing but the White House is yet to endorse that assessment. Saudi Arabia has called the claim false and denied Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had any knowledge of the murder. Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government, was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October to obtain a marriage document. Saudi Arabia says Khashoggi was killedas the result of a rogue operation. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Khashoggi murder: Is Saudi crown prince finished? The journalist who vanished into a consulate Even supporters in the US Congress have been pressing President Trump for a tougher response to the killing, but with Saudi Arabia a key partner in the Middle East this may be something Mr Trump is reluctant to do. The US president said he did not have to, given he had been fully briefed on its content. ""I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it,"" he told Fox. ""It was very violent, very vicious and terrible."" The reportedly shocking and incriminating recordings were shared by Turkeywith the US and other  western allies. This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? In his interview, President Trump said that Mohammed bin Salman had told him he had no knowledge of the killing. Mr Trump added that it may be no one will find out who was behind the killing, and pointed to US sanctions imposed on individuals allegedly involved. ""But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good,"" he added. Although the CIA is not said to have direct evidence linking Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the murder, officials reportedly believe it could not have taken place without his approval. But on Saturday the State Department said the US government was yet to reach a final conclusion on the killing, with ""numerous unanswered questions"" remaining. President Trump has spoken to the CIA on its findings. His Fox interview was recorded before news of the CIA's findings emerged and he said his administration's verdict was imminent. ""We'll be having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday,"" he told reporters. An ally of Mr Trump, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, said he did not believe the Crown Prince's denials. ""If he is going to be the face of Saudi Arabia going forward, I think the kingdom will have a hard time on the world stage,"" he told NBC. Khashoggi murder: Is Saudi crown prince finished?

Wedding magazine shuts after LGBT row,"One of Australia's leading wedding magazines is shutting down after it refused to feature same-sex couples. Luke and Carla Burrell, founders of White magazine, said advertisers had abandoned them in droves. The Christian couple said they made the choice because they had ""no desire to create a social, political or legal war"". Australia legalised gay marriage in December last yearafter the country overwhelmingly voted in favour of it. In a farewell post on its website, the magazine's founders said they had been targeted by ""a flood of judgement,"" and that couples they featured had been sent online abuse. ""White Magazine has always been a secular publication, but as its publishers, we are Christian. We have no agenda but to love,"" they wrote. ""Like many people, we have had to reflect on our beliefs,"" the founders wrote. ""It's a long and continuing journey."" Was Australia's marriage poll worth it? How the killing of a gay academic changed Australia Photographer Lara Hotz, who shot three covers for the magazine, told media in August that it wasn't including gay couples - though it hadn't said so publicly. Ms Hotz, who is in a same-sex marriage herself, said the magazine's decision made her feel ""extremely hurt"",external. ""It appears they are happy to take money, content and photographs from LGBTQI advertisers and contributors, but are yet to support and represent us in the same way as heterosexual couples are represented in the magazine,"" radio programme Hack quoted her as saying. The photographer said she did not want to force the magazine to include same-sex weddings, but felt its stance should be made transparent. Allow Facebook content?

""It doesn't seem to me that your agenda is just to love, it seems like your agenda is just to love straight people,"" wrote Ruth Parker. Another commenter, Cynthia McKenzie, said she felt the magazine's freedom of speech had been impeded, writing: ""Unfortunately today if you have faith and don't agree with same-sex marriage, you can't run your own business the way you want.""

Two-year degree plan to cut cost of fees,"Students in England are being promised the option of ""accelerated"" two-year degree courses, saving 20% on tuition fees compared with a three-year course. Universities Minister Sam Gyimah has confirmed plans for universities to be able to charge higher fees for shorter, more intensive courses. It would mean paying about Â£5,500 less than for a three-year course - which would mean about Â£11,000 per year. But raising annual fees above Â£9,250 would require Parliamentary approval. The government wants to encourage more flexible ways of studying - in particular as a way of reversing the decline in the numbers of mature students taking degrees. Condensing a full degree into two years is seen as being more appealing to people who are in work or with family commitments. A fast-track degree, with two 45-week years of teaching, would allow students to borrow less on fees and to save on a year's living costs and accommodation. Universities would have the incentive of being able to charge higher annual fees to cover extra teaching costs. It would also be cheaper for the government, which would have lower tuition fee loans to fund. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Tuition fees cut to Â£6,500 but higher for science? The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't The proposals for this scheme wereput forward by the government last year- but making it happen will depend on Parliament lifting the fee cap above Â£9,250. It would have to be debated and backed by Parliament - but the Department for Education says if it got approval, such courses could operate from next year. Mr Gyimah said accelerated degrees would help improve access for ""mature students and those who commute, who were previously locked out of higher education"". He said there were ""undeniable financial, academic and personal benefits"" and it would also encourage universities to ""offer dynamic choices that serve students' needs"". However, the head of one of the first universities to offer two-year degrees over 40 years ago has warned that many universities will find it difficult to adapt. Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: ""Two-year degrees are a more efficient and cost-effective method for students to get on with their careers and their lives."" But he said: ""Universities offering three-year degrees will find it difficult to restructure. ""We would like the universities minister to engage in discussions with us in order to assist independent providers who offer two-year degrees."" Are students overpaying for tuition fees?

US-China division mars Apec summit end,"US VP Pence (3rd right) and China's Xi did not appear together in Apec leaders pictures An Asian economic summit has ended without a formal leaders' statement for the first time because of US-China divisions over trade. Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said ""the two big giants in the room"" had been unable to agree. He said a chairman's statement for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit would be released later. The US and China are engaged in trade war and revealed competing visions for the region at the summit. In his closing comments, Mr O'Neill said Apec would try to ensure ""free and open trade"" in the region by 2020. China v the US: Not just a trade war What China wants from the Pacific US to invest more than $100m in Asia During the summit,the US said it would join Australia in developing a naval basein Papua New Guinea (PNG), in an apparent move to curb China's growing influence. US Vice-President Mike Pence said the base would help ""protect sovereignty and maritime rights in the Pacific islands"". On Saturday Chinese PresidentXi Jinping took a swipe at the US's America First policyby saying that countries that embraced protectionism were ""doomed to failure"". Mr Xi (C) criticised the US's America First policy Mr Pence later said he was prepared to ""more than double"" the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. He also criticised China's massive Belt-and-Road infrastructure programme, warning smaller countries that ""opaque"" Chinese development loans led to ""staggering debt"".

Wedding magazine shuts after LGBT rowAustralian wedding magazine White was dropped by advertisers for refusing to feature gay couples.,"One of Australia's leading wedding magazines is shutting down after it refused to feature same-sex couples. Luke and Carla Burrell, founders of White magazine, said advertisers had abandoned them in droves. The Christian couple said they made the choice because they had ""no desire to create a social, political or legal war"". Australia legalised gay marriage in December last yearafter the country overwhelmingly voted in favour of it. In a farewell post on its website, the magazine's founders said they had been targeted by ""a flood of judgement,"" and that couples they featured had been sent online abuse. ""White Magazine has always been a secular publication, but as its publishers, we are Christian. We have no agenda but to love,"" they wrote. ""Like many people, we have had to reflect on our beliefs,"" the founders wrote. ""It's a long and continuing journey."" Was Australia's marriage poll worth it? How the killing of a gay academic changed Australia Photographer Lara Hotz, who shot three covers for the magazine, told media in August that it wasn't including gay couples - though it hadn't said so publicly. Ms Hotz, who is in a same-sex marriage herself, said the magazine's decision made her feel ""extremely hurt"",external. ""It appears they are happy to take money, content and photographs from LGBTQI advertisers and contributors, but are yet to support and represent us in the same way as heterosexual couples are represented in the magazine,"" radio programme Hack quoted her as saying. The photographer said she did not want to force the magazine to include same-sex weddings, but felt its stance should be made transparent. Allow Facebook content?

""It doesn't seem to me that your agenda is just to love, it seems like your agenda is just to love straight people,"" wrote Ruth Parker. Another commenter, Cynthia McKenzie, said she felt the magazine's freedom of speech had been impeded, writing: ""Unfortunately today if you have faith and don't agree with same-sex marriage, you can't run your own business the way you want.""

England comeback seals finals spot,"Harry Kane (right) was on a run of seven England games without a goal England staged a superb late comeback to beat Croatia at Wembley to reach the finals of the inaugural Uefa Nations League. Croatia, England's World Cup semi-final conquerors in Moscow in July, looked set to win once more and relegate Gareth Southgate's side from the elite group when Andrej Kramaric's twisting finish put them ahead via a deflection off Eric Dier after 57 minutes. England needed two goals to top the group and reach the semi-final and final stages in Portugal next June, and at least inflict a small measure of revenge on Croatia for that World Cup disappointment. And they responded brilliantly to get the win their performance deserved and secure qualification for the next stage of the tournament. Substitute Jesse Lingard scored from almost on the line with 12 minutes left before, with five minutes remaining, captain Harry Kane slid in Ben Chilwell's free-kick to send England through and relegate Croatia. Passion? A plan? New faces? Personalities? Wins? Tell us what you loved about England in 2018,external 'England deliver a win to savour' The 12 minutes that made England fall in love with the Nations League This video can not be played Croatia win perfect end to 2018 - Kane Southgate will have feared an old flaw was returning to haunt his side when Kramaric put Croatia ahead just before the hour after seemingly taking an age to twist and turn before beating Jordan Pickford. It was cruel on England and punishment for failing, as they did in Moscow, to make the most of vast first-half superiority as they created a series of chances but contrived to miss them, with Kane and Raheem Sterling the chief culprits. England could have been forgiven for believing the fates were against them as they trailed to their League A Group Four opponents, who have become something of a bogey side over the years. Instead, they responded with courage and character as the clock ticked down to rescue glory and a place in Portugal from the prospect of relegation into the lower reaches of the Nations League. The victory also guarantees England a place in the Euro 2020 play-offs, a fallback in the event they fail to qualify for that tournament through the traditional route. Southgate can take his share of the credit for two attacking substitutions, sending on Lingard and Jadon Sancho with England's backs against the wall, the reward coming in the shape of that decisive late rally. It hardly counts as retribution for the disappointment of the World Cup semi-final but it was a demonstration this England side is developing under Southgate, this victory acting as a measure of their progress. How the players rated What's at stake in final week of group games? England defenders Kyle Walker (left in top photo) and Joe Gomez after Croatia's goal and then at the end of the match The obvious joy of England's players and supporters after that dramatic finale was another indicator the Uefa Nations League, mocked and maligned at its inception, is capturing the public's imagination. It is not yet close to being ready to be spoken about in the same breath as the major tournaments such as the World Cup and the Euros - but England's adventure so far has produced hard evidence the idea behind its creation - to add an extra edge beyond traditional friendlies - has been a success. The atmosphere inside Wembley when England went a goal behind was testament to this, with the crowd clearly aware of the consequences and what Southgate's men required to avoid the worst fate. The group situation added an extra layer of tension and atmosphere, contributing to a memorable conclusion. The Nations League results have also seen England respond to an ongoing criticism they fail to beat the top sides, with even Southgate insisting they could not be considered among the world's elite until they beat the best. The World Cup did nothing to answer those questions. Now, in this increasingly competitive environment, they have recorded significant wins away to Spain and now at home to the team that outmanoeuvred them in Moscow. England and Wembley embraced this new format - and relished in the occasion. England's 'Football Coming Home' anthem became a serious bone of contention at the World Cup - with Croatia using it as a sign of arrogance from their opponents in the build-up to the semi-final. That was harsh and misleading as the song was actually written as a hymn to England's failures and disappointments in the lead-up to staging Euro '96 on home soil. In Russia, it worked to fire up Croatia even if it was unfair on England as the message was twisted. Was it mischievous, then, that the strains of the song were belted out over Wembley's public address system at deafening volume the second the final whistle sounded and was instantly joined by thousands of celebrating England fans? No-one should count this as revenge for the World Cup but England and their supporters took great satisfaction in overcoming notoriously difficult opponents. England have won four of their past five matches (D1), having won just one of their six before that (D1 L4). This was Croatia's first defeat against England since September 2009, when they lost 5-1 in a World Cup qualifier at Wembley. Kane ended a run of 747 minutes without an England goal, scoring his first since his penalty against Colombia at the World Cup. This was his 20th England goal. Lingard's goal for England was their first goal via a throw-in since May 2014 (Daniel Sturridge v Peru). Kramaric scored with Croatia's first shot on target of the match. Lingard has scored as many goals in his past two England matches (two) as he managed in his first 20 caps for the Three Lions. England have won 15 of their past 16 competitive matches at Wembley (L1). This was England's 17th game in 2018 - their joint-most matches in a calendar year, also playing 17 times in 1966. England manager Gareth Southgate on BBC Radio 5 live:""I think the most pleasing thing of the year has been the connection with the fans and being able to share brilliant experiences with them. ""Today was brilliant - I can't remember the new Wembley like that. We have exciting players that give them excitement. ""We were by far the better team in the first half and we came back from a soft goal. If you're going to win a game that's the way you want to win. ""We were playing against a very, very good side. To keep the ball, use the ball and create chances was very pleasing. And you have to keep calm - when you think the chances have gone then you have to keep believing."" England striker Harry Kane on BBC Radio 5 live, talking about where his winning goal ranks:""It's right up there. To see the fans like they were and the belief they showed. It's all about having match-winners in the squad. ""It's one of England's best years. We could win a trophy. ""To carry the momentum into the new year... we've had a fantastic year, but not rested on our laurels."" England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford on BBC Radio 5 live:""The atmosphere is probably the best we've had at Wembley, so credit to the fans. ""This Nations League makes you want to beat the best. We've beaten two of the top 10 sides in the world. Now we have another semi-final - it'll be a good summer.""

Macron: Europe must prevent 'global chaos',"The French president was speaking on the occasion of Volkstrauertag, Germany's national day of mourning for victims of war France's President Emmanuel Macron has called for closer ties between his country and Germany, saying Europe ""has the obligation not to let the world slip into chaos"". Mr Macron is in Berlin for the country's annual day of mourning for victims of war. In a speech to Germany's parliament, he said Europe must not ""become a plaything of great powers"". Mr Macron wants a more integrated EU, with a joint eurozone budget. He also wants Germany's backing for a European Army, which he has said would reduce the bloc's dependence on the US, and a new tax on internet tech giants. Trump-Macron smooth over defence spat German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed tentative support for some of these ideas, but others are controversial in Berlin. The French leader spoke of nationalist forces ""with no memory"", and urged progressive forces to unite in an uncertain world. ""There are too many powers that wish to thwart us, that interfere in our public debates, attack our liberal democracies and are trying to pit us against each other,"" he said. ""And in this global order, which we have to take very seriously, our strength - our true strength - lies in unity."" US President Donald Trump was moved to a Twitter tirade by similar remarks from Mr Macron a week ago,when the French leader called nationalism a ""betrayal of patriotism"" while commemorating the end of World War One. This video can not be played President Trump and President Putin were among the leaders at the ceremony in Paris The French president acknowledged that unity could be ""scary,"" and would mean nations pooling their funds and decision-making - but then asked: ""Is it better to remain locked at a standstill?"" The French and German leaders met for talks after Mr Macron's speech, and were set to discuss migration, defence co-operation and tax structures for digital companies. France and Germany are expected to unveil plans for a limited joint eurozone budget on Monday. Trump mocks French leader after visit Trump 'lacked decency' in Macron attack ""You made clear with an impressive speech how important the German-Franco friendship and co-operation is, and what role it plays in the European context,"" Mrs Merkel told Mr Macron. ""You said we are at a crossroads... and this is exactly what I perceive. Those of us born after the war are responsible for the lessons that we learned."" Mrs Merkel, who has led Germany for 13 years, recently confirmed she would not stand as her party's leader again. She intends to serve out her fourth term as chancellor, which ends in 2021, but some commentators believe she may be brought down before that by in-fighting within her party or the broader government coalition she leads.

French fuel protests leave 400 injured,"This video can not be played Thousands march in France over diesel tax Demonstrations in France over rising fuel prices have left more than 400 people injured, officials say, as protests spilled into a second day. The French interior ministry said that nearly 300 protesters were questioned, with 157 among them taken into custody. Some 288,000 people took part in Saturday's protests, the ministry said, with scores under way on Sunday. The demonstrators, known as the ""yellow vests"", have been setting up roadblocks across France. Many turned their anger on President Emmanuel Macron, who they accuse of being out-of-touch. He is yet to comment on the protests, and has seen his popularity slump in polls. 'Gauls' resistant to change - Macron Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work The president came to power last year vowing to overhaul the French economy and argues the hikes are needed to wean the French people off fossil fuels. The government has announced a number of measures to help poorer families pay their energy and transport bills. But support for the protests appears broad. Nearly three-quarters of respondents to a poll by the Elabe institute backed the Yellow Vests and 70% wanted the government to reverse the fuel tax hikes. Demonstrators took to the streets at more than 2,000 locations across France on Saturday, according to the interior ministry. Most protests passed peacefully but at some places tempers flared and drivers tried to force their way through the roadblocks. In the worst incident, a female protester died after a driver surrounded by demonstrators panicked and accelerated. The driver has been charged with manslaughter and released on bail, prosecutors said. The blockades continued at several sites on Sunday In northern Caen, protesters scrawled on the road urging President Macron to quit About 3,500 people stayed out on Saturday in what Interior Minister Christophe Castaner called a ""restive"" night. ""There were assaults, fights, stabbings,"" he said. ""There were fights among 'yellow vest' protesters. There was a lot of alcohol at certain venues, which led to this idiotic behaviour."" He said more than 400 people were hurt, 14 seriously. Protesters remain at about 150 sites on Sunday,external, BFMTV reported. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s, AFP news agency reports. World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. Mr Macron is currently in Germany for a day of national mourning for victims of warand his office said it would be inappropriate to discuss the protests while he was there.

What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
England comeback seals finals spotHarry Kane comes to England's rescue as they beat Croatia to reach the Uefa Nations League finals.,"Harry Kane (right) was on a run of seven England games without a goal England staged a superb late comeback to beat Croatia at Wembley to reach the finals of the inaugural Uefa Nations League. Croatia, England's World Cup semi-final conquerors in Moscow in July, looked set to win once more and relegate Gareth Southgate's side from the elite group when Andrej Kramaric's twisting finish put them ahead via a deflection off Eric Dier after 57 minutes. England needed two goals to top the group and reach the semi-final and final stages in Portugal next June, and at least inflict a small measure of revenge on Croatia for that World Cup disappointment. And they responded brilliantly to get the win their performance deserved and secure qualification for the next stage of the tournament. Substitute Jesse Lingard scored from almost on the line with 12 minutes left before, with five minutes remaining, captain Harry Kane slid in Ben Chilwell's free-kick to send England through and relegate Croatia. Passion? A plan? New faces? Personalities? Wins? Tell us what you loved about England in 2018,external 'England deliver a win to savour' The 12 minutes that made England fall in love with the Nations League This video can not be played Croatia win perfect end to 2018 - Kane Southgate will have feared an old flaw was returning to haunt his side when Kramaric put Croatia ahead just before the hour after seemingly taking an age to twist and turn before beating Jordan Pickford. It was cruel on England and punishment for failing, as they did in Moscow, to make the most of vast first-half superiority as they created a series of chances but contrived to miss them, with Kane and Raheem Sterling the chief culprits. England could have been forgiven for believing the fates were against them as they trailed to their League A Group Four opponents, who have become something of a bogey side over the years. Instead, they responded with courage and character as the clock ticked down to rescue glory and a place in Portugal from the prospect of relegation into the lower reaches of the Nations League. The victory also guarantees England a place in the Euro 2020 play-offs, a fallback in the event they fail to qualify for that tournament through the traditional route. Southgate can take his share of the credit for two attacking substitutions, sending on Lingard and Jadon Sancho with England's backs against the wall, the reward coming in the shape of that decisive late rally. It hardly counts as retribution for the disappointment of the World Cup semi-final but it was a demonstration this England side is developing under Southgate, this victory acting as a measure of their progress. How the players rated What's at stake in final week of group games? England defenders Kyle Walker (left in top photo) and Joe Gomez after Croatia's goal and then at the end of the match The obvious joy of England's players and supporters after that dramatic finale was another indicator the Uefa Nations League, mocked and maligned at its inception, is capturing the public's imagination. It is not yet close to being ready to be spoken about in the same breath as the major tournaments such as the World Cup and the Euros - but England's adventure so far has produced hard evidence the idea behind its creation - to add an extra edge beyond traditional friendlies - has been a success. The atmosphere inside Wembley when England went a goal behind was testament to this, with the crowd clearly aware of the consequences and what Southgate's men required to avoid the worst fate. The group situation added an extra layer of tension and atmosphere, contributing to a memorable conclusion. The Nations League results have also seen England respond to an ongoing criticism they fail to beat the top sides, with even Southgate insisting they could not be considered among the world's elite until they beat the best. The World Cup did nothing to answer those questions. Now, in this increasingly competitive environment, they have recorded significant wins away to Spain and now at home to the team that outmanoeuvred them in Moscow. England and Wembley embraced this new format - and relished in the occasion. England's 'Football Coming Home' anthem became a serious bone of contention at the World Cup - with Croatia using it as a sign of arrogance from their opponents in the build-up to the semi-final. That was harsh and misleading as the song was actually written as a hymn to England's failures and disappointments in the lead-up to staging Euro '96 on home soil. In Russia, it worked to fire up Croatia even if it was unfair on England as the message was twisted. Was it mischievous, then, that the strains of the song were belted out over Wembley's public address system at deafening volume the second the final whistle sounded and was instantly joined by thousands of celebrating England fans? No-one should count this as revenge for the World Cup but England and their supporters took great satisfaction in overcoming notoriously difficult opponents. England have won four of their past five matches (D1), having won just one of their six before that (D1 L4). This was Croatia's first defeat against England since September 2009, when they lost 5-1 in a World Cup qualifier at Wembley. Kane ended a run of 747 minutes without an England goal, scoring his first since his penalty against Colombia at the World Cup. This was his 20th England goal. Lingard's goal for England was their first goal via a throw-in since May 2014 (Daniel Sturridge v Peru). Kramaric scored with Croatia's first shot on target of the match. Lingard has scored as many goals in his past two England matches (two) as he managed in his first 20 caps for the Three Lions. England have won 15 of their past 16 competitive matches at Wembley (L1). This was England's 17th game in 2018 - their joint-most matches in a calendar year, also playing 17 times in 1966. England manager Gareth Southgate on BBC Radio 5 live:""I think the most pleasing thing of the year has been the connection with the fans and being able to share brilliant experiences with them. ""Today was brilliant - I can't remember the new Wembley like that. We have exciting players that give them excitement. ""We were by far the better team in the first half and we came back from a soft goal. If you're going to win a game that's the way you want to win. ""We were playing against a very, very good side. To keep the ball, use the ball and create chances was very pleasing. And you have to keep calm - when you think the chances have gone then you have to keep believing."" England striker Harry Kane on BBC Radio 5 live, talking about where his winning goal ranks:""It's right up there. To see the fans like they were and the belief they showed. It's all about having match-winners in the squad. ""It's one of England's best years. We could win a trophy. ""To carry the momentum into the new year... we've had a fantastic year, but not rested on our laurels."" England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford on BBC Radio 5 live:""The atmosphere is probably the best we've had at Wembley, so credit to the fans. ""This Nations League makes you want to beat the best. We've beaten two of the top 10 sides in the world. Now we have another semi-final - it'll be a good summer.""

"Wedding magazine shuts after LGBT rowAustralian wedding magazine ""White"" was dropped by advertisers for refusing to feature gay couples.Australia","One of Australia's leading wedding magazines is shutting down after it refused to feature same-sex couples. Luke and Carla Burrell, founders of White magazine, said advertisers had abandoned them in droves. The Christian couple said they made the choice because they had ""no desire to create a social, political or legal war"". Australia legalised gay marriage in December last yearafter the country overwhelmingly voted in favour of it. In a farewell post on its website, the magazine's founders said they had been targeted by ""a flood of judgement,"" and that couples they featured had been sent online abuse. ""White Magazine has always been a secular publication, but as its publishers, we are Christian. We have no agenda but to love,"" they wrote. ""Like many people, we have had to reflect on our beliefs,"" the founders wrote. ""It's a long and continuing journey."" Was Australia's marriage poll worth it? How the killing of a gay academic changed Australia Photographer Lara Hotz, who shot three covers for the magazine, told media in August that it wasn't including gay couples - though it hadn't said so publicly. Ms Hotz, who is in a same-sex marriage herself, said the magazine's decision made her feel ""extremely hurt"",external. ""It appears they are happy to take money, content and photographs from LGBTQI advertisers and contributors, but are yet to support and represent us in the same way as heterosexual couples are represented in the magazine,"" radio programme Hack quoted her as saying.

"Change law on mental health at work, say firms","Some of Britain's biggest employers are pressing the government to honour a promise to give mental health the same status as physical health at work. Royal Mail and WH Smith are among the companies asking the PM to follow through on her manifesto pledge to update health and safety legislation. That would mean employers would have to provide appropriate training for staff to deal with mental ill-health. About one in six of people at work have symptoms of a mental health condition. A government-commissioned review,externalput the cost of those conditions, such as depression, anxiety or stress, to the economy at between Â£74bn and Â£99bn a year. PM pledges to improve mental health care Poor mental health at work 'widespread' More workers ask for mental health help At the last general election, the Conservatives said they would amend health and safety rules so employers would have to treat mental health the same way they treat physical health. Some 50 executives, including Lord Sugar and bosses from Thames Water and Ford of Britain, have written to Theresa May, asking her to prioritise this particular pledge. The companies behind the letter argue the promised change in the law would help break the stigma of mental illness at work. Fionuala Bonnar, from Mental Health First Aid England said: ""The change in legislation we are calling for will establish a baseline for protecting mental health in the workplace, ensuring no one is left behind."" Poor mental health affects half of all employees,according to a survey of 44,000 people carried out by the mental health charity Mind. It says around 300,000 people lose their job each year due to a mental health problem.

The deal - what it all means,"The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 599 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union. Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls outthe key points from the agreement,externaland what they mean. The transition period (which the UK government calls ""implementation period"")  is due to last for 21 months. The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions. The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or ""divorce bill"") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations. While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least Â£39bn and it will be paid over a number of years. Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. In 2018/19 the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net Â£10.8bn. If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately. Chris Morris's analysis:It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court. All you need to know about Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Your guide to Brexit jargon What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition. Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. Chris Morris's analysis:The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders after the transition period, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now are also unresolved issues. If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of ""a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom"" will be triggered. Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market. As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to ""level playing field conditions"", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory. The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU. Chris Morris's analysis:The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters. The document says: ""The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."" Chris Morris's analysis:Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters. It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be. The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition. A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly. Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision. Chris Morris's analysis:Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come. Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus. There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled. EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like ""Welsh Lamb"" or ""Parma Ham"" remain. Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.

Referendum not an option for now - Corbyn,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn leaves his home ahead of the interview A new referendum on the UK's relationship with the EU is ""an option for the future"" but ""not an option for today"", Jeremy Corbyn has said. The Labour leader confirmed on Sky News that his party would vote against the draft withdrawal agreement. Mr Corbyn said Labour ""couldn't stop"" Brexit because it does not have enough seats in Parliament. Prime Minister Theresa May has said thatousting her would not make it easier to deliver Brexit. Asked about calls for a further referendum as demanded by some of his MPs, Mr Corbyn said: ""If there was a referendum tomorrow what's it going to be on, what's the question going to be?"" If such a referendum were called, Mr Corbyn, who voted Remain in 2016, said: ""I don't know how I am going to vote - what the options would be at that time."" Speaking on the Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, the Labour leader said Mrs May's draft deal with the EU was a ""one-way agreement"" where the EU ""calls all the shots"".

Why are so many missing in California fires?,"The number of missing jumped from 110, to 220, to 631 on Thursday before going over 1,000 Over the last few days the number of people unaccounted for in the deadly Camp Fire in northern California skyrocketed to more than 1,200, before falling again to just below 1,000. The sudden jump led to some confusion among locals and officials alike. The confirmed death toll of 77 is already a state record, so could this huge number of missing people really still be added to that? The answer is not so simple, as authorities in the worst-hit area, Butte County, have openly admitted. On Friday, when the list first soared to over 1,000, Sheriff Kory Honea described the database as ""dynamic"". ""The information I am providing you is raw data and we find there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names,"" the sheriff said on Friday. Officials say the large fluctuation is occurring as investigators try to compile all the missing person reports from calls, reports and emails since the fire began on 8 November. The day Paradise burned down Before and after snapshots Finland bemused by Trump raking comment The fire spread rapidly, and many have reported having only minutes to gather their loved ones to try and escape through congested roads. This video can not be played Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise Because of the intensity of the fire, officials have warned the full recovery may take weeks as hundreds of specialists and cadaver dogs use reports to find and search residences for evidence of human remains. Some news sources were quick to point out duplications or strange anomalies in the county's list, includingan earlier version which listed five missing people as aged 119,,externalaccording to the New York Times. The newspaper reported that they were able to locate some people from the list on social media, who confirmed they were, in fact, fine. The Associated Press (AP) highlighted the case of one resident, Tamara Conry,,externalwho posted on Facebook to reassure people of her safety. ""My husband and I are not missing and never were!"" she wrote Thursday night on one of the pages for missing people. ""We have no family looking for us ... I called and left a message to take our names off."" Sheriff Honea has defended the decision to publish the list in its ""raw"" form. ""I can't let perfection get in the way of progress,"" the sheriff told the media on Friday. ""It's important for us to get the information out so that we can get started on identifying these unaccounted individuals."" With more than 12,000 buildings destroyed in the Camp Fire and evacuation orders still in place across swathes of California, thousands of residents are now spread out in temporary accommodation or shelters. The difficulties in keeping track of who are actually missing, then, are obvious - and communication problems are compounding these further. As towers and power lines perished in the blaze, so did mobile phone service in places. In some areas, temporary towers had to be installed by providers. Away from the official list on the county website, missing posters are also being tacked around local bulletin boards and trees at encampments. Wildfire survivors: 'We swam to safety' Is it advisable to escape a wildfire by car? The animals caught in California's wildfires Further afield, loved ones and friends are relying on social media groups to share images and information about people who haven't been in touch. On the county list, many of the people whose ages are listed are elderly - reflecting the area's popularity as a retirement hotspot. Paradise, the town in Butte County that was devastated by the wildfire, has an estimated population of about 27,000. According to the latest census, about a quarter of those are aged 65 or over. This video can not be played California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son Eric Reinbold, the chief of police in Paradise, said the list's demographics underscore the difficulties in evacuating older residents in rapid emergency situations. ""Like any community, we had elderly folks and some of them gave up driving or can't drive,"" Chief Reinbold said. If they did make it out, older residents may also be less likely to have access to the internet or other mobile communications to contact people they know. Sheriff Honea said that because of displacements, many of those on this list may not even be aware that people are looking for them. A spokesman for his office told AP that the list was not a ""real-time"" reflection of who is missing, but is being widely publicised in the hope it will prompt people to call in to say they are okay. Authorities are continuing to implore locals to double-check the list as it is updated and let them know, by phone and not voicemail, about people who are confirmed safe, in order to help focus their already stretched resources.

'Indiana Jones of art' strikes againThe Dutch investigator says he is proud to be able to return the sixth-Century mosaic to Cyprus.Europe,"Arthur Brand says tracking down the mosaic felt very special The man nicknamed ""the Indiana Jones of the art world"" has done it again - this time tracking down a precious sixth-Century mosaic stolen from Cyprus. Finding the 1,600-year-old piece in a flat in Monaco had felt very special, Dutchman Arthur Brand said. He handed the work over to the Cypriot embassy in The Hague on Friday. Mr Brand has achieved fame recovering stolen artwork since 2015 whenhe found Hitler's Horses- two Nazi statues that stood outside Hitler's office. The Byzantine depiction of Saint Mark was stolen in the 1970s from Panayia Kanakaria church, about 105km (65 miles) north-east of the Cypriot capital, Nicosia. Mr Brand spent nearly two years chasing the work across Europe, finally tracking it down in the possession of a British family. They had ""bought the mosaic in good faith more than four decades ago"", the investigator told AFP news agency. ""They were horrified when they found out that it was in fact a priceless art treasure, looted from the Kanakaria church after the Turkish invasion,"" Mr Brand said. ""It was one of the greatest moments of my life,"" the investigator said. The newest instalment of the Indiana Jones franchise, which stars Harrison Ford in the title role, is scheduled for release in 2020. A grown-up viewing of Indiana Jones The 2002 Van Gogh museum raid was one of a series of thefts that shocked the art world. Munch's 1893 work The Scream was found two years after it was torn from a museum wall in Oslo in 2004 In 2004, two Edvard Munch masterpieces, The Scream and Madonna, were seized by armed men who raided the Munch museum in Oslo.  Several men were jailed and the paintings later recovered after painstaking detective work in 2006. Another version of The Scream was stolen from the National Art Museum in Oslo in 1994 and that too was later recovered in a sting operation by UK detectives. In 2012, seven artworks were stolen from Rotterdam's Kunsthal museum, including paintings by Picasso, Monet and Matisse.Two thieves were later jailed, telling a Bucharest court that security at the museum had been lax. Some of the paintings were destroyed in an oven. Earlier this year, four paintings out of a haul of 24 stolen from a Dutch gallery in 2005 were recovered in Ukraine.

Willow sub marks WW1 U-boat surrender,"This video can not be played Model U-boat on beach marks surrender A model U-boat has been created to commemorate the mass surrender of Germany's submarines on the Essex coast at the end of World War One. More than 160 U-boats surrendered at Harwich in November 1918, at one point stretching in a two-mile (3km) line. While most were taken to go on display, many were left beached at Harwich before being sunk or taken by the sea. The model has been created as part of centenary celebrations. It measures 15m (49.2ft) long, is made of willow and sits on Dovercourt Beach. U-boats were moored three-to-four-abreast on the north bank of the River Stour The crew members of one of the U-boats, who would have boarded a transport ship to take them back to Germany David Cain, project director for Harwich Haven History Surrender and Sanctuary, described the surrender as an ""important part of national and local maritime history that has been completely forgotten over the last 100 years"". He said: ""We wanted to have a landmark and have something to stay on the beach, much like the U-boats which were left beached here. ""Because it's biodegradable, it will slowly fade into the sea, maybe over the next two or three years."" On 20 November 1918 - nine days after Armistice Day - the first batch of U-boats crossed the North Sea to the British coast. They were met by a small flotilla of British warships led by Rear Adm Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt, commanding officer of the Harwich fleet. The British fleet meet one of the U-boats outside Harwich Harbour In the following days, the U-boats and up to 50 other German vessels were escorted along the River Stour by British ships. They were then moored, often four abreast, to be commandeered by the authorities. Rear Adm Tyrwhitt ruled there should be ""no communication whatsoever"" with the Germans, who were packed on to transport ships and sent home without being allowed to set foot on British soil. Most of the U-boats - some of which were 100m (328ft) long - were put on display in places such as Brighton and Liverpool, while one was taken to Japan. But some were left on the beach and the estuary eventually became known as ""U-boat alley"", said Mr Cain. To mark the centenary of the surrender, the project has also organised talks, parades, film screenings and heritage walks, as well as a1918-themed train,externalrunning from Manningtree to Harwich.

'Brexit plan can be improved',"This video can not be played I'm not a plotter, says Andrea Leadsom There is ""still the potential to improve"" the draft Brexit deal, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has said. While she backed Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to get the ""best possible deal"", she warned the UK could not be ""trapped"" in an EU customs union. The BBC understands that Brexiteer Mrs Leadsom is part of a group of five ministers hoping to amend the deal. Despite widespread criticism of the draft withdrawal agreement, Mrs May has vowed to ""see it through"". The585-page document,externalsets out the terms of the UK's departure, including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens' rights. It is due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday, 25 November. The publication of the draft text prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning. Some Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership. Mark Francois, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have sent a letter, said Mrs May's plan would leave the UK ""half in and half out"" of the EU and everyone knew she would never get it through Parliament. As it happened: May bids to shore up support Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May Danger has not passed for Theresa May Brexit: Where we are in eight charts But Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan urged his other fellow MPs to ""stop and reflect"", saying a leadership challenge was not going to get the country a better deal than Mrs May's. ""All it's likely to do is create chaos, break the government, break the party and leave the country in great disarray."" If there were to be a confidence vote in Mrs May's leadership, party veteran Ken Clarke said she would ""easily"" win it but Nadine Dorries was doubtful, saying ""when pen comes to paper"" most MPs would vote against her in a secret ballot. By Susana MendonÃ§a, BBC political correspondent When they didn't jump ship over Theresa May's Brexit deal you might have thought that meant these key Brexiteers in her cabinet were ready to toe the line in a show of what's supposed to be known as ""collective responsibility"". But the fact that they're still manoeuvring to change the details of the prime minister's deal (while declaring their support for her), is yet another sign of the extraordinary political times we are in. This apparent gang of five inside the cabinet differ in their priorities. Andrea Leadsom - who's understood to be leading them - doesn't want Britain to be trapped in an endless backstop, and wants technological solutions to get around it. Environment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The group is at an ""embryonic"" stage but will they get their tweaks? Andrea Leadsom thinks there's ""still more to be done"" and that they ""do still have more time"" before the EU Council at the end of the month. But that leaves only just over a week - and the EU doesn't look to be in the market for renegotiation at the moment. On Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other cabinet ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something ""winnable and supportable"". The four ministers believed to working with Mrs Leadsom are Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling. Speaking to the BBC in her constituency, Mrs Leadsom said: ""What I'm doing is working very hard to support the prime minister in getting the Brexit deal that 17.4 million people voted for. ""I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with."" Among her concerns was that ""the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement"" with the EU, she said. She added: ""I wouldn't describe myself as a plotter. I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal."" Reality Check: Making sense of the Brexit deal How a day of resignations and appointments unfolded The five Brexit questions everyone's asking Google The cabinet ""gang of five"" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this. The backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable. The UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent. This video can not be played BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier According to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue. The group's plans were described as a ""work in progress"", and a ""last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons"". The deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament. Ahead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. If it is voted down, the EU would be open to ""tweaks"" but a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron has said ""nothing fundamental"" could change. Our correspondent adds that if it came to a general election or another referendum, the EU would likely be open to putting the leaving process on ice to avoid a no-deal Brexit and in the hope the UK might change its mind and stay in the EU. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU should not enter ""some kind of bargaining process"" over parts of the text, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the EU and the UK had agreed the text so negotiations should not continue. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested that Labour could renegotiate the deal before the UK is due to leave the EU in March next year. ""I think we can do it with good will, we can change the atmosphere of negotiations into one of mutual interest and mutual benefit,"" he told Sky News. Meanwhile, the prime ministertold the Daily Mail,externalthe withdrawal agreement was ""not everybody's ideal deal"" but said her job was to make ""tough decisions"" and ""find a way through"". She also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue. Commenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been ""a pretty heavy couple of days"". The PM says her husband is protective over her She revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her ""rock"", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast. On Friday night, Mrs May called dozens of constituency chairmen to appeal to them to back her deal and her leadership - and this weekend she is expected to embark on a ""social media blitz"" to try to sell her plans to people not usually engaged in politics. Mrs May's comments come after Stephen Barclay was picked as the new Brexit secretary - replacing Dominic Raab who quit on Thursday. How could May turmoil affect Brexit? A guide to where we are with Brexit A No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay, who becomes the third Brexit secretary since the role was created, would focus on domestic preparations for Brexit, rather than the negotiations. Amber Rudd returns to the frontbench - she quit as home secretary in April over the Windrush controversy In other developments: Amber Rudd was named as the new work and pensions secretary - replacing Esther McVey who also quit over the deal Stephen Hammond takes over from Mr Barclay as a health minister in the mini-reshuffle And John Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara; while Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman David Davis, Brexit secretary before Mr Raab, pressed Mrs May for a looser deal with the EU, saying the US would be ready to start negotiating a free trade deal straight after Brexit if she ditches her plan On Sunday, the pro-Brexit European Research Group plans to publish a seven-page summary of the 585-page draft agreement The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland warned that ""anything that re-emphasises"" the Irish border presented challenges for policing and thethreat of violence was not being exaggerated Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar told his party thathis government wants to build bridges rather than new borders.

Brexit: Where we are in eight charts,"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has dismissed speculation she could be ousted as leader despite a series of ministers resigning over her long-awaited Brexit deal. Mrs May hasvowed to get her draft withdrawal agreement signed off in Brussels and put before MPsin defiance of a possible vote of no-confidence in her. Such a vote could lead to her removal as prime minister and a change of course on Brexit. Here are seven charts that will help explain what's going on. The draft EU withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May is set to be signed off by European leaders at an emergency summit on 25 November. But if Mrs May survives as PM she faces a battle to get MPs to back it in a House of Commons vote. Mrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit deal, or even openly hostile to it. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against the deal, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. A number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it. The vote is expected to take place around 7 December. What does the Brexit deal mean for you? Your Brexit questions answered Guide to where we are Transport Minister Jo Johnson, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey - along with more junior ministers - have all resigned over the Brexit deal in the last week. They followed a flurry of other resignations in July - among them ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis. Looking back, Mrs May's tenure actually got off to a relatively strong and stable start. She had no resignations in her first 475 days as prime minister, before Michael Fallon was forced to resign as defence secretary in November 2017. Former prime minister David Cameron, by contrast, had David Laws leave his post as chief secretary to the Treasury over expenses claims after just 10 days. In just over a year, however, Mrs May has lost eight ministers, taking her level with Mr Cameron in just half the time. The only recent prime minister to come close to her rate of resignations is Gordon Brown, who lost five ministers in three days in June 2009 after a poor showing in local and European elections. Some departments appear more likely to experience resignations than others. Of the 32 cabinet ministers who have quit since 1997, six have been work and pensions: Andrew Smith and David Blunkett under Tony Blair, Peter Hain and James Purnell under Gordon Brown, Iain Duncan-Smith in David Cameron's cabinet, and Esther McVey under Mrs May. There have already been two Brexit secretaries, despite it only being a Cabinet position since July 2016. If you'd bought Â£10 worth of dollars at the beginning of the day on Thursday, you'd have got $12.99 in return. By the end of the day it would have bought you $12.77 - a difference of 1.7%. The resignations of Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and other more junior ministers appeared to have a bigger impact than those of Boris Johnson and David Davis over the summer. However, neither of the two rounds of resignations was as significant as Britain voting to leave back in June 2016, though - the pound dropped more than 10% between 21.40 BST and midnight. The draft agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the EU, due to be signed off by European leaders next month, is just the beginning of the process of leaving. The deal needs to be backed by UK Parliament, voted for by the European Parliament and approved by the EU Council before the UK can officially leave on 29 March 2019. However, the agreement is not a trade deal - details of that have yet to be hammered out. That is set to happen during the transition period, if all goes as planned. However, if Mrs May loses the vote in Parliament, the UK enters uncharted territory. The PM may seek to renegotiate with the EU, but most expect her time in Downing Street to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister. This would trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May among all Tory MPs. It would be a secret ballot, and if she won, she would be immune from challenge for a year. But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand. Unless there is a general election, the winner of any Tory leadership contest would also be expected to become prime minister.

Screen legend wins big at 'Chinese Oscars',"This video can not be played Taiwanese director Yue Fu (R) won the best documentary award Controversy has broken out at the Golden Horse awards amid a row over the status of Taiwan. The 55th annual awards - dubbed the ""Chinese Oscars"" - were held in the Taiwanese capital Taipei on Saturday. Fu Yue, who won the best documentary award, said in her acceptance speech that she hoped Taiwan would be recognised as ""independent"". Her words appeared to spark opposition from mainland Chinese stars, while Taiwan's president has also waded in. Taiwan's status is sensitive. The island has been self-ruling since 1949 but China regards it as a breakaway province it will reunite with one day. Fu, whose documentary Our Youth in Taiwan was aboutthe island's 2014 Sunflower Movement, said that ""I hope one day our country will be recognised and treated as a truly independent entity. This is my biggest wish as a Taiwanese."" Mainland Chinese former Best Actor winner Tu Men then raised more eyebrows by saying he was honoured to present an award in ""China, Taiwan"" a phrase many Taiwanese object to. He added that the two sides were like a close family. How a coffee in LA sparked a diplomatic row China warns Western firms over Taiwan Airlines bow to China's Taiwan deadline Later on Sunday, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen spoke out, saying that Taiwan ""never accepted the phrase 'China, Taiwan', and never would, because Taiwan is Taiwan"". ""I am proud of yesterday's Golden Horse Awards, that highlights the differences between Taiwan and mainland China, because of our freedom and diversity, and this is why this is a place where artistic creations can be free,"" she added in a Facebook post. By Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei Politics got in the way last night and threatens future awards ceremonies. Oscar award-winning director Ang Lee tried to defuse the tensions by calling for politics to be kept out of the awards. But leading Chinese actress Gong Li, chair of the jury, declined to stand on stage with him, reportedly because of the Taiwanese documentary winner's pro-independence comment. Many Chinese celebrities reportedly did not attend the after-ceremony party and left Taiwan early. This leaves Ang Lee, who chairs the Golden Horse committee, very worried about next year's awards. The festival and awards bring together the best in Chinese-language films. In the past, they've been able to avoid politics but not, apparently, in the current tense atmosphere. Meanwhile, one of China's most acclaimed directors, Zhang Yimou, took home the most awards for his film Shadow. Zhang Yimou, 68, took home the most awards, including Best Director Best Film went to novelist-turned-director Hu Bo for his first feature. An Elephant Sitting Still was an adaptation of his own novel, which told the story of four people who run away from their troubles to search for a mythical elephant. Hu took his own life in the Chinese capital Beijing last year, aged 29. His mother accepted the award on his behalf, thanking the jury and the audience.

"Change law on mental health at work, say firmsBosses ask the PM to honour a pledge to give it the same status as physical health in the workplace.UK","Some of Britain's biggest employers are pressing the government to honour a promise to give mental health the same status as physical health at work. Royal Mail and WH Smith are among the companies asking the PM to follow through on her manifesto pledge to update health and safety legislation. That would mean employers would have to provide appropriate training for staff to deal with mental ill-health. About one in six of people at work have symptoms of a mental health condition. A government-commissioned review,externalput the cost of those conditions, such as depression, anxiety or stress, to the economy at between Â£74bn and Â£99bn a year. PM pledges to improve mental health care Poor mental health at work 'widespread' More workers ask for mental health help At the last general election, the Conservatives said they would amend health and safety rules so employers would have to treat mental health the same way they treat physical health. Some 50 executives, including Lord Sugar and bosses from Thames Water and Ford of Britain, have written to Theresa May, asking her to prioritise this particular pledge. The companies behind the letter argue the promised change in the law would help break the stigma of mental illness at work. Fionuala Bonnar, from Mental Health First Aid England said: ""The change in legislation we are calling for will establish a baseline for protecting mental health in the workplace, ensuring no one is left behind."" Poor mental health affects half of all employees,according to a survey of 44,000 people carried out by the mental health charity Mind. It says around 300,000 people lose their job each year due to a mental health problem. A recent poll by the Institute of Directorsfound less than one in five firms offered mental health training for managers.

US-China division mars Apec summit endThere is no formal leaders's statement for the first time amid competing visions for the region.Asia,"US VP Pence (3rd right) and China's Xi did not appear together in Apec leaders pictures An Asian economic summit has ended without a formal leaders' statement for the first time because of US-China divisions over trade. Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said ""the two big giants in the room"" had been unable to agree. He said a chairman's statement for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit would be released later. The US and China are engaged in trade war and revealed competing visions for the region at the summit. In his closing comments, Mr O'Neill said Apec would try to ensure ""free and open trade"" in the region by 2020. China v the US: Not just a trade war What China wants from the Pacific US to invest more than $100m in Asia During the summit,the US said it would join Australia in developing a naval basein Papua New Guinea (PNG), in an apparent move to curb China's growing influence. US Vice-President Mike Pence said the base would help ""protect sovereignty and maritime rights in the Pacific islands"". On Saturday Chinese PresidentXi Jinping took a swipe at the US's America First policyby saying that countries that embraced protectionism were ""doomed to failure"". Mr Xi (C) criticised the US's America First policy Mr Pence later said he was prepared to ""more than double"" the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. He also criticised China's massive Belt-and-Road infrastructure programme, warning smaller countries that ""opaque"" Chinese development loans led to ""staggering debt"". He urged countries to work with the US instead, saying the US did not ""coerce, corrupt or compromise your independence"". Mr Xi insisted that there was no ""hidden agenda"" to the Belt-and-Road scheme. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war.

"Brexit debate dominates Sunday interviewsTheresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and Dominic Raab face TV grillings over their Brexit positions.","Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been on Sky News, with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Mrs May warns party rivals that replacing her won't make Brexit negotiations easier or ""change the parliamentary arithmetic"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says a further referendum is ""an option for the future but not an option for today"" Publication of the draft withdrawal agreement led to the resignations of two senior ministers and several junior ministers and aides Brian Wheeler and Tom Moseley From free trade agreement to no deal, find out what the key terms mean. What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sir Cable said the whole issue of Europe was divisive and the ""least damaging"" way forward now would be to go back to the people, put the question before them and come to a ""clear decision"". The case would be made on facts rather than promises, as it was a few years ago, he said. Asked if he thought Mrs May would keep her job, Sir Vince said: ""I think so.""

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Screen legend wins big at 'Chinese Oscars'Zhang Yimou's Shadow wins the most plaudits at the 55th Golden Horse film awards in Taiwan.Asia,"This video can not be played Taiwanese director Yue Fu (R) won the best documentary award Controversy has broken out at the Golden Horse awards amid a row over the status of Taiwan. The 55th annual awards - dubbed the ""Chinese Oscars"" - were held in the Taiwanese capital Taipei on Saturday. Fu Yue, who won the best documentary award, said in her acceptance speech that she hoped Taiwan would be recognised as ""independent"". Her words appeared to spark opposition from mainland Chinese stars, while Taiwan's president has also waded in. Taiwan's status is sensitive. The island has been self-ruling since 1949 but China regards it as a breakaway province it will reunite with one day. Fu, whose documentary Our Youth in Taiwan was aboutthe island's 2014 Sunflower Movement, said that ""I hope one day our country will be recognised and treated as a truly independent entity. This is my biggest wish as a Taiwanese."" Mainland Chinese former Best Actor winner Tu Men then raised more eyebrows by saying he was honoured to present an award in ""China, Taiwan"" a phrase many Taiwanese object to. He added that the two sides were like a close family. How a coffee in LA sparked a diplomatic row China warns Western firms over Taiwan Airlines bow to China's Taiwan deadline Later on Sunday, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen spoke out, saying that Taiwan ""never accepted the phrase 'China, Taiwan', and never would, because Taiwan is Taiwan"". ""I am proud of yesterday's Golden Horse Awards, that highlights the differences between Taiwan and mainland China, because of our freedom and diversity, and this is why this is a place where artistic creations can be free,"" she added in a Facebook post. By Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei Politics got in the way last night and threatens future awards ceremonies. Oscar award-winning director Ang Lee tried to defuse the tensions by calling for politics to be kept out of the awards. But leading Chinese actress Gong Li, chair of the jury, declined to stand on stage with him, reportedly because of the Taiwanese documentary winner's pro-independence comment. Many Chinese celebrities reportedly did not attend the after-ceremony party and left Taiwan early. This leaves Ang Lee, who chairs the Golden Horse committee, very worried about next year's awards. The festival and awards bring together the best in Chinese-language films. In the past, they've been able to avoid politics but not, apparently, in the current tense atmosphere. Meanwhile, one of China's most acclaimed directors, Zhang Yimou, took home the most awards for his film Shadow. Zhang Yimou, 68, took home the most awards, including Best Director Best Film went to novelist-turned-director Hu Bo for his first feature. An Elephant Sitting Still was an adaptation of his own novel, which told the story of four people who run away from their troubles to search for a mythical elephant. Hu took his own life in the Chinese capital Beijing last year, aged 29. His mother accepted the award on his behalf, thanking the jury and the audience.

Probe into tighter control of fireworks,"The Scottish government is to consider tighter controls on the use of fireworks. The move follows increased concern over anti-social behaviour linked to their use. Community safety minister Ash Denham wants to hear the public's views and a consultation will begin next year. The study will consider measures to reduce their misuse, including restrictions on where and when fireworks can be used. The feedback will influence ongoing discussions with the UK government about legislation governing the sale of fireworks, which is currently reserved. The aim is to reduce dangerous and anti-social behaviour around bonfire night Ms Denham said: ""Many people enjoy attending fireworks displays but I am very aware from conversations with members of the public and emergency service workers that there is growing concern about the use and sale of fireworks to individuals. ""The hard work of the police and fire services to tackle dangerous and anti-social behaviour helped to reduce the number of bonfire night incidents this year. ""However, there were still a number of concerning reports and I am keen to hear the public's views on the impact of fireworks and action we could take to improve the situation further."" Bonfire night arrests in Edinburgh Dispersal zone plan for Bonfire Night in Edinburgh Police officer burned by firework in Edinburgh The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service welcomed the consultation, which will be launched early next year. Assistant Chief Officer David McGown, said: ""Our service welcomes any wider public debate around matters of safety, which includes fire, and in particular the use of fireworks.

Ex-militia leader 'Rambo' is extradited,"Mr Yekatom (C) was arrested last month by members of the armed services An MP and former militia leader in the Central African Republic (CAR) has been extradited to The Hague to face trial for crimes against humanity. Alfred Yekatom arrived at the International Criminal Court (ICC) detention centre on Saturday. The ICC alleges he was responsible for murder,external, torture, attacking civilians and using child fighters. Mr Yekatom, known as ""Rambo"", led a Christian militia which formed after Muslim rebels seized power in 2013. The group formed part of a band of mostly Christian militias, called the anti-Balaka, which rose up to counter the rebels. The allegations against Mr Yekatom, which include war crimes, date back to late 2013 and early 2014. Mr Yekatom was elected as an MP in 2016, despite being subject to UN sanctions. He was arrested last month when he fired a gun in parliament, then ran away, after a row with a fellow MP. This is the first extradition to the court from the CAR. The International Federation for Human Rights (known by its French acronym FIDH) said it signalled the authorities were committed to fighting impunity. Sectarian violence continues to grip the CAR, with nearly 40 people dying in clashes on Friday in the centre of the country. Meanwhile, a UN peacekeeper died of injuries he received in a gunfight during an attack on a base in the west of the country. A priest was also burnt to death in a central town, and the UN said thousands of people were forced to flee violence. In 2013, Muslim militias called the Seleka seized power in Central African Republic Largely Christian fighters known as the anti-Balaka took up arms to fight back More than a million people have since been displaced by continued fighting, and thousands killed About 13,000 United Nations peacekeepers are deployed in the country at a cost of nearly $900m (Â£686m) per year in the mission known as Minusca Central African Republic profile 'Ethnic cleansing' of CAR Muslims The country where teachers have disappeared Central African Republic country profile Top football post for CAR ex-militia chief Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Adler: EU determined to keep calm and carry on,"Germany's Angela Merkel and Irish leader Leo Varadkar have both stressed they have no appetite to amend the Brexit deal Again and again throughout this Brexit process I've been struck by the chasm in thinking between leading UK politicians and the viewpoint of EU leaders. But the current state of affairs is particularly surreal. As the UK's political class twists and turns itself into a spitting Brexit frenzy and the pound fluctuates hysterically on the currency markets, the EU has popped on its blinkers, clapped its hands firmly over its metaphorical ears and is resolutely continuing preparations for a special summit of EU leaders to sign a Brexit deal that many in the UK believe/hope could yet end up in the bin. So far, nothing - none of the screaming headlines back in the UK - is managing to distract the EU from its focus. This video can not be played May responds to call to stand aside This, first and foremost, is because Theresa May stands firmly behind the Brexit deal. And Europeans view her as the UK's chief Brexit negotiator. UK cabinet ministers - even Brexit secretaries - can come and go, but as long as the prime minister remains on board, EU leaders believe the seal-the-deal Brexit summit will go ahead. There is also zero - really, truly, honestly, not just saying it - zero-intention or appetite in Europe to start renegotiating the withdrawal deal with the UK. For Europe's leaders, the document is the result of 19 months of intense and tense negotiations working towards something (Brexit) that none of them wants and which has already sucked up an enormous amount of time, energy and money across the European capitals in preparation. Of course, the EU would rather the UK changed its mind and stayed in the club. But if it is leaving then this, they say, is the deal on the table. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told EU ambassadors on Friday that the European Union should not start a last minute bargaining process. Live: Theresa May vows to sell Brexit deal No Brexit renegotiation, EU leaders warn Brexiteers Gove and Fox back PM amid Tory revolt The EU should protect its principles, he said: meaning standing by the backstop guarantee on the Irish border. Brussels wants to close this chapter and move on. But remember: we're talking about the divorce deal here. Not the future EU-UK trade deal. Sure, EU and UK negotiators are hammering out a document this weekend to outline the kind of relationship they intend to have with one another after Brexit but - spoiler alert - when it comes to the chapter on future economic relations, expect their text to be suitably vague. This video can not be played Brexit: What just happened? And, anyway, this document unlike the Brexit withdrawal agreement is not legally binding. Detailed negotiations on the new EU-UK trade deal will only begin after Brexit day and the UK is legally, if not politically, free to choose - and change - the kind of economic relationship it wants with the bloc: very closeÃ  laEEA (European Economic Area),or a more arm's-length deal like Canada has. But, since it takes two to tango in negotiations, each choice has consequences under EU law. More from Katya:Volatile UK politics could bin Brexit deal, worries EU A Canada-like free-trade agreement can never - whatever David Davis and others promised - offer frictionless trade. And it would lead to a customs border on the island of Ireland unless a separate arrangement is agreed for Northern Ireland. Whereas being a member of the EEA would mean the UK accepting freedom of movement and paying into the EU budget. But the by-now hugely controversial EU-UK customs relationship outlined in the Brexit withdrawal treaty need never come about. It is an on-paper insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland since, as already discussed, no-one knows right now what the future economic relationship will look like between the EU and the UK. Explained: The Irish border Brexit backstop Your questions answered Brexit: Where we are in eight charts How could May turmoil affect Brexit? The reason it is a UK-wide customs arrangement is because Theresa May, not the EU, wanted it to be. And, if a new trade deal is ready between the two sides before the end of the transition period - the end of 2020 - then the ""backstop"" customs partnership would be superseded. If it isn't ready, the UK government could ask the EU to extend the transition period instead, though that of course has consequences too: ongoing freedom of movement, payments into the EU budget etc. Please upgrade your browser The options don't look appetising perhaps but, as I have said, if the UK parliament now rejects the Brexit withdrawal deal, hoping to renegotiate a ""better"" (i.e more successfully cake-and-eat-it) deal, then the EU doesn't want to know. But they would likely ""freeze"" the Article 50 process if the UK were to hold a general election or a second referendum. Out of self-interest, of course. Firstly, because the EU wants to avoid a costly, chaotic no-deal scenario and, secondly, because as France's Emmanuel Macron has said so often, they will keep the door open until the last moment in case the UK should change its mind about leaving. But, deep down, Europeans think a nationwide change of heart is unlikely and that the Brexit deal will in the end be signed. Which is why, in stark contrast to the UK media obsession with the current political turmoil, Brexit is far, far down the running order of evening news programmes across Europe.

Rules for any challenge to Theresa May,"A majority of Tory MPs have said they want Boris Johnson to remain party leader and prime minister. But critics suggest his authority has been undermined and he still faces challenges to keep his job. All 359 Conservative MPs took part in the vote. Mr Johnson received the support of 211 of them, with 148 voting against him. The result means Mr Johnson was supported by 59% of his MPs. As the ballot was held in secret, Tory MPs don't have to say how they voted, but some have chosen to do so. The PM will know his opponents are not defeated Boris Johnson is not the first prime minister to have been challenged. Theresa May: In a vote over her Brexit policy, Mrs May survived a confidence vote witha majority of 83 in December 2018. Despite winning, she resigned as PM six months later Iain Duncan Smith:Following months of speculation the Tory leadernarrowly lost a confidence vote in October 2003,externaland resigned John Major:Triggered a contest in 1995 byresigning as leader of the Tory party(though not as prime minister) amid disagreements inside the party over Europe. Mr Major beat challenger John Redwood, but went on to lose the 1997 election Margaret Thatcher:Resigned as PM in 1990 afterfailing to win outright victory for party leadership,external. She beat Michael Heseltine by 204 votes to 152, but was persuaded to stand down by her Cabinet Having survived, Mr Johnson can continue as Conservative Party leader and therefore prime minister. However, by-elections to pick new MPs in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton will be held on 23 June. If they are taken by opposition parties, Mr Johnson could find himself under renewed pressure. Although Mr Johnson won the vote, MPs could still consider options to try to remove him: Change the rules At present, Conservative MPs will not be allowed to hold another confidence vote for a year. However, there has been speculation the rules could be changed, in order to hold another vote sooner. When asked about it, Sir Graham Brady MP - the chairman of a group called the 1922 Committee, which represents Tory backbenchers - said ""technically, it's possible"". Cabinet pressure The Cabinet - made up senior members of the government - could put political pressure on the PM to resign. This happened toMargaret Thatcher in 1990,external, despite having defeated Michael Heseltine who had challenged for the leadership. A far less likely route would be for the Cabinet to go the Queen and declare they don't have confidence in the PM. However, this ""would drag the Queen into a very difficult position"" says Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government. Motion of no confidence in the prime minister A confidence vote where all MPs - not just Conservatives - get to vote has been proposed by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey. The government is very unlikely to make time in Parliament to hold such a vote, according to Ms Haddon. However, if the leader of the opposition - Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - introduces the motion, convention means the government will provide time. It would need just one more MP to vote in favour than the number voting against in order to pass. However, Tory MPs are very unlikely to go down this path says Ms Haddon: ""They would only use this mechanism as a last resort if they had no other way to dislodge Boris Johnson."" If Mr Johnson stood down, a leadership contest would be triggered. The eventual winner would become prime minister. In order to stand, candidates need the support of eight other Tory MPs. If there are more than two candidates, Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two remain. in the first round, candidates must get 5% of the votes to stay in the running (18 MPs) in the second round, they must get 10% (36 MPs) in the following rounds, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated When two MPs are left, Conservative Party members around the country - not just MPs - will vote for the winner.

Democrat Gillum concedes in Florida raceThe man hoping to be Florida's first black governor admits defeat after votes are recounted.US & Canada,"Andrew Gillum admitted defeat following a recount in Florida. Democrat Andrew Gillum has admitted defeat to his Republican rival in the race to be named Florida's governor - for the second time. Mr Gillum, who hoped to be Florida's first black governor, congratulated Ron DeSantis in a tweet, 10 days after he first conceded the 6 November election. He withdrew the initial concession after Mr DeSantis's lead narrowed to 0.41%, triggering a recount. A recount has also been ordered in Florida's Senate race. US mid-terms: Why the elections still aren't over Unofficial results revealed Republican former governor Rick Scott was leading Democrat Bill Nelson by just 0.15% for a seat in the US Senate. Florida is a well-known swing state and has a history of close elections, so the slim margins are not a major surprise.

Ireland hold nerve to beat All BlacksJacob Stockdale's second-half try helps Ireland earn a first ever home win over New Zealand as they clinch a 16-9 triumph.BBC SportComments,"Irish joy was unconfined after the final whistle at the Aviva Stadium Autumn internationals: Ireland v New Zealand Ireland: (9) 16 Tries:StockdaleCons:SextonPens:Sexton 3 New Zealand: (6) 9 Pens:Barrett 2Drop Goal:Barrett Ireland have beaten New Zealand on home soil for the first time with a frenzied 16-9 win at the Aviva Stadium. Jacob Stockdale's superb chip-and-gather try decided an absorbing contest between the top two sides in the world. Johnny Sexton advanced his claims for the world player of the year award with the rest of Ireland's points. The Grand Slam champions added to their historic first win over the All Blacks in 2016 as they sent out a warning before next year's Rugby World Cup. Stockdale's try pushed his side into a 10-point lead in the 49th minute and they produced a heroic defensive display, led by man-of-the-match Peter O'Mahony, to repel the inevitable New Zealand fightback as 'The Fields of Athenry' rang through the Dublin night. Relive the moment Ireland beat the All Blacks Schmidt scoffs at Hansen's 'Ireland now number one' claim A game of tiny margins was ultimately decided by a moment of brilliance from Stockdale which had Joe Schmidt's imprint all over it. Off a 10-metre line-out - Ireland's favourite attacking platform - the home side swung the ball towards the right before Bundee Aki dramatically switched direction and fed Stockdale down the narrow side. It left last season's Six Nations player of the year facing a group of weary All Blacks who were still picking themselves up from the line-out. The Ulster wing's deft chip took them out of play and he won the sprint with Aaron Smith to gather and score the decisive try. Jacob Stockdale's try helped push Ireland into a 16-6 lead and they held on despite intense late New Zealand pressure The tone for a frenzied but absorbing contest was set from the off when the Irish team took a half-step towards the New Zealand haka and sent the crowd into overdrive. The adrenaline coursed from the stands down onto the pitch, where New Zealand set a bewildering tempo, but a wonderful steal by Josh van der Flier and CJ Stander under their own posts helped Ireland to clear the danger. The All Blacks were living dangerously without the ball and repeatedly were warned for offside by referee Wayne Barnes as a half-time penalty count of 9-2 against the visitors told its own story. Sexton and Beauden Barrett traded early scores but the home side were unquestionably on top with Stockdale and Garry Ringrose looking menacing with every possession. Sexton nudged Ireland back ahead before Barrett landed a wonderful drop-goal to keep his side in touch after Cian Healy had been held up over the line and Rob Kearney had knocked-on in the act of scoring at the other end. Ireland dominated the second quarter after a superb gather-and-go by Stockdale brought them into the opposition half and they appeared determined not to leave without a try. A cross kick to Stockdale did not succeed but New Zealand's creaking defence continued to concede penalties and Kieran Read was warned about his team's indiscipline as Sexton eventually settled for a penalty to give his side a 9-6 half-time lead. Peter O'Mahony produced a number of vital interventions for Ireland in a man-of-the-match display Stockdale's try was the score Ireland deserved for their first-half domination and - crucially - pushed them more than a converted try ahead. But New Zealand are not the world's number one side for no reason and the black jerseys began to gather momentum in the final quarter. Reiko Ioane cut a dangerous figure with ball in hand and Kearney had to scamper back to gather Ardie Savea's kick through. Next it was O'Mahony's turn to save the day as the Munster captain somehow managed to pivot and dive on Barrett's grubber, and minutes later he put his body on the line again to produce a brilliant turnover that lifted the siege and simultaneously forced him off the field with an injury. Sexton conceded a penalty for a high tackle that allowed his opposite number to shrink the gap to seven points but the Ireland fly-half was fired up and he punched the air with a roar minutes later when he combined with Stockdale to bundle Ben Smith out of touch. Sexton also departed before the end as the big hits continued to rain in but the Irish line held firm to clinch a momentous victory. Ireland's man of the match Peter O'Mahony:""They're not the number one team in the world for nothing. We probably had to play our best game of this term and thankfully we managed to do that. ""It's a big piece of history and one that we wanted to tick off here in Ireland and now we have done it."" Ireland captain Rory Best:""To stop New Zealand scoring a try shows what a fantastic effort it was. The boys are very tired in there but it's amazing what a win like that can do to give you a little bit more energy. ""It's a big result for us no matter what the context is. Yet again, we've raised the standard of what we expect. The problem is Joe and the team and going to expect that and more [from now on].""

'Illegal' women's football player named,"The family of Laura Wiltsher identified her in this photo from a women's match at Luton in 1935 The nephew of a footballer pictured at an ""illegal"" women's match in 1935 has said he feels ""proud"" of her. Mervyn Lammiman spotted Laura Wiltsher in a photo discovered by Luton Town's historian, showing women's matches at the club's Kenilworth Road ground. The Football Association (FA) had banned such matches, calling the sport ""quite unsuitable for females"". Mr Lammiman said: ""Without a doubt, I'm proud. The picture shows the ground was packed during women's matches."" Luton Town hadappealed for help to discover more about two picturesshowing women's football at its ground, in contravention of anFA ban that ran from 1921 to 1971.,external Mervyn Lammiman is a lifelong Luton Town supporter and said he was ""proud"" of his aunt Mr Lammiman, 71, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said: ""When I saw a photo online, I thought 'She doesn't half look like one of my family'. ""Then I found out people had told my cousin Linda it looked like her mum, my auntie Laura."" Mr Lammiman's aunt died in 1999 but he doesn't remember her speaking about playing at Kenilworth Road. ""All we know is she used to play for M&S, and sometimes Woolworths,"" he said, ""It's an important part of our history; the door's been opened and this is just the beginning."" It is not known who the child in the photo is and, although both photos are believed to have been taken in 1935, they are not dated more precisely.

Brexit plan can be improved - Leadsom,"This video can not be played I'm not a plotter, says Andrea Leadsom There is ""still the potential to improve"" the draft Brexit deal, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has said. While she backed Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to get the ""best possible deal"", she warned the UK could not be ""trapped"" in an EU customs union. The BBC understands that Brexiteer Mrs Leadsom is part of a group of five ministers hoping to amend the deal. Despite widespread criticism of the draft withdrawal agreement, Mrs May has vowed to ""see it through"". The585-page document,externalsets out the terms of the UK's departure, including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens' rights. It is due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday, 25 November. The publication of the draft text prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning. Some Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership. Mark Francois, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have sent a letter, said Mrs May's plan would leave the UK ""half in and half out"" of the EU and everyone knew she would never get it through Parliament. As it happened: May bids to shore up support Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May Danger has not passed for Theresa May Brexit: Where we are in eight charts But Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan urged his other fellow MPs to ""stop and reflect"", saying a leadership challenge was not going to get the country a better deal than Mrs May's. ""All it's likely to do is create chaos, break the government, break the party and leave the country in great disarray."" If there were to be a confidence vote in Mrs May's leadership, party veteran Ken Clarke said she would ""easily"" win it but Nadine Dorries was doubtful, saying ""when pen comes to paper"" most MPs would vote against her in a secret ballot. By Susana MendonÃ§a, BBC political correspondent When they didn't jump ship over Theresa May's Brexit deal you might have thought that meant these key Brexiteers in her cabinet were ready to toe the line in a show of what's supposed to be known as ""collective responsibility"". But the fact that they're still manoeuvring to change the details of the prime minister's deal (while declaring their support for her), is yet another sign of the extraordinary political times we are in. This apparent gang of five inside the cabinet differ in their priorities. Andrea Leadsom - who's understood to be leading them - doesn't want Britain to be trapped in an endless backstop, and wants technological solutions to get around it. Environment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The group is at an ""embryonic"" stage but will they get their tweaks? Andrea Leadsom thinks there's ""still more to be done"" and that they ""do still have more time"" before the EU Council at the end of the month. But that leaves only just over a week - and the EU doesn't look to be in the market for renegotiation at the moment. On Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other cabinet ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something ""winnable and supportable"". The four ministers believed to working with Mrs Leadsom are Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling. Speaking to the BBC in her constituency, Mrs Leadsom said: ""What I'm doing is working very hard to support the prime minister in getting the Brexit deal that 17.4 million people voted for. ""I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with."" Among her concerns was that ""the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement"" with the EU, she said. She added: ""I wouldn't describe myself as a plotter. I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal."" Reality Check: Making sense of the Brexit deal How a day of resignations and appointments unfolded The five Brexit questions everyone's asking Google The cabinet ""gang of five"" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this. The backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable. The UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent. This video can not be played BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier According to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue. The group's plans were described as a ""work in progress"", and a ""last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons"". The deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament. Ahead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. If it is voted down, the EU would be open to ""tweaks"" but a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron has said ""nothing fundamental"" could change. Our correspondent adds that if it came to a general election or another referendum, the EU would likely be open to putting the leaving process on ice to avoid a no-deal Brexit and in the hope the UK might change its mind and stay in the EU. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU should not enter ""some kind of bargaining process"" over parts of the text, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the EU and the UK had agreed the text so negotiations should not continue. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested that Labour could renegotiate the deal before the UK is due to leave the EU in March next year. ""I think we can do it with good will, we can change the atmosphere of negotiations into one of mutual interest and mutual benefit,"" he told Sky News. Meanwhile, the prime ministertold the Daily Mail,externalthe withdrawal agreement was ""not everybody's ideal deal"" but said her job was to make ""tough decisions"" and ""find a way through"". She also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue. Commenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been ""a pretty heavy couple of days"". The PM says her husband is protective over her She revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her ""rock"", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast. On Friday night, Mrs May called dozens of constituency chairmen to appeal to them to back her deal and her leadership - and this weekend she is expected to embark on a ""social media blitz"" to try to sell her plans to people not usually engaged in politics. Mrs May's comments come after Stephen Barclay was picked as the new Brexit secretary - replacing Dominic Raab who quit on Thursday. How could May turmoil affect Brexit? A guide to where we are with Brexit A No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay, who becomes the third Brexit secretary since the role was created, would focus on domestic preparations for Brexit, rather than the negotiations. Amber Rudd returns to the frontbench - she quit as home secretary in April over the Windrush controversy In other developments: Amber Rudd was named as the new work and pensions secretary - replacing Esther McVey who also quit over the deal Stephen Hammond takes over from Mr Barclay as a health minister in the mini-reshuffle And John Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara; while Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman David Davis, Brexit secretary before Mr Raab, pressed Mrs May for a looser deal with the EU, saying the US would be ready to start negotiating a free trade deal straight after Brexit if she ditches her plan On Sunday, the pro-Brexit European Research Group plans to publish a seven-page summary of the 585-page draft agreement The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland warned that ""anything that re-emphasises"" the Irish border presented challenges for policing and thethreat of violence was not being exaggerated Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar told his party thathis government wants to build bridges rather than new borders.

UK 'not standing up to Brussels bullies',"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""I've got huge respect for her... it's not flim flam"" Theresa May has told her critics that getting rid of her as PM would not make delivering Brexit any easier. Mrs May defended last week's draft agreement for leaving the EU and said there was a ""critical"" week ahead. She suggested agreeing more details of UK's future relationship with the EU, ahead of an expected summit next week, could satisfy the concerns of some of the Tory MPs opposed to her plans. Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was being ""bullied"" by the EU. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party could get a better deal in time for Brexit, which is due to happen on 29 March. May and Corbyn interviews and reaction Referendum not an option for now - Corbyn Reality Check: What does the draft agreement reveal? Rules for any challenge to Theresa May There has been widespread criticism of the 585-page withdrawal agreement - published alongside a  shorter document setting out what the UK and EU's future relationship could look like - which is set be signed off at a summit next week. There is also doubt over whether it can win the approval of the House of Commons. Some cabinet ministers have resigned, including Mr Raab, and others are believed to be trying to change its wording. In other developments: The European Commission has proposed 31 December 2022 as the ultimate end date for any extension to the post-Brexit transition period The key Brexiteer group of Tory MPshas published,externalits rebuttal of the draft plan - saying it will make the UK a ""rule-taker"" A poll of 505 Tory councillors found more were against the deal than for it - but a majority wanted MPs to back Theresa May Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonconfirmed her MPswould vote against the deal Mrs May told Sky News's Ridge on Sunday it had been a ""tough week"" but that she would not be distracted. She added the next seven days ""are going to be critical"" for the UK's future. Asked whether Sir Graham Brady - chairman of the backbench 1922 committee - had received the 48 letters needed to trigger a confidence vote in her leadership, she replied: ""As far as I know, no - it has not."" And in a warning to those pushing for a change of leader, she said: ""It is not going to make the negotiations any easier and it won't change the parliamentary arithmetic."" This video can not be played BBC correspondents explain 585 pages faster than you could print them... on a BBC photocopier Mrs May said negotiations were still taking place to put more detail into the future deal proposals, saying it was this part that ""delivers on the Brexit vote"". She also said she would be meeting European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels ahead of the summit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler The European Commission says Mrs May will only meet Mr Juncker when concrete progress has been made on the content of the political declaration document on the future relationship. Those negotiations have been going on this weekend and had been expected to conclude on Tuesday - let's see. EU sources are clearly spelling out that the PM's visit would be to finalise this political declaration - and not to re-open the withdrawal deal approved last week by the cabinet. Despite the political turmoil in the UK, the EU intends the Brexit summit between EU leaders and the PM to go ahead next Sunday unless she is kicked out of her job, or she suddenly politically denounces the divorce deal she has been trying to sell. Don't forget - the withdrawal agreement will be legally binding. The political declaration on the future will not. It can be altered after Brexit, because it is only then that the detailed EU-UK negotiations on a future trade deal begin in earnest. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has been meeting diplomats from the 27 remaining EU member states. The EU has now proposed 31 December 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible extension to the transition period. This period, during which the UK will have left but arrangements will largely continue as they are, is currently forecast to finish by the end of 2020. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The draft withdrawal agreement includes the option of extending it if more time is needed to reach a trade deal - but rather than specifying an end date, says a decision may be taken ""extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]."" Also in the meeting there was a divide between states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who want Britain's access to the single market to be more constrained, BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said. The UK wants to maintain the status quo on internal security, which is also ""a problem,"" ambassadors were told. And Spain raised serious concerns about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days, he added. A diplomat said the message from the EU's Brexit negotiators to the member states was: ""Keep a lid on your concerns for now and we'll deal with them in the negotiations on the future relationship."" Sir Graham told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics he would not reveal how many letters he had received - saying he had not even told his wife, who is his parliamentary assistant. ""I get asked in the supermarket, in the street,"" he said. Sir Graham said he found the suggestion he had received 48 letters but not acted on it to be ""slightly offensive"". ""It's critical that people trust my integrity in this,"" he said. Sir Graham also told the BBC's Sunday Politics North West it was ""very likely"" Mrs May would win a vote of no-confidence if there was one. It is difficult to see how the 25 November EU summit could go ahead if Mrs May were to lose a confidence vote next week. It is up to Sir Graham to decide when such a vote would be held, but he has said the process will move quickly. The last time a Tory leader was ousted by their own MPs, in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith faced a confidence vote the next day. If Mrs May were to lose that confidence vote it would spark a leadership election but she would not be allowed to run. She would remain prime minister until the contest was over unless she opted to resign and hand over to a caretaker prime minister. In either circumstance, her version of Brexit would be in doubt. European Council President Donald Tusk has said the summit will go ahead unless something ""extraordinary"" happens - he did not elaborate on what that might be. The Tory leadership rules explained Mr Raab, who negotiated with the EU's Michel Barnier, explained his decision to quit on the BBC's Andrew Marr show. With ""two or three points"" being changed he could support the government's proposals, he said. He said he did not know who had inserted a clause on customs relations into the future partnership document but said it was a ""clear breach"" of the Conservative manifesto. ""The difficulty for me is that I was being asked to go over to Brussels and sign on the bottom line... on a deal which I said in good conscience I did not feel was right for the country,"" he said. ""I do think we are being bullied, I do think we are being subjected to what is pretty close to blackmail frankly. ""I do think there is a point at which, we probably should have done it before, where we just say 'I'm sorry this is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we cannot accept those dictated terms'."" The draft document,externalsets out the terms of the UK's departure, including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens' rights. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to include in the deal a ""backstop"" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this. This would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable. And the UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent. Danger has not passed for Theresa May Brexit: Where we are in eight charts Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthe Brexiteer MP Zac Goldsmith said under the PM's plan ""in effect, Britain would remain in the EU, but without having any say"". He added: ""Had that been the choice, I personally would have voted to remain."" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says his party, which has 257 MPs, will not support the deal. He told Sky News the ""one-way agreement"" on Northern Ireland was ""not acceptable"", and there were no guarantees on workers' rights and environmental protections. If it was voted down in the Commons, he said the government should go back to the EU and ""renegotiate, rapidly"". Mr Corbyn insisted Labour would be able to negotiate a better deal, saying the proposed transition period - which will only happen if there is a withdrawal agreement - offered ""some opportunities"" for this.

Willow sub marks WW1 U-boat surrenderMore than 160 German U-boats surrendered to Allied forces off the Essex coast in November 1918.Essex,"This video can not be played Model U-boat on beach marks surrender A model U-boat has been created to commemorate the mass surrender of Germany's submarines on the Essex coast at the end of World War One. More than 160 U-boats surrendered at Harwich in November 1918, at one point stretching in a two-mile (3km) line. While most were taken to go on display, many were left beached at Harwich before being sunk or taken by the sea. The model has been created as part of centenary celebrations. It measures 15m (49.2ft) long, is made of willow and sits on Dovercourt Beach. U-boats were moored three-to-four-abreast on the north bank of the River Stour The crew members of one of the U-boats, who would have boarded a transport ship to take them back to Germany David Cain, project director for Harwich Haven History Surrender and Sanctuary, described the surrender as an ""important part of national and local maritime history that has been completely forgotten over the last 100 years"". He said: ""We wanted to have a landmark and have something to stay on the beach, much like the U-boats which were left beached here. ""Because it's biodegradable, it will slowly fade into the sea, maybe over the next two or three years."" On 20 November 1918 - nine days after Armistice Day - the first batch of U-boats crossed the North Sea to the British coast. They were met by a small flotilla of British warships led by Rear Adm Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt, commanding officer of the Harwich fleet. The British fleet meet one of the U-boats outside Harwich Harbour In the following days, the U-boats and up to 50 other German vessels were escorted along the River Stour by British ships. They were then moored, often four abreast, to be commandeered by the authorities. Rear Adm Tyrwhitt ruled there should be ""no communication whatsoever"" with the Germans, who were packed on to transport ships and sent home without being allowed to set foot on British soil. Most of the U-boats - some of which were 100m (328ft) long - were put on display in places such as Brighton and Liverpool, while one was taken to Japan. But some were left on the beach and the estuary eventually became known as ""U-boat alley"", said Mr Cain. To mark the centenary of the surrender, the project has also organised talks, parades, film screenings and heritage walks, as well as a1918-themed train,externalrunning from Manningtree to Harwich.

"France fuel protests take deadly turnMore than 280,000 people took part in protests across France against the rising price of fuel.Europe","This video can not be played Thousands march in France over diesel tax One protester has died and more than 200 were injured as more than a quarter of a million people took to the streets of France, angry at rising fuel prices. The female protester who died was struck after a driver surrounded by demonstrators panicked and accelerated. The ""yellow vests"", so-called after the high-visibility jackets they are required to carry in their cars, blocked motorways and roundabouts. They accuse President Emmanuel Macron of abandoning ""the little people"". Mr Macron has not so far commented on the protests, some of which have seen demonstrators call for him to resign. But he admitted earlier in the week that he had not ""really managed to reconcile the French people with their leaders"". Six held in plot to 'attack' Macron 'Gauls' resistant to change - Macron Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work Nonetheless, he accused his political opponents of hijacking the movement in order to block his reform programme. Some 280,000 people took part in protests across France, the interior ministry said in its latest update. It said 227 people were injured during the day, seven seriously, with 52 people arrested. Most of the protests have been taking place without incident although several of the injuries came when drivers tried to force their way through protesters. A driver forces a car through a group of protesters in Donges, western France Chantal Mazet, 63, was killed in the south-eastern Savoy region when a driver who was taking her daughter to hospital panicked at being blocked by about 50 demonstrators, who were striking the roof of her vehicle, and drove into them. The driver has been taken into police custody in a state of shock. In Paris protesters approaching the ÃlysÃ©e Palace, the president's official residence, were repelled with tear gas. The price of diesel, the most commonly used fuel in French cars, has risen by around 23% over the past 12 months to an average of â¬1.51 (Â£1.32; $1.71) per litre, its highest point since the early 2000s, AFP news agency reports. World oil prices did rise before falling back again but the Macron government raised its hydrocarbon tax this year by 7.6 cents per litre on diesel and 3.9 cents on petrol, as part of a campaign for cleaner cars and fuel. Tear gas was used to disperse protesters in Paris The decision to impose a further increase of 6.5 cents on diesel and 2.9 cents on petrol on 1 January 2019 was seen as the final straw. Speaking on Wednesday, the president blamed world oil prices for three-quarters of the price rise. He also said more tax on fossil fuels was needed to fund renewable energy investments. It has broad support. Nearly three-quarters of respondents to a poll by the Elabe institute backed the Yellow Vests and 70% wanted the government to reverse the fuel tax hikes. More than half of French people who voted for Mr Macron support the protests, Elabe's Vincent Thibault told AFP. Police attend as protesters block a motorway in Antibes ""The expectations and discontent over spending power are fairly broad, it's not just something that concerns rural France or the lower classes,"" he said. The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris says the movement has grown via social media into a broad and public criticism of Mr Macron's economic policies. They have certainly tried to tap into it. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who was defeated by Mr Macron in the second round of the presidential election, has been encouraging it on Twitter. She said: ""The government shouldn't be afraid of French people who come to express their revolt and do it in a peaceful fashion."" Allow Twitter content?

Laurent Wauquiez, leader of the centre-right Republicans, called on the Macron government to scrap the next planned increase in carbon tax on fossil fuels in January to offset rising vehicle fuel prices. Mr Castaner has described Saturday's action as a ""political protest with the Republicans behind it"". Olivier Faure, leader of the left-wing Socialist Party said the movement - which has no single leader and is not linked to any trade union - had been ""born outside political parties"". ""People want politicians to listen to them and respond. Their demand is to have purchasing power and financial justice,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, the government announced action to help poor families pay their energy and transport bills. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced that 5.6 million households would receive energy subsidies. Currently 3.6 million receive them. A state scrappage bonus on polluting vehicles would also be doubled for France's poorest families, he said, and fuel tax credits would be brought in for people who depend on their cars for work. Protesters have mocked the president relentlessly as ""Micron"" or ""Macaron"" (Macaroon) or simply Manu, the short form of Emmanuel, which he famously scolded a student for using.
