Charles' former aide steps down over honour claims,"This video can not be played ""Is the story true?"" - Michael Fawcett faces reporters after claims about his conduct surfaced. A former aide to the Prince of Wales has temporarily stepped down from his role as chief executive of The Prince's Foundation amid claims that he helped secure an honour for a major donor. Michael Fawcett has been accused of offering to help a wealthy Saudi businessman with an honour. Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz received an honorary CBE in late 2016. The prince was not aware of any link between donations to the foundation and honours, a close source told the BBC. The Met Police said it was ""aware of media reports and await further contact in relation to this matter"". Mr Fawcett became chief executive of the Prince's Foundation in 2018. It is an educational charity and encompasses a number of Prince Charles' charitable interests. The heritage-led regeneration of the Dumfries House estate in Ayrshire is at the heart of the organisation's work, thefoundation's website,externalsays. Claims about Mr Fawcett's conduct were published inthe Sunday Times,externalandMail on Sunday,external. The Sunday Times said Mr Mahfouz, who denies any wrongdoing, donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles. Mr Fawcett is alleged to have co-ordinated support for an honour for Mr Mahfouz, according to newspaper reports. Douglas Connell, chair of The Prince's Foundation, said Mr Fawcett offered on Saturday to step down temporarily from chief executive duties while an investigation was carried out. Mr Connell added: ""The Prince's Foundation has accepted this offer. Michael fully supports the ongoing investigation and has confirmed that he will assist the investigation in every way."" Prince Charles with Michael Fawcett, his valet at the time A spokeswoman for The Prince's Foundation said it ""takes very seriously the allegations that have recently been brought to its attention and the matter is currently under investigation"". Mr Fawcett was once a close aide of Prince Charles and served as his valet until 2003. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said that a Palace source stressed the distance between Prince Charles' office and his foundation, but Mr Fawcett was known for being close to Prince Charles and these allegations were an ""embarrassment"" for him. Mr Fawcett began his royal service in 1981 as a footman to the Queen, before later becoming Prince Charles' assistant valet. In 2003 he was cleared of financial misconduct allegations over the selling of royal gifts. He resigned after the internal report criticised the running of the royal household, but continued to work as a freelance fixer and Prince Charles' events manager. ROE V.

Extra Â£5.5bn to help NHS Covid recovery,"Boris Johnson will unveil his long-term plans for social care and the NHS as early as Tuesday, amid rows over how to pay for multi-billion pound funding. The PM said he had a plan to reform social care when he took power in 2019 but has yet to announce the detail. Reports of an increase in National Insurance to cover the cost -which would break his commitment not to raise taxes- has angered Tory MPs. The NHS in England will getan extra Â£5.4bnover the next six months. The prime minister said the money would ""go straight to the front line"" to help ""bust the Covid backlogs"". Organisations representing the NHS have warnedservices may have to be cut unless NHS England receives an extra Â£10bn in fundingnext year. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? The nine problems facing social care right now Social care shake-up plans expected this week Meetings to discuss the social care plan for England have been taking place between the PM, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid across the weekend, according to government sources. But while a deal is said to be ""close"", Laura Kuenssberg said it ""sounded like haggling was still going on"" over how to solve the funding issue. And she said a delay in reaching an agreement had ""created plenty of space for a backlash before the details have even emerged"". The rumoured increase in National Insurance - which has only been raised twice in the past 20 years - has particularly angered some Conservative MPs, with one cabinet minister telling the BBC: ""It is the wrong thing to do, and the wrong way to go about it"". Former minister and Tory MP Jake Berry also said it would not be a ""fair and equitable way"" to secure the money. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rise would disproportionately affect working people ""on lower wages than many others in the country"", who would end up ""paying tax to support people to keep hold of their houses in other parts of the country where house prices may be much higher"".

NHS waiting list in England hits record 5.45 million Why workers face the bill for care revolution But it is widely accepted that major changes are needed to social care - which helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and medication - due an to ageing population and failures to address issues in the past. Defence Minister James Heappey said too many governments had ""ducked the opportunity"" to fix the system, leading to the ""social contract in the UK to be broken"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""The social contract is that whilst you are of working age, you pay your taxes to pay for those who aren't working in anticipation that when you yourself are retired, those who are of working age at that time will do the same for you. ""That social contract has become dangerously out of balance."" Mr Heappey would not confirm if National Insurance would be part of the government's proposals, but he said any plan would have pros and cons, and it was up to MPs to ""fiercely debate"" them when final detail is announced. Earlier this week,the government did not deny newspaper reportsthat it was considering increasing National Insurance contributions by at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. National Insurance is paid by workers until they reach the state pension age and by employers. For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in National Insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. Governments have only increased the tax twice since the 1990s - the Tory/Lib Dem coalition upped it in April 2011 (although it was announced by the previous Labour government) to improve public finances after the 2008 financial crash, and in 2003, Labour raised it to boost NHS spending. The last time the Conservatives increased National Insurance was in April 1994. But on all three occasions, the figure went up by 1%. Some Tories accept that a tax rise is needed - but say it should not be National Insurance because that could hit younger and lower income workers harder, while pensioners would not have to pay. However, during the last election, the Conservatives madea manifesto commitment,externalnot to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. Labour has voiced its opposition to an increase to National Insurance, with its leader, Sir Keir Starmer, ruling out his party's support. He told the Daily Mirror newspaper,external: ""We do need more investment in the NHS and social care but National Insurance, this way of doing it, simply hits low earners, it hits young people and it hits businesses. ""We don't agree that is the appropriate way to do it. Do we accept that we need more investment? Yes we do. Do we accept that NI is the right way to do it? No we don't. ""But we will look at what [the government puts] forward because after eleven years of neglect we do need a solution."" The SNP also called for the prime minister to ""go back to the drawing board"" over how to cover the cost. The party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, tweeted: ""This deeply regressive move would hammer young people, low paid workers and Scottish families by hundreds of pounds each year."" The social care system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop separate solutions. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council. There is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs. The SNP said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an ""England-only policy"". Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. For decades now there have been arguments over how we pay for the support needed as people live longer with more complex health conditions. Scotland made the decision twenty years ago to give families more help with the costs. Wales and Northern Ireland have tweaked their systems making them slightly more generous, but in England, all plans for change have so far become mired in political arguments over how we pay the bill. In the meantime the crisis in social care has deepened, leaving a system that is underfunded, has patchy quality, struggles to recruit enough staff and relies on the many people who fund their own care to subsidise the care of those who get council help. Anyone with more than Â£23,250 pays for all their care costs, which when it comes to residential care can run into thousands of pounds a month. This is as true for someone who bought their council house under the Tories right to buy scheme, as it is for someone who lives in a mansion. Also about half of local authority care spending is on younger adults with disabilities and their needs are unlikely to be addressed in these plans. The danger is that too much heat and noise over the funding mechanism will obscure meaningful discussion about what the vision should be for a care system of the future - because at its best it could help many more people live the lives they want for longer. In 2019/20, local authorities received 1.9 million requests for support, according to the Kings Fund - up by over 100,000 in five years While 1.4 million were from older people, 560,00 came from working age adults In total, 839,000 people received long-term care - 548,000 older people and 290,000 working-age adults But despite the rise in demand, the total expenditure on adult social care was only Â£99m more than in 2010/11, with council spending in England about 3% lower than in 2010 An ageing population also means growing demand, and Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Will the National Insurance cut leave me better off?

Frozen eggs and sperm to get 55-year storage limit,"The storage limit for eggs, sperm and embryos would be increased from 10 years to 55 years under government plans Storage limits for eggs, sperm and embryos will go up to 55 years under government plans that ministers say will give people greater choice over when to start a family. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the current limit of 10 years was ""severely restrictive."" Modern freezing techniques mean eggs can be stored indefinitely without deterioration, research from the Royal College of Obstetricians has suggested. The plans need parliamentary approval. The Department for Health said there would be extra conditions around third party donors and use of a person's frozen cells after they have died. Currently, when the 10 years is up, prospective parents must decide whether to undergo fertility treatment or have the cells destroyed, unless samples have been stored due to medical procedures, such as chemotherapy for cancer. Under the new system, they would be given the option to keep or dispose of the frozen cells or embryos at 10-year intervals. Women's frozen eggs 'should be stored for longer' Egg-freezing: What's the success rate? Egg freezing in your 40s 'not sensible' Mr Javid said: ""This new legislation will help turn off the ticking clock in the back of people's minds."" He added: ""By making these changes, we are going to take a huge step forwards - not just for giving people greater freedom over their fertility, but for equality too."" British Fertility Society chairman Dr Raj Mathur welcomed the plans. He said extending the time limit ""protects the ability of all our patients to make reproductive choices for themselves as individuals and couples."" Julia Chain, chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said the earlier a woman froze her eggs the better the chance of a successful IVF pregnancy later. She said: ""This will give women a lot more choice and flexibility about when they can start having their families."" What is egg, sperm and embryo freezing? It is a way of preserving fertility by collecting eggs, sperm or embryos and storing them so it may be possible to have a baby at a later date. The process involves collecting around 15 eggs through IVF, cooling them quickly then storing them in tanks of liquid nitrogen. The eggs are then thawed when needed, and those that have survived intact will be injected with sperm. Sperm samples are usually divided between a number of containers called straws before freezing so they can be used in multiple treatments. Embryos are frozen during fertility treatment in case the first round is not successful or to try for a sibling. They can be frozen when they're just a single cell, at the two to eight cell stage or later in their development. Source:HFEA,external Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Live music told path to tackle climate change,"Live music is back but can the music industry change the way it works to help the planet? Artists and bands must swap private jets for trains, festivals and venues need to generate more of their own renewable energy and gig tickets should include free public transport. These are just some of the recommendations being made by scientists at the University of Manchester to help the music industry reduce its carbon emissions to stop climate change. The roadmap for live music was based on tour data supplied by the band Massive Attack. The findings are being shared across the industry and, it's hoped, will inspire millions of fans to live more sustainably, too. Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change A really simple guide to climate change Since 2019, scientists at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research have been poring over every detail of Massive Attack's last tour. They then used lessons learned to create a roadmap for the whole industry. Their recommendations for ""super low carbon practices"" deal with how musicians, promoters, tour managers and agents should work in order to keep the rise in global warming restricted to 1.5C. The suggestions cover how artists move around, the venues they play at, and how fans get to events: Plan tour routes in a way that minimises travel and transport Include travel by public transport in the ticket price Generate renewable energy on site, e.g. solar panels Gig and concert venues should use renewable energy Use energy efficient lighting and sound equipment Use electric vehicles and trains to travel between venues Better bike storage at music venues Avoiding flying and eliminating private jets Perform at venues that are taking action to reduce their building energy use Offer incentives to fans who choose to travel by public transport Prof Carly McLachlan from the Tyndall Centre led the research and says ""to really decarbonise live music, you need to start doing it right from the inception of a tour"". The report says the music industry should only pay to carbon offset its emissions when reducing them was no longer possible. It's also suggested that a central independent body be appointed to monitor the progress the sector is making against ""clearly defined measurable targets"". ""This is so we can scale up the practice that works, learn where things didn't work and really accelerate that change."" Massive Attack said they felt conflicted by the music industry's contribution to climate change so asked scientists for guidance. Robert ""3D"" Del Naja from Massive Attack says the findings aren't surprising because the solutions to climate change are already known. He says the idea of making ""plug and play"" tours more routine - where artists hire things like sound systems from the venue rather than bringing their own - already happens, but not at such a large scale. ""When we turn up at festivals, we use the same gear. We get on the same stage. Most of the stuff we use is pretty similar. ""It sounds crazy that bands are crisscrossing the same highways at night with the same gear with the same big lorries - it's unnecessary."" He says he can picture a world where tours are developed around train schedules - similar to how football matches work - and says fans taking direct trains to festivals could actually enhance the experience. The report also recommends the sector as a whole should act together to support smaller venues. He says if the whole industry takes on these recommendations, it can help avoid a ""code red for humanity"" - a reference to the stark warnings given inthe recent UN report on climate change. Robert says how easily it can adapt though will depend upon what level of financial support is available to help make these changes. Prof McLachlan says this research is also about credibility. ""Particular artists have a really amazing platform to talk about these issues. ""They have to be able to demonstrate that they are doing all these things themselves [whether it's] reducing the amount of aviation or working with partners to decarbonise the venues they play in."" Investing in new ways of working and new technologies sound expensive. But the thinking is reducing emissions could reduce costs, too. Prof McLachlan says ""a lot of these elements are about saving energy and that could be a direct money-saver for the tour. ""We can have affordable low-carbon activities of all sorts in the future, including music."" Whether or not this is reflected in ticket prices, though, is a different story.

"Ikea struggles to supply 1,000 product lines","Furniture giant Ikea is struggling to supply about 1,000 product lines as a shortage of HGV drivers continues to hit businesses. The company said the shortage of products, including mattresses at some stores, was down to Covid and Brexit. Businesses ranging from flu vaccine suppliers to food and drink firms have also been suffering from supply issues. The government has previously said it is ""working closely with industry to address sector challenges"". Ikea said that all 22 of its UK and Ireland stores were having supply problems with 10% of its stock, or around 1,000 product lines. ""Like many retailers, we are experiencing ongoing challenges with our supply chains due to Covid-19 and labour shortages, with transport, raw materials andâ¯sourcing all impacted. In addition, we are seeing higher customer demand as more people are spending more time at home.â¯ â¯""As a result, we are experiencing low availability in some of our ranges, including mattresses."" The retailer apologised and said it hoped the situation would improve ""in the coming weeks and months"". ""What we are seeing is a perfect storm of issues, including the disruption of global trade flows and a shortage of drivers, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic and Brexit,"" Ikea said. There has been disruption in the global container shipping industry due to the pandemic, while Brexit labour shortages span from lorry drivers to meat production workers. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Food firm in 'drastic' action amid driver shortage Wetherspoons runs low on some beer amid driver shortage Labour problems linked to Brexit are also hitting meat production. The National Pig Association warned on Sunday that there was a backlog of 85,000 pigs on farms dues to a significant shortage of abattoir workers, and that this figure was growing at 15,000 per week. ""If processors continue not to take the pigs they will have to go somewhere,"" said National Pig Association chief executive Zoe Davies. ""If the government doesn't act soon to alleviate labour shortage in plants, farmers will be forced to make difficult choices. ""The last thing we want to see is pigs being destroyed on farms and the meat wasted, so we are talking to processors about options."" She added that the government does not appear to have ""the slightest interest in helping us here which I find both incredibly disappointing and galling in equal measure considering this situation is entirely within their gift to resolve"". Businesses across the board have been hit by supply chain problems which hauliers have blamed on Covid and Brexit. Flu jabs in England and Wales have been delayed due to the HGV driver shortage, and food firms including Tesco and Iceland have said there could be shortages of some products in the run-up to Christmas. Wetherspoons ran short of some beer brands, but downplayed the link to Brexit, instead saying the shortages were down to industrial action. Unions, however, say this industrial action never took place. Brewers Heineken and Molson Coors, and fast food chains McDonald's, KFC and Nando's were also hit by supply issues. There is a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, according to the Road Haulage Association. During the pandemic as travel restrictions came in, many European lorry drivers went home to their own countries, and then decided to work elsewhere. There have also been tax changes which mean it's now more expensive for foreign drivers to work in the UK. Logistics firms have been calling for the government to allow temporary work visas for lorries in the short term to try to alleviate the problem. But the government has consistently said that firms have to do more to find UK drivers. It has previously said: ""We're working closely with industry to address sector challenges, which are similarly being faced by other countries around the world. ""This includes plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of driving tests able to be conducted. ""We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce and make employment more attractive through offering training, careers options and wage increases.""

Former Spice Girl Geri Horner - a judge on Popstars: The Rivals -tweeted:,external""Rest in peace, Sarah Harding. You'll be remembered for the light and joy you brought to the world."" Fellow judge Louis Walsh, who helped create the group, said he would remember her with ""great fondness"". He added: ""She was always fun and the life and soul of the party. Anytime she came to Dublin in the early days, we went out to the Pod nightclub and would be the last to leave."" Another member of the ITV talent show's cast, TV presenter Davina McCall,wrote,externalit was ""so, so sad"" to hear the news. ""A star from the get go, hugely fun and outgoing yet also somehow fragile... love to her family and friends."" Former boyfriend Calum Best, a reality TV star, spoke of the ""crazy fun times and adventures"" they had together, saying she would be ""so very missed"". Allow Twitter content?

JLS singer Oritse Williams, whose band emerged four years after Girls Aloud, said it was ""heartbreaking"" to hear that she had died, tweeting: ""The times we met she was always so bubbly, such a big beautiful personality."" ""Dainty blonde I ain't,"" wrote Sarah Harding in Girls Aloud's official book, Dreams That Glitter, in 2009. ""I've got a t-shirt that says 'Well-behaved women don't make history'. Funny how the stylist gave that to me..."" Harding was the band's rock and roll star, smashing up a phone box in the video for No Good Advice and recording some of their most outrageous ad-libs. Just listen to the gleeful menace with which she delivers the line, ""[you] make me wanna break the rules"" over the shredding guitar riffs of Wake Me Up. She was the last contestant on Popstars: The Rivals to be selected for the band, but she was also their biggest cheerleader. When they finally won a Brit Award, seven years into a career that changed the face of British pop, it was Harding who grabbed the trophy, hoisted it into the air and shouted, ""It's about time!"" But although she was portrayed in the press as the band's party girl, she had a quiet side. The Girls Aloud song Live In The Country was inspired by her decision to quit London and live on a farm (although the insistent drum and bass beat suggested she'd never be too far away). And the line, ""Here I am, walking Primrose,"" from the Brit Award-winning The Promise was a tribute to the singer's beloved pet bulldogs. Allow YouTube content?

When Girls Aloud went their separate ways in 2013, Harding pursued a career on the screen, appearing in independent films, soap operas and reality TV shows; while recording new music in fits and starts. The devastating news of her cancer diagnosis last year was followed, this March, by an autobiography in which she revealed that Christmas 2020 was ""probably my last"". ""I'm trying to live and enjoy every second of my life, however long it might be,"" she wrote. ""I am having a glass of wine or two during all this, because it helps me relax."" In the end, she died peacefully at home - but she will always be remembered as the vital life force of one of British pop's defining bands. Girls Aloud are Britain's biggest-selling girl group of the 21st Century, selling 4.3 million singles and four million albums. They scored 21 UK top 10 singles between 2002-2012, including four number ones. The group went on to have several UK hits, including Sound of the Underground, The Promise, Love Machine, Jump and Call The Shots. Harding won a Brit Award with Girls Aloud for best single for The Promise in 2009 In 2011Harding went into rehab for depression and alcohol addictionafter the end of her four-year relationship with DJ Tom Crane, to whom she was engaged. Girls Aloud reunited in 2012 after a short hiatus, to release and tour a greatest hits album. They announced their split in 2013. Harding then took on several acting roles, including appearances in Run for Your Wife, and St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold. She appeared on the Channel 4 reality show The Jump in 2016, but was forced to pull out after suffering a knee injury. In 2017, she won Celebrity Big Brother. The most common sign of breast cancer is a lump or thickening in the breast - but there are other symptoms too. They include: Change in size or feel of the breast Changes in the skin of the breast, such as dimpling or redness Fluid leaking from the nipple, outside of pregnancy or breast feeding Change in position of the nipple These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, so it is important to get any lumps or changes checked by a doctor. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with women over 50 more at risk than the under-40s. But there are many other factors that can increase a person's risk, including a family history of cancer and being overweight. Many treatments are available for breast cancer and survival is generally good if the disease is detected early.

Girls Aloud star's life and career,"An irrepressible and immensely likeable pop star, Sarah Harding, who has died at the age of 39, helped Girls Aloud become Britain's biggest-selling girl group of the 21st Century, but also had a ""wild child"" reputation and a turbulent personal life. Harding's natural warmth, energy and glamour were key parts of the chemistry that helped Girls Aloud soar and blow a breath of fresh air through the charts. Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding has died In pictures: Look back at the life of Sarah Harding Her vocal capabilities and wide-eyed exuberance were put in the national spotlight on 2002 TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals. When judge Louis Walsh rebuked the 20-year-old for failing to remember dance moves in one episode, her excuse was: ""I'm too much of a loon."" When Walsh then told her she was through to the next round anyway, she proved herself right by hugging him round the neck, skipping into the corridor screaming, jumping into two peoples' arms and collapsing on the floor. Wearing her emotions on her sleeve endeared Harding to viewers. L to R: Kimberley Walsh, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Tweedy and Nadine Coyle made up Girls Aloud In the final, five spots in the band were up for grabs. Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts, Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyle had all been told they were in - meaning it was between Harding and Javine Hylton for the last seat. When Harding's name was read out, she staggered, sobbing uncontrollably, to sit alongside her new bandmates. Hylton had been the bookies' favourite, and the result was such a surprise thatITV launched a brief investigation into the voting,external- but no irregularities were found. Three weeks later, Girls Aloud were number one. They were the first band to have a Christmas chart-topper with their debut single and the first girl group to debut at number one. It helped that the track, Sound of the Underground, was one of the best and most innovative pop songs of the decade. ""They landed in a gulf in a drab pop landscape,""wrote the Telegraph's Alice Vincent,externalin 2017. Against that backdrop the tune ""almost tore a hole in the space-time continuum"",declared The Guardian's Michael Cragg,external. It was the first of four UK number ones and 21 Top 10 hits over the course of a decade. Girls Aloud's other slices of pop brilliance, crafted by writers and producers Xenomania, included Love Machine (2004), Something Kinda Ooh (2006), Call the Shots (2007) and The Promise (2008). The last of these earned the band a Brit Award for best single. They won the Brit Award for best single for The Promise in 2009 The success fulfilled a dream Harding had held since her father, a session musician, started taking her into recording studios when she was three years old. ""It was all I wanted to do,"" she told The Sun. ""I always loved being the centre of attention and ever since I can remember I've wanted to be a star."" Harding was born Sarah Hardman on 17 November 1981 in Ascot, Berkshire, and moved with her family to Stockport, Greater Manchester, at the age of 14. But she struggled to settle in at her new school and dropped out before taking her GCSEs. She gigged in pubs, clubs and caravan parks around the north-west of England and north Wales and formed her own short-lived girl group. She also signed with an Italian label to sing on dance tracks - only to get cold feet three days before she was due to fly out. At college she studied hair and beauty, and did jobs ranging from pizza deliveries to directory enquiries. It was while working in a bar that she applied for Popstars: The Rivals. Girls Aloud sold 4.3 million singles and four million albums Despite her grounding in music, Harding had little idea about what to expect from stardom. ""These days there is a lot more talent coming out of shows like that, so people are now partly aware of what is going to happen,""she told the Daily Star in 2015,external. ""With social media, you kind of see what is coming. We didn't have all that back in the day."" A nickname, Hardcore Harding, was coined by her karate teacher ""because she's left loads of men injured"" - but it also suited her party lifestyle. Her twenties were ""all heartbreaks and hangovers"", she once said. ""I was young and naive and played up to my lairy character,""she told The Sun,external. ""It overshadowed the real me."" ""I used to think I was Liam Gallagher, flicking the Vs at the camera, thinking I was rock 'n' roll,""she told The Sun on Sunday's Fabulous magazine,external. The singer said she went through a ""little wild-child stage"" As for the heartbreaks, her boyfriends included socialite Calum Best, TV presenter Steve Jones, producer Mark Foster, actor Danny Dyer and DJ Tom Crane, to whom she was engaged. After her four-year relationship with Crane broke down in 2011,she went into rehab for depression and alcohol addiction. ""I've been to hell and back,""she said at the time,external. ""I'm just glad I survived."" She told another interviewer: ""The drinking was more to give me more confidence, especially when I was going through my little wild-child stage."" But her lifestyle calmed down in her thirties, and she enthused about how she preferred tending her vegetable patch in her Buckinghamshire garden to partying. Girls Aloud reassembled for their 10th anniversary in 2012 only to part ways again the following year, having sold a total of 4.3 million singles and four million albums. Harding (left) had a stint in Coronation Street in 2015 Explaining the band dynamicto Look magazine after the split, Harding said: ""Me and Nadine are more music orientated - more vocals - and the other three are more about dancing. I'd put my foot down about the music side of things. Nicola was more about the clothes. Choreography is Cheryl's forte. ""When there's five of you, it's difficult to have a say in everything. I'm looking forward to having more control."" By that time, the other four had all launched solo careers. Harding started work on hers in 2011, but ditched the songs and started again a few years later with more input into the songwriting. ""This is my angry song but there's some real heartbreak stuff that I've written,"" she said of her debut solo single Threads, which came out in 2015. Threads missed the UK Top 100, however, and her solo career was over. Harding won Celebrity Big Brother in 2017 Harding also got into acting, appearing opposite Dominic Cooper, Rosamund Pike and Riz Ahmed in the 2009 BBC Two drama Freefall. She appeared in St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold the same year and acted alongside Dyer and Denise van Outen in the 2012 flop Run For Your Wife. Coronation Street signed her up for four episodes in 2015, and she took part in such other TV shows as Celebrity Masterchef, the BBC's gymnastics contest Tumble - where she came second - and Channel 4's ski show The Jump. But she dropped out of the latter after sustaining a ligament injury. Later that year, she blamed the injury for her withdrawal from her theatre debut in Ghost: The Musical, which had received poor reviews. ""I've been in constant pain with my knee injury,"" she said. ""It can take a massive toll on your mental as well as physical well-being."" In 2017 she went into the Celebrity Big Brother house and emerged as the winner. Just like at the start of her career,some viewers were aggrieved by the result,external. Harding then retreated from the limelight, only re-emerging in August 2020 to deliver the devastating news that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. In March 2021, an early extract from her memoir, Hear Me Out, revealed doctors had told her she wouldn't see another Christmas. She wrote she was ""trying to live and enjoy every second of my life, however long it might be"". The book also revealed that all five members of Girls Aloud had been reunited behind closed doors in the wake of her diagnosis. The star admitted she was anxious about them all seeing her looking ""bloated"" due to the steroid treatment she was on, and having lost her eyelashes due to chemotherapy. ""It's not that I thought they wouldn't understand or be judgmental, of course; it's just that when we were together as a group, part of our thing was the glamour,"" she wrote. While back together, the ex-bandmates watched the 2006 E4 documentary series Girls Aloud: Off the Record, ""laughing"" and ""cringing"" at their old antics. ""I have to say, I looked on fondly,"" wrote Harding. ""'You only miss this when it's gone,' I told the girls."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

What's life like since the Taliban took over?,"A street vendor in Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city, which was seized by the Taliban earlier this month. What is life like for those left behind when the last foreign troops flew out of Afghanistan? Four people from cities and provinces around the country told the BBC they had lost basic freedoms and were struggling to survive. Some names have been changed to protect contributors' safety. Mazar-i-Sharif is a large city and major economic hubin the north of Afghanistan,close to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Once a government stronghold, it fell to the Taliban on14August. A view of a closed market in Mazar-i-Sharif, the provincial capital of Balkh province, Afghanistan Majib used to work in a restaurant. Now he's struggling to find food. In a video call from Mazar-i-Sharif, he pointed to the dirty floor of an abandoned building where a few blankets were piled - for now it is his new home. Majib arrived in the city just a few weeks ago, one of more than half a million Afghans displaced this year by the conflict between the Taliban and recently-ousted government forces. His father was killed by the Taliban more than 10 years ago, he said. A decade on and he's ""scared to go outside"" because ""they're beating people up every day"". Footage from Mazar-i-Sharif last week showed dozens of Afghans carrying suitcases and clutching plastic bags as they boarded buses to the capital, Kabul, in the hope of trying to leave. But in the past few days, since US forces departed, more people have been arriving from in Mazar-i-Sharif from Kabul, Majib said - trying to make their way to the border with Uzbekistan as a way out. Majib is also desperate to escape, but doesn't know if he will make it. ""The Taliban are here and they don't want people to leave the country,"" he said. LashkarGah, Helmand Province Helmand Province in the south, where British troops were stationed during the conflict, was seized by the Taliban on 13 August. The provincial capital Lashkar Gah saw some of the heaviest fighting in the weeks preceding. Women and children at a mobile clinic in Lashkar Gah in March 2021 Pinned to the noticeboard of Dr Viktor Urosevic's office are small plastic bags containing bullets. ""We call it our wall of shame,"" he said, as he removed one to hold up to the camera in a video interview. Most of them were large calibre rounds which he had removed from young patients, he said. Dr Urosevic works at a trauma hospital in Lashkar Gah. Now that the fighting has ended, the wards are no longer packed like they were just weeks ago. The bombs and bullets have stopped and the streets outside are calm. ""It's very strange, I've been here for a few years, but it's never been so quiet,"" he said. ""I'm seeing it as the silence before the storm, I hope I'm wrong, but let's see."" Many buildings were damaged or destroyed in bombings in Lashkar Gah and families who fled during the conflict have come back to find their homes in ruins, Dr Urosevic said. ""They're sleeping in front of the mosque, they're sleeping in the streets,"" he said. ""They don't have the funding to rebuild their homes so a lot of them have ended up being homeless or forced to stay with their relatives."" He said a lot of families in the area were living in poverty, struggling to get a meal during the day. With banks closed for many days, a lack of access to cash has exacerbated the problem. Many foreign aid workers who would be distributing this kind of aid left the country as the Taliban took charge. Dr Urosevic, from Serbia, is among those who decided to stay behind. ""We have a responsibility, we are the only trauma centre in the province,"" he said. ""People need food, they need money, they need medicines."" Badakhshan One of Afghanistan's poorest provinces, Badakhshan,in the northeast of the country, borders Tajikistan. The Taliban took control of its provincial capital on11August. Displaced people in Badakshan back in May 2018. People in the province have been uprooted for years by the conflict. Abdul is a doctor in Badakhshan. He was a student the last time the Taliban ran the country. ""The situation at that time was very bad and their behaviour is the same as they were in the past,"" he said. ""I don't see any changes."" Abdul sent the BBC several pictures from a hospital in the area which is now guarded by the Taliban. In one, an 18-month-old boy lies emaciated on a bed, as his mother begs for staff to save him. According to Abdul, she could not afford to feed him. ""Day by day, more children are becoming malnourished,"" he said. According to the UN, more than half of the children under five in Afghanistan are expected to be acutely malnourished in the next year. Poverty was already a reality for many in this province, but food and fuel prices have risen since the Taliban took charge and government employees have lost their jobs. Some are still waiting to be paid for the last few months. Abdul also fears for women's rights in the province. While female medical staff have been allowed to work, he said many other women weren't being allowed to continue with their jobs and were left wondering what lies ahead. Girls above Class 6 - above UK secondary school age - were no longer being allowed to go to school, Abdul said. ""People don't have any hope for their future,"" he said. ""There is no opportunity for people in Badakhshan."" Herat,aSilk Road city close to the border with Iran, was seen as one of Afghanistan's most liberal.The day after US troops left, hundreds of Taliban supporters filled the streets. Others stayed home in fear. A Taliban figher on patrol in Herat, which was seized by the group on 11 August. Gul had just come back from the market when he spoke to the BBC. ""All over the bazaar, the Taliban are standing with their guns,"" he said. ""You don't see many rich people or women and girls on the street now because they're all afraid of the Taliban."" Gul's wife Afsoon now can't leave the house without taking a male escort and she has to wear a burqua covering her face. ""The future for my daughter is unclear,"" she said. And Gul's sister, a doctor, was told to stay away from her clinic for a few weeks, he said, even after Taliban leaders told women in the medical profession they could return to work. Days later she was able to return alongside other women, Gul said. But many other women were still at home, he said, unsure if they can resume the careers they had worked for. Gul and his family are still hoping to leave Afghanistan. ""We will go anywhere,"" he said. ""America, Germany, France. Anywhere.""

Despair of Britons stuck behind Taliban lines,"Hundreds of UK nationals are stuck in Afghanistan days after the last evacuation flight left Kabul airport. It is feared that hundreds more who are eligible for relocation to Britain are also trapped in the country, which is now in the hands of the hardline Islamist group. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has taken part in meetings in Qatar and Pakistan this week to discuss how some of the people could be helped to safety, said Kabul airport might reopen ""in the near future"". He also signalled that Britain was looking for co-operation with the Taliban on crossings. Here, British nationals and at-risk Afghans share what has happened since the final evacuation flight  - and what they plan to do now. The BBC has changed some names to protect the identities of those we spoke to. Halima's parents, who both have British passports, went to Afghanistan for a family funeral in July, before the Taliban's rapid surge to power. Their flights back to London were cancelled and days later the country fell to the Taliban. In an email, the UK government told them to go to Kabul airport to be put on an evacuation flight but they turned back after warnings of an attack. Halima is alone now in London while her parents are trapped in Afghanistan Since the final UK evacuation, they have had no communication from the government. ""We are running out of money here. Banks are closed, there is a shortage of food,"" they explain. Their only plan is to try to survive until it's possible to come home. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week, Halima, who is in her early 20s, asked: ""Have you got any idea what my family and I are going through?"" She has so far received only an automated reply. After working in a London hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic, Wahid went to visit family in Afghanistan in early August. After the Taliban seized power, he was advised by the Foreign Office to go to the Baron Hotel, near Kabul airport, where British troops were processing UK nationals for evacuation. Wahid says he loves his job in the hospital and misses going to work At the gates, Taliban guards tried to tear up his British passport. Photos show the bruises from the humiliating beating they gave him in front of his wife. Afghan evacuations could resume soon, says Raab How many Afghan refugees are fleeing? Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan? ""Now I'm moving from house to house. It's not safe to stay still. I have nightmares,"" he explains, adding that his brother was captured by the Taliban last week. ""It's too scary to try to leave through a neighbouring country. We heard a group of Afghans were killed at the border last week,"" said Wahid, who is in his 20s. ""All I can do is wait. All day I look at my phone hoping for an email - but nothing,"" he says. Abdul was an English language trainer for the British Council, working all over Afghanistan. The council told him he was eligible for the Arap (Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy) scheme, which gives Afghans who worked for the British government the right to resettle in the UK. He has not yet heard the outcome of his application. ""We are left behind. They've given us to the Taliban,"" he said as the final evacuation flight left. Abdul worked for the British Council and is waiting to hear whether he can resettle in the UK Fearing for their safety, Abdul and his family have now abandoned their home. With no job, he has sold his wife's jewellery to make ends meet. He says he has no plans and no options. ""It's hard for me to return to normal life,"" he says. ""Even if the borders to neighbouring countries open, I don't know how to safely get out. No-one is answering my question - how long should we wait to hear from the government?"" ""There's no sleep - just worrying,"" says Zahra. She is in Leeds. Her family, some of whom fought the Taliban or prosecuted militants under the Western-backed Afghan government, are in Afghanistan. She registered their details with the UK government but was told this week there were no updates and not to call the government hotline again. ""They have provided no solutions,"" she says. The family are in hiding and waiting. One relative, tired of being scared, is considering the dangerous crossing into neighbouring Iran. ""There needs to be some kind of confirmation from the government. That's what they're waiting for. If they go to another country, will there be help?"" says Zahra, who is in her 20s. ""I'm 100% sure my family would take the risk if there was clarity and hope."" Farwad went to the Baron Hotel three times to join the evacuation by British soldiers. In one attempt he says he waited for 24 hours in the dust and heat. An Afghan-British national, he had gone back to Afghanistan in 2019 and was living with his wife and young baby, neither of whom have British passports. He was so certain they would be able to leave the country after the Taliban took power that he left their home. This video can not be played BBC's Lyse Doucet reports from Kabul: ""It's still a struggle to survive, or a race to try to escape"" He says he sent numerous emails and called embassy staff. ""I told them our passport says the Queen 'will afford the bearer such assistance and protection as necessary' but they didn't care,"" he says. Farwad is now staying with neighbours. ""I don't have any options. My wife and child don't have British passports and I cannot leave them. It's dangerous to go to neighbouring countries. The embassies are closed. We don't know what to do."" ""I've dialled the helpline more than 2,000 times,"" Sayyid, who lives in Edinburgh with his Scottish wife and children, tells the BBC. ""It's a waste of time."" His brother, who worked for a British charity in Afghanistan, has already been threatened by the Taliban, he says. With his mother, he left their home and joined the crowds at Kabul Airport trying to leave. But after missing out on the evacuation, they are left waiting in hope that flights will soon resume. ""I want them to get on one of those flights. They are eligible,"" Sayyid says. ""My mother is asking for my help and I'm helpless. She said 'I don't care about my life, but please take your brother'.""

England start well in record run chaseEngland make a promising start to their pursuit of a record 368 to leave the fourth Test against India primed for a thrilling conclusion at The Kia Oval.,"This video can not be played England openers hold firm to set up intriguing final day Fourth LV= Insurance Test, The Kia Oval (day four of five) India 191(Thakur 57, Woakes 4-55)& 466(Rohit 127, Pujara 61) England 290(Pope 81, Woakes 50) &77-0(Hameed 43*, Burns 31*) England need 291 more runs to win Scorecard England made a promising start to their pursuit of a record 368, to leave the fourth Test against India primed for a thrilling conclusion at The Kia Oval. Faced with what would be England's highest successful chase in Test cricket, Haseeb Hameed and Rory Burns took the home side to 77-0 at the close on day four. When England took three wickets for 16 runs in the morning session, including India captain Virat Kohli for 44, Joe Root's side had the opportunity to minimise their target. However, Shardul Thakur batted patiently for 60 and Rishabh Pant was similarly careful in his 50 as they shared a seventh-wicket partnership of 100. On a placid pitch, the tourists were eventually bowled out for 466 in their second innings. History is against England - only nine times in the history of the game have more runs been chased by any side to win a Test. Yet, all four results will be possible on Monday morning, as a wonderful series that is level at 1-1 continues to deliver.

Realistically, India remain favourites, with England's next-best hope being the draw. However, optimism inside the The Oval was raised by the way Hameed and Burns played on a pitch that only seems to be getting better for batting. England also have the inspiration ofBen Stokes' Headingley heroicsfresh in the memory. For context, their target in 2019 was 359, which they reached in 125.4 overs. Here they need more runs in what is likely to be fewer overs. India, and particularly captain Kohli, will be under pressure to close out the win, especially after again omitting masterful off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. The Oval is sold out for the final day. The match is deliciously poised. It could turn out to be a classic. England's highest successful Test run-chases at home Opponent Score Venue When Australia 362-9 Headingley 2019 Australia 315-4 Headingley 2001 New Zealand 294-4 Old Trafford 2008 New Zealand 284-6 Trent Bridge 2004 New Zealand 282-3 Lord's 2004 From 270-3 overnight, India's most likely hope of batting England out of the game seemed to be Kohli. However, when he edged Moeen to slip soon after both Ravindra Jadeja and Ajinkya Rahane had been pinned lbw by Chris Woakes, the tourists were 213 ahead with only four wickets in hand. Pant's cavalier attitude had brought little prior success in this series, while Thakur hit the fastest ever Test half-century in this country in the first innings, yet they both curbed their natural instincts to calmly stretch India's advantage. Pant did not hit his first boundary until the 54th ball he faced. Only when Moeen wasted a run-out chance with both men in the middle of the pitch when Pant was on 37 did India opt to attack. Thakur hit Ollie Robinson over long-on for six and reached 50 for the second time before he edged Root's off-spin to slip. Pant's 105-ball half-century was his slowest in Tests and he was furious with himself when he drove a return catch back to Moeen. Infuriatingly for England, Umesh Yadav swung his way to 25 and Jasprit Bumrah again frustrated them with 24 to prolong the toil and increase the target. This video can not be played 'What a shambles!' England chances fade after missing run-out If England do pull off an incredible win, or even survive to claim a draw, they will have done so after the best part of two days toiling in the field. They lacked inspiration in the early part of Sunday morning, only to be inspired by the introduction of Woakes who struck twice in as many overs. Time and again, Woakes, Robinson and James Anderson were summoned. The work Anderson and Robinson have done must raise questions over their fitness for the fifth Test, while Anderson has taken only two second-innings wickets in six Tests his summer. Craig Overton was often overlooked. Off-spinner Moeen conceded more than 4.5 runs an over and his failure to run-out Pant - he had time to either throw to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow or even run to the stumps himself, only to miss with an attempted direct hit - goes alongside the six catches England have missed in this match. After so long in the field, the home top order was vulnerable to the new ball, yet Hameed and Burns played with certainty, positivity and sound judgement. Burns pulled with authority in moving to 31 not out, while Hameed flicked off his pads on the way to 43, the latter surviving a tense review for lbw off Mohammed Siraj in the penultimate over of the day. Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""England will talk about chasing it but if you said now, do you want the draw, I think they would take it. I am leaning towards draw, then India, then England. England have given themselves a glimmer."" England all-rounder Chris Woakes, speaking to TMS:""There is enough time in the game to get the runs. After that session [the evening session] we feel more pleased than at the start of our innings. We know it is a good pitch."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Social care shake-up plans expected this week,"This video can not be played Nadhim Zahawi: ""You're being presumptuous"" on National Insurance rise. Plans to overhaul England's social care system are likely to be unveiled this week following government talks this weekend, the BBC has been told. Boris Johnson promised to fix the social care system when he became PM. But the prime minister is facing pressure from his own MPs not to increase National Insurance to pay for it - an idea that is being considered. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi refused to say if taxes would be raised in order to pay for social care. During the last election, the Conservatives made amanifesto commitment,externalnot to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. Asked if the government would break that pledge in order to pay for social care, Mr Zahawi said he was ""not going to engage in a hypothetical discussion"" but added he would defend the plans once they have been published. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Zahawi said his party was committed to reforming social care and that the chancellor would set out the government's proposals. Many Conservative MPs are against tax rises to fund any reforms, and ex-Conservative Chancellor Lord Philip Hammond told Times Radio increasing National Insurance could provoke a ""very significant backlash"". The nine problems facing social care right now Government sources said meetings have been going on throughout the weekend. Plans to reform social care and give extra funding to the NHS should become clear this week, they said. It is widely accepted that major changes are needed to the social care system, which helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and medication. The current system is under pressure after past governments failed to fund it properly or bring in reforms. But bringing in a shake-up would cost billions of pounds. Earlier this week,the government did not deny newspaper reportsthat it was considering increasing National Insurance contributions by at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. National Insurance is paid by workers until they reach the state pension age. For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in National Insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. Employers also pay NI. It is probably the biggest domestic policy challenge Boris Johnson inherited when he became prime minister. A challenge he promised to face up to and solve - sorting out social care in England. In Scotland, there is free personal care, but accommodation costs have to be paid for. Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free in Northern Ireland. The big questions are: Should the state have a bigger role? Should care costs be capped? And how should that be paid for? The talk of putting up National Insurance is already proving controversial: Not only do Labour not like it, plenty of Conservatives don't either, including a former Prime Minister Sir John Major and a former Chancellor, Philip Hammond. For some, the very idea of raising taxes makes them squeamish, for others raising National Insurance simply isn't fair, as the burden falls disproportionately on poorer people in work. Among the Conservatives who have come out publicly against the idea is MP Marcus Fysh, who said he was ""alarmed at the apparent direction of travel"" of the government, and calling it a ""socialist approach to social care"". Hewrote in the Sunday Telegraph:,external""I do not believe it is Conservative to penalise individuals of working age and their employers with higher taxes on their employment when our manifesto promised not to."" Many other Tories accept that a tax rise is needed - but say it should not be National Insurance because that could hit younger and lower income workers harder, while pensioners would not have to pay. On Saturday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major backed this view, telling the FT Weekend Festival: ""I don't think they should use National Insurance contributions, I think that's a regressive way of doing it. ""I would rather do it in a straightforward and honest fashion and put it on taxation."" An ageing population means growing demand However, council spending in England is about 3% lower than in 2010 Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Earlier this week former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there should be a new ""health and care premium"" added to tax, rather than raising National Insurance or income tax, while Lord Hammond said ""the only fair and workable answer is insurance scheme... if necessary government backed."" Labour has also voiced its opposition to an increase to National Insurance, with shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy arguing that the ""burden of the social care crisis"" shouldn't fall on ""supermarket workers and delivery drivers"". Party leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to come under pressure to set out how he would fund the reforms in the coming weeks. The social care system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop solutions unique to their own region.

"Company fined Â£150,000 for making nuisance calls","A Glasgow company has been fined Â£150,000 for making more than half a million nuisance marketing calls. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) found that DialADeal Scotland Ltd (DDSL) had made the unsolicited calls between August 2019 and March 2020. They were about non-existent Green Deal energy saving schemes, including boiler and window replacement, loft insulation and home improvement grants. There were more than 500 complaints - one of the highest numbers received. The calls were made to telephone numbers which had been registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) where people had not given their permission to receive them. This is against the law. Why phone scams are so difficult to tackle Phone scammers demand Â£1,000 to stop calling The complaints suggested that DDSL had used several false trading names and the ICO's investigation found that the company also disguised the telephone numbers they were calling from. This is also illegal. Ken Macdonald, head of ICO regions, said: ""DialADeal were breaking the law on a number of fronts, not only were they making calls to people without their permission, they were also hiding their identity using false names and spoof numbers. ""Calls about Green Deal schemes can be a real problem as people often believe they are legitimate but, thanks to the complaints made by the public, we've been able to take action. ""Companies making similar nuisance calls should take note, we use our powers where we see serious breaches of the law."" As well as issuing the fine, the ICO has also given the company an enforcement notice ordering it to stop making unsolicited marketing calls and has successfully blocked its attempt to be struck off the Companies House register to try and avoid paying any fine.

It was a dark time - now I want to revive granny's legacy,"Barrie Henderson has found a way to revive his granny's legacy Barrie Henderson was devastated when his late grandmother's business - the UK's longest-running vegetarian restaurant - went into liquidation last year. His granny Janet founded Scotland's first vegetarian cafe almost 60 years ago, and it went on to become an institution in Edinburgh. Now Barrie is preparing to bring back the Hendersons name in an attempt to revive her legacy. Barrie, 36, grew up working at the Edinburgh institution and had been a manager before it closed last year. His father, Oliver, and aunt, Catherine Home, were the directors. Longest-running vegetarian restaurant stays shut Barrie told BBC Scotland: ""When Hendersons was liquidated I felt like the rug had been pulled from under me and I didn't know what to do. ""It wasn't about the money, it was about my granny's legacy and family history, and it hurt a lot. ""I didn't know what to do and I kept looking back at my life and thinking and reflecting on how I could have done things differently. ""It was a hard time and very dark. My identity, history and life had been jettisoned."" Barrie has planted vegetables and fruit in a garden at the back of his new restaurant in Edinburgh's Barclay Place Barrie said he was inundated with messages from regular customers and friends after the business closed. The father-of-one said: ""So many people messaged me saying it was so sad and saying I should start again, how there were not many veggie places, and how the lockdown wouldn't be forever. ""It was these forces pushing me that made me realise I could do it. ""I grew up with Hendersons and I want my son to grow up the same way knowing about granny's legacy. I don't want her memory to disappear from Edinburgh."" Janet Henderson was 20 when she was introduced to vegetarianism by an aunt in Vienna in the 1930s. Janet Henderson first became interested in vegetarianism after a stay with family in Vienna in the 1930s When she returned to Scotland, Janet married James, a farmer who was known as Mac, and began selling organic produce to wholefood shops from her four-acre vegetable garden on the family farm in East Lothian. The Hendersons Farm Shop opened in Hanover Street, Edinburgh, in 1962, then the following year Janet opened up a vegetarian restaurant in the basement. ""From what I hear, my granny was a workaholic, she was on the counter every lunchtime and in the kitchen in the mornings,"" says Barrie. ""She was strict, stern and creative and really passionate about people having a good diet. I'm very happy her memory will now live on."" He plans to open a new restaurant in Barclay Place later this month after borrowing money from friends. Although Barrie ran Hendersons before it was liquidated he was not financially invested in the firm, so is able to start a new business using the same family name. Hendersons cook Myra tending pots in the restaurant's kitchen in the 1960s In a bid to make his new venture work he said they would be returning to dishes from his granny's ""salad heavy"" menu, using a lot of raw organic ingredients. This will mean using locally-grown produce rather than the more exotic vegetables that had been getting used latterly in the restaurant. Barrie's father, Oliver Henderson, said Janet would be ""really proud"" that her legacy was being carried on. ""She would have been very upset last year when we had to close,"" he said. ""We all thought it was closed for good, so for Barrie to find a way to bring it back to life, and my mother's legacy to live on, is wonderful.""

GB 'rewrote the history books' in Tokyo,"Krysten Coombs' badminton bronze was Great Britain's 124th and final medal from Tokyo Great Britain's team have ""rewritten the history books"" with their performance in Tokyo, says ParalympicsGB's chief Penny Briscoe. GB won 124 medals, including 41 golds, to finish second in the medal table behind China. While those tallies are a drop on Rio five years ago, Britain won medals in 18 of the 19 sports they entered, a new team record. ""It's been an incredible Games for ParalympicsGB,"" Briscoe said. ""We're absolutely delighted with the performance of the team."" GB finish Paralympics with two more bronzes Who won Great Britain's medals? Chef de mission Briscoe believes the return of Russian athletes - competing under the flag of their Paralympic Committee after they werebanned in 2016- made replicating Rio's medal totals improbable. Britain won 64 golds and 147 medals overall in Rio after claiming 34 and 120 respectively at London 2012. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""The medal total was always going to be difficult in terms of the return of Russian athletes. But for 18 out of 19 sports to deliver medal success was an absolutely phenomenal effort by the team. ""We've rewritten the history books out here in Tokyo."" The Winter Paralympics begin in Beijing in six months' time with the next edition of the summer Games in Paris only three years away. ""It has been a monumental effort,"" said Briscoe of the Tokyo campaign. ""It has been challenging, complex and incredibly demanding. Not only in the 12 days we've been competing but in the 18 months leading up to the Games."" The 12 days of action were brought to an end in a shimmering closing ceremony that celebrated Japan's mix of cutting-edge technology and distinctive culture as well as commemorating the unique challenges of holding the Games during the coronavirus pandemic. Boccia gold medallist David Smithcarried the Great Britain flag,while the parade into the Olympic Stadium included the Afghanistan flag, which was carried by their two competitors, Zakia Khudadadi and Hossain Rasouli. They had been evacuated from Kabul before making it to Japanin what was describedas ""a major global operation"". The pair had arrived late in Tokyo and missed the opening ceremony. After a performance that evoked classic console games and karaoke and a solemn acknowledgement of the healthcare workers behind the scenes, Paris, the next host, took centre stage. Rasouli and Khudadadi were warmly received into the Olympic Stadium A collection of French Tokyo 2020 medal winners, joined by Olympic counterparts, musicians and circus performers, cheered beneath the Eiffel Tower, with the famous landmark given a prosthetic running blade in place of one of its four legs in a computer-generated image. Seiko Hashimoto, president of the Tokyo Organising Committee who competed at seven Olympic Games as a track cyclist and speed skater during her sporting career, paid tribute to the athletes. ""The indomitable spirit of all those who have overcome difficulty has illuminated this stage,"" she said. ""We were overwhelmed by your astonishing performances. The long and arduous paths you have travelled shook us all to the core."" The Games signed off with athletes and performers coming together in a rendition of Louis Armstrong's jazz standard What a Wonderful World. Performers reflected the vibrancy of the host city The staging of the Games amid the pandemic has shown the Paralympic movement is ""stronger than ever before"", according to International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons. The Games, like the Olympics earlier in the summer, took place behind closed doors with Covid-19 case numbers in Japan breaching 25,000 per day for the first time four days before their start. ""I think these Games were just sensational,"" he said. ""The sport was unbelievable, world records were broken in every possible sport. Performances were fantastic. To think that these athletes have prepared for these Games under the circumstances of the pandemic, facing restrictions, is unbelievable. ""It's proof that the Paralympic movement is stronger than ever before."" Tanni Grey-Thompson column: 'Great moments in Tokyo but Para-sport faces challenges' Storey's sweet 17 and Fachies' double delight - memorable moments from Tokyo Paralympics Financial constraints meant that there was no live television coverage of wheelchair fencing, powerlifting and Para-taekwondo at the Tokyo Games. Parsons said he hoped to have live coverage of all sports at Paris 2024. ""In Rio there were 13 events covered live and here in Tokyo we are running 19 sports live,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Three of the 22 sports at the Paralympics were not shown live by television as broadcasters' budgets failed to stretch to total coverage ""Of course we would like to have the 22 sports being played live on TV but at the end of the day it's a matter of resources and broadcasting rights. ""I was frustrated to not be able to have these sports live but also on the flip side we made great progress from going from 13 in Rio to 19 here in Tokyo."" Parsons added that the IPC will take ""a more targeted approach"" in adding new sports to the Paralympic programme after seeing the response to karate, baseball, skateboarding, climbing and surfing at the Tokyo Olympics. The Paris 2024 sports selection mirrors Tokyo, although wheelchair basketball is still waiting for final confirmation that it will be included because of changes to its classification rules that have been demanded by the IPC. Any significant changes to the Paralympics programme would only take effect from Los Angeles 2028. ""We will be more proactive in selecting sports that we think will be appealing or that the host nation might think will be interesting,"" Parsons said. Sarah Storey first competed at the Paralympics at Barcelona in 1992 Sarah Storey delivered three of Britain's golds with victory in the individual pursuit, time trial and road race to claim her 15th, 16th and 17th Paralympic titles of a career that has spanned eight Games and two sports. Storey has now surpassed swimmer Mike Kenny asthe most successful British Paralympian of all time. While the 43-year-old intends to compete again at Paris 2024, in part to give her three-year-old son Charlie the chance to experience the Paralympics in person, other British legends will not be back next time. Five-time champion swimmer Ellie Simmonds and Libby Clegg, who did the T11 sprint double on the track in Rio, have said that Tokyo marks the end of their Paralympic careers. However, a new generation of stars emerged, led by swimmer Reece Dunn, who was Britain's most successful athlete at the Games, winning five medals, including three golds.

Faced with what would be England's highest successful chase in Test cricket, Haseeb Hameed and Rory Burns took the home side to 77-0 at the close on day four. When England took three wickets for 16 runs in the morning session, including India captain Virat Kohli for 44, Joe Root's side had the opportunity to minimise their target. However, Shardul Thakur batted patiently for 60 and Rishabh Pant was similarly careful in his 50 as they shared a seventh-wicket partnership of 100. On a placid pitch, the tourists were eventually bowled out for 466 in their second innings. History is against England - only nine times in the history of the game have more runs been chased by any side to win a Test. Yet, all four results will be possible on Monday morning, as a wonderful series that is level at 1-1 continues to deliver.

Realistically, India remain favourites, with England's next-best hope being the draw. However, optimism inside the The Oval was raised by the way Hameed and Burns played on a pitch that only seems to be getting better for batting. England also have the inspiration ofBen Stokes' Headingley heroicsfresh in the memory. For context, their target in 2019 was 359, which they reached in 125.4 overs. Here they need more runs in what is likely to be fewer overs. India, and particularly captain Kohli, will be under pressure to close out the win, especially after again omitting masterful off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. The Oval is sold out for the final day. The match is deliciously poised. It could turn out to be a classic. England's highest successful Test run-chases at home Opponent Score Venue When Australia 362-9 Headingley 2019 Australia 315-4 Headingley 2001 New Zealand 294-4 Old Trafford 2008 New Zealand 284-6 Trent Bridge 2004 New Zealand 282-3 Lord's 2004 From 270-3 overnight, India's most likely hope of batting England out of the game seemed to be Kohli. However, when he edged Moeen to slip soon after both Ravindra Jadeja and Ajinkya Rahane had been pinned lbw by Chris Woakes, the tourists were 213 ahead with only four wickets in hand. Pant's cavalier attitude had brought little prior success in this series, while Thakur hit the fastest ever Test half-century in this country in the first innings, yet they both curbed their natural instincts to calmly stretch India's advantage. Pant did not hit his first boundary until the 54th ball he faced. Only when Moeen wasted a run-out chance with both men in the middle of the pitch when Pant was on 37 did India opt to attack. Thakur hit Ollie Robinson over long-on for six and reached 50 for the second time before he edged Root's off-spin to slip. Pant's 105-ball half-century was his slowest in Tests and he was furious with himself when he drove a return catch back to Moeen. Infuriatingly for England, Umesh Yadav swung his way to 25 and Jasprit Bumrah again frustrated them with 24 to prolong the toil and increase the target. This video can not be played 'What a shambles!' England chances fade after missing run-out If England do pull off an incredible win, or even survive to claim a draw, they will have done so after the best part of two days toiling in the field. They lacked inspiration in the early part of Sunday morning, only to be inspired by the introduction of Woakes who struck twice in as many overs. Time and again, Woakes, Robinson and James Anderson were summoned. The work Anderson and Robinson have done must raise questions over their fitness for the fifth Test, while Anderson has taken only two second-innings wickets in six Tests his summer. Craig Overton was often overlooked. Off-spinner Moeen conceded more than 4.5 runs an over and his failure to run-out Pant - he had time to either throw to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow or even run to the stumps himself, only to miss with an attempted direct hit - goes alongside the six catches England have missed in this match. After so long in the field, the home top order was vulnerable to the new ball, yet Hameed and Burns played with certainty, positivity and sound judgement. Burns pulled with authority in moving to 31 not out, while Hameed flicked off his pads on the way to 43, the latter surviving a tense review for lbw off Mohammed Siraj in the penultimate over of the day. Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""England will talk about chasing it but if you said now, do you want the draw, I think they would take it. I am leaning towards draw, then India, then England. England have given themselves a glimmer."" England all-rounder Chris Woakes, speaking to TMS:""There is enough time in the game to get the runs. After that session [the evening session] we feel more pleased than at the start of our innings. We know it is a good pitch."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Women scared to speak out about sexism in NHSA recent report found about 91% of female doctors in the UK had experienced sexism at work.,"GP Bethan Roberts said sexism ""feeds into a wider culture of fear"" in addressing issues Women working in the NHS in Wales have been patronised and belittled while at work, a survey by the British Medical Association (BMA) has found. The survey found 88% of doctors thought there was sexism in the NHS and called on the organisation to educate people against discriminatory behaviour. GP Bethan Roberts said the results shone a light on the prevalence of sexism in the workplace. The Welsh government said it took discrimination ""very seriously"". TheBMA's UK-wide survey,externalof about 2,000 female doctors found 91% have experienced sexism at work, with 42% feeling they could not report it. In Wales, 88% of respondents said they felt structural and institutional factors that disadvantage women are the main drivers of sexism in the NHS in Wales. Also, 35% said they experienced at least one example of sexism in the past two years, while 21% said this had happened once a month and 26% said they had witnessed sexism on a daily basis. Dr Roberts, also the equality champion for the BMA's GP Committee, said she was not surprised by these statistics and it was not just confined to doctors. ""People will have had very different experiences and so it's important for the survey results to be publicised - just because something is invisible to some doesn't mean it isn't happening at all,"" she said. Can my employer ask me to wear make-up and heels? 'It's shocking to have to pay to not play in our pants' 'Men guess what I'm wearing while gaming online' She said structural problems were part of the problem, but it fed into ""a wider culture of fear of repercussion for addressing issues"". She said: ""I think sexist attitudes and behaviours are most likely a combination of NHS structures tolerating sexist behaviour by individuals, junior doctors rotating out of hostile work environments - resulting in a reliance on staff moving out of departments rather than fixing the problem - and a reluctance by junior doctors to raise concerns for fear of this impacting negatively on career progression."" She added it was ""so important"" to report sexism, but often women felt like they could not due to an impact on their career. A separateUK-wide report by the Unison union,externalfound three in five nurses have experienced sexual harassment at work. Some said they were expected to put up with abusive behaviour because it âwas seen as ""just part of the job"", while a number described it happening so frequently it haâd become ""normal"". As many as one in nine (11%) said they often encountered such experiences and 21% reported occasional harassment. Of those who had been harassed, only 27% reported it to their employer. â Others said they did not believe the issue âwas taken seriously and 35% said not enough was being done to protect them from sexism in the workplace. One doctor who anonymously responded to the survey said she has been told her career choices are not good for women Doctors in Wales who shared their experiences anonymously said they have received patronising comments, been judged on their appearance, overlooked in their career progression, or been ignored by patients and other doctors in favour of their male colleagues. One doctor said: ""On numerous occasions, I've heard a specialty isn't good for women, especially if you want a family etc. I very frequently get mistaken by patients for nursing staff, often despite introducing myself as a doctor."" Another doctor said: ""I was once told my place was in the home and raising kids and I'd soon get bored of being a doctor. ""Endless mansplaining in handovers with male members of the team endlessly talking over the females and making the same exact point after a female has said it."" Dr Roberts said being called ""dear"", being asked to make tea or do jobs male doctors are not asked to do are just some of sexist microaggressions she has seen. She said a lack of training and awareness of discrimination is one of the main reasons this behaviour still existed, something she said needed to be addressed. She said equality training should be both ""mandatory and meaningful"" for all in the NHS, but ""equality and diversity discussions should ideally begin at an early age so that we all know how to behave with respect towards others, irrespective of the number of protected characteristics we or others might possess"". She added that reporting needs a more ""robust"" system as some that exist are a ""bit opaque"". ""Certainly ,for the junior doctors who might not feel able because of the way that training works, they might not feel able to take it to their supervisor who might be the person who they want to report. It needs to be totally separate,"" she said. ""So, I think that that almost needs to be a separate mechanism that is open to everyone."" Manish Adke said the survey confirms concerns he has had for many years Manish Adke, co-chair of the BAME forum in Wales, said: ""I had my concerns for many years about discrimination on gender and sex. Sadly, this survey has just confirmed my observations. ""We, as the BMA, must engage with employers to eliminate the sexism and gender inequality within NHS by improving education, training, support and raising awareness. ""It is also important to have a defined mechanism through which staff can raise concerns regarding discrimination and appropriate actions are taken against those who continue to discriminate colleagues. ""Female gender-pay inequality is a direct manifestation of discrimination in career progression, lack of opportunities given to female staff and male-dominant culture in NHS. We need to work together to eliminate all forms of discrimination and make NHS safer place to work."" The Welsh government said: ""Any form of prejudice or discrimination is entirely unacceptable, and we take these matters very seriously. We continue to work with the NHS to tackle all forms of discrimination and expect all NHS Wales staff to be treated with dignity and respect. ""Policies are in place to ensure NHS organisations take action to address any concerns raised to them and all staff are encouraged to raise any worries.

"Social care shake-up plans expected this weekGovernment talks are continuing through the weekend, following reports of a National Insurance hike.","This video can not be played Nadhim Zahawi: ""You're being presumptuous"" on National Insurance rise. Plans to overhaul England's social care system are likely to be unveiled this week following government talks this weekend, the BBC has been told. Boris Johnson promised to fix the social care system when he became PM. But the prime minister is facing pressure from his own MPs not to increase National Insurance to pay for it - an idea that is being considered. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi refused to say if taxes would be raised in order to pay for social care. During the last election, the Conservatives made amanifesto commitment,externalnot to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. Asked if the government would break that pledge in order to pay for social care, Mr Zahawi said he was ""not going to engage in a hypothetical discussion"" but added he would defend the plans once they have been published. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Zahawi said his party was committed to reforming social care and that the chancellor would set out the government's proposals. Many Conservative MPs are against tax rises to fund any reforms, and ex-Conservative Chancellor Lord Philip Hammond told Times Radio increasing National Insurance could provoke a ""very significant backlash"". The nine problems facing social care right now Government sources said meetings have been going on throughout the weekend. Plans to reform social care and give extra funding to the NHS should become clear this week, they said. It is widely accepted that major changes are needed to the social care system, which helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and medication. The current system is under pressure after past governments failed to fund it properly or bring in reforms. But bringing in a shake-up would cost billions of pounds. Earlier this week,the government did not deny newspaper reportsthat it was considering increasing National Insurance contributions by at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. National Insurance is paid by workers until they reach the state pension age. For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in National Insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. Employers also pay NI. It is probably the biggest domestic policy challenge Boris Johnson inherited when he became prime minister. A challenge he promised to face up to and solve - sorting out social care in England. In Scotland, there is free personal care, but accommodation costs have to be paid for. Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free in Northern Ireland. The big questions are: Should the state have a bigger role? Should care costs be capped? And how should that be paid for? The talk of putting up National Insurance is already proving controversial: Not only do Labour not like it, plenty of Conservatives don't either, including a former Prime Minister Sir John Major and a former Chancellor, Philip Hammond. For some, the very idea of raising taxes makes them squeamish, for others raising National Insurance simply isn't fair, as the burden falls disproportionately on poorer people in work. Among the Conservatives who have come out publicly against the idea is MP Marcus Fysh, who said he was ""alarmed at the apparent direction of travel"" of the government, and calling it a ""socialist approach to social care"". Hewrote in the Sunday Telegraph:,external""I do not believe it is Conservative to penalise individuals of working age and their employers with higher taxes on their employment when our manifesto promised not to."" Many other Tories accept that a tax rise is needed - but say it should not be National Insurance because that could hit younger and lower income workers harder, while pensioners would not have to pay. On Saturday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major backed this view, telling the FT Weekend Festival: ""I don't think they should use National Insurance contributions, I think that's a regressive way of doing it. ""I would rather do it in a straightforward and honest fashion and put it on taxation."" An ageing population means growing demand However, council spending in England is about 3% lower than in 2010 Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Earlier this week former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there should be a new ""health and care premium"" added to tax, rather than raising National Insurance or income tax, while Lord Hammond said ""the only fair and workable answer is insurance scheme... if necessary government backed."" Labour has also voiced its opposition to an increase to National Insurance, with shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy arguing that the ""burden of the social care crisis"" shouldn't fall on ""supermarket workers and delivery drivers"". Party leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to come under pressure to set out how he would fund the reforms in the coming weeks. The social care system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop solutions unique to their own region.

"GB 'rewrote the history books' in TokyoGreat Britain's Paralympics team has ""rewritten the history books"" with their performance in Tokyo, says chef de mission Penny Briscoe.BBC Sport","Krysten Coombs' badminton bronze was Great Britain's 124th and final medal from Tokyo Great Britain's team have ""rewritten the history books"" with their performance in Tokyo, says ParalympicsGB's chief Penny Briscoe. GB won 124 medals, including 41 golds, to finish second in the medal table behind China. While those tallies are a drop on Rio five years ago, Britain won medals in 18 of the 19 sports they entered, a new team record. ""It's been an incredible Games for ParalympicsGB,"" Briscoe said. ""We're absolutely delighted with the performance of the team."" GB finish Paralympics with two more bronzes Who won Great Britain's medals? Chef de mission Briscoe believes the return of Russian athletes - competing under the flag of their Paralympic Committee after they werebanned in 2016- made replicating Rio's medal totals improbable. Britain won 64 golds and 147 medals overall in Rio after claiming 34 and 120 respectively at London 2012. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""The medal total was always going to be difficult in terms of the return of Russian athletes. But for 18 out of 19 sports to deliver medal success was an absolutely phenomenal effort by the team. ""We've rewritten the history books out here in Tokyo."" The Winter Paralympics begin in Beijing in six months' time with the next edition of the summer Games in Paris only three years away. ""It has been a monumental effort,"" said Briscoe of the Tokyo campaign. ""It has been challenging, complex and incredibly demanding. Not only in the 12 days we've been competing but in the 18 months leading up to the Games."" The 12 days of action were brought to an end in a shimmering closing ceremony that celebrated Japan's mix of cutting-edge technology and distinctive culture as well as commemorating the unique challenges of holding the Games during the coronavirus pandemic. Boccia gold medallist David Smithcarried the Great Britain flag,while the parade into the Olympic Stadium included the Afghanistan flag, which was carried by their two competitors, Zakia Khudadadi and Hossain Rasouli. They had been evacuated from Kabul before making it to Japanin what was describedas ""a major global operation"". The pair had arrived late in Tokyo and missed the opening ceremony. After a performance that evoked classic console games and karaoke and a solemn acknowledgement of the healthcare workers behind the scenes, Paris, the next host, took centre stage. Rasouli and Khudadadi were warmly received into the Olympic Stadium A collection of French Tokyo 2020 medal winners, joined by Olympic counterparts, musicians and circus performers, cheered beneath the Eiffel Tower, with the famous landmark given a prosthetic running blade in place of one of its four legs in a computer-generated image. Seiko Hashimoto, president of the Tokyo Organising Committee who competed at seven Olympic Games as a track cyclist and speed skater during her sporting career, paid tribute to the athletes. ""The indomitable spirit of all those who have overcome difficulty has illuminated this stage,"" she said. ""We were overwhelmed by your astonishing performances. The long and arduous paths you have travelled shook us all to the core."" The Games signed off with athletes and performers coming together in a rendition of Louis Armstrong's jazz standard What a Wonderful World. Performers reflected the vibrancy of the host city The staging of the Games amid the pandemic has shown the Paralympic movement is ""stronger than ever before"", according to International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons. The Games, like the Olympics earlier in the summer, took place behind closed doors with Covid-19 case numbers in Japan breaching 25,000 per day for the first time four days before their start. ""I think these Games were just sensational,"" he said. ""The sport was unbelievable, world records were broken in every possible sport. Performances were fantastic. To think that these athletes have prepared for these Games under the circumstances of the pandemic, facing restrictions, is unbelievable. ""It's proof that the Paralympic movement is stronger than ever before."" Tanni Grey-Thompson column: 'Great moments in Tokyo but Para-sport faces challenges' Storey's sweet 17 and Fachies' double delight - memorable moments from Tokyo Paralympics Financial constraints meant that there was no live television coverage of wheelchair fencing, powerlifting and Para-taekwondo at the Tokyo Games. Parsons said he hoped to have live coverage of all sports at Paris 2024. ""In Rio there were 13 events covered live and here in Tokyo we are running 19 sports live,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. Three of the 22 sports at the Paralympics were not shown live by television as broadcasters' budgets failed to stretch to total coverage ""Of course we would like to have the 22 sports being played live on TV but at the end of the day it's a matter of resources and broadcasting rights. ""I was frustrated to not be able to have these sports live but also on the flip side we made great progress from going from 13 in Rio to 19 here in Tokyo."" Parsons added that the IPC will take ""a more targeted approach"" in adding new sports to the Paralympic programme after seeing the response to karate, baseball, skateboarding, climbing and surfing at the Tokyo Olympics. The Paris 2024 sports selection mirrors Tokyo, although wheelchair basketball is still waiting for final confirmation that it will be included because of changes to its classification rules that have been demanded by the IPC. Any significant changes to the Paralympics programme would only take effect from Los Angeles 2028. ""We will be more proactive in selecting sports that we think will be appealing or that the host nation might think will be interesting,"" Parsons said. Sarah Storey first competed at the Paralympics at Barcelona in 1992 Sarah Storey delivered three of Britain's golds with victory in the individual pursuit, time trial and road race to claim her 15th, 16th and 17th Paralympic titles of a career that has spanned eight Games and two sports. Storey has now surpassed swimmer Mike Kenny asthe most successful British Paralympian of all time. While the 43-year-old intends to compete again at Paris 2024, in part to give her three-year-old son Charlie the chance to experience the Paralympics in person, other British legends will not be back next time. Five-time champion swimmer Ellie Simmonds and Libby Clegg, who did the T11 sprint double on the track in Rio, have said that Tokyo marks the end of their Paralympic careers.

Do celebrity posts give locations a tourism boost?,"Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker has posted on social media during his stay in Wales Wales has played host to some of Hollywood's finest this summer, with stars filming on location and posting pictures of the scenery in their down time. Oscar winnerForest Whitaker, Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda and British star Tom Hardyhave all given Wales their social media seal of approval, but what does that do for the locations in the backdrop? Well, according to tourism expert Dr Marcus Hansen, quite a lot. The programme leader for hospitality, tourism and events at Wrexham Glyndwr University said stars filming and promoting in Wales can put ""hidden gems on the map"". ""Film-induced tourism is really an extension of popular media and popular culture and Wales featuring in a film or TV series can be invaluable marketing,"" he said. ""If films/TV series become very popular, people often want to re-connect with the show and therefore decide to visit the locations. Great examples are New Zealand after Lord of the Rings or Dubrovnik, Croatia, following Game of Thrones."" In 2019, it was estimated thatabout 350,000 visitors- and Â£50m - were drawn to Northern Ireland each year thanks to Game of Thrones being produced there. Tourism expert Marcus Hansen said stars posting Wales on their social media is ""invaluable"" for the tourism industry Dr Hansen said: ""People want to re-experience those emotions from their favourite film or TV show and so you have people travel to where it was filmed to do that. ""So, particularly from an international perspective, it can really put Wales on the map, and it would be very expensive to try and get that kind of exposure in other ways.""

Hardy surprised Barry locals when he showed up at the town's famous pleasure beach and was even spotted on a few rides. Dr Hansen said it would have a ""great impact"" for a destination like Wales with heritage attractions and eye-catching geography, but which has perhaps not been seen as big a draw as other locations in the UK up to now. ""Whilst an advert can be very effective, it'll struggle to compete with recommendations from friends, family and celebrities whom we may follow online,"" he added. ""It's seen as more trustworthy, unless of course the celebrity is sponsored by the destination. But I think Wales is still a bit of a hidden gem, certainly compared to places in England and Scotland and so to get this kind of exposure is really invaluable.""

The plans include supporting communities to hold outdoor markets by giving powers to local councils to grant them for an unlimited number of days. A temporary lifting of restrictions in June 2020 allowed councils to permit street markets for an unlimited number of days. They had previously only been allowed to be held for 14 days a year. The second proposal in the consultation concerns marquees that have sprung up in the grounds of pubs, cafes and restaurants, as well as other new ""moveable structures"" in listed buildings, such as shelters for ticket sales.

No trains running between Glasgow and Edinburgh,"No trains will be running between Glasgow and Edinburgh on Sunday, due to engineering works and strike action. ScotRail said there would also be no replacement buses running between the two cities. Strikes among conductors have been taking place every Sunday since the end of March in a dispute over overtime pay. On Thursday, ScotRail engineers also voted for industrial action after pay talks with management collapsed. About 250 workers, who maintain and repair ScotRail trains, backed strike action and other measures. ScotRail engineers vote for industrial action ScotRail conductors to stage series of strikes The Unite union said this industrial action was likely to take place from the middle of September. It said operator Abellio ScotRail had rejected a number of demands, including a ""substantial"" pay increase, greater flexibility of holidays, and no compulsory redundancies. The ballot returned a vote of 78% in favour of strike action from a 68.4% turnout. ScotRail has said passenger numbers and its income have plummeted due to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

""This week a parallel issue over the imposed pay freeze stepped up a notch with sister unions joining the fight for justice.

NHS gender clinic whistleblower wins tribunal,"A woman who raised concerns about the safety of children at an NHS gender clinic has been awarded Â£20,000 in an employment tribunal case. Sonia Appleby is children's safeguarding lead for Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which runs the Gender Identity Development Service. The tribunal ruled that the way the trust treated her had damaged her professional reputation. The trust said it was disappointed by the tribunal's decision. It added that it was considering the ruling carefully, saying: ""It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."" Gids is England's only NHS gender service for children. There are clinics in London and Leeds. As the child safeguarding lead at the trust, Ms Appleby's job meant protecting children at risk from maltreatment, and stopping impairment of children's health or development. The tribunal heard that a number of staff brought concerns to Ms Appleby. The concerns included the high numbers of children being referred to Gids, and ""a worry that some young children are being actively encouraged to be transgender without effective scrutiny of their circumstances"". Ms Appleby then reported these concerns to her line manager. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust specialises in mental health, and the gender clinic is a service within it It heard evidence that after this, instead of addressing the concerns, the trust management attempted to prevent her from carrying out her safeguarding role in what Ms Appleby described as a ""full-blown organisational assault"". The trust denied treating Ms Appleby unfairly, claiming that aspects of her allegations affected the way she was treated and that she had been ""accusatory in approach"". The tribunal concluded that Ms Appleby was subjected to ""quasi disciplinary treatment"" and there was ""obvious unfairness"" in the way she had been dealt with by the trust. In a statement, Ms Appleby said that the decision to go to court had been an overwhelming one, but she was extremely pleased with the outcome.

Former Irish President Mary McAleese paid tribute to Mrs Hume saying she was ""the perfect partner"" to John Hume. Mrs Hume worked alongside her husband from the beginning of the civil rights movement in Londonderry in the 1960s. Her death comes just over a yearafter the death of her husband. ""She was a nurturer, she was a coper,"" said Dr McAleese, who recently spent a day with Mrs Hume. Listen: Pat Hume on her life with John Pat Hume, widow of John Hume, has died Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume dies Hume Foundation 'will inspire future generations' In a statement on Thursday, the Hume family said they were ""heartbroken"", adding that she ""died as she lived - surrounded by family, peacefully and generous to the end"". The family paid tribute to the medical staff who cared for their mother in her final days. Speaking to Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster, Dr McAleese said John relied on Pat for her ""wisdom and advice"". ""Pat was an extravagantly wise woman, she had a huge wisdom,"" she added. ""I don't know anybody who I have met in my life who was more rounded and more grounded than Pat. This video can not be played Political leaders pay tribute to Pat Hume ""She was able to synthesise common sense, compassion, political nous in a way that was really, really special and absolutely essential to John."" Dr McAleese said Mrs Hume ""never looked for the limelight... but boy is she deserving of a mountain of praise."" Foyle MP and current SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Mrs Hume has left ""a tremendous legacy for everyone in Derry and across Ireland"". ""John always said: 'I'm the parcel and Pat delivers me.' ""That was true,"" he added. ""I genuinely don't believe any of the of the things John achieved would have been possible without Pat. ""She just had such strength and also belief in what they were doing, she was as driven to bring about a peaceful, and just Ireland as he was."" ""The people of Derry and the people of Ireland owe them both a great debt."" Pat Hume was, according to her husband John, his rock and key adviser throughout his long political career. As a journalist in the north west, you were always very keen to get Pat Hume's insight into current political developments. Her brain was so sharp and she was able to cut through a lot of the spin and nonsense - delivering lines you wouldn't hear from politicians. I always found her very frustrating, but very frustrating in a nice way. The more I tried to question her, and get advice and a steer from her, the more she would ask me about my family, my career and how things were going for me. You always came away from meeting her having unburdened yourself, without having gleaned the information you were hoping to get. Like her husband John, she was always interested in people and that cut to the core of what they were about as a couple. They were very much rooted in the Derry community and were more interested in the people around them, than mixing with the great and the good. Pat Hume's name never appeared on an election ballot paper, but her influence on the political path in Northern Ireland stretched far beyond many politicians. John and Pat Hume with David Trimble and Hillary Clinton in Belfast in 2012 Paying tribute to Mrs Hume on Friday, former US President Bill Clinton said that she ""played an enormous role"" in helping to achieve peace in Northern Ireland. ""All of us who were blessed by the way she lived her life and advanced her cause with such grace and good humour will be forever grateful,"" he said. Hillary Clinton, former US secretary of state and presidential candidate, described her as ""a gracious, determined force behind the achievement of peace in Ireland"". Mrs Clinton added that the Humes ""made the world a better place and set an example for us all"". Former Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin said Pat Hume was ""one of the bedrocks of the peace process who kept her nerve at the worst of times"". ""She didn't flinch, John Hume didn't flinch and they prevailed in the end,"" the former Sinn FÃ©in Foyle MLA said. When talks with the Sinn FÃ©in leadership were held at the Humes' home in Derry, Pat ""set the atmosphere for constructive and calm conversation"". He added: ""Unfailingly, no matter the circumstances, Pat Hume was always steady, steadfast, she clearly was across all the discussions. ""She was always focused on finding ways through the disagreements and I think John Hume was benefitting from her advice on an ongoing basis. I think republicans benefitted as well, I know I certainly did."" John and Pat Hume pictured beside one of Mr Hume's election poster in 1999 Ulster Unionist MLA Mike Nesbitt, a trustee of the John and Pat Hume Foundation, said the Hume's shared a view of Northern Ireland politics that was ahead of its time. ""Everybody else was talking about a divided society and the negativity of that, John and Pat were talking in a very positive way about the benefits of the fact we have a very diverse society,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. He said she was ""more than just John's rock"" and along with Daphne Trimble, wife of former Ulster Unionist party leader Lord Trimble, had playeda key role in supporting victims,externaland survivors of the Troubles. Lady Trimble said she shared a ""warm friendship"" with Mrs Hume. ""She was one of the best, simply one of the best people I have ever met,"" she said. Her friend will be sorely missed, she added. Mrs Hume's work continued during the Troubles, through to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. She ran her husband's Foyle constituency office dealing with community issues, housing and poverty in Derry. Mrs Hume, a former teacher, wasawarded the Irish Red Cross Lifetime Achievement award in 2018. A foundation honouring John and Pat Hume's peace and reconciliation work waslaunched in November last year. A book of condolence has opened in the main hall of Derry's Guildhall. The city's Mayor Graham Warke said it would allow people to ""offer the people the chance to pay their respects and say thank you to a remarkable and courageous woman"". Mrs Hume's funeral Mass will be held at St Eugene's Cathedral in Derry at 11:00 BST on Monday. Members of the public are invited to watch the service live via webcam.

Remembering a school run like no other,"Police officers in riot gear escorted schoolgirls and their families past the protesters in 2001 Twenty years ago, a violent sectarian dispute took place outside Holy Cross Primary School in north Belfast. The school was thrust into the international spotlight, when hundreds of loyalist protesters tried to block the route taken by the school's pupils and their parents, who were from a Catholic background, on their walk to class. BBC News NI's Gareth Gordon, who was among the reporters who covered the story at the time, shares his memories. Have tape recorder, will travel. Once, my journey was a road trip to the places left behind when Northern Ireland got peace. There I met mostly good people trapped by location and a history they didn't write. But some not so good as well. Drumcree, Ormeau Road, Cluan Place, Short Strand, Whitewell, Ardoyne and Holy Cross. Of all of them, Holy Cross is the name I most remember, with very good reason. Catholic Ardoyne is beside Protestant Glenbryn. Just another interface but with one big difference. Tucked away at the Glenbryn end of the Ardoyne Road is the Catholic Holy Cross Girls' Primary School. And for a time in 2001, before an even more grave event in New York replaced it in the world's collective consciousness, it made headlines around the globe. Here's why. A large police convoy waited to protect the Holy Cross school run in 2001 No community living on either side of Belfast's many peace walls had a monopoly on grievance, and that summer there was a lot of it about. Attacks from one side on the other went both ways and Ardoyne saw more than its fair share. Twenty years on, the blame game has been well played out elsewhere. What follows here are my memories of a situation I, or no-one else who witnessed it, will ever forget. At its heart are the innocents who attended Holy Cross Girls' School. Children held hands tightly with family members as they passed police and Army lines Locals claimed some Protestants were attacked while putting up flags in late June just before the end of summer term. There was a claim one of them was knocked off a ladder. As usual this is disputed. But what's not disputed is that the school was then singled out for attention by loyalist protesters - a situation that remained unresolved all summer until the new term began in September. Everyone remembers the girls, some crying, being taken to school by parents with police shielding them from angry people shouting insults from the ""other side"". Whatever the rights and wrongs of the cause which began this form of protest, it was lost in the terrified faces of the girls forced to suffer a school run like no other. The daily school run became a traumatic experience for children The Wednesday morning was the worst. A pipe bomb was thrown, probably aimed at police, but the explosion was loud enough to send children into hysterics. Later I asked two Protestant women why it had happened. This is how it went. Woman one:""There must be a reason why we're doing this. There must be. We've had enough fear and we can't take it no more. We don't care."" Woman two:""We don't care; we're like the Jews now, I think."" Woman one:""I mean I wouldn't let my son or my daughter come home from a disco or anything from that Crumlin Road to get in here and it's the only way they can come at night."" Me:""This morning, whatever the wrongs and rights here, a bomb went off close to the children going to school. How did that make you feel?"" Woman one:""I'm past feeling. You can't understand that. I am past feeling. I'm not going to run my ones down for throwing that bomb."" Me:""But you're not a terrorist."" Woman one:""I'm not. No, I'm not a terrorist. No, I'm a mother. I'm a mother of five children."" Me:""Who's to blame for this?"" Woman one:""Themmuns down there."" Me:""How would you have felt this morning if a child had been killed?"" Woman one:""I'd have felt terrible. I'm a mother of five. Yes, it would be like me losing one of my own. I could feel for that mother."" Me:""So you're not past caring."" RUC officers shielding an injured colleague during the 2001 Holy Cross dispute The next morning the walk to school was played out on live television and radio to a world which could not quite believe what was happening. My job was to relay this live on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme which remained on air way past its scheduled end time of 09:00 BST. I did so against the ear-splitting sound of protesters blowing whistles. But, thankfully, there were no more pipe bombs and the children made it through. Police in riot gear protected families from attack on the school run I had no idea if I was speaking to thousands or to myself until we reached the school and the presenter Seamus McKee was able to ask me a question. One woman later told me she missed an important appointment because she couldn't leave her car listening to me until it was clear the children had made it through unscathed. After that, the protest seemed to peter out. No-one had the stomach for any more of this madness. The following week I stood at the school gate as two clerics who had been centrally involved in trying to resolve things - Father Aidan Troy and the Reverend Norman Hamilton - emerged after a joint school visit. Catholic priest Fr Aidan Troy helped shield schoolgirls on their walk to school I returned to the BBC happy the protest was now over and looked forward to an easy day. That day was 11 September 2001 and my report of the school visit never made air. Days later I arrived in New York to cover the aftermath of the attacks on the Twin Towers. We went first to Battery Park, a residential area near the World Trade Center, where people unable to return home watched lorry after lorry carry away the rubble of their lives. ""Are you really from BBC Northern Ireland?"" asked a woman who told me she and her daughter had spent the evening before the attack crying at the scenes of those young girls being escorted to school in Belfast. Even in the midst of a horrific terrorist attack on the other side of the Atlantic, there was no escaping Holy Cross.

Raducanu hands out US Open thrashingThe British teenager stuns Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo to reach the US Open last 16.BBC Sport,"Emma Raducanu has reached the last 16 in back-to-back Grand Slams US Open 2021 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDate:30 August-12 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra/BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app British teenager Emma Raducanu thrashed Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo in a one-sided US Open encounter and will face American Shelby Rogers in the last 16. Raducanu, 18, won 6-0 6-1 against world number 41 Sorribes Tormo as her overseas Grand Slam debut continued with an extraordinary win in New York. She will play Rogers on Monday after the world number 43stunned Australian top seed Ashleigh Barty. ""My game is just getting better with each match,"" said Raducanu. After bursting on to the Grand Slam scene with a stunning run to the Wimbledon last 16 as a wildcard, the world number 150 has now matched that breakout display at Flushing Meadows. Sorribes Tormo is the highest-ranked player Raducanu has beaten in her fledgling professional career. ""I was playing very well and I know Sara is a tough opponent so I had to be on my game and worked so hard,"" said Raducanu, who won in one hour nine minutes. ""I'm happy I maintained and stayed consistent."" Djokovic fights back to beat Nishikori and reach fourth round Andreescu and Sakkari through to fourth round Stephens reveals '2,000-plus' messages of abuse after loss Salisbury & Skupski both reach doubles last eight The manner of the teenager's victory was scarcely believable, overwhelming an industrious opponent who has reached a career-high ranking after winning 29 tour matches this year. Raducanu's power and precision was too much for Sorribes Tormo to handle. The Briton walloped 23 winners and served solidly throughout, too. Fittingly she sealed victory with another thunderous forehand winner before taking the acclaim of a New York crowd which appears to realise they are watching a star in the making. ""I had to hit through her and hit the corners,"" said Raducanu, whose number of winners outweighed 16 unforced errors. ""If you trade against her you come second best and I took the game to her and I hit more winners than errors."" Raducanu has been a popular attraction for US Open fans on the outside courts Three months ago, few outside British tennis knew Raducanu. Then she was ranked 361 in the world. After her stunning run at Wimbledon she became a household name in the UK and is now attracting plenty of attention from the New York crowd, many of whom who wanted selfies and autographs after she beat Sorribes Tormo. Victory also means the Kent teenager is on the verge of climbing into the world's top 100. Raducanu qualified for her first major last week and, unfazed by the magnitude of playing in her first overseas Grand Slam, has continued to create a buzz at Flushing Meadows. In three qualifying matches and three main-draw matches, she has not dropped a set. ""It was an unbelievably impressive performance from such a young player. She has absolutely nothing to lose,"" former British number one Laura Robson said on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra. ""We kept bigging this match up as a tough opponent - and it is a tough opponent. Sorribes Tormo has won so many matches against top players and has the game to really get you in trouble. ""But she was never in it. She didn't have the chance to play her game because Emma hit her off the court."" Raducanu quickly stamped her authority in the opening stages, breaking 24-year-old Sorribes Tormo's serve at the third attempt in a lengthy second game. From then on it was one-way traffic as the Briton won 29 of the 42 points played in the first set. Former British number one Tim Henman called Raducanu's first-set performance ""a ball-striking clinic"". She continued to press in the second set, breaking serve at the first opportunity for a 2-0 lead. With her head in her hands, Sorribes Tormo looks shell-shocked as she trailed 3-0 at the changeover. Raducanu refused to ease off as she chased a second set to love, maintaining her intensity as the Spaniard battled to get on the scoreboard. There was a huge cheer as Sorribes Tormo did hold serve for 5-1, after fighting off a match point, but could not further delay the inevitable as Raducanu maintained her composure to serve out a one-sided victory. ""The level was silly,"" added Robson, who also reached the US Open fourth round as an 18-year-old in 2012. ""A lot of young players can hit the ball hard, but to be this consistent and be able to back yourself is unbelievable."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The valley trying to hold off the Taliban,"Resistance fighters have gathered in Panjshir province, just north of Kabul The Taliban have swept through Afghanistan with remarkable speed. But as they sit in Kabul planning their new government, there remains a large thorn in their side: a small valley of anti-Taliban resistance just north-east of the capital, refusing to give up despite being entirely surrounded. Senior Taliban leader Amir Khan Motaqi has called on the residents of the Panjshir Valley to lay down their weapons, but there is little sign of them complying. Dozens of Taliban fighters are said to have been killed in skirmishes along its borders since 15 August, when Kabul fell, and fighting is continuing. So what exactly is happening in the Panjshir Valley - and should the Taliban be worried? The valley in eastern Afghanistan has become the home of the National Resistance Front (NRF),  a multi-ethnic group made up of militias and former Afghan security force members, reportedly numbering in the thousands. Photos released this week show what appears to be an organised, well-armed and well-trained group. Resistance fighters training in late August The NRF has been joined by former vice-president Amrullah Saleh, but its leader is Ahmad Massoud, whose father was known as the ""Lion of Panjshir"", and for good reason. Ahmad Shah Massoud not only held off the Soviet invasion in the 1980s, but went on to keep the Taliban out in the 1990s, only to be killed by assassins two days before 9/11. His son - a 32-year-old King's College London and Sandhurst Military Academy graduate - is now determined to do the same and keep the Taliban out. And he is not just looking for support at home - earlier this year he met France's President Emmanuel Macron, seemingly in a bid for international allies as the US withdrawal drew nearer. Ahmad Massoud, pictured in 2019, is the leader of the resistance In an interview with CNN, Massoud warned the militants had not changed - adding that he and his fighters believed ""that democracy, the rights, and freedom of all citizens regardless of race and gender should be preserved"". The militant group has been pushing the idea that the Taliban's ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is home for all Afghans"". The Panjshir Valley's resistance - right on the doorstep of the capital - is a blow to this particular image of unity. On social media, hashtags voicing support for the resistance have begun to pop up. The Taliban and the NRF have been negotiating but, although both sides say they are keen to avoid war, there has been no settlement reached, and it seems talks have given way to open fighting. The Taliban say they have sent hundreds of fighters, but Panjshir is ready. According to news agency AFP, Taliban fighters who make it to the edges of the valley will be greeted by machine gun nests, mortars and surveillance posts fortified with sandbags. Both sides say they have inflicted casualties, but exact numbers are difficult to gauge. Claims by the Taliban that they have taken control of certain areas have also been dismissed by NRF. The Taliban are also reportedly trying to cut supply lines into the valley, potentially hoping to force the resistance to give up. Panjshir is one of Afghanistan's smallest provinces and is home to somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 people, hidden behind mountain peaks that rise 9,800ft (3,000m) above the Panjshir River. In peaceful years, people flocked to the valley, drawn by the stunning views and the safety it offered. It is home to a range of people, with the largest group being ethnic Tajiks. The valley's residents have developed a reputation for bravery thanks to fighting off outsiders.
