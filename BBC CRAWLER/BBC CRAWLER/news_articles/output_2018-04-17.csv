Starbucks shuts US cafes for race training,"This video can not be played Watch police arrest two black men at Starbucks - and the protests that followed Coffee chain Starbucks is to close more than 8,000 company-owned branches in the US for an afternoon next month to carry out ""racial bias"" training. The aim is to prevent discrimination in Starbucks stores. The move comes after the firm had to apologise over last week's arrest of two black men who were waiting to meet someone in a Starbucks in Philadelphia. Following the incident, protesters converged on the store and there were calls for a boycott of Starbucks. Starbucks race row leaves customers with a bitter aftertaste Starbucks' chief executive Kevin Johnson said he had been ""learning what we did wrong and the steps we need to take to fix it"". Mr Johnson said he had spent the last few days in Philadelphia. He has also met the two men who were arrested. In a joint statement,the men's lawyer and Starbucks said their discussions had been ""constructive"",external. Mr Johnson had apologised on behalf of the company and the conversation was continuing about how this ""painful incident can become a vehicle for positive social change"", the statement added. All Starbucks company-owned branches and corporate offices will be closed on the afternoon of Tuesday 29 May. Nearly 175,000 staff will receive the training, as will all future recruits. The closure could cost an estimated $20m in lost sales. Days after the coffee company was forced to apologise to the Philadelphia men, footage emerged of an apparent race-related incident in a Starbucks store in California. Brandon Ward, a black Starbucks customer in Torrance in southern California, posted a video on social media purporting to show an incident in January, in which he was barred from using a toilet - despite being a paying customer - while a white man who hadn't bought anything was allowed to use the facilities. This video can not be played Brandon Ward's video of his encounter at a Starbucks has gone viral Mr Ward's video provoked a strong reaction on social media, with some criticising the coffee giant for its actions.

As part of its damage-limitation effort, the company has asked civil rights leaders and officials including former US Attorney General Eric Holder for help in developing a ""curriculum"" for staff, which it will make available to other companies. The training will ""address implicit bias, promote conscious inclusion, prevent discrimination and ensure everyone inside a Starbucks store feels safe and welcome"",the company statement said,external. ""Closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities,"" said Mr Johnson. In last Thursday's incident, two black men were waiting in a Philadelphia Starbucks to meet someone and had not bought anything when the store manager called police. Amateur video showed police placing the pair, who were accused by shop staff of trespassing, in handcuffs. ""All the other white people are wondering why it's never happened to us when we do the same thing,"" tweeted customer Melissa DePino, who posted a video of the incident. Mr Johnson said the video was ""hard to watch"" and that the actions taken were ""wrong"" and ""reprehensible"". In an interview on Monday, Mr Johnson said the Philadelphia branch manager who called police about the two men had now left the company. In 2015 a Starbucks public relations campaign to encourage customers to discuss issues of race backfired, when the company's big roll-out was widely mocked. Launching the ""Race Together"" campaign, Starbucks had said it wanted to engage customers in a conversation about race amid protests about policing of African-American communities. It involved baristas scribbling the words ""Race Together"" on cups and attempting to ""engage customers in conversation through Race Together stickers available in select stores"", Starbucks said. But instead the hashtag #racetogether was hijacked on social media and the campaign became the subject of widespread criticism.

US in direct talks with N Korea - Trump,"Mr Pompeo's mission reportedly was to prepare for the Trump-Kim summit CIA director Mike Pompeo travelled to Pyongyang for a secret meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump has confirmed. A ""good relationship"" was formed at the meeting last week, Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday. News of the visit first emerged on Tuesday. US officials were quoted as saying the aim was to prepare a summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim. Mr Trump had earlier alluded to high-level direct talks with Pyongyang. But the unexpected and clandestine meeting marks the highest level US contact with North Korea since 2000. ""We have had direct talks at... extremely high levels,"" Mr Trump said from Florida, where he is hosting Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The president added that he gave his ""blessing"" for talks between the South and North to discuss a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War. North Korea crisis in 300 words The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea has also signalled that it may pursue a formal resolution of the conflict. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim are due to meet next week. The two sides have agreed to broadcast parts of the summit live, the South's state news agency Yonhap reported. The news that Mr Pompeo had travelled to North Korea fora clandestine meeting with Mr Kim,externalwas first reported by The Washington Post. The trip took place shortly after Mr Pompeo was nominated by Mr Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, two anonymous sources ""with direct knowledge of the trip"" told the newspaper. Later Reuters news agency said the report had been confirmed to them by senior officials. Early on Wednesday, Mr Trump confirmed the reports with a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Very little is known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit. Mr Pompeo is predicted to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in coming weeks. This is despite mounting speculation that he will, unusually, fail to receive the backing of the bipartisan Senate Foreign Relations Committee followinga grilling of more than five hoursby the committee last week. The US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, although diplomats have visited in the past and there are some so-called ""back channels"" used to communicate with Pyongyang. Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Mr Pompeo's trip was the highest level meeting with a North Korean leader since 2000 when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, in Pyongyang. This video can not be played Trump takes credit for the success of the Winter Olympics in South Korea In 2014, the then-head of National Intelligence James Clapper visited North Korea in a secret mission to negotiate the release of two US citizens. Mr Clapper did not meet the North Korean leader during his trip. Mr Trump stunned the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader. He said the summit would take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites were under consideration but that none of them were in the US. Analysts have speculated that a location for talks could be the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, Beijing, another Asian country, Europe or even a vessel in international waters. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US. North Korea's surge of friendly visitors The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit Mr Trump's estimate that a meeting could take place in June or earlier appears to be one the administration is taking seriously. But news of Mr Pompeo's visit is also likely to overshadow delicate talks with Japan, a key US ally and neighbour of North Korea. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders (left) was on hand for the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Abe There have been fears in Tokyo that Mr Trump's plans for bilateral talks could sideline Japan, and Mr Abe is currently in Florida for talks with the US leader. Relations between the two men appeared cordial on this, the second time that Mr Trump has welcomed Mr Abe to his Mar-a-Lago resort. Japan's worries about the Korean detente Mr Trump insisted on Tuesday that the two countries were ""very unified on the subject of North Korea"", and Mr Abe praised the US president's handling of the North Korea issue. However, observers say Mr Abe's goal for his US trip will be to persuade the US president as much as he can not to sway from the West's hard line on Pyongyang. The Japanese prime minister has repeatedly sought to portray a close personal relationship with Mr Trump and was the first foreign leader to meet him in New York after his election victory in 2016.

MPs applauded after anti-Semitism speeches,"This video can not be played MPs given standing ovations after anti-Semitism speeches Two Labour MPs have been given standing ovations in the Commons after speaking passionately about their own experience of anti-Semitic threats. Luciana Berger said she had contended with abuse for 18 years after receiving her first piece of hate mail aged 19. She told her party it had a ""duty to the next generation"" to confront the issue as ""denial was not an option"". Ruth Smeeth said British Jews had a right to participate in public life as equals and would not be ""bullied"". Addressing those who she said had dismissed claims of anti-Semitism as political smears, she said ""we know what anti-Semitism is, we know where it leads, how dare these people suggest that"". Chakrabarti on Labour and anti-Semitism During the parliamentary debate on anti-Semitism, a succession of MPs urged Jeremy Corbyn to act against offenders within the party. Labour's communities spokesman Andrew Gwynne said ""much more work needs to be done"" on anti-Semitism, adding: ""No political party has the monopoly on vice or virtue but we will put our house in order."" Repeating some of the insults and insinuations she had received firstly as a student activist and then MP for Liverpool Wavertree, Ms Berger said she said had been vilified as ""paid-up Israeli operative"", a traitor, an ""absolute parasite"", and told to ""get out of the country and go back to Israel"". She said she had received abuse from both the far-left and far-right of politics, and that the abuse had become more ""commonplace and corrosive"" in the past two years. Her own party, she said, ""urgently needs to address this issue publicly and consistently"". ""We have a duty to the next generation. Denial is not an option. Prevarication is not an option. Being a bystander who turns the other way is not an option. The time for action is now. Enough really is enough."" The Labour leader, who was present in the chamber for much of the debate, is due to hold talks next week with leading Jewish groups amid criticism of his handling of anti-Semitism cases. This video can not be played Corbyn urged to 'boot out' Livingstone from Labour Labour has been accused of not fully implementing the recommendations of a 2016 review into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the party. The inquiry found that although the party was ""not over-run"" by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" within the party which needed to be addressed. A number of MPs called for the expulsion of former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, who has been suspended since 2016 for comments he made about Adolf Hitler and Zionism. Backbench Labour MP Ian Austin called for Mr Livingstone to be ""booted out"" immediately. Mr Livingstone, London mayor between 2000 and 2008, has been suspended indefinitely pending the outcome of an internal investigation over his claim that Adolf Hitler supported Zionism in the 1930s. An internal disciplinary panel upheld three charges against Mr Livingstone of breaching party rules in April 2017. Mr Austin said there had been ""ample time"" for a decision on the future of the ex-London mayor, who has insisted his comments were historically accurate and will not apologise. Mr Austin said that no action had been taken despite the condemnation of the Community Security Trust, the Holocaust Educational Trust, the Jewish Labour Movement and the chief rabbi. ""Still nothing has happened, it is a disgrace,"" he said. ""Let's be clear about this. Ken Livingstone claiming Hitler was a Zionist is anti-Semitism pure and simple. It happened two years ago, there has been ample time to deal with it. It is a disgrace it has not been dealt with. Kick him out immediately... Boot him out. Mr Gwynne said due process must be observed but the case was taking too long to resolve. Describing Mr Livingstone's comments as ""abhorrent"", he said there must be ""zero tolerance"" of anti-Semitism within Labour and the left as a whole. ""We need to be better at policing our borders,"" he told MPs. ""We need not just to call it out but to cut it out."" Earlier in the debate, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid warned the ""world's oldest hatred"" was on the rise in the UK and worldwide and that it was up to MPs from all parties to show they ""get"" the ""pernicious prejudice"" of anti-Semitism. He criticised what he described as ""dinner party anti-Semites"" who were on the surface ""self-respecting and respectable"" but who freely repeated old anti-Semitic ""tropes"". He also said tech giants needed to do more to remove anti-Semitic material from their platforms, promising ""no hiding place"" from the authorities for those spreading vile abuse online. Ahead of Tuesday's debate, the Board of Deputies president Jonathan Arkush warned that anti-Semitism should be ""called for what it is - anti-Jewish racism"". He warned it had ""sadly and shamefully"" re-emerged to ""infect parts of British political life"".

Jones 'told truth' over bullying claims,"Carwyn Jones referred himself to an inquiry after allegations he had mislead the assembly over what he knew about allegations of bullying in 2014 An independent inquiry has cleared the first minister of misleading the assembly over what he knew about past claims of a bullying culture in the Welsh Government. Carwyn Jones was found to be telling the truth when he told AMs last year thatno allegations were made in 2014. The bullying debate was sparked after ex-communities secretary Carl Sargeant was found dead last November. He died days after being sacked over claims about his conduct towards women. Following the death, former local government ministerLeighton Andrewsanda former special advisorclaimed there had been a ""toxic"" atmosphere within the Welsh Government back in 2014. Welsh Labour leader Mr Jones told AMs no complaints had been made but was accused by some of giving misleading answers. Sargeant's death 'due to hanging' Hereferred himself to an independent inquiry, headed by lawyer James Hamilton, following the allegations. And on Tuesday, Mr Hamilton published his findings clearing Mr Jones of breaking the ministerial code, saying that the answers given by the first minister in the assembly were ""accurate"" and ""truthful"". The lawyer said there was no evidence of complaints being raised by Alyn and Deeside AM Mr Sargeant, who was sacked from the Welsh Labour cabinet in November after claims about his conduct towards women. But Mr Hamilton also suggested Mr Andrews had not made any complaints himself that could be ""properly described as bullying"". Carl Sargeant: Timeline of events before and following his death The Irish lawyer investigating Carwyn Jones Fresh Welsh Government bullying claims Witness fears over first minister probe Mr Hamilton, a former prosecutor, added he found no evidence before 11 November 2014 of any reports or allegations of bullying by special or specialist policy advisers. ""There were allegations made subsequently that there had been a toxic atmosphere or bullying culture in the ministerial floor of Ty Hywel in 2014,"" he said. ""I did not find convincing evidence that this was the case."" Carl Sargeant was found dead four days after he was sacked as communities secretary by the first minister ""The late Mr Sargeant is known to have had a discussion over a drink with the first minister in October 2014, but it was the first minister's evidence that no concerns of bullying were raised with him at meeting,"" he said. ""There is no evidence of complaints being raised by Mr Sargeant at any other time."" Mr Hamilton added that he did not ""consider the first minister to have misled the assembly when he said on 14 November 2017 that all issues had been dealt with"". ""Consequently, my conclusion is that, since the answers given by the first minister on 11 November 2014 and 14 November 2017 were accurate and truthful, and not misleading, the first minister did not breach the ministerial code,"" he said. The code is the set of rules ministers are expected to abide by. Mr Hamilton heard evidence that Mr Andrews, current Rural Affairs Secretary Lesley Griffiths and Mr Sargeant had been concerned about the behaviour of a politically appointed ""special/specialist adviser"". Ms Griffiths told Mr Hamilton that she did feel ""bullied at times by the way in which she said a particular special adviser sometimes operated"", the report said. ""Her concerns related principally to what she saw as a denial of access to the first minister and to feeling undermined in her work such through the questioning of her diary commitments,"" Mr Hamilton wrote, but added that she did not raise her concerns with Mr Jones. The report also said Mr Andrews had taken a letter setting out complaints to a meeting with Mr Jones, but did not hand it to the first minister. ""Mr Andrews failure to hand over that letter is difficult to understand in the light of his present claim that the first minister had misled the assembly just one week before that meeting,"" he said. The report also cites a special adviser who made allegations of a toxic environment at the top of Welsh Government - but said the individual declined to participate in the investigation.

Mr Andrews said the inquiry was ""flawed from the beginning"" and was the ""expected whitewash"". ""It is partial, inconsistent, and ignores evidence from a number of witnesses. The Hamilton Inquiry was flawed from the beginning,"" he added. ""This was not an inquiry into bullying, as Mr Hamilton himself says - it was a narrowly-drawn inquiry into whether or not the first minister misled the assembly on two named dates."" The Hamilton inquiry was one of three triggered following Mr Sargeant's death. Tuesday's inquiry result came afterMr Jones threatened the assembly with court actionover an attempt by the Welsh Conservatives to force the publication of an inquiry report into whether details of Mr Sargeant's sacking were leaked before a cabinet reshuffle. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""We welcome the release of Mr Hamilton's report which sets an important precedent, particularly in light of the ongoing threat of legal action by the First Minister, Carwyn Jones, to prevent publication of a similar report produced at the conclusion of the recent leak inquiry. ""Any continuation to frustrate its publication can only lead to more unhelpful speculation regarding the process and its contents and we would now expect the Welsh Labour Government to publish the leak inquiry report without delay.""

Penis advert appeared in video game apps,"Wish claims to have more than 300 million users worldwide A US online retailer has been reprimanded for promoting an explicit ad for a penis extender strap within video games played by children. UK watchdog the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that Wish.com had behaved ""irresponsibly"" and must ensure its adverts were properly targeted at appropriate age groups in the future. It marks the third time in five months that the San Francisco-based firm has been found to have breached the rules. In each case it has failed to respond. The powers the ASA has to punish offenders are limited, but it told the BBC it would ""continue to apply pressure on Wish.com where necessary"". An animated version of these images appeared within the games (the black boxes have been added by the BBC) The latest ruling concerns an advert that appeared on 26 November. It showed an animated image of a penis above a second animation of the strap being applied. Members of the public reported seeing the imagery in two puzzle-themed apps: Zynga's Crazy Cake Swap and Ketchapp's 2048. Both have a Pegi 3 rating, meaning they had been judged to be suitable for all ages by Europe's video games ratings authority. In addition, the ad was also spotted in Peel Smart Remote, a TV remote control app. Ketchapp said it believed that it should not be held responsible for ads served up in its software, but added that it had increased the age rating of all of its games in response to the complaint. Crazy Cake Swap challenges players to solve puzzles to become ""the best baker in the land"" The ASA said that Zynga did not respond to its inquiries while Peel Technologies' reply was not substantive. ""We considered that given the content of the apps, they were likely to have a broad appeal to all ages including children,"" the watchdog's ruling stated. ""The ad must not appear again in an untargeted medium."" Tom Daley swimming pool selfie advert banned Amazon ads 'misled' customers over savings Poundland's naughty elf deemed 'irresponsible' Wish did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. The ruling comes just a week after the ASA upheld other complaints made against Wish and its parent Contextlogic. These followed itspromotion of adverts,externalfeaturing a baby wearing ripped shorts that exposed its bottom ""for no reason that was relevant to the product"". In some cases the photo appeared alongside a picture of a woman wearing an unzipped cat suit, who was also exposing parts of her buttocks. These adverts had appeared on Facebook as well as an unidentified app, and were judged to be ""offensive"". Prior to this, the ASA criticised Wish in November for an ad featuring a ""red and bloody"" temporary tattoo placed on a woman's shoulder. It had appearedin the game Simon's Cat Crunch Timelast July. The authority said that children who had seen it might have suffered distress. This Wish.com ad was spotted within the game app on 24 July The ASA does not have the power to impose fines. However, it told the BBC it had taken other action to tackle the problem. ""In all three rulings against Wish.com, we have directly contacted the media owners and planners who have been involved in the placement of Wish.com's ads,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We have since received assurances from these media owners and planners that they will either refuse future advertising from Wish.com or adapt their processes to ensure more appropriate ad targeting.""

Costa vows to boost coffee cup recyclingThe UK's biggest coffee chain says it will recycle as many disposable cups as it sells by 2020.,"The UK's biggest coffee chain Costa Coffee has said it will recycle as many disposable cups as it sells by 2020 in a ""cup recycling revolution"". Under the scheme, 500 million coffee cups a year would be recycled, including some sold by rivals, it said. It will encourage waste collection firms to collect the cups by paying them a supplement of Â£70 a tonne. About 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups are thrown away each year in the UK and99.75% are not recycled. They have a mixture of paper and plastic in their inner lining - designed to make them both heat- and leak-proof. Plastic recycling: Why are 99.75% of coffee cups not recycled? Waitrose to stop using disposable coffee cups Four solutions to the disposable coffee cup problem 'Latte levy': Would you pay 25p for your coffee cup? Environmental campaigners have welcomed Costa's move. Costa managing director Dominic Paul told the BBC the move was ""a cup-recycling revolution"". ""By the end of 2020, we'll effectively be cup-neutral. We'll be recycling as many cups as we put into the system,"" he said. Costa said ""misconceptions"" had arisen about whether a coffee cup could be recycled because of the plastic layer, which had ""previously been considered difficult to separate"". However, the chain, which has more than 2,380 branches in the UK,  said: ""The actual issue lies in collecting the cups once they have been disposed of correctly."" Costa and other coffee chains do have recycling collection points for cups in their branches, but most takeaway coffees are consumed elsewhere, including in offices and on the street. Under its new scheme, Costa will pay a supplement of Â£70 for every tonne of cups collected to waste collectors, plus Â£5 per tonne to to a firm that will check the scheme is running as it should. As a result, waste collectors will get on average Â£120 for every tonne of cups they collect, up from Â£50 - a 150% increase. The idea is to make it ""commercially and financially attractive"" for waste collectors to put in place infrastructure to handle the cups - from installing collection points in offices and elsewhere, to sorting them and taking them to recycling plants. Five waste collection firms have been involved in developing the new scheme: Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile. Grundon's sales and marketing director, Bradley Smith, said Costa was helping to create the right conditions for paper cups to become a valuable recycled material. ""This provides increased stability and confidence in the market, which will help waste management companies like Grundon to extend paper cup recycling services to more customers,"" he added. Welcoming the announcement, Gavin Ellis, co-founder of environmental charity Hubbub, said there had been a significant increase in the UK's recycling facilities over recent months, and ""the biggest challenge now is to make sure the used cups are collected and make it to the recycling plants"". And Environment Minister Therese Coffey congratulated Costa on taking a ""significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling"".

"US in direct talks with N Korea - TrumpHe says talks have been held at ""extremely high levels"" to set up his summit with Kim Jong-un.1h40 minutes agoAsia","Mr Pompeo's mission reportedly was to prepare for the Trump-Kim summit CIA director Mike Pompeo travelled to Pyongyang for a secret meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump has confirmed. A ""good relationship"" was formed at the meeting last week, Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday. News of the visit first emerged on Tuesday. US officials were quoted as saying the aim was to prepare a summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim. Mr Trump had earlier alluded to high-level direct talks with Pyongyang. But the unexpected and clandestine meeting marks the highest level US contact with North Korea since 2000. ""We have had direct talks at... extremely high levels,"" Mr Trump said from Florida, where he is hosting Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The president added that he gave his ""blessing"" for talks between the South and North to discuss a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War. North Korea crisis in 300 words The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea has also signalled that it may pursue a formal resolution of the conflict. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim are due to meet next week. The two sides have agreed to broadcast parts of the summit live, the South's state news agency Yonhap reported. The news that Mr Pompeo had travelled to North Korea fora clandestine meeting with Mr Kim,externalwas first reported by The Washington Post. The trip took place shortly after Mr Pompeo was nominated by Mr Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, two anonymous sources ""with direct knowledge of the trip"" told the newspaper. Later Reuters news agency said the report had been confirmed to them by senior officials. Early on Wednesday, Mr Trump confirmed the reports with a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Very little is known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit. Mr Pompeo is predicted to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in coming weeks. This is despite mounting speculation that he will, unusually, fail to receive the backing of the bipartisan Senate Foreign Relations Committee followinga grilling of more than five hoursby the committee last week. The US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, although diplomats have visited in the past and there are some so-called ""back channels"" used to communicate with Pyongyang. Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Mr Pompeo's trip was the highest level meeting with a North Korean leader since 2000 when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, in Pyongyang. This video can not be played Trump takes credit for the success of the Winter Olympics in South Korea In 2014, the then-head of National Intelligence James Clapper visited North Korea in a secret mission to negotiate the release of two US citizens. Mr Clapper did not meet the North Korean leader during his trip. Mr Trump stunned the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader. He said the summit would take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites were under consideration but that none of them were in the US. Analysts have speculated that a location for talks could be the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, Beijing, another Asian country, Europe or even a vessel in international waters. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US. North Korea's surge of friendly visitors The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit Mr Trump's estimate that a meeting could take place in June or earlier appears to be one the administration is taking seriously. But news of Mr Pompeo's visit is also likely to overshadow delicate talks with Japan, a key US ally and neighbour of North Korea. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders (left) was on hand for the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Abe There have been fears in Tokyo that Mr Trump's plans for bilateral talks could sideline Japan, and Mr Abe is currently in Florida for talks with the US leader. Relations between the two men appeared cordial on this, the second time that Mr Trump has welcomed Mr Abe to his Mar-a-Lago resort. Japan's worries about the Korean detente Mr Trump insisted on Tuesday that the two countries were ""very unified on the subject of North Korea"", and Mr Abe praised the US president's handling of the North Korea issue. However, observers say Mr Abe's goal for his US trip will be to persuade the US president as much as he can not to sway from the West's hard line on Pyongyang. The Japanese prime minister has repeatedly sought to portray a close personal relationship with Mr Trump and was the first foreign leader to meet him in New York after his election victory in 2016.

Sir Cliff felt violated by BBC - Hunniford,"Ms Hunniford has attended some of the court hearings with Sir Cliff Sir Cliff Richard felt ""violated and betrayed"" by BBC coverage of a police search of his flat, TV and radio presenter Gloria Hunniford has said. In awitness statement,externalpresented to the singer's High Court privacy case against the corporation, she said her friend was left ""extremely distressed"". Sir Cliff was not charged after South Yorkshire Police's investigation into a historical sexual assault claim. The BBC says its August 2014 report was of legitimate public interest. Lawyers for the broadcaster maintain it acted in good faith and its journalists had respected Sir Cliff's ""presumption of innocence"". Ms Hunniford, who attended some of the court hearings with Sir Cliff, said she had been watching television when the BBC first reported officers were searching his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire. ""That the police were searching my friend's apartment was of course a shock in itself, but to witness the search being carried out on television apparently in real time, with a helicopter filming overhead, together with details of the appalling criminal allegations that the police were said to be investigating, seemed beyond belief,"" she said. Police 'forced' into revealing Cliff raid BBC report shocking, says Cliff Richard Case 'likely to have huge impactâ Sir Cliff, 77, is suing the BBC for the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. He told the judge how the BBC decision to name him and report on the raid left him feeling ""forever tainted"" and ""smeared"". Ms Hunniford's statement said Sir Cliff had always been the ""most positive and upbeat of people"" but after the coverage ""he seemed a different person; broken and extremely confused"". She said there was a ""real emotional and mental change... and even a physical one"" in the two years it took for prosecutors to announce Sir Cliff would not be charged. Ms Hunniford, who hosted a daily show on BBC Radio 2 for 10 years and currently presents Rip Off Britain on BBC One, has known Sir Cliff since 1969. She said after the raid he ""tried to keep things as normal as he could"" and they continued to go on holidays together and spent occasional time at his home in Portugal. ""He was clearly trying to stay positive and put on a brave face on things, but he was not quite succeeding,"" she said. Ms Hunniford said Sir Cliff later spoke of how relieved he was when cleared. She added: ""I could tell that he was, but at the same time I could still see evidence of the toll that this extraordinarily difficult time had taken upon him. When I gave him a hug, he had lost so much weight that he felt like skin and bones."" Ms Hunniford said while Sir Cliff now ""seems more his old self and is looking a lot better...  he cannot stop talking about how violated and betrayed he feels about the BBC decision to broadcast the police search of his apartment and create the media storm that ensued"". One of the singer's lawyers, Paul Morris, gave evidence to the court and described South Yorkshire Police's investigation into Sir Cliff as ""astonishingly long"". Sir Cliff's business manager, Malcolm Smith, told the judge, Mr Justice Mann, it was hoped the investigation would be over within 12 weeks. But he said it was delayed by further false allegations that ""would not have been made but for the BBC publicising the raid in the way they did"". Police had been looking into a claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985. A text message exchange between Dan Johnson and Carrie Goodwin was read out in court South Yorkshire Police has settled its own privacy case with Sir Cliff for Â£400,000 and argues that the BBC should pay a share of this because its actions were ""far more causative of the damage suffered"". Former Det Supt Matthew Fenwick told the court on Monday that police only agreed to tell the BBC about the raid because it had wanted to stop reporter Dan Johnson breaking the story before it had a chance to search Sir Cliff's flat. Details of text message conversations between Mr Johnson and South Yorkshire Police's head of media, Carrie Goodwin, on the day of the raid were raised in court by the BBC's barrister Gavin Millar. The lawyer referred to a message Ms Goodwin sent a few hours after the search and the first BBC broadcast, to ask Mr Johnson whether he had had a ""good day"". Mr Johnson said it had been ""bonkers but brilliant. Thanks for your help. Hope it went well from your point of view. Any idea what happens next?"" In response, Ms Goodwin said: ""Just waiting for meeting to be arranged - everyone thinks we tipped you off so lots of grief from the media but nothing we cannot handle."" Cross-examined by Mr Millar, she denied police had been ""perfectly happy to use Johnson and the BBC after his initial approach to get coverage"" for its ""high profile"" investigation, saying his suggestion ""couldn't be further from the truth"". Ms Goodwin also rejected the lawyer's assertion the force had gone ""out of its way"" to help the BBC to report the case.

"Stormy Daniels unveils stranger sketchThe adult film star's lawyer offers $100,000 for information on a man who allegedly threatened her.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played 'That's between Trump and his family' The adult film star who alleges she had an affair with Donald Trump has unveiled a sketch of the man she claims threatened her in a car park in 2011. Stormy Daniels told ABC's The View that she was speaking out because she was tired of being bullied and threatened. Her lawyer offered a $100,000 (Â£70,000; â¬80,000) reward for information on a man who allegedly told her to ""leave Donald Trump alone"". President Trump denies having any relationship with Ms Daniels. However, his lawyer, Michael Cohen, has admitted paying Ms Daniels $130,000 just before the 2016 US presidential election, which she says was a payment intended to keep her quiet. On Tuesday's daytime ABC Television show The View, Ms Daniels defended herself,externalagainst questions about her motives and her ""end game"". ""I'm tired of being threatened,"" Ms Daniels responded. ""I'm done. I'm sorry, I'm done being bullied."" Stormy Daniels at court for Trump lawyer The president and the porn star: Why this matters The actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is suing Mr Cohen for defamation and fighting Mr Trump's lawyers who are seeking at least $20m in damages from her for breaking a 2016 non-disclosure deal. She has filed a lawsuit to scrap the agreement, which her lawyer believes is invalid because Mr Trump did not sign it. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue in Washington DC described Ms Daniels's latest interview as entertaining and in parts salacious. She repeated her claim that she had sex with Mr Trump just once, in a hotel room during a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, California, in July 2006. Mr Trump married Melania Trump in 2005. The adult film star also recounted a story, first relayed on CBS's 60 Minutes last month, of a threat she received from an unknown manin a Las Vegas car park in 2011. A sketch of the man who threatened Ms Daniels in 2011 was revealed on the US talk show She alleges she was on her way to a fitness class with her infant daughter, when a ""sort of handsome"" man warned her to ""forget the story, leave Donald Trump alone"". When questioned by the TV hosts as to why she did not report the incident, she explained she was afraid to go against the warning and wary of revealing her then-secret alleged affair with Mr Trump to the police. She also added: ""I didn't tell my husband at the time, I was embarrassed. I didn't want him to think I was a bad mum or that I put my daughter in danger."" Ms Daniels and her lawyer Michael Avenatti, who also appeared on the show, revealed a sketch of a lightly bearded man in his 20s or 30s with backswept hair. Mr Avenatti told the public they would be rewarded for tips leading to the identification of the man. Stormy Daniels says she was paid by Michael Cohen to keep quiet about an affair with Mr Trump Ms Daniels' appearance on mainstream US television comes a day after she attended a federal court hearingwhere Mr Cohen was seeking to limit the ability of prosecutors to review documents seized in recent raids on his home, office and hotel room. Mr Trump's personal lawyer is being investigated for criminal wrongdoing, and Ms Daniels said she wanted to be present for anything that might be relevant to her. Legal analysts have said that Mr Cohen's $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels could have violated the rules on financing Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

"'A nightmare, and it's not over yet'","This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? Some members of the so-called Windrush generation, who arrived in the UK decades ago as children, have been incorrectly identified as illegal immigrants. Here are some of their stories. The case of Albert Thompson - not his real name - has become the focus of much coverage during the current row. The 63-year-old is not technically of the Windrush generation as he arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1973 as a teenager. Buthis case was brought to light,externalafter he was told he would have to pay Â£54,000 for prostate cancer treatment unless he could produce the right documentation. ""I was less than two weeks away from my treatment. That was really upsetting,"" he told the BBC. ""I get to the Royal Marsden and they gave me this form to fill out where they want to see passport or visa, benefits letter and bank statement. ""At the end of the day, I don't have those things to show so I've got to pay Â£54,000, which I haven't got."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has raised Mr Thompson's struggles at Prime Minister's Questions, first in March and again on Wednesday, when he accused Theresa May of declining to help him. The prime minister insisted the Home Office has been in contact with Mr Thompson's representatives, and said his NHS treatment should never have been withheld. Who are the Windrush generation? In Pictures: The Windrush generation Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? But Mr Thompson said he first heard that he would receive treatment on the TV news. ""It makes me feel a bit better but not really completely. When I get the treatment - then I'll be over the moon,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Royal Marsden Hospital in London said it had been committed to resolving Mr Thompson's eligibility for further NHS treatment with his legal advisers. They added that his cancer specialist has contacted Mr Thompson to assess him in clinic for his next stage of treatment. In response, Jeremy Bloom, Mr Thompson's lawyer, said his client had been told radiotherapy treatment would only go ahead if he paid in advance or proved he had indefinite leave to remain. The Royal Marsden disputes this. Paulette Wilson, here alongside her daughter Natalie, spent time at an immigration detention centre Paulette Wilson came to Britain from Jamaica aged 10 in the late 1960s. Now 61, she said she was confused when she received a letter saying she was in the country illegally. ""I just didn't understand it and I kept it away from my daughter for about two weeks, walking around in a daze thinking 'why am I illegal?'"" Her daughter Natalie Barnes booked an appointment with the Home Office and was told her mother had six months to leave the country. Ms Wilson then spent two years with the threat of deportation hanging over her, includinga week at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre, which she describes as ""a nightmare"". Windrush peers attack 'incompetent' Home Office How do you prove you've been living in the UK? Her MP and a local charity intervened to prevent her removal, and she has since been given a biometric residence permit which proves she can stay in the country. ""It's not ended because I've just got a card saying I have a right to stay in England - I still have to renew it in 2024,"" she said. Ms Wilson welcomed the government's apology, but asked: ""What about all the other people who were sent away before my case became big? ""It's just upsetting to think that an ordinary person like me could go through something like that. I'm still going through hell at the moment."" This video can not be played Winston Walker has lived in the UK since he was 18 months old Winston Walker arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1966 aged 18 months, on his father's passport. ""I'm as British as anyone,"" said the 53-year-old, who grew up in Birmingham and now lives in Bristol. He ran into difficulty in 2008 when applying for a provisional driving licence. ""I kept sending documents to the DVLA and they kept on sending it back,"" he told the BBC. Mr Walker later contacted an MP to help, after which he said he was told he did not ""exist on any data in this country"". ""It was frightening. I've been schooled here - had the same National Insurance number since I was 16... To be told you don't exist, it's overwhelming."" Mr Walker was able to get a resident's permit but that does not make him a British citizen. He said he wanted a British passport, but found it ""insulting"" that it would cost him ""about Â£1,500"". ""My grandmother would be turning in her grave to find out the way her offspring had been treated,"" he added. This video can not be played Junior Green was not allowed to return to the UK for his mother's funeral Junior Green arrived in the UK from Jamaica at 15 months old, in 1958. ""Sixty years, it's a long time. I'm an Englishman,"" he told BBC Newsnight. In 2009, Mr Green tried to update his passport with the proper visa information, but was told by the Home Office he had to prove he had lived in the UK for each of the previous 10 years. His application was rejected twice. In March last year, Mr Green travelled to Jamaica to be with his dying mother, but when he tried to return to the UK in June, he was not allowed on the flight. ""I was upset - virtually in tears. I couldn't understand why,"" he said. Months passed and Mr Green's mother was repatriated to the UK, but her son was unable to return to attend her funeral. He finally came back to the UK in September, after his local MP intervened. This video can not be played Windrush migrant Nick Broderick: 'I contemplated suicide' Nick Broderick, who came to the UK as a baby in 1962, has been fighting for the past four years to prove his legal status. He was working for a recruitment company in Dunstable when his office was subject to an immigration check. ""I wrote to the Jamaican embassy, I sent Â£70 to get a birth certificate. That didn't happen 3 or 4 times... So they gave me these papers to fill out and after I filled it out, they said to me 'I'm sorry, we seem to have lost the papers that you sent in and so now you're going to be deported',"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. In the months that followed, Mr Broderick had to report to the police station every month, could not work or use his driving licence. He said he knows others, in a similar position, who have been seriously ill with cancer and denied NHS treatment. ""It was an awful, awful time"" which sent him ""into a spiral of depression"", he said. ""I always thought myself as being English. I just want to have a normal life again,"" Nick added. Whitfield Francis - here with his eldest daughter Maria - came to England with his parents at the age of nine Whitfield Francis was born in Jamaica in 1958 and came to England with his parents at the age of nine. He only realised there was an issue over his right to remain in the UK when he tried to change jobs four years ago and was unable to provide proof of his status - something he didn't have - and he hasn't been able to work since. The father-of-four says he can't afford to pay for a biometric residence permit or for legal assistance. ""No-one has given me any help,"" the 59-year-old said. ""If I haven't got these certain documents, my children could be affected. They may not be eligible for a British passport although they were born in Britain."" His former partner Helen Cappasso says the situation ""nearly destroyed him"" and being unable to provide for their four children has ""broken his heart"". ""I cannot express here what a nightmare it's been, and it's not over yet,"" she said. Mr Francis, who is currently ""sofa surfing"" in Birmingham as he is unable to rent somewhere to live, said the government's pledge to help those affected has given him renewed hope that he would finally be able to work again. Sonia Williams says she doesn't accept the government's apology Sonia Williams, who came to the UK from Barbados in 1975, aged 13, has been fighting to prove she is British for four years. She was made redundant in 2014, and lost her driving licence in 2016. ""I can't drive, I can't work, I can't claims benefits, I can't do anything,"" she said. ""Sometimes I just want to give up. ""My mum's got citizenship, my dad had right to remain. So I just presumed I had all that, because I was leaving Barbados to come and live with my family. I wasn't just coming on holiday."" May apologises to Caribbean leaders Have you been affected? She said she feels ""stressed"" and ""numb"", and doesn't accept the government's apology. ""I'm not working, I can't claim benefits, so where am I going to get this money to apply for these things that they're asking me for?"" The Home Office said it would get in touch with Ms Williams. Londoner Katrice, 18, and her mother are both unable to get British passports The impact has not only been felt by the Windrush generation, but many of their children as well. Katrice Louis, whose mother, now 59, came to England from St Lucia aged 8, was born and raised in London but is unable to get a British passport. The 18-year-old says she only found out she wasn't classed as a British citizen when her mother tried to get passports for a family holiday in 2005. Two of Katrice's older siblings, born in the 1980s, have British passports, but Katrice and two of her other sisters, born in the 1990s, are unable to get one. ""The only option we have been given is to spend thousands of pounds to apply for citizenship and a passport which we cannot afford,"" she said. ""I have never understood how I have been born and raised here, but still not classed as a British citizen and been stripped of my identity. I have been denied a job. ""I have been living in fear of being deported to a country I have never even seen."" Tanya Simms, from Sheffield, was born in the UK in 1990. Her grandparents came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s and settled in Reading, Berkshire. They were granted British citizenship in the late 1960s and Tanya's mother joined them in the UK in 1975. Last year Tanya applied for a passport so she could go on her friend's hen do but was turned down on the grounds that neither of her parents were settled at the time of her birth. ""I cried my heart out when I got the letter,"" she said. ""It hurts. I've put into the system, I've been educated here, paid national insurance here."" She fears for the future: ""Where would they send me and my daughter? I've never been to Jamaica. What are they going to do? Just stick me in the sea?""

Kuenssberg: Not coincidental errors,"The Windrush generation are named after the Empire Windrush ship which brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948 As in every walk of life, mistakes happen in politics and policy. And mistakes can happen by accident, sometimes out of negligence, or sometimes because no-one could quite have imagined the consequences of actions that they decided to take. But what's unravelled in the last few days - where the government has been embarrassed, and the prime minister herself had to say sorry about how people whose home is Britain have been treated - is more than just a series of coincidental errors. Dozens of new Windrush cases investigated 'A nightmare, and it's not over yet' Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? The home secretary and the prime minister herself have now both apologised for the Windrush fiasco. Without question a big part of the problem has been how the Home Office has applied the policy that was set by ministers. Incompetence is an occasional feature of any enormous government department. It's not exactly unheard of for the Home Office to be not quite up to its enormous task. In fact, almost any MP will tell you about the kind of delays and frustrations they hear from some of their constituents about the Home Office's handling of immigration cases, affecting all sorts of different nationalities. But officials respond to and operate within the policies, and the climate set by their political masters. And to understand what's gone here it's worth remembering that the rules that now seem overly draconian and unnecessarily burdensome were conceived in a particular political climate. In the days of the coalition, the government's target of getting net immigration down to below 100,000 seemed pretty much unachievable. But the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, had told voters in 2010 that he would cut immigration or deserve to be kicked out. He was determined to stick to the aim, despite a myriad of warnings that it was unrealistic and misleading to suggest the government had any hope of hitting it. Theresa May was the politician charged with trying to meet what seemed an impossible goal. This video can not be played Theresa May's Windrush apology to Caribbean leaders The hunt was then on, under her leadership at the Home Office, to try to find every single possible way that could cut the levels of immigration, whether cracking down on people coming here illegally, or dealing with the problem of over-staying - where people came to the UK to study or work on time-limited visas but stayed. Of course, neither of those categories relate to the Windrush generation, but they meant that slowly but surely government policy towards anyone whose status might be unclear or undocumented became tighter and tighter. And the extent of action to try to monitor immigration extended into more areas of government activity. The rhetoric got tougher and tougher too, with David Cameron even warning illegal immigrants in 2014: ""When we find you, and we will find you, we'll make sure you are sent back to the country you came from."" At times it felt then the two main parties were in a bidding war over who could sound tougher on immigration. There was unease, particularly on the Labour side, but the political wind certainly blew towards a tougher and tougher approach. One of Nick Clegg's former advisers, Polly McKenzie, revealed online tonight how in 2012 it seemed inside government that part of the Home Office's effort to crack down on immigration was to make ""it systematically difficult to get by without papers"". This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK This was of course an effort to cut the numbers of people who were here illegally. But over time, that meant people who had every right to stay in Britain, in their home, came under pressure too. Some of the ideas were resisted. We revealed in 2016 that the now prime minister had even wanted at one stage toput the children of illegal immigrantsat the bottom of the list for school places, but push back in Cabinet stopped that idea. But it's clear that for years, there was a huge focus in government on looking for ways of cutting the levels of immigration. And it's the drive to achieve that, not just administrative mistakes in the Home Office, that is now revealed to have caused such anxiety for so many people. The Windrush fiasco is in part a by-product of a wider political trend that pushed policy over many years. The government promises now that the personal injustices it's caused will come to an end - whether it calls time on the wider culture is a different question.

How to prove you've been in UK,"ManyWindrush migrantswho have had their legal status called into question have been in the UK for decades, often paying taxes and making pension contributions. It seems intuitively that anyone living and working in a country for a long period will leave a significant paper trail. So why are some finding it so difficult to prove? Part of the problem has been a requirement to provide four pieces of evidence for each year that a person has been in the country. Windrush migrants must prove they have been in the UK continually since 1 January 1973, when they were granted the right to stay in the country permanently. Anyone who has left the country for more than two years loses their right to remain. The Home Office did not keep records of the people to whom it granted indefinite leave to remain in the 1970s. Some stayed but did not apply for British citizenship meaning there is no official record of their legal status. May apologises to Caribbean leaders Who are the Windrush generation? Are you from the Windrush generation? To gain this official recognition, people must apply for an official stamp known as No Time Limit (NTL), at a cost of Â£229. The Home Office has put the onus on the individual to provide evidence. It has not been using central tax and pension records, which could prove someone has been working, to support people's applications. Instead, the current system relies on people having kept their own documentation including payslips and bank statements. Guidance published this week has softened the requirements, saying any evidence will be considered that helps to build a picture of someone's life in the UK including: where you went to school where you might have studied where you have worked whether you have family here where you have lived while in the UK Immigration minister Caroline Nokes told the BBC's Daily Politics programme that the Home Office would no longer ask for four pieces of evidence for each year of residence. She said that the Home Office would work with the tax and benefits authorities to ""establish those records which may not be available at first hand to the individuals concerned"". Changes to the immigration system during Theresa May's tenure as home secretary clamped down on people living in the UK illegally. The Immigration Act 2014 introduced requirements on landlords, employers, banks and the NHS to check people's immigration status. This was designed to restrict illegal immigrants' access to work and public services like healthcare, benefits and housing. The Advertising Standards Authority banned a Home Office mobile advert telling illegal immigrants to ""go home or face arrest"". These requirements were made more stringent in 2016. Some people who arrived legally decades ago are being caught out by these checks when they try to rent a house or get medical treatment, but aren't able to prove their status. Although we have anecdotal evidence, there's no central record of how many people have been denied medical treatment because of their immigration status. Since October, NHS hospitals in England have had a legal duty to charge overseas patients upfront for non-urgent care if they are not eligible for free treatment. That includes EU citizens who have been in UK less than six months. The regulations require NHS bodies to make inquiries about whether patients are here legally and ordinarily resident in the UK, in order to charge those who aren't entitled to free care. The Windrush migrants are entitled to treatment - their problem has been proving this. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants' head of legal and policy, Chai Patel, told BBC Reality Check that while in theory there is flexibility in the guidelines, this is not how it has been applied in practice. Timothy Lawrence, a solicitor for the Southwark Law Centre, said: ""The approach has, for many years, been to refuse to accept any claimed period of residence in the absence of independent documentary evidence covering the entire period, with no benefit of the doubt given. ""One of my clients, who had lost the passport she used to enter the UK as a child with indefinite leave, was refused confirmation that she had retained that status in spite of her having supplied the Home Office with a copy of the passport,"" he added. Windrush generation treatment 'appalling' There have been several cases of people who have been refused NHS treatment, detained in immigration centres and almost deported in the case ofPaulette Wilson,external, who was taken as far as Heathrow before her MP intervened. However, there appears to be some confusion in government over whether anyone has actually been deported. Although there are figures available for deportations (there were 12,321 enforced returns last year), it's not possible to tell from these whether any were Windrush migrants. Of the 524,000 people living in the UK in June 2017 who arrived from a Commonwealth country before 1971, 57,000 of them are not UK nationals. Of this group, 15,000 were from Jamaica, 13,000 from India and 29,000 from elsewhere. The University of Oxford's Migration Observatory notes that these figures don't tell us how many people are now likely to be having difficulty demonstrating their legal status in the UK. This is still unknown. It also points out that nationality data is self-reported and so anyone who mistakenly believes they are a UK citizen, as has been the case for some of the Windrush generation, will not be included.

May apologises to Caribbean leaders,"This video can not be played Theresa May's Windrush apology to Caribbean leaders Prime Minister Theresa May has apologised to Caribbean leaders over the Windrush generation controversy, at a Downing Street meeting. She said she was ""genuinely sorry"" about the anxiety caused by the Home Office threatening the children of Commonwealth citizens with deportation. The UK government ""valued"" the contribution they had made, she said, and they had a right to stay in the UK. It comes amid reports some are still facing deportation. The deportation of one man, which had been due to take place on Wednesday, has been halted following an intervention by Labour MP David Lammy. The Tottenham MP said the mother of 35-year-old Mozi Haynes got in touch saying her son was due to be removed from the country after two failed applications to stay. Who are the Windrush generation? 'A nightmare, and it's not over yet' Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? UK makes Commonwealth education aid pledge Mr Lammy later tweeted that he had been contacted by Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes, who had said that Mr Haynes would not now be deported on Wednesday and his case was ""being reviewed"". The Tottenham MP, who has called the controversy a ""national disgrace,"" urged the children of the Windrush generation facing deportation to contact him, promising ""justice will be done"". Mr Lammy said that of 12,056 deportations in 2015, 901 were over 50 years of age. and 303 were to Jamaica. He is calling on the Home Office to review all such cases since 2014 to ""ensure no wrongful detentions have taken place"". The Home Office said it was making efforts to speak to Mr Haynes to advise him that there is no requirement for him to leave the UK. Officials say it is not a Windrush case and was never an ""enforced removal"". The department said it was looking at 49 cases relating to Windrush migrants as a result of calls received on Tuesday. A former Home Office employee has, meanwhile,told The Guardian,externalthat thousands of landing card slips recording Windrush immigrants' arrival dates in the UK were destroyed in 2010 during an office move. The former worker, who is not named by the newspaper, said managers were warned by staff that destroying the cards would make it harder to check the records of older Caribbean-born residents experiencing difficulties proving their right to remain in the UK. In Pictures: The Windrush generation Windrush peers attack Home Office The government said the decision to ""dispose of"" the cards had been an ""operational"" one, taken by officials at the UK Border Agency, rather than the then Home Secretary Theresa May. A Home Office spokesman said: ""Registration slips provided details of an individual's date of entry, they did not provide any reliable evidence relating to ongoing residence in the UK or their immigration status. ""So it would be misleading and inaccurate to suggest that registration slips would therefore have a bearing on immigration cases whereby Commonwealth citizens are proving residency in the UK."" The prime minister's spokesman said things like school records, exam certificates, employment records and bills were seen by the Home Office as ""more reliable evidence of ongoing residence"". In her apology to Caribbean leaders, Theresa May said she wanted to ""dispel any impression that my government is in some sense clamping down on Commonwealth citizens, particularly those from the Caribbean who have built a life here"". She said the current controversy had arisen because of new rules, introduced by her as home secretary, designed to make sure only those with the right to remain in the UK could access the welfare system and the NHS. ""This has resulted in some people, through no fault of their own, now needing to be able to evidence their immigration status,"" she told the foreign ministers and leaders of 12 Caribbean nations in Downing Street. ""And the overwhelming majority of the Windrush generation do have the documents that they need, but we are working hard to help those who do not."" This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK The PM added: ""Those who arrived from the Caribbean before 1973 and lived here permanently without significant periods of time away in the last 30 years have the right to remain in the UK. ""As do the vast majority of long-term residents who arrived later, and I don't want anybody to be in any doubt about their right to remain here in the United Kingdom."" A new taskforce and helpline has been established for those people who arrived from the Commonwealth decades ago as children but were now being incorrectly identified as illegal immigrants. Mrs May said people involved in the process of establishing their status should not be ""left out of pocket"" as a result and would not have to pay for documentation. Cases have emerged -such as these in the Guardian,external- of people who have lost their jobs, rights to health and benefits and faced deportation despite being able to show they have paid tax and National Insurance for decades. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness said he had accepted Theresa May's apology, adding: ""I believe that the right thing is being done at this time."" He said he did not know how many people had been affected by the controversy, but it was ""at least"" in the hundreds. Asked if Mrs May was to blame for the situation, he said: ""I can't answer that question. The truth is that she has said there has been a policy change, that this was an unintended consequence. ""As Caribbean leaders we have to accept that in good faith."" He added that Mrs May had not been able to say ""definitively"" that nobody had been deported as a result of issues with paperwork. Andrew Holness said he had accepted Mrs May's apology Timothy Harris, prime minister of St Kitts and Nevis, said: ""We see this basically as the start of the dialogue, as evidence is uncovered which requires correction."" He said he hoped the British government would ""make good any injustice"" suffered by individuals, including by offering compensation. Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, also backed compensation for those affected and told BBC News there should be ""reprisals for those who dropped the ball"" in the UK government. Thousands of people arrived in the UK as children in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration 70 years ago, often on their parents' passports. They are known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the ship, the Empire Windrush, that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. Under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. However, the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for the individuals to now prove they are in the UK legally. Changes to immigration law in 2012, which require people to have documentation to work, rent a property or access benefits, including healthcare, have highlighted the issue and left people fearful about their status.

Dozens of new Windrush cases investigated,"This video can not be played Theresa May's Windrush apology to Caribbean leaders Officials are investigating dozens of new migration cases relating to the Windrush generation amid mounting criticism of the government. The Home Office said it was looking at 49 cases as a result of calls over the course of Tuesday. Earlier Theresa May apologised over the deportation threats to children of Commonwealth citizens. It has also emerged that landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants were destroyed by the Home Office in 2010. Labour said this was ""truly shocking"", accusing the Home Office - which was run at that time by Theresa May - of getting rid of ""the very records that could have demonstrated their right to remain"". But the government said such a suggestion would be ""misleading and inaccurate"". Who are the Windrush generation? 'A nightmare, and it's not over yet' Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? The row has focused on the so-called Windrush generation, who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean as children in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration 70 years ago, often on their parents' passports. Changes to migration rules mean those who lack documents are now being told they need evidence to continue working, access key services or even remain in the UK. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg As in every walk of life, mistakes happen in politics and policy. And mistakes can happen by accident, sometimes out of negligence, or sometimes because no-one could quite have imagined the consequences of actions that they decided to take. But what's unravelled in the last few days - where the government has been embarrassed, and the prime minister herself had to say sorry about how people whose home is Britain have been treated - is more than just a series of coincidental errors. The home secretary and the prime minister herself have now both apologised for the Windrush fiasco.

Sandy Hook parents sue for defamation,"The lawsuits were filed in Texas, where Mr Jones lives and works Three parents whose young children were killed in a school shooting in 2012 have sued right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation. Mr Jones has long claimed on his radio show and InfoWars website that the Sandy Hook Elementary school attack was ""completely fake"" and a ""giant hoax"". Twenty children - all under the age of seven - and six adults were killed. Mr Jones has implied that the parents are actors seeking to undermine laws allowing private gun ownership. Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, whose son Noah Pozner was one of those killed by a gunman, filed their lawsuit in Travis County, Texas, where Mr Jones lives and works. Sandy Hook parents to Trump: 'Help us stop conspiracy theorists' FBI releases Sandy Hook shootings files ""This conspiracy theory, which has been pushed by InfoWars and Mr Jones since the day of the shooting, alleges that the Sandy Hook massacre did not happen, or that it was staged by the government and concealed using actors, and that the parents of the victims are participants in a horrifying cover-up,"" the lawsuit says. Mr Jones, in an April 2017 video titled ""Sandy Hook Vampires Exposed"", insinuated that Ms De La Rosa was an actor. Noah Pozner, six, was one of the children killed in the massacre A separate lawsuit filed in Travis County by Neil Heslin, father of slain student Jesse Lewis, alleges that Mr Jones accused him of lying about holding his son's body with a bullet hole in his head, according to the complaint. ""This heartless and vile act of defamation re-ignited the Sandy Hook 'false flag' conspiracy and tore open the emotional wounds that plaintiff has tried so desperately to heal,"" the complaint said. This video can not be played Sandy Hook survivors march with Parkland The parents are seeking at least $1m (Â£700,000) in damages. They are suing Mr Jones more than five years after the shooting because they concluded the right-wing radio host has no intention of leaving them alone, according to Mark Bankston, a Houston-based lawyer for the parents. Parents of Sandy Hook victims who have spoken publicly about their experiences have been targeted by trolls, both online, as well as in person. Last June, a Florida woman who believes the attack was fabricated,was sentenced to five months in prison for making death threats against Mr Pozner by phone and email.

Stormy Daniels unveils stranger sketch,"This video can not be played 'That's between Trump and his family' The adult film star who alleges she had an affair with Donald Trump has unveiled a sketch of the man she claims threatened her in a car park in 2011. Stormy Daniels told ABC's The View that she was speaking out because she was tired of being bullied and threatened. Her lawyer offered a $100,000 (Â£70,000; â¬80,000) reward for information on a man who allegedly told her to ""leave Donald Trump alone"". President Trump denies having any relationship with Ms Daniels. However, his lawyer, Michael Cohen, has admitted paying Ms Daniels $130,000 just before the 2016 US presidential election, which she says was a payment intended to keep her quiet. On Tuesday's daytime ABC Television show The View, Ms Daniels defended herself,externalagainst questions about her motives and her ""end game"". ""I'm tired of being threatened,"" Ms Daniels responded. ""I'm done. I'm sorry, I'm done being bullied."" Stormy Daniels at court for Trump lawyer The president and the porn star: Why this matters The actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is suing Mr Cohen for defamation and fighting Mr Trump's lawyers who are seeking at least $20m in damages from her for breaking a 2016 non-disclosure deal. She has filed a lawsuit to scrap the agreement, which her lawyer believes is invalid because Mr Trump did not sign it. The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue in Washington DC described Ms Daniels's latest interview as entertaining and in parts salacious. She repeated her claim that she had sex with Mr Trump just once, in a hotel room during a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, California, in July 2006. Mr Trump married Melania Trump in 2005. The adult film star also recounted a story, first relayed on CBS's 60 Minutes last month, of a threat she received from an unknown manin a Las Vegas car park in 2011. A sketch of the man who threatened Ms Daniels in 2011 was revealed on the US talk show She alleges she was on her way to a fitness class with her infant daughter, when a ""sort of handsome"" man warned her to ""forget the story, leave Donald Trump alone"". When questioned by the TV hosts as to why she did not report the incident, she explained she was afraid to go against the warning and wary of revealing her then-secret alleged affair with Mr Trump to the police. She also added: ""I didn't tell my husband at the time, I was embarrassed. I didn't want him to think I was a bad mum or that I put my daughter in danger."" Ms Daniels and her lawyer Michael Avenatti, who also appeared on the show, revealed a sketch of a lightly bearded man in his 20s or 30s with backswept hair. Mr Avenatti told the public they would be rewarded for tips leading to the identification of the man. Stormy Daniels says she was paid by Michael Cohen to keep quiet about an affair with Mr Trump Ms Daniels' appearance on mainstream US television comes a day after she attended a federal court hearingwhere Mr Cohen was seeking to limit the ability of prosecutors to review documents seized in recent raids on his home, office and hotel room.

Skripal nerve agent 'was in liquid form',"Specialist officers in protective clothing, seen here in March, will remain in Salisbury for the clean-up The nerve agent used to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia was delivered ""in a liquid form"", the Department for Environment says. Only ""a very small amount"" was used on the pair, who were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury on 4 March. A massive clean-up operation is beginning to decontaminate nine sites in the city - it will take several months and cost millions of pounds. The UK says Russia was behind the attack, but Moscow denies involvement. Yulia, 33, left hospital earlier this month.Her 66-year-old father is said to be recovering more slowly but is expected to eventually be discharged. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Who is Sergei Skripal? Yulia Skripal: No-one speaks for me The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the highest concentration of military grade Novichok nerve agent was found at Mr Skripal's house, but eight other sites are known, or thought, to be contaminated. They include ambulance stations and a police car compound, as well as a Zizzi restaurant and the Mill pub, where the Skripals spent time on the day they fell ill. The nerve agent does not evaporate or disappear over time, experts said, and intense cleaning with caustic chemicals is required to get rid of it. Hoardings will go up in public places in the next few days for the clean-up to begin. Grass and stones will be removed from public areas around the Maltings shopping centre, and all material found to be contaminated will be incinerated. Almost 200 military personnel will help with the work, which is expected to take a number of months. A 10th site - a section of London Road cemetery - has now been reopened to the public after tests established it was not contaminated. The cemetery contains the remains of Mr Skripal's wife and son. Yulia and Sergei Skripal were critically ill for several weeks Defra's chief scientific adviser Ian Boyd said the ""number one priority is making these sites safe for the public, so they can be returned to use for the people of Salisbury"". The BBC's Duncan Kennedy, in Salisbury, said authorities are stressing that the risk to the public remains very low. The Skripals' poisoning has triggered a diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. The international watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,has backed the UK's findingsregarding the substance responsible. The UK has called for a UN Security Council meeting on the OPCW report, which could be held this week. Moscow has attempted to gain access to Yulia Skripal, butshe has so far rejected offers of assistancefrom the Russian embassy. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea.

One dead after US jet engine 'explosion',"This video can not be played Jennifer Riordan died after being partially sucked out of the window A woman who was partially sucked out of a window of a US passenger plane after an engine exploded in mid-air has died. Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after a window, wings and fuselage were damaged. Seven passengers were injured. Initial findings say an engine fan blade was missing. In a recording, one of the pilots can be heard saying ""there is a hole and someone went out"". The last passenger death on a US commercial flight was in 2009. This video can not be played Video shows exploded plane engine The Boeing 737-700 had been en route from New York's La Guardia airport to Dallas, Texas, with 143 passengers and five crew when the incident happened. Witnesses say an engine on the plane's left side blew, smashing a window and causing cabin depressurisation that nearly sucked the woman out of the aircraft. She was pulled back in by other passengers. Jennifer Riordan was a mother-of-two and bank vice-president The plane made a safe landing at 11:20 (15:20 GMT), fire officials said. The victim was Jennifer Riordan, a mother-of-two and bank vice-president at Wells Fargo in Albuquerque, New Mexico,according to the Philadelphia Inquirer,external. In the air traffic control recording released by NBC News, pilot Tammie Jo Shults is heard saying: ""We have a part of the aircraft missing, so we're going to need to slow down a bit."" Asked if the plane is on fire, she says it is not but adds: ""They said there is a hole and someone went out."" Passenger images shows a broken window and oxygen masks deployed The former Navy pilot was at the controls when the plane landed. The US Federal Aviation Administration has opened an investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said a preliminary investigation had revealed that an engine fan blade was missing and there was evidence of metal fatigue at the point where it had apparently broken off. Why do people grab their bags after a plane crash? 2017 was safest year for air travel Air disasters timeline NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said part of the cowling - the engine's covering - was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles (112km) from Philadelphia. ""It is very unusual so we are taking this event extremely seriously,"" he said, adding that the investigation could take 12 to 15 months. Mr Sumwalt told reporters the type of engine, a CFM56, is ""very widely used in commercial transport"". Southwest Airlines said it was accelerating its inspection programme for CFM56 engines ""out of an abundance of caution"" and said inspections should be completed over the next 30 days.

Honestly I think we just all thought we were going down."" When flight attendants told passengers to brace for impact, Mr Bourman said he and his wife worried for the worst. ""We're just all really thankful to be alive right now,"" he said. ""Thankful to God, thankful to that pilot."" Passenger Marty Martinez posted a brief Facebook live with the caption: ""Something is wrong with our plane! It appears we are going down! Emergency landing!! Southwest flight from NYC to Dallas!!"" After landing, he told CBS News that it felt like the plane was ""free-falling"", and added that he saw one injured woman being taken off the plane by rescuers.

Girl death bouncy castle 'blown 300m',"Paramedics were called to the park but Summer later died in hospital A girl died after a bouncy castle that two workers had failed to ""adequately anchor"" was blown 300m across a park with her inside it, a court has heard. Summer Grant, seven, from Norwich, died in hospital after visiting a fun fair in Harlow, Essex, on 26 March 2016. Her father told Chelmsford Crown Court he saw the castle go ""50ft in the air"". Fairground workers William Thurston, 29, and his wife Shelby Thurston, 26, both deny a health and safety offence and manslaughter by gross negligence. Tracy Ayling QC, prosecuting, said Summer was with her father, Lee Grant, and other family members at Thurston's Fun Fair on Easter Saturday, and that Storm Katie was expected to arrive by Easter Monday. ""While Summer was in the bouncy castle, it blew away from its moorings and bounced 300 metres down a hill. Having hit a tree, it came to rest,"" she said. The two defendants, of Whitecross Road, Wilburton, Cambridgeshire, sat side-by-side in the dock as Ms Ayling opened the prosecution's case. ""It's the Crown's case that they breached the duty of care they owed to Summer Grant by failing to ensure that the bouncy castle, called a circus super dome inflatable, was adequately anchored to the ground and failed to monitor weather conditions to ensure it was safe to use,"" Ms Ayling said. It is believed a strong gust of wind swept the inflatable across the park Mr Grant told the court he had taken his two daughters to the fair in Harlow Town Park that day. When asked by the prosecution about the weather he said it was a bit windy but ""nothing to think a bouncy castle would blow away"". Mr Grant explained that Summer was on the bouncy castle when he heard his mother scream 'No'. When he turned he saw the bouncy castle in the air. He said ""My daughter's in that"" and he ran after it. He told the court: ""It went about 30-50 feet in the air, it was rolling down the field, rolling, rolling, rolling, I think it hit a tree."" Kevin Smith, an eyewitness who had been at the fair with his family, told the court there was a gust of wind and the dome started to move. He said: ""It started tumbling and cart-wheeling in any direction it could."" He said he shouted to his partner that there was a little girl in there and ran after it. He said he saw it go down the hill and hit a fence. The trial continues.

Lloyds Banking Group to close 49 branches,"Lloyds Banking Group has announced that 49 branches will be closed. Those closures, along with reorganisation elsewhere at the bank, will affect 1,230 jobs. Lloyds says it is creating 925 jobs and existing staff will be redeployed ""wherever possible"". Of the 49 banks earmarked for closure eight belong to the Halifax network and the other 41 are Lloyds branches. After those cuts the group will have 1,750 branches in total. You can finda list of the banks due to close here. Like other banks Lloyds has been reducing the size of its network as customers have switched to online and telephone banking. When chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio took over in 2011 Lloyds Banking Group had almost 2,900 outlets, of which more than 600 were were spun-off in 2013 under the TSB brand name. Lloyds hails landmark year In October 2014 Lloyds announced 400 branch closures as part of a three year plan and last November another 49 were scheduled to be shut. Lloyds says the banks affected in the latest round of closures all have a Post Office ""within short walking distance"", where banking services will be available. Even after the latest closures, Lloyds says it will still have the biggest branch network. ""The changes in roles are in line with our plan to adapt to and meet the changing needs of our customers,"" the bank said in a statement. ""Today's announcement involves making difficult decisions, and we are committed to working through these changes in a careful and sensitive way,"" it added. However, Federation of Small Business national chairman Mike Cherry said the bank's decision to accelerate its bank branch closure programme would ""come as a real blow"" to small businesses in the local communities affected. ""Equally, bank branches are vital to encouraging high street footfall. Cash is still the preferred payment method for thousands of shoppers. ""Reduced access to free to use cash machines is bad for our already embattled high streets and bad for local growth,"" he added. In February Lloyds announced annual profits of Â£5.3bn, up 24% on the previous year and its strongest performance since 2006.

Chemical inspectors allowed into Douma,"This video can not be played Seth Doane from CBS News visits the scene of the 'chemical attack' in Douma Efforts by international experts to examine the scene of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria have been delayed again after a UN risk assessment team came under fire. Shots were fired when a security team visited Douma on Tuesday to prepare for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors' visit. Nobody was injured and the team returned to the capital, Damascus. Western states have accused the Syrian government of a chemical attack. The US, UK and France bombed several Syrian government sites on Saturday in retaliation as the government and its main ally Russia denied chemical weapons had been used. Western powers have suggested the government and Russia, which nominally control Douma after rebel forces withdrew, may be delaying the OPCW visit to tamper with evidence. Local medical organisations and rescue workers say more than 40 people died when two devices were dropped on Douma, while it was still under rebel control. How do you test for chemical weapons? What we know about the 'chemical attack' The UN security detail set out to perform reconnaissance in Douma ahead of the arrival of the actual inspectors, who were scheduled to go in on Wednesday. As OPCW chief Ahmet Uzumcu explained in a statement, the two suspected attack sites are under the control of the Russian military police as part of an agreement with the rebels to keep out the Syrian military. When the security team arrived at the first site, a large crowd gathered and the UN decided to withdraw. At the second site, ""the team came under small arms fire and an explosive was detonated,"" said Mr Uzumcu. The OPCW inspectors are staying at the Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus At that point the UN team decided to return to Damascus. Mr Uzumcu said he did not currently know when the OPCW inspectors could deploy to Douma. ""This incident again highlights the highly volatile environment in which the FFM [fact-finding mission] is having to work and the security risks our staff are facing,"" he said. The nine-strong FFM team has been waiting in Damascus since Saturday. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after alleged gas attack US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert warned on Tuesday that thedelays in getting the OPCW experts into Douma to gather soil samples and other information would ""further degrade"" any evidence on the ground,external. France's foreign ministry said it was ""very likely that proof and essential elements"" were ""disappearing from this site"". This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has told BBC News the allegations of chemical weapons use were ""based on media reports and social media"" and that the incident was ""staged"". On the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under rebel control, the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus after a bloody government offensive. Thousands of people were sheltering in basements from the government's bombardment, when two bombs filled with chemicals were allegedly dropped several hours apart on two separate locations. The US, UK and France say that, based on open-source information and their own intelligence, they are confidentchlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used,external. The government denies using chemical weapons and says the attack was fabricated. A correspondent for US network CBS who gained access to the alleged attack site in Douma on Monday was told by one resident:""All of a sudden some gas spread around us,external. We couldn't breathe. It smelled like chlorine."" Another resident, who said many members of his family were among those killed, showed the CBS crew a yellow compressed gas canister that appeared to have punched a hole in the roof of the building.The canister looked similar to others photographed in the wake of other alleged chlorine attacks,external. Saturday's air strikes were carried out on three targets said to have been ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". The Syrian government denies having ever used chemical weapons but experts from the UN and the OPCW have ascribed four chemical attacks to the government during the civil war, including an attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017 that involved the nerve agent Sarin.

Starbucks to shut cafes for race training,"This video can not be played Watch police arrest two black men at Starbucks - and the protests that followed Coffee chain Starbucks is to close more than 8,000 company-owned branches in the US for an afternoon next month to carry out ""racial bias"" training. The aim is to prevent discrimination in Starbucks stores. The move comes after the firm had to apologise over last week's arrest of two black men who were waiting to meet someone in a Starbucks in Philadelphia. Following the incident, protesters converged on the store and there were calls for a boycott of Starbucks. Starbucks race row leaves customers with a bitter aftertaste Starbucks' chief executive Kevin Johnson said he had been ""learning what we did wrong and the steps we need to take to fix it"". Mr Johnson said he had spent the last few days in Philadelphia. He has also met the two men who were arrested. In a joint statement,the men's lawyer and Starbucks said their discussions had been ""constructive"",external. Mr Johnson had apologised on behalf of the company and the conversation was continuing about how this ""painful incident can become a vehicle for positive social change"", the statement added. All Starbucks company-owned branches and corporate offices will be closed on the afternoon of Tuesday 29 May. Nearly 175,000 staff will receive the training, as will all future recruits. The closure could cost an estimated $20m in lost sales. Days after the coffee company was forced to apologise to the Philadelphia men, footage emerged of an apparent race-related incident in a Starbucks store in California. Brandon Ward, a black Starbucks customer in Torrance in southern California, posted a video on social media purporting to show an incident in January, in which he was barred from using a toilet - despite being a paying customer - while a white man who hadn't bought anything was allowed to use the facilities. This video can not be played Brandon Ward's video of his encounter at a Starbucks has gone viral Mr Ward's video provoked a strong reaction on social media, with some criticising the coffee giant for its actions.

As part of its damage-limitation effort, the company has asked civil rights leaders and officials including former US Attorney General Eric Holder for help in developing a ""curriculum"" for staff, which it will make available to other companies. The training will ""address implicit bias, promote conscious inclusion, prevent discrimination and ensure everyone inside a Starbucks store feels safe and welcome"",the company statement said,external. ""Closing our stores for racial bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities,"" said Mr Johnson. In last Thursday's incident, two black men were waiting in a Philadelphia Starbucks to meet someone and had not bought anything when the store manager called police. Amateur video showed police placing the pair, who were accused by shop staff of trespassing, in handcuffs. ""All the other white people are wondering why it's never happened to us when we do the same thing,"" tweeted customer Melissa DePino, who posted a video of the incident. Mr Johnson said the video was ""hard to watch"" and that the actions taken were ""wrong"" and ""reprehensible"". In an interview on Monday, Mr Johnson said the Philadelphia branch manager who called police about the two men had now left the company. In 2015 a Starbucks public relations campaign to encourage customers to discuss issues of race backfired, when the company's big roll-out was widely mocked. Launching the ""Race Together"" campaign, Starbucks had said it wanted to engage customers in a conversation about race amid protests about policing of African-American communities. It involved baristas scribbling the words ""Race Together"" on cups and attempting to ""engage customers in conversation through Race Together stickers available in select stores"", Starbucks said. But instead the hashtag #racetogether was hijacked on social media and the campaign became the subject of widespread criticism.

Witnesses say an engine on the plane's left side blew, smashing a window and causing cabin depressurisation that nearly sucked the woman out of the aircraft. She was pulled back in by other passengers. Jennifer Riordan was a mother-of-two and bank vice-president The plane made a safe landing at 11:20 (15:20 GMT), fire officials said. The victim was Jennifer Riordan, a mother-of-two and bank vice-president at Wells Fargo in Albuquerque, New Mexico,according to the Philadelphia Inquirer,external. In the air traffic control recording released by NBC News, pilot Tammie Jo Shults is heard saying: ""We have a part of the aircraft missing, so we're going to need to slow down a bit."" Asked if the plane is on fire, she says it is not but adds: ""They said there is a hole and someone went out."" Passenger images shows a broken window and oxygen masks deployed The former Navy pilot was at the controls when the plane landed. The US Federal Aviation Administration has opened an investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said a preliminary investigation had revealed that an engine fan blade was missing and there was evidence of metal fatigue at the point where it had apparently broken off. Why do people grab their bags after a plane crash? 2017 was safest year for air travel Air disasters timeline NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said part of the cowling - the engine's covering - was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles (112km) from Philadelphia. ""It is very unusual so we are taking this event extremely seriously,"" he said, adding that the investigation could take 12 to 15 months. Mr Sumwalt told reporters the type of engine, a CFM56, is ""very widely used in commercial transport"". Southwest Airlines said it was accelerating its inspection programme for CFM56 engines ""out of an abundance of caution"" and said inspections should be completed over the next 30 days.

Year-long wage squeeze nearing an end,"The year-long squeeze on wages is nearing an end, official figures for the three months to February suggest. Using the consumer prices index (CPI) average wages went up by 2.8%, still below the 2.9% inflation rate. But the Office for National Statistics said,externalwhen wages are compared with their new measure of inflation, including housing costs (CPIH), average weekly earnings rose by 0.2% year-on-year. Inflation started to overtake wages in February last year, squeezing incomes. Meanwhile, unemployment in the latest three-month period fell by 16,000 to 1.42 million, with the 4.2% unemployment rate the lowest since the three months to May 1975. The Bank of England has said it expects the fall in unemployment to start pushing up pay more quickly, which is the main reason why it has said it is likely to raise interest rates more quickly than it previously thought. The number of people in work has reached a record high of 32.2 million. The strength or otherwise of people's incomes is one of the most important drivers of our economy. Not only is it of obvious importance to people individually - if each year I feel a little richer I tend to have a more positive outlook on life - but it is also the engine at the heart of our country's growth. Household consumption accounts for about 60% of the value of the UK economy. We are not just a nation of shopkeepers, we are a nation of shoppers. If consumers are on average worse off - as they have been for the last year - then spending levels are put under pressure and economic activity slows. That means we are producing less wealth, less tax income and less money for spending on things like the health service. Tuesday's better news on incomes - month-on-month wages are now rising faster than prices - does not mean the good times are suddenly back. On the more reliable three-month measure, December and February wages still rose less quickly than inflation. And for many millions of people the last decade of anaemic incomes growth has left wages pretty much where they were in 2007. And we haven't seen figures that miserable since Queen Victoria was on the throne. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said: ""Another milestone for employment has been reached under this government as employment reaches a record high, up 3.2 million since 2010 - the 16th time the employment record has been broken in the same period. ""Day-by-day we are helping people turn their lives around by getting into employment. Jobs are key to transforming lives and work is the best route out of poverty."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Unions have negotiated pay rises for workers across the UK, from the counters at McDonald's to the factory floor at Ford. ""But wage growth is still weak. Workers are Â£14 a week worse off than they were in 2007 - with pay packets not expected to return to their pre-crisis level until 2025."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The continued rise in employment, coupled with a further drop in the unemployment rate, is further evidence that the UK jobs market remains in good shape, with firms continuing to recruit despite sluggish economic conditions. However, Mr Thiru said spending was unlikely to increase with ""consumers expected to remain under pressure from uncomfortably high debt levels, particularly if interest rates rise further."" Meanwhile, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, does not think the figures mean an interest rate rise in May is a certainty. He tweeted that,externalthe figures ""place little pressure on the MPS to hike next month"". However, Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, disagrees. ""The figures reinforce expectations the Bank of England will lift interest rates at its May policy meeting. Markets are now pricing in an 85% chance of a rate rise,"" he said.

The unlikely Boston marathon runner-up,"The unlikely runner-up will return to her full-time job with $75,000 in prize money A two-time Olympian, Desiree Linden, became the first American woman to win the Boston Marathon since 1985 on Monday - but it's the runner-up who is making headlines. Sarah Sellers ran the 26.2 mile (42km) course in a time of two hours 44 minutes four seconds, finishing just minutes behind Linden. Monday's race was only the second marathon that the 26-year-old nurse has run. The first, in Utah, she won to qualify for the prestigious Boston event. She was a keen track and field competitor in college, but is an unknown to the professional running world. Previous injuries meant she stopped competing. The nurse only signed up for Monday's event because her younger brother was participating. After paying the $185 (Â£130) entrance fee, she now leaves the east coast with $75,000 (Â£52,000) in prize money. Sellers ran the race without sponsors or an agent, and she has a day job. As the marathon got closer, she has typically been waking up at 04:00 to squeeze in training before long anaesthesiology shifts starting at 06:30 at Banner Health Centre in Arizona. ""Looking at the field of athletes assembled yesterday, I would have been ecstatic to finish in the top 15,"" she told the BBC. Her husband Blake said Sarah did not realise how well she had done until after she finished ""People knew I ran - but it took me by complete surprise so it's taken them by surprise too,"" she said. ""The husband and my parents are here - it was really cool for them to be a part of it."" Linden becomes first American winner in 33 years Bomb survivor marries firefighter who saved her Boston marathon honours bomb victims The 122nd edition of the world's oldest marathon threw up several shock results, with rain-soaked and windy conditions contributing to upsets. Ethiopian runner Mamitu Daska, who led for much of the women's' race, had to withdraw before the end. ""It felt like running in a washing machine - wind and rain the full race,"" Sellers said.

She plans to return to Arizona for work on Tuesday, and laughed off media questions about turning professional. ""I'm definitely going to compete again.

Young face renting 'all their lives',"Up to a third of young people face living in private rented accommodation all their lives, a new report by the Resolution Foundation has found. The think tank, which aims to improve the standard of living of low and middle-income families, said 40% of ""millennials"" - those born between 1980 and 1996 - were living in rented housing by the age of 30. That was twice as many as ""generation X"" - those born between 1965 and 1980. The government said it was already putting policies in place to improve the housing market. The Foundation's Home Improvements report said ""generation rent"" needed much more help. It called for more affordable homes for first-time buyers to be built, as well as better protection for those who rent. Although renting is often a reasonable choice for people who have few ties, the private rented sector is ""far less fit for purpose"" for those with children because of a lack of security. The report reveals that a record 1.8 million families with children rent privately, up from 600,000 15 years ago. It adds that while housing benefit should be able to help millennial families, its value has been reduced relative to the generation who came before them. Four ways to fix the rental market Big landlords are trying to solve Britain's renting mess Renting in retirement: How feasible is it? Where can I afford to rent or buy? Are you a private tenant? Share your stories,external Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Britain's housing problems have developed into a full-blown crisis and young people are bearing the brunt - paying a record share of their income on housing in return for living in smaller, rented accommodation. ""While there have been some steps recently to support housebuilding and first-time buyers, up to a third of millennials still face the prospect of renting from cradle to grave. ""If we want to tackle Britain's housing crisis we have to improve conditions for the millions of families living in private rented accommodation. That means raising standards and reducing the risks associating with renting through tenancy reform.""

She toldRadio 4's Today programme:""I've currently been saving for about two or three  years now but I do find it very difficult due to the fact that my wages don't always match my expenditure and I don't always get the opportunity to save every month. ""The prices are just too ridiculous to even consider buying. I think that a lot of people my age turn to renting because it is cheaper in the beginning and you just get caught in a cycle of renting and can't save up."" Are you stuck in the rent trap? BBC News has set up a new UK Facebook group all about affordable living.Join the Affordable Living group here.,external The report says the tax system should be changed to discourage second home ownership, reducing stamp duty for people who own one home and increasing surcharges for second home owners. It also calls for ""light touch"" stabilisation policies to limit rent increases to the rate of inflation over a three-year period. Read more from Kamal here The experience of those who rent has become much more important politically as the numbers have increased. The accountancy firm PwC predicts that as the price of owning a home rises, 7.2 million households will be in rented accommodation by 2025, compared with 5.4m now and 2.3m in 2001. The Labour Party has already proposed a cap on rent increases, along with three-year tenancies and a licensing scheme for landlords. The party has also said it will build more council houses. This video can not be played Buying a house made ""impossible"" by rental costs The Liberal Democrats are proposing a ""rent-to-buy"" scheme to help renters purchase the homes they live in, as well as far more shared ownership and social housing. A Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: ""Our Help to Buy scheme and the recent cut in stamp duty are helping more young first time buyers get on the property ladder. Figures show that we are seeing the highest number of first time buyers for more than a decade. ""But we're also ... giving councils stronger powers to crack down on bad landlords and consulting on stronger protections for tenants themselves.""

"Assert authority, Corbyn urges MPs","It is time for Parliament to ""assert its authority"" over UK military action after it was not consulted over Syrian air strikes, Jeremy Corbyn has said. The Labour leader told MPs Theresa May had shown ""flagrant disregard"" for the convention that MPs should be consulted beforehand on foreign interventions. He said the PM had ""tossed aside"" the precedent, set by the 2003 Iraq War vote, because it was ""inconvenient"". Mrs May said she was ""deeply conscious"" of the ""gravity"" of her decision. Live: MPs debate Syria strikes Were the Syria air strikes legal? Chemical inspectors to be allowed in Douma Reality Check: Does Russia always use a veto on Syria? But she said that while in some circumstances it was ""absolutely right and appropriate"" for Parliament to debate military action beforehand, this could sometimes prevent the armed forces from acting ""quickly and decisively"". After six hours of debate on Monday, MPs considered Parliament's role in approving military action in Syria in an emergency debate secured by Mr Corbyn, who has accused the PM of by-passing Parliament. He said the decision to authorise air strikes without Parliament's approval set a precedent for possible, more dangerous action in the future. This video can not be played May: We have not done this because President Trump asked us to He said the debate was needed to clarify the government's obligation to consult MPs before military intervention, which has been a convention since the Iraq invasion of 2003. ""It seems the convention established in 2003 and in the cabinet manual is being tossed aside as simply being inconvenient,"" he said. Will West's attack sway Syria's Assad? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Calling for a new War Powers Act that would require Parliament to be consulted on military intervention, Mr Corbyn said this ""is an essential, vital development of hundreds of years of democratic development and parliamentary accountability"". It was for the Commons ""to take matters into its own hands and take back our control"", he said. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM accountable to Parliament not the whims of US president Mrs May said she had made a statement to Parliament ""at the first opportunity"" to take MPs' questions, and responded angrily to a Labour suggestion that US President Donald Trump had been given more of a say than the UK Parliament. ""Let no-one in this House be in any doubt that neither I nor this government take instructions from any president or any other national government,"" she said, adding that the government only acted in the national interest. At the end of the debate, MPs voted in favour of a motion that they had ""considered Parliament's rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces overseas"". Labour opposed the motion as a way of registering dissatisfaction at the lack of a Commons vote before the military action took place. The Stop the War Coalition protested outside Parliament as MPs debated on Monday Sites near Damascus and Homs were hit on Saturday by the US, France and UK in response to the alleged chemical attack on Douma on 7 April. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons at those sites, the Ministry of Defence said. Both Syria, which denies any chemical use, and Russia, which provides military support to the Syrian government, have reacted angrily to the action.

Jones cleared of misleading assembly,"Carwyn Jones referred himself to an inquiry after allegations he had mislead the assembly over what he knew about allegations of bullying in 2014 An independent inquiry has cleared the first minister of misleading the assembly over what he knew about past claims of a bullying culture in the Welsh Government. Carwyn Jones was found to be telling the truth when he told AMs last year thatno allegations were made in 2014. The bullying debate was sparked after ex-communities secretary Carl Sargeant was found dead last November. He died days after being sacked over claims about his conduct towards women. Following the death, former local government ministerLeighton Andrewsanda former special advisorclaimed there had been a ""toxic"" atmosphere within the Welsh Government back in 2014. Welsh Labour leader Mr Jones told AMs no complaints had been made but was accused by some of giving misleading answers. Sargeant's death 'due to hanging' Hereferred himself to an independent inquiry, headed by lawyer James Hamilton, following the allegations. And on Tuesday, Mr Hamilton published his findings clearing Mr Jones of breaking the ministerial code, saying that the answers given by the first minister in the assembly were ""accurate"" and ""truthful"". The lawyer said there was no evidence of complaints being raised by Alyn and Deeside AM Mr Sargeant, who was sacked from the Welsh Labour cabinet in November after claims about his conduct towards women. But Mr Hamilton also suggested Mr Andrews had not made any complaints himself that could be ""properly described as bullying"". Carl Sargeant: Timeline of events before and following his death The Irish lawyer investigating Carwyn Jones Fresh Welsh Government bullying claims Witness fears over first minister probe Mr Hamilton, a former prosecutor, added he found no evidence before 11 November 2014 of any reports or allegations of bullying by special or specialist policy advisers. ""There were allegations made subsequently that there had been a toxic atmosphere or bullying culture in the ministerial floor of Ty Hywel in 2014,"" he said. ""I did not find convincing evidence that this was the case."" Carl Sargeant was found dead four days after he was sacked as communities secretary by the first minister ""The late Mr Sargeant is known to have had a discussion over a drink with the first minister in October 2014, but it was the first minister's evidence that no concerns of bullying were raised with him at meeting,"" he said. ""There is no evidence of complaints being raised by Mr Sargeant at any other time."" Mr Hamilton added that he did not ""consider the first minister to have misled the assembly when he said on 14 November 2017 that all issues had been dealt with"". ""Consequently, my conclusion is that, since the answers given by the first minister on 11 November 2014 and 14 November 2017 were accurate and truthful, and not misleading, the first minister did not breach the ministerial code,"" he said. The code is the set of rules ministers are expected to abide by. Mr Hamilton heard evidence that Mr Andrews, current Rural Affairs Secretary Lesley Griffiths and Mr Sargeant had been concerned about the behaviour of a politically appointed ""special/specialist adviser"". Ms Griffiths told Mr Hamilton that she did feel ""bullied at times by the way in which she said a particular special adviser sometimes operated"", the report said. ""Her concerns related principally to what she saw as a denial of access to the first minister and to feeling undermined in her work such through the questioning of her diary commitments,"" Mr Hamilton wrote, but added that she did not raise her concerns with Mr Jones. The report also said Mr Andrews had taken a letter setting out complaints to a meeting with Mr Jones, but did not hand it to the first minister. ""Mr Andrews failure to hand over that letter is difficult to understand in the light of his present claim that the first minister had misled the assembly just one week before that meeting,"" he said. The report also cites a special adviser who made allegations of a toxic environment at the top of Welsh Government - but said the individual declined to participate in the investigation.

Mr Andrews said the inquiry was ""flawed from the beginning"" and was the ""expected whitewash"". ""It is partial, inconsistent, and ignores evidence from a number of witnesses. The Hamilton Inquiry was flawed from the beginning,"" he added. ""This was not an inquiry into bullying, as Mr Hamilton himself says - it was a narrowly-drawn inquiry into whether or not the first minister misled the assembly on two named dates."" The Hamilton inquiry was one of three triggered following Mr Sargeant's death. Tuesday's inquiry result came afterMr Jones threatened the assembly with court actionover an attempt by the Welsh Conservatives to force the publication of an inquiry report into whether details of Mr Sargeant's sacking were leaked before a cabinet reshuffle. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""We welcome the release of Mr Hamilton's report which sets an important precedent, particularly in light of the ongoing threat of legal action by the First Minister, Carwyn Jones, to prevent publication of a similar report produced at the conclusion of the recent leak inquiry. ""Any continuation to frustrate its publication can only lead to more unhelpful speculation regarding the process and its contents and we would now expect the Welsh Labour Government to publish the leak inquiry report without delay.""

Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after a window, wings and fuselage were damaged. Seven passengers were injured. Initial findings say an engine fan blade was missing. In a recording, one of the pilots can be heard saying ""there is a hole and someone went out"". The last passenger death on a US commercial flight was in 2009. This video can not be played Video shows exploded plane engine The Boeing 737-700 had been en route from New York's La Guardia airport to Dallas, Texas, with 143 passengers and five crew when the incident happened. Witnesses say an engine on the plane's left side blew, smashing a window and causing cabin depressurisation that nearly sucked the woman out of the aircraft. She was pulled back in by other passengers. Jennifer Riordan was a mother-of-two and bank vice-president The plane made a safe landing at 11:20 (15:20 GMT), fire officials said. The victim was Jennifer Riordan, a mother-of-two and bank vice-president at Wells Fargo in Albuquerque, New Mexico,according to the Philadelphia Inquirer,external.

Asked if the plane is on fire, she says it is not but adds: ""They said there is a hole and someone went out."" Passenger images shows a broken window and oxygen masks deployed The former Navy pilot was at the controls when the plane landed. The US Federal Aviation Administration has opened an investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said a preliminary investigation had revealed that an engine fan blade was missing and there was evidence of metal fatigue at the point where it had apparently broken off. Why do people grab their bags after a plane crash? 2017 was safest year for air travel Air disasters timeline NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said part of the cowling - the engine's covering - was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles (112km) from Philadelphia. ""It is very unusual so we are taking this event extremely seriously,"" he said, adding that the investigation could take 12 to 15 months. Mr Sumwalt told reporters the type of engine, a CFM56, is ""very widely used in commercial transport"". Southwest Airlines said it was accelerating its inspection programme for CFM56 engines ""out of an abundance of caution"" and said inspections should be completed over the next 30 days.

"Macron urges EU to shun nationalismFrance's leader warns of a ""civil war"" of ideas after recent electoral gains for populists.4h4 hours agoEurope","This video can not be played ""I don't want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers"" French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that ""there seems to be a European civil war"" between liberal democracy and rising authoritarianism. He urged the EU to renew its commitment to democracy, in a passionate speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. ""I don't want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers that has forgotten its own past"", he said. Populists dominated recent elections in states like Hungary and Italy, fuelled by the continuing EU migrant crisis. Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban returned to power with a landslide victoryearlier this month whileEurosceptic parties caused a political earthquake in Italy in March. Mr Macron and his liberal La RÃ©publique en Marche (LREM) party triumphed in France's elections last year with a strongly pro-EU platform. However, the French polls saw record numbers of voters staying away, with turnout of less than 50% at both rounds of the parliamentary election. The man who thinks Europe has been invaded What the Italian result means Nationalism in the heart of Europe By Adam Fleming, BBC News, Strasbourg President Macron used some memorable phrases as he sought to reinvigorate European democracy. The divisions in Europe were like a ""civil warâ¦ where there is an increasing fascination with illiberalism"". And was he referring to Brexit when he said that, in response to problems, some proposed a yellow brick road, to take their people off on an adventure somewhere else? Most striking was his heralding of a new generation that didn't experience World War Two and saw Europe in a different way. But will next year's elections for the European Parliament usher in a wave of MEPs who want to strengthen the EU or to rip it apart? That's the test. In his speech he condemned what he called ""a fascination with the illiberal"" in Europe. ""I want to belong to a generation that will defend European sovereignty because we fought to obtain it,"" he said. ""And I will not give in to any kind of fixation on authoritarianism."" In 2017, Mr Macron's main challenger was National Front leader Marine Le Pen, a nationalist and fierce critic of the EU. The French president is launching debates with voters aimed at re-engaging them with the EU. He also proposed a new European fund to help communities that take in migrants and said France would be willing to pay more into the EU budget to fill the gap left by the departure of the UK. In a debate with MEPs after his speech Mr Macron said he wanted to keep the UK close to the EU despite Brexit but there was to be ""no cherry-picking in the single market"". He said there must be ""full respect"" for the freedoms of the EU single market: free movement of goods, services, capital and people. Macron's meteoric rise - in depth What are French President Macron's policies? He identified some key areas of ""European"" - rather than national - sovereignty: tackling climate change and environmental problems, health, minority rights and privacy. He wants France and Germany to be in the vanguard of ambitious eurozone reforms, including turning the bailout fund - the European Stability Mechanism - into a European Monetary Fund, like the IMF. The idea is that an ""EMF"" could tackle a country's debt problems and other financial crises before they spread to the rest of Europe. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats are wary of any scheme that could make richer countries liable for the debts of poorer partners. Mr Macron's set-piece speech in Strasbourg set out his vision for democratic renewal in the EU, at a time of growing nationalism in the 28-nation bloc. Anti-government protesters at a rally in Hungary before the election The focus of the migrant crisis has switched from Greece to Italy, where some 600,000 undocumented migrants have arrived by sea in the past four years. There is also nervousness in the EU about Russian influence on European voters, with many examples of fake news spreading in social media - often blamed on supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. MEPs applauded Mr Macron when he said democracy was a ""word with meaning, which emerged from the battles of the past"". He faces a big challenge ahead of the 2019 European elections as the LREM does not belong to any of the main groups in the European Parliament. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

'Rife misuse' of data by Brexit campaigners,"Brittany Kaiser, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, has been giving evidence to a parliamentary committee Misuse of data was ""rife"" among the businesses and campaigns of Leave.EU chairman and ex-UKIP donor Arron Banks, a former Cambridge Analytica (CA) employee has told MPs. Brittany Kaiser said Mr Banks asked the consultancy firm for a joint strategy for Leave.EU, UKIP and Eldon Insurance. Ms Kaiser said CA ""took receipt"" of UKIP's membership data as part of this. Leave.EU refutes Ms Kaiser's statements and CA said it has never received data from any Arron Banks company. Ms Kaiser was giving evidence to the House of Commons' digital, culture, media and sport committee, which is conducting an inquiry into fake news. Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting of personal Facebook data and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US presidential election and Brexit referendum. Meanwhile, committee chair Damian Collins has said there is no legal reason for the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, to not attend the inquiry on Wednesday. Mr Collins said representatives for Mr Nix had said he would miss the hearing as he was ""subject to a criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner's office"". Facebook suspends Brexit data firm How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded Chris Wylie: 'I want a democratic mandate for Brexit' Leave.EU was fronted by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage and funded by millionaire Mr Banks, but failed in its bid to be named the official Brexit campaign group. It denies that Cambridge Analytica undertook any work for the campaign. But Ms Kaiser says she pitched them a detailed strategy. ""Arron Banks asked us to design a strategy where we could work with Leave.EU, UKIP and Eldon Insurance together"", she told MPs. Ms Kaiser said she saw data from Eldon Insurance - which is owned by Mr Banks and carries out claims for Go Skippy - used by the Leave.EU with her ""own eyes"". She said that as Leave.EU had little data when they first met, CA ""took receipt"" of UKIP's membership and survey data to create a model for Leave.EU communications. A UKIP spokesman told the BBC they had asked CA to make a bid, ""showed them a sample of data"" and then said ""thanks, but no thanks"", adding that the party's ""root data wasn't very good"". ""We submitted a contract for Â£41,500 for phase one,"" said Ms Kaiser, referring to the preliminary work she says was undertaken by CA. She said this work was not  reported to the Electoral Commission and never paid for. ""We never had a contract with Leave.EU, the contract was with the UK Independence Party for the analysis of this data but it was meant to benefit Leave.EU,"" she added. ""Normally you don't charge for a bid,"" UKIP told the BBC, adding that ""in case we wanted the work"" Mr Banks donated the same amount of money to the party, but the money ended up being used for something else. CA denies doing any paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU. ""Eldon shared no data with anyone and to suggest they did is again another lie to attack Arron Banks and Leave.EU directly,"" a Leave.EU spokesperson said. Brittany Kaiser (far right) of Cambridge Analytica sits alongside Brexit campaigner Aaron Banks during a Leave.EU news conference in 2015 Meanwhile, Leave.EU's Andy Wigmore has been recorded appearing to compare the tactics it used to keep immigration at the top of the referendum debate to the ""clever"" techniques of the Nazis. Mr Wigmore said ""it was a conversation not a statement of facts"". He is also heard discussing contacts with Cambridge Analytica. Mr Wigmore was talking to university lecturer Emma Briant for an upcoming book on the Trump campaign. He told Ms Briant ""the only way"" Leave.EU would be successful was to ""follow the Trump doctrine"". ""The more outrageous we are, the more attention we'll get, and the more attention we get, the more outrageous we'll be,"" said Mr Wigmore. Mr Wigmore admitted that campaigners were concerned they would be blamed for creating ""a wave of hatred and racism"". He told Ms Briant: ""The propaganda machine of the Nazis, for instance - you take away all the hideous horror and that kind of stuff, it was very clever, the way they managed to do what they did. ""In its pure marketing sense, you can see the logic of what they were saying, why they were saying it, and how they presented things, and the imagery. ""Having been on the sharp end of this campaign, you think: crikey, this is not new, and it's just ... using the tools that you have at the time."" Mr Wigmore has since said his comments on Nazism were in a ""historical context around the Remain campaign's project fear and how propaganda has been used in the context of social media"". Ms Briant also spoke to the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL Group, Nigel Oakes. Mr Oakes told her that Mr Trump ""leveraged an artificial enemy"" in the shape of the Muslims. ""Hitler attacked the Jews. He didn't have a problem with the Jews at all, but the people didn't like the Jews and so he just leveraged an artificial enemy... that's exactly what Trump did. He leveraged Muslims,"" Mr Oakes told Ms Briant. This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded Ms Briant said she was ""shocked"" Nazism had come up in the two interviews and felt a ""moral obligation"" to share the recordings. A CA spokesperson said Mr Oakes was speaking in ""a personal capacity about the historical use of propaganda"" and ""has never worked for Cambridge Analytica and did not work on the Trump campaign in any way"". But Mr Collins said the recordings made clear that Leave.EU benefited from their work with CA and the campaign had questions to answer about how it developed its database. ""We're very interested to understand more about this work Cambridge Analytica did for Leave.EU. Leave.EU may not have paid for that themselves but nevertheless a huge amount of work was done which, I believe, they benefited from,"" Mr Collins told Today.

Macron urges EU to shun nationalism,"This video can not be played ""I don't want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers"" French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that ""there seems to be a European civil war"" between liberal democracy and rising authoritarianism. He urged the EU to renew its commitment to democracy, in a passionate speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. ""I don't want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers that has forgotten its own past"", he said. Populists dominated recent elections in states like Hungary and Italy, fuelled by the continuing EU migrant crisis. Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban returned to power with a landslide victoryearlier this month whileEurosceptic parties caused a political earthquake in Italy in March. Mr Macron and his liberal La RÃ©publique en Marche (LREM) party triumphed in France's elections last year with a strongly pro-EU platform. However, the French polls saw record numbers of voters staying away, with turnout of less than 50% at both rounds of the parliamentary election. The man who thinks Europe has been invaded What the Italian result means Nationalism in the heart of Europe By Adam Fleming, BBC News, Strasbourg President Macron used some memorable phrases as he sought to reinvigorate European democracy. The divisions in Europe were like a ""civil warâ¦ where there is an increasing fascination with illiberalism"". And was he referring to Brexit when he said that, in response to problems, some proposed a yellow brick road, to take their people off on an adventure somewhere else? Most striking was his heralding of a new generation that didn't experience World War Two and saw Europe in a different way. But will next year's elections for the European Parliament usher in a wave of MEPs who want to strengthen the EU or to rip it apart? That's the test. In his speech he condemned what he called ""a fascination with the illiberal"" in Europe. ""I want to belong to a generation that will defend European sovereignty because we fought to obtain it,"" he said. ""And I will not give in to any kind of fixation on authoritarianism."" In 2017, Mr Macron's main challenger was National Front leader Marine Le Pen, a nationalist and fierce critic of the EU. The French president is launching debates with voters aimed at re-engaging them with the EU. He also proposed a new European fund to help communities that take in migrants and said France would be willing to pay more into the EU budget to fill the gap left by the departure of the UK. In a debate with MEPs after his speech Mr Macron said he wanted to keep the UK close to the EU despite Brexit but there was to be ""no cherry-picking in the single market"". He said there must be ""full respect"" for the freedoms of the EU single market: free movement of goods, services, capital and people. Macron's meteoric rise - in depth What are French President Macron's policies? He identified some key areas of ""European"" - rather than national - sovereignty: tackling climate change and environmental problems, health, minority rights and privacy. He wants France and Germany to be in the vanguard of ambitious eurozone reforms, including turning the bailout fund - the European Stability Mechanism - into a European Monetary Fund, like the IMF. The idea is that an ""EMF"" could tackle a country's debt problems and other financial crises before they spread to the rest of Europe. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats are wary of any scheme that could make richer countries liable for the debts of poorer partners. Mr Macron's set-piece speech in Strasbourg set out his vision for democratic renewal in the EU, at a time of growing nationalism in the 28-nation bloc. Anti-government protesters at a rally in Hungary before the election The focus of the migrant crisis has switched from Greece to Italy, where some 600,000 undocumented migrants have arrived by sea in the past four years. There is also nervousness in the EU about Russian influence on European voters, with many examples of fake news spreading in social media - often blamed on supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. MEPs applauded Mr Macron when he said democracy was a ""word with meaning, which emerged from the battles of the past"". He faces a big challenge ahead of the 2019 European elections as the LREM does not belong to any of the main groups in the European Parliament. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Girl death bouncy castle 'blown 300m'Summer Grant died because the inflatable she wasn't ""adequately anchored"" a court hears.11m11 minutes agoEssex","Paramedics were called to the park but Summer later died in hospital A girl died after a bouncy castle that two workers had failed to ""adequately anchor"" was blown 300m across a park with her inside it, a court has heard. Summer Grant, seven, from Norwich, died in hospital after visiting a fun fair in Harlow, Essex, on 26 March 2016. Her father told Chelmsford Crown Court he saw the castle go ""50ft in the air"". Fairground workers William Thurston, 29, and his wife Shelby Thurston, 26, both deny a health and safety offence and manslaughter by gross negligence. Tracy Ayling QC, prosecuting, said Summer was with her father, Lee Grant, and other family members at Thurston's Fun Fair on Easter Saturday, and that Storm Katie was expected to arrive by Easter Monday. ""While Summer was in the bouncy castle, it blew away from its moorings and bounced 300 metres down a hill. Having hit a tree, it came to rest,"" she said. The two defendants, of Whitecross Road, Wilburton, Cambridgeshire, sat side-by-side in the dock as Ms Ayling opened the prosecution's case. ""It's the Crown's case that they breached the duty of care they owed to Summer Grant by failing to ensure that the bouncy castle, called a circus super dome inflatable, was adequately anchored to the ground and failed to monitor weather conditions to ensure it was safe to use,"" Ms Ayling said. It is believed a strong gust of wind swept the inflatable across the park Mr Grant told the court he had taken his two daughters to the fair in Harlow Town Park that day. When asked by the prosecution about the weather he said it was a bit windy but ""nothing to think a bouncy castle would blow away"". Mr Grant explained that Summer was on the bouncy castle when he heard his mother scream 'No'. When he turned he saw the bouncy castle in the air. He said ""My daughter's in that"" and he ran after it. He told the court: ""It went about 30-50 feet in the air, it was rolling down the field, rolling, rolling, rolling, I think it hit a tree."" Kevin Smith, an eyewitness who had been at the fair with his family, told the court there was a gust of wind and the dome started to move. He said: ""It started tumbling and cart-wheeling in any direction it could."" He said he shouted to his partner that there was a little girl in there and ran after it. He said he saw it go down the hill and hit a fence. The trial continues.

Cliff 'felt violated' by BBC - Hunniford,"Ms Hunniford has attended some of the court hearings with Sir Cliff Sir Cliff Richard felt ""violated and betrayed"" by BBC coverage of a police search of his flat, TV and radio presenter Gloria Hunniford has said. In awitness statement,externalpresented to the singer's High Court privacy case against the corporation, she said her friend was left ""extremely distressed"". Sir Cliff was not charged after South Yorkshire Police's investigation into a historical sexual assault claim. The BBC says its August 2014 report was of legitimate public interest. Lawyers for the broadcaster maintain it acted in good faith and its journalists had respected Sir Cliff's ""presumption of innocence"". Ms Hunniford, who attended some of the court hearings with Sir Cliff, said she had been watching television when the BBC first reported officers were searching his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire. ""That the police were searching my friend's apartment was of course a shock in itself, but to witness the search being carried out on television apparently in real time, with a helicopter filming overhead, together with details of the appalling criminal allegations that the police were said to be investigating, seemed beyond belief,"" she said. Police 'forced' into revealing Cliff raid BBC report shocking, says Cliff Richard Case 'likely to have huge impactâ Sir Cliff, 77, is suing the BBC for the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. He told the judge how the BBC decision to name him and report on the raid left him feeling ""forever tainted"" and ""smeared"". Ms Hunniford's statement said Sir Cliff had always been the ""most positive and upbeat of people"" but after the coverage ""he seemed a different person; broken and extremely confused"". She said there was a ""real emotional and mental change... and even a physical one"" in the two years it took for prosecutors to announce Sir Cliff would not be charged. Ms Hunniford, who hosted a daily show on BBC Radio 2 for 10 years and currently presents Rip Off Britain on BBC One, has known Sir Cliff since 1969. She said after the raid he ""tried to keep things as normal as he could"" and they continued to go on holidays together and spent occasional time at his home in Portugal. ""He was clearly trying to stay positive and put on a brave face on things, but he was not quite succeeding,"" she said. Ms Hunniford said Sir Cliff later spoke of how relieved he was when cleared. She added: ""I could tell that he was, but at the same time I could still see evidence of the toll that this extraordinarily difficult time had taken upon him. When I gave him a hug, he had lost so much weight that he felt like skin and bones."" Ms Hunniford said while Sir Cliff now ""seems more his old self and is looking a lot better...  he cannot stop talking about how violated and betrayed he feels about the BBC decision to broadcast the police search of his apartment and create the media storm that ensued"". One of the singer's lawyers, Paul Morris, gave evidence to the court and described South Yorkshire Police's investigation into Sir Cliff as ""astonishingly long"". Sir Cliff's business manager, Malcolm Smith, told the judge, Mr Justice Mann, it was hoped the investigation would be over within 12 weeks. But he said it was delayed by further false allegations that ""would not have been made but for the BBC publicising the raid in the way they did"". Police had been looking into a claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985. A text message exchange between Dan Johnson and Carrie Goodwin was read out in court South Yorkshire Police has settled its own privacy case with Sir Cliff for Â£400,000 and argues that the BBC should pay a share of this because its actions were ""far more causative of the damage suffered"". Former Det Supt Matthew Fenwick told the court on Monday that police only agreed to tell the BBC about the raid because it had wanted to stop reporter Dan Johnson breaking the story before it had a chance to search Sir Cliff's flat. Details of text message conversations between Mr Johnson and South Yorkshire Police's head of media, Carrie Goodwin, on the day of the raid were raised in court by the BBC's barrister Gavin Millar. The lawyer referred to a message Ms Goodwin sent a few hours after the search and the first BBC broadcast, to ask Mr Johnson whether he had had a ""good day"". Mr Johnson said it had been ""bonkers but brilliant. Thanks for your help. Hope it went well from your point of view. Any idea what happens next?"" In response, Ms Goodwin said: ""Just waiting for meeting to be arranged - everyone thinks we tipped you off so lots of grief from the media but nothing we cannot handle."" Cross-examined by Mr Millar, she denied police had been ""perfectly happy to use Johnson and the BBC after his initial approach to get coverage"" for its ""high profile"" investigation, saying his suggestion ""couldn't be further from the truth"". Ms Goodwin also rejected the lawyer's assertion the force had gone ""out of its way"" to help the BBC to report the case.

She said there was a ""real emotional and mental change... and even a physical one"" in the two years it took for prosecutors to announce Sir Cliff would not be charged. Ms Hunniford, who hosted a daily show on BBC Radio 2 for 10 years and currently presents Rip Off Britain on BBC One, has known Sir Cliff since 1969. She said after the raid he ""tried to keep things as normal as he could"" and they continued to go on holidays together and spent occasional time at his home in Portugal. ""He was clearly trying to stay positive and put on a brave face on things, but he was not quite succeeding,"" she said. Ms Hunniford said Sir Cliff later spoke of how relieved he was when cleared. She added: ""I could tell that he was, but at the same time I could still see evidence of the toll that this extraordinarily difficult time had taken upon him. When I gave him a hug, he had lost so much weight that he felt like skin and bones."" Ms Hunniford said while Sir Cliff now ""seems more his old self and is looking a lot better...  he cannot stop talking about how violated and betrayed he feels about the BBC decision to broadcast the police search of his apartment and create the media storm that ensued"". One of the singer's lawyers, Paul Morris, gave evidence to the court and described South Yorkshire Police's investigation into Sir Cliff as ""astonishingly long"". Sir Cliff's business manager, Malcolm Smith, told the judge, Mr Justice Mann, it was hoped the investigation would be over within 12 weeks. But he said it was delayed by further false allegations that ""would not have been made but for the BBC publicising the raid in the way they did"". Police had been looking into a claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985. A text message exchange between Dan Johnson and Carrie Goodwin was read out in court South Yorkshire Police has settled its own privacy case with Sir Cliff for Â£400,000 and argues that the BBC should pay a share of this because its actions were ""far more causative of the damage suffered"". Former Det Supt Matthew Fenwick told the court on Monday that police only agreed to tell the BBC about the raid because it had wanted to stop reporter Dan Johnson breaking the story before it had a chance to search Sir Cliff's flat. Details of text message conversations between Mr Johnson and South Yorkshire Police's head of media, Carrie Goodwin, on the day of the raid were raised in court by the BBC's barrister Gavin Millar. The lawyer referred to a message Ms Goodwin sent a few hours after the search and the first BBC broadcast, to ask Mr Johnson whether he had had a ""good day"". Mr Johnson said it had been ""bonkers but brilliant. Thanks for your help. Hope it went well from your point of view. Any idea what happens next?"" In response, Ms Goodwin said: ""Just waiting for meeting to be arranged - everyone thinks we tipped you off so lots of grief from the media but nothing we cannot handle."" Cross-examined by Mr Millar, she denied police had been ""perfectly happy to use Johnson and the BBC after his initial approach to get coverage"" for its ""high profile"" investigation, saying his suggestion ""couldn't be further from the truth"". Ms Goodwin also rejected the lawyer's assertion the force had gone ""out of its way"" to help the BBC to report the case.

Man gets 'third face' in French transplant,"This video can not be played Mr Hamon is still recovering in hospital in Paris after the January transplant The first person in the world to receive two facial transplants says he is feeling well, three months after his latest groundbreaking operation. JÃ©rÃ´me Hamon had his first transplanted face removed last year after signs of rejection following a treatment with an incompatible antibiotic during a cold. The 43 year old remained in a hospital in Paris without a face for two months while a compatible donor was sought. He said: ""The first [face] I accepted immediately. This time it's the same."" Mr Hamon suffers from neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic condition that caused severe disfiguring tumours on his face. His first transplant, in 2010, was a success, but he caught a common cold in 2015 and was given antibiotics. The drug was incompatible with the immunosuppressive treatment he was having to prevent a rejection of the transplanted material. The first signs of rejection came in 2016 and last November, the face, suffering from necrosis, had to be removed. What's it like living with a face transplant? How to build a whole new face Mr Hamon lived without a face in a room at Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris without being able to see, speak or hear until January, when a face donor was found and the second transplant carried out. To avoid further rejection, Mr Hamon - dubbed ""the man with three faces"" by French media - had special treatment to clean the blood prior to the transplant. His new face remains smooth and motionless, and his skull, skin and features are yet to be fully aligned. But he is positive about his recovery. ""If I hadn't accepted this new face it would have been terrible. It's a question of identity... But here we are, it's good, it's me,"" he told AFP news agency from the hospital, where he is still recovering. ""I'm 43 and the donor was 22 so I'm 22 again,"" he told French TV. Prof Lantieri next to a screen showing the different steps of Mr Hamon's face The hours-long operation was led by Prof Laurent Lantieri, a specialist in hand and face transplants who carried out Mr Hamon's initial surgery eight years ago. ""Today, we know that a double transplant is feasible, it's no longer in the field of research,""he told Le Parisien newspaper (in French).,external Anaesthetist Bernard Cholley said: ""Anyone who loses their face and then has to wait for a hypothetical transplant for an unknown length of time - that's something that no-one has ever had to go through here. ""I'm amazed by the courage of a patient who has been able to get through such an ordeal."" The first face transplant was carried out in 2005 in northern France.Since then, some 40 operations have been performed around the world. What's it like living with a face transplant?

Inquiry reveals Stephen Lawrence 'spy name',"Doreen and Neville Lawrence: Officer ""Hagan"" gathered intelligence on their failing relationship in 1998 A long-delayed inquiry into abuses by undercover police has published the covert name used by the officer who ""spied"" on the Stephen Lawrence family campaign. The Metropolitan Police officer who gathered intelligence during the 1998 public inquiry into the murder used the name ""Dave Hagan"". Hagan was a member of the controversial Special Demonstration Squad and between 1996 and 2001 infiltrated four left-wing campaign groups. His information was passed to Scotland Yard bosses who were fighting damning accusations that the murder investigation had been marred by racism. Dave Hagan is the 30th ""cover name"" to be released by the inquiry out of approximately 200 officers who will be at the heart of the investigation. The officer,whose real identity is being protected by the inquiry,external, has fought against his false name being revealed, saying he was suffering from long-standing mental health problems. According to the inquiry, he was deployed by the Metropolitan Police to gather intelligence on the activities of the Socialist Workers Party, the anarchist group Class War, Movement Against the Monarchy, and Movement for Justice. It was during his deployment in the last of those organisations in 1998 that he became involved in the Lawrence family's campaign as the SDS unit investigated whether tension over botched investigations into black deaths could spill over into violence. Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Stephen Lawrence's father forgives killers Former Lawrence suspect to repay Â£6,000 But some of the information Hagan gathered had no bearing on public order. One intelligence report from the officer indicated that Doreen and Neville Lawrence, had  probably separated but were appearing united for the sake of the campaign. In August 1998, as Scotland Yard prepared its final submissions for the inquiry into its handling of Stephen Lawrence's murder, Hagan and his SDS handler had a secret meeting with Richard Walton, a now-retired senior officer. Mr Walton was part of the then Commissioner's inquiry team. The Home Office's own review of the episode described this meeting as ""wrong-headed"" and that Hagan had been a ""spy in the Lawrence family camp"" at a crucial point in the family's fight for justice. Hagan, previously only known as ""N81,""told the Home Office team he had been following orders,external. Undercover police inquiry: Can it get to the truth? Inquiry chairman urged to quit Part of Hagan's mission is believed to have also included targeting Duwayne Brooks, Stephen's friend who was with him the night he was murdered. Today, Mr Brooks welcomed the release of the name - and demanded that Scotland Yard release all secret files on him that were written by Hagan. ""At last the speculation is over and I can try and piece together what parts of my life 'Dave Hagan' intruded on,"" he said. ""Which bits of my private life did he snoop on? How much of my confidential legal advice did he leach out of me? ""Which campaigns for justice did he infiltrate and perhaps subvert? Trying to remember after 20 years of unnecessary delay is hard, and makes holding the police accountable that much harder."" Neither Doreen nor Neville Lawrence have commented today on the release of the name - but another family has called for his full identity to be revealed. Ricky Reel campaign: Another apparent target for Dave Hagan Sukhdev Reel's son Ricky died in unexplained circumstances in 1997, shortly after being racially abused by two white men in Kingston, south west London. Mrs Reel told the BBC the undercover inquiry had informed her that Hagan was also involved in her campaign. ""People would come to my home and offer their support, shake our hands, shake my children's' hands,"" she said. ""We would offer them cups of tea, our door was always open. Did Hagan shake my children's hands? Who was he? I need a photograph, a real name. And I want to ask him why he did it.""

Primark and JD Sports buck UK retail gloom,"Associated British Foods, owner of Primark, has hailed the clothing chain's UK performance as ""remarkable"" after a boost in like-for-like sales. However, the UK results were not enough to offset a decline in Primark's same-store sales overall. Retailer JD Sports also reported a rise in sales, which it said was ""an excellent result"". The UK results of both firms come despite the crisis faced by some High Street chains. In the 24 weeks to 3 March, Primark saw 3% growth in its UK like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new store openings. This increase came ""against a backdrop of unseasonable weather in Europe"" and a decline in margins due to adverse currency movements. ""Our UK performance was remarkable in the circumstances and delivered a strong increase in our share of the total clothing market,"" it said. However, this was not enough to boost its overall like-for-like sales, which fell 1.5% after ""unseasonably warm weather in October"" and ""freezing temperatures across northern Europe"". Sales in Northern Europe declined in the period. Primark has 352 stores worldwide, with 184 in the UK. There was a drop in sales in Germany, where the chain has 25 stores. The fashion chain owner said it expected profit growth to pick up in the second half. Associated British Foods (ABF) had ""successfully navigated a brace of headwinds"" including challenges in its sugar business and unseasonal weather said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon. ""What's impressive in these results is management's assertion that profitability in the all-important retail division will rise in the second half. ""Part of this is due to the benefit of a weaker dollar, but Primark has managed its stock well and improved its buying positions too,"" Mr Salmon said. Meanwhile, like-for-like sales at JD Sports stores grew 3%, while profits were up by 26%, in the 53 weeks to 3 February. ""This is an excellent result demonstrating our capacity for continuing growth in both existing and new markets, and the strength of our offer in store and online,"" said Peter Cowgill, JD Sports executive chairman. Chains on the UK High Street have been facing a combination of a squeeze on incomes and rising overheads. Prezzo, New Look and Carpetright are among the big names that have been struggling recently.

Chemical inspectors to be allowed into DoumaOPCW experts are to be allowed access to the site of an alleged chemical attack in Syria on 7 April.6m7 minutes agoMiddle East,"This video can not be played Seth Doane from CBS News visits the scene of the 'chemical attack' in Douma Efforts by international experts to examine the scene of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria have been delayed again after a UN risk assessment team came under fire. Shots were fired when a security team visited Douma on Tuesday to prepare for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors' visit. Nobody was injured and the team returned to the capital, Damascus. Western states have accused the Syrian government of a chemical attack. The US, UK and France bombed several Syrian government sites on Saturday in retaliation as the government and its main ally Russia denied chemical weapons had been used. Western powers have suggested the government and Russia, which nominally control Douma after rebel forces withdrew, may be delaying the OPCW visit to tamper with evidence. Local medical organisations and rescue workers say more than 40 people died when two devices were dropped on Douma, while it was still under rebel control. How do you test for chemical weapons? What we know about the 'chemical attack' The UN security detail set out to perform reconnaissance in Douma ahead of the arrival of the actual inspectors, who were scheduled to go in on Wednesday. As OPCW chief Ahmet Uzumcu explained in a statement, the two suspected attack sites are under the control of the Russian military police as part of an agreement with the rebels to keep out the Syrian military. When the security team arrived at the first site, a large crowd gathered and the UN decided to withdraw. At the second site, ""the team came under small arms fire and an explosive was detonated,"" said Mr Uzumcu. The OPCW inspectors are staying at the Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus At that point the UN team decided to return to Damascus. Mr Uzumcu said he did not currently know when the OPCW inspectors could deploy to Douma. ""This incident again highlights the highly volatile environment in which the FFM [fact-finding mission] is having to work and the security risks our staff are facing,"" he said. The nine-strong FFM team has been waiting in Damascus since Saturday. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after alleged gas attack US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert warned on Tuesday that thedelays in getting the OPCW experts into Douma to gather soil samples and other information would ""further degrade"" any evidence on the ground,external. France's foreign ministry said it was ""very likely that proof and essential elements"" were ""disappearing from this site"". This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has told BBC News the allegations of chemical weapons use were ""based on media reports and social media"" and that the incident was ""staged"". On the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under rebel control, the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus after a bloody government offensive. Thousands of people were sheltering in basements from the government's bombardment, when two bombs filled with chemicals were allegedly dropped several hours apart on two separate locations. The US, UK and France say that, based on open-source information and their own intelligence, they are confidentchlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used,external. The government denies using chemical weapons and says the attack was fabricated. A correspondent for US network CBS who gained access to the alleged attack site in Douma on Monday was told by one resident:""All of a sudden some gas spread around us,external. We couldn't breathe. It smelled like chlorine."" Another resident, who said many members of his family were among those killed, showed the CBS crew a yellow compressed gas canister that appeared to have punched a hole in the roof of the building.The canister looked similar to others photographed in the wake of other alleged chlorine attacks,external. Saturday's air strikes were carried out on three targets said to have been ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". The Syrian government denies having ever used chemical weapons but experts from the UN and the OPCW have ascribed four chemical attacks to the government during the civil war, including an attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017 that involved the nerve agent Sarin.

MPs to hold second debate on Syria strikes,"It is time for Parliament to ""assert its authority"" over UK military action after it was not consulted over Syrian air strikes, Jeremy Corbyn has said. The Labour leader told MPs Theresa May had shown ""flagrant disregard"" for the convention that MPs should be consulted beforehand on foreign interventions. He said the PM had ""tossed aside"" the precedent, set by the 2003 Iraq War vote, because it was ""inconvenient"". Mrs May said she was ""deeply conscious"" of the ""gravity"" of her decision. Live: MPs debate Syria strikes Were the Syria air strikes legal? Chemical inspectors to be allowed in Douma Reality Check: Does Russia always use a veto on Syria? But she said that while in some circumstances it was ""absolutely right and appropriate"" for Parliament to debate military action beforehand, this could sometimes prevent the armed forces from acting ""quickly and decisively"". After six hours of debate on Monday, MPs considered Parliament's role in approving military action in Syria in an emergency debate secured by Mr Corbyn, who has accused the PM of by-passing Parliament. He said the decision to authorise air strikes without Parliament's approval set a precedent for possible, more dangerous action in the future.

Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Calling for a new War Powers Act that would require Parliament to be consulted on military intervention, Mr Corbyn said this ""is an essential, vital development of hundreds of years of democratic development and parliamentary accountability"". It was for the Commons ""to take matters into its own hands and take back our control"", he said. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM accountable to Parliament not the whims of US president Mrs May said she had made a statement to Parliament ""at the first opportunity"" to take MPs' questions, and responded angrily to a Labour suggestion that US President Donald Trump had been given more of a say than the UK Parliament. ""Let no-one in this House be in any doubt that neither I nor this government take instructions from any president or any other national government,"" she said, adding that the government only acted in the national interest. At the end of the debate, MPs voted in favour of a motion that they had ""considered Parliament's rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces overseas"". Labour opposed the motion as a way of registering dissatisfaction at the lack of a Commons vote before the military action took place. The Stop the War Coalition protested outside Parliament as MPs debated on Monday Sites near Damascus and Homs were hit on Saturday by the US, France and UK in response to the alleged chemical attack on Douma on 7 April. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons at those sites, the Ministry of Defence said. Both Syria, which denies any chemical use, and Russia, which provides military support to the Syrian government, have reacted angrily to the action.

Macron: EU 'in civil war' over democracy,"This video can not be played ""I don't want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers"" French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that ""there seems to be a European civil war"" between liberal democracy and rising authoritarianism. He urged the EU to renew its commitment to democracy, in a passionate speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. ""I don't want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers that has forgotten its own past"", he said. Populists dominated recent elections in states like Hungary and Italy, fuelled by the continuing EU migrant crisis. Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban returned to power with a landslide victoryearlier this month whileEurosceptic parties caused a political earthquake in Italy in March. Mr Macron and his liberal La RÃ©publique en Marche (LREM) party triumphed in France's elections last year with a strongly pro-EU platform. However, the French polls saw record numbers of voters staying away, with turnout of less than 50% at both rounds of the parliamentary election. The man who thinks Europe has been invaded What the Italian result means Nationalism in the heart of Europe By Adam Fleming, BBC News, Strasbourg President Macron used some memorable phrases as he sought to reinvigorate European democracy. The divisions in Europe were like a ""civil warâ¦ where there is an increasing fascination with illiberalism"". And was he referring to Brexit when he said that, in response to problems, some proposed a yellow brick road, to take their people off on an adventure somewhere else? Most striking was his heralding of a new generation that didn't experience World War Two and saw Europe in a different way. But will next year's elections for the European Parliament usher in a wave of MEPs who want to strengthen the EU or to rip it apart? That's the test. In his speech he condemned what he called ""a fascination with the illiberal"" in Europe. ""I want to belong to a generation that will defend European sovereignty because we fought to obtain it,"" he said. ""And I will not give in to any kind of fixation on authoritarianism."" In 2017, Mr Macron's main challenger was National Front leader Marine Le Pen, a nationalist and fierce critic of the EU. The French president is launching debates with voters aimed at re-engaging them with the EU. He also proposed a new European fund to help communities that take in migrants and said France would be willing to pay more into the EU budget to fill the gap left by the departure of the UK. In a debate with MEPs after his speech Mr Macron said he wanted to keep the UK close to the EU despite Brexit but there was to be ""no cherry-picking in the single market"". He said there must be ""full respect"" for the freedoms of the EU single market: free movement of goods, services, capital and people. Macron's meteoric rise - in depth What are French President Macron's policies? He identified some key areas of ""European"" - rather than national - sovereignty: tackling climate change and environmental problems, health, minority rights and privacy. He wants France and Germany to be in the vanguard of ambitious eurozone reforms, including turning the bailout fund - the European Stability Mechanism - into a European Monetary Fund, like the IMF. The idea is that an ""EMF"" could tackle a country's debt problems and other financial crises before they spread to the rest of Europe. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats are wary of any scheme that could make richer countries liable for the debts of poorer partners. Mr Macron's set-piece speech in Strasbourg set out his vision for democratic renewal in the EU, at a time of growing nationalism in the 28-nation bloc. Anti-government protesters at a rally in Hungary before the election The focus of the migrant crisis has switched from Greece to Italy, where some 600,000 undocumented migrants have arrived by sea in the past four years. There is also nervousness in the EU about Russian influence on European voters, with many examples of fake news spreading in social media - often blamed on supporters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. MEPs applauded Mr Macron when he said democracy was a ""word with meaning, which emerged from the battles of the past"". He faces a big challenge ahead of the 2019 European elections as the LREM does not belong to any of the main groups in the European Parliament. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Man gets 'third face' in French transplantJÃ©rÃ´me Hamon is the first patient to have two facial transplants and says he is doing well.1han hour agoEurope,"This video can not be played Mr Hamon is still recovering in hospital in Paris after the January transplant The first person in the world to receive two facial transplants says he is feeling well, three months after his latest groundbreaking operation. JÃ©rÃ´me Hamon had his first transplanted face removed last year after signs of rejection following a treatment with an incompatible antibiotic during a cold. The 43 year old remained in a hospital in Paris without a face for two months while a compatible donor was sought. He said: ""The first [face] I accepted immediately. This time it's the same."" Mr Hamon suffers from neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic condition that caused severe disfiguring tumours on his face. His first transplant, in 2010, was a success, but he caught a common cold in 2015 and was given antibiotics. The drug was incompatible with the immunosuppressive treatment he was having to prevent a rejection of the transplanted material. The first signs of rejection came in 2016 and last November, the face, suffering from necrosis, had to be removed. What's it like living with a face transplant? How to build a whole new face Mr Hamon lived without a face in a room at Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris without being able to see, speak or hear until January, when a face donor was found and the second transplant carried out. To avoid further rejection, Mr Hamon - dubbed ""the man with three faces"" by French media - had special treatment to clean the blood prior to the transplant. His new face remains smooth and motionless, and his skull, skin and features are yet to be fully aligned. But he is positive about his recovery. ""If I hadn't accepted this new face it would have been terrible. It's a question of identity... But here we are, it's good, it's me,"" he told AFP news agency from the hospital, where he is still recovering. ""I'm 43 and the donor was 22 so I'm 22 again,"" he told French TV. Prof Lantieri next to a screen showing the different steps of Mr Hamon's face The hours-long operation was led by Prof Laurent Lantieri, a specialist in hand and face transplants who carried out Mr Hamon's initial surgery eight years ago. ""Today, we know that a double transplant is feasible, it's no longer in the field of research,""he told Le Parisien newspaper (in French).,external Anaesthetist Bernard Cholley said: ""Anyone who loses their face and then has to wait for a hypothetical transplant for an unknown length of time - that's something that no-one has ever had to go through here. ""I'm amazed by the courage of a patient who has been able to get through such an ordeal."" The first face transplant was carried out in 2005 in northern France.Since then, some 40 operations have been performed around the world. What's it like living with a face transplant?

Skripal poison 'was in liquid form',"Specialist officers in protective clothing, seen here in March, will remain in Salisbury for the clean-up The nerve agent used to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia was delivered ""in a liquid form"", the Department for Environment says. Only ""a very small amount"" was used on the pair, who were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury on 4 March. A massive clean-up operation is beginning to decontaminate nine sites in the city - it will take several months and cost millions of pounds. The UK says Russia was behind the attack, but Moscow denies involvement. Yulia, 33, left hospital earlier this month.Her 66-year-old father is said to be recovering more slowly but is expected to eventually be discharged. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Who is Sergei Skripal? Yulia Skripal: No-one speaks for me The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the highest concentration of military grade Novichok nerve agent was found at Mr Skripal's house, but eight other sites are known, or thought, to be contaminated. They include ambulance stations and a police car compound, as well as a Zizzi restaurant and the Mill pub, where the Skripals spent time on the day they fell ill. The nerve agent does not evaporate or disappear over time, experts said, and intense cleaning with caustic chemicals is required to get rid of it. Hoardings will go up in public places in the next few days for the clean-up to begin. Grass and stones will be removed from public areas around the Maltings shopping centre, and all material found to be contaminated will be incinerated. Almost 200 military personnel will help with the work, which is expected to take a number of months. A 10th site - a section of London Road cemetery - has now been reopened to the public after tests established it was not contaminated. The cemetery contains the remains of Mr Skripal's wife and son. Yulia and Sergei Skripal were critically ill for several weeks Defra's chief scientific adviser Ian Boyd said the ""number one priority is making these sites safe for the public, so they can be returned to use for the people of Salisbury"". The BBC's Duncan Kennedy, in Salisbury, said authorities are stressing that the risk to the public remains very low. The Skripals' poisoning has triggered a diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. The international watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,has backed the UK's findingsregarding the substance responsible. The UK has called for a UN Security Council meeting on the OPCW report, which could be held this week. Moscow has attempted to gain access to Yulia Skripal, butshe has so far rejected offers of assistancefrom the Russian embassy. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea.

Chemical inspectors to be allowed into Douma,"This video can not be played Seth Doane from CBS News visits the scene of the 'chemical attack' in Douma Efforts by international experts to examine the scene of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria have been delayed again after a UN risk assessment team came under fire. Shots were fired when a security team visited Douma on Tuesday to prepare for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors' visit. Nobody was injured and the team returned to the capital, Damascus. Western states have accused the Syrian government of a chemical attack. The US, UK and France bombed several Syrian government sites on Saturday in retaliation as the government and its main ally Russia denied chemical weapons had been used. Western powers have suggested the government and Russia, which nominally control Douma after rebel forces withdrew, may be delaying the OPCW visit to tamper with evidence. Local medical organisations and rescue workers say more than 40 people died when two devices were dropped on Douma, while it was still under rebel control. How do you test for chemical weapons? What we know about the 'chemical attack' The UN security detail set out to perform reconnaissance in Douma ahead of the arrival of the actual inspectors, who were scheduled to go in on Wednesday. As OPCW chief Ahmet Uzumcu explained in a statement, the two suspected attack sites are under the control of the Russian military police as part of an agreement with the rebels to keep out the Syrian military. When the security team arrived at the first site, a large crowd gathered and the UN decided to withdraw. At the second site, ""the team came under small arms fire and an explosive was detonated,"" said Mr Uzumcu. The OPCW inspectors are staying at the Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus At that point the UN team decided to return to Damascus. Mr Uzumcu said he did not currently know when the OPCW inspectors could deploy to Douma. ""This incident again highlights the highly volatile environment in which the FFM [fact-finding mission] is having to work and the security risks our staff are facing,"" he said. The nine-strong FFM team has been waiting in Damascus since Saturday. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after alleged gas attack US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert warned on Tuesday that thedelays in getting the OPCW experts into Douma to gather soil samples and other information would ""further degrade"" any evidence on the ground,external. France's foreign ministry said it was ""very likely that proof and essential elements"" were ""disappearing from this site"". This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has told BBC News the allegations of chemical weapons use were ""based on media reports and social media"" and that the incident was ""staged"". On the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under rebel control, the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus after a bloody government offensive. Thousands of people were sheltering in basements from the government's bombardment, when two bombs filled with chemicals were allegedly dropped several hours apart on two separate locations. The US, UK and France say that, based on open-source information and their own intelligence, they are confidentchlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used,external. The government denies using chemical weapons and says the attack was fabricated. A correspondent for US network CBS who gained access to the alleged attack site in Douma on Monday was told by one resident:""All of a sudden some gas spread around us,external. We couldn't breathe. It smelled like chlorine."" Another resident, who said many members of his family were among those killed, showed the CBS crew a yellow compressed gas canister that appeared to have punched a hole in the roof of the building.The canister looked similar to others photographed in the wake of other alleged chlorine attacks,external. Saturday's air strikes were carried out on three targets said to have been ""specifically associated with the Syrian regime's chemical weapons programme"". The Syrian government denies having ever used chemical weapons but experts from the UN and the OPCW have ascribed four chemical attacks to the government during the civil war, including an attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017 that involved the nerve agent Sarin.

Actress kidnapped by North Korea diesShe was kidnapped under the orders of then leader Kim Jong-il before escaping years later.,"Ms Choi was one of South Korea's most famous actresses during the peak of her popularity A South Korean actress, once kidnapped by North Korea and forced to make films for the state, has died at 91. Choi Eun-hee was a leading actress in the South when she was kidnapped on the orders of then leader-in-waiting Kim Jong-il in the late 1970s. Her ex-husband, a famous film director, was also abducted several months later. The duo later escaped. North Korea has always denied abducting the couple, saying they had sought sanctuary there. Ms Choi died on Monday afternoon in hospital in South Korea. ""My mother passed when she went to hospital for kidney dialysis this afternoon,""Ms Choi's eldest son, director Shin Jeong-gyun, told news outlet Yonhap.,external Born in November 1926 in South Korea's Gyeonggi province, Ms Choi began her film career in 1947. Kidnapped by North Korea - and forced to make films Ten things about North Korea's film industry What's behind North Korea's surge of friendly visitors? She and her then-husband Shin Sang-ok eventually rose to be among South Korea's most celebrated film directors and stars. This still of Ms Choi and Mr Shin is taken from a film about the couple, titled ""The Lovers and the Despot"" But by the late 1970s, the couple had divorced and Choi's career had hit a downturn. It was during that time that Choi was approached by someone posing as a Hong Kong businessman with a proposal to form a film-making company which would revive her fortunes. According to a book ""A Kim Jong-il Production"", she was persuaded to go to Hong Kong.Once in Hong Kong, she was grabbed and sedated by a group of men. Eight days later she was in Pyongyang in a luxurious villa that was constantly guarded. Despite being divorced, Mr Shin and his ex-wife had remained close and he went to Hong Kong to look for her. He too was later abducted. Mr Shin and Ms Choi are shown here with Kim Jong-il (centre) The late Mr Kim, who ruled North Korea from his father's death in 1994 until his own in 2011, was said to be a great film buff, and an avid watcher of Hollywood movies. He had hoped that the couple's presence in the North could help their film industry compete on the international stage. After eight years, the couple won Mr Kim's trust and were allowed to travel to Vienna to promote their films. While in Vienna, the duo sought political asylum at the US embassy. They returned to South Korea years later and Mr Shin died in 2006. The outlandish tale has gone on to grip audiences across the globe.

Facebook facial recognition faces lawsuit,"Facebook must face a class action lawsuit over its use of facial recognition technology, a California judge has ruled. The lawsuit alleges that Facebook gathered biometric information without users' explicit consent. It involves the ""tag suggestions"" technology, which spots users' friends in uploaded photos. The lawsuit says this breaches Illinois state law. Facebook said the case had no merit and it would fight it vigorously. However in his order, US District Judge James Donato wrote that Facebook seemed to believe individual lawsuits would be preferable to a class action ""because statutory damages could amount to billions of dollars"". On Monday, Judge Donato ruled to certify a class of Facebook users - a key legal hurdle for a class action suit. In a successful class action suit, any person in that group could be entitled to compensation. The class of people in question is made up of Facebook users ""in Illinois for whom Facebook created and stored a face template after 7 June 2011,"" according to the court order. The decision comes days after Facebook chief executiveMark Zuckerberg faced intensive questioning by US lawmakersover the company's collection and use of user data. He is also due to meet European Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip in San Francisco this week, reports Bloomberg. Zuckerberg: I'm still the man to run Facebook Facebook chief's data was harvested June 2011 was the date on which Facebook rolled out its ""tag suggestions"" feature. The feature suggests who might be present in uploaded photos, based on an existing database of faces. In Judge Donato's ruling, he laid out the four-step process behind the technology: Initially, the software tries to detectanyfaces in an uploaded photo It standardises and aligns them for size and direction Then, for each face, Facebook computes a facesignature- a mathematical representation of the face in that photo Face signatures are then run through a stored database of user facetemplatesto look for similar matches The tag suggestions feature is not currently available in the UK On its help pages, Facebook says the face templates,externalare made from information about the similarities in every photo the user has been tagged in. ""If you've never been tagged in a photo on Facebook or have untagged yourself in all photos of you on Facebook, then we do not have this summary information for you,"" the company says. The feature is not available to users in most countries, including the UK - and can be turned off in settings for US users. In December 2017 Facebook announced that userswould be notified if a picture of them was uploaded by someone else, even if they hadn't been tagged in it. Due to privacy regulations, this feature would not be available in Europe or Canada, the firm said at the time.

Leave.EU figure praised Nazi tactics,"Brittany Kaiser, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, has been giving evidence to a parliamentary committee Misuse of data was ""rife"" among the businesses and campaigns of Leave.EU chairman and ex-UKIP donor Arron Banks, a former Cambridge Analytica (CA) employee has told MPs. Brittany Kaiser said Mr Banks asked the consultancy firm for a joint strategy for Leave.EU, UKIP and Eldon Insurance. Ms Kaiser said CA ""took receipt"" of UKIP's membership data as part of this. Leave.EU refutes Ms Kaiser's statements and CA said it has never received data from any Arron Banks company. Ms Kaiser was giving evidence to the House of Commons' digital, culture, media and sport committee, which is conducting an inquiry into fake news. Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting of personal Facebook data and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US presidential election and Brexit referendum. Meanwhile, committee chair Damian Collins has said there is no legal reason for the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, to not attend the inquiry on Wednesday. Mr Collins said representatives for Mr Nix had said he would miss the hearing as he was ""subject to a criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner's office"". Facebook suspends Brexit data firm How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded Chris Wylie: 'I want a democratic mandate for Brexit' Leave.EU was fronted by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage and funded by millionaire Mr Banks, but failed in its bid to be named the official Brexit campaign group. It denies that Cambridge Analytica undertook any work for the campaign. But Ms Kaiser says she pitched them a detailed strategy. ""Arron Banks asked us to design a strategy where we could work with Leave.EU, UKIP and Eldon Insurance together"", she told MPs. Ms Kaiser said she saw data from Eldon Insurance - which is owned by Mr Banks and carries out claims for Go Skippy - used by the Leave.EU with her ""own eyes"". She said that as Leave.EU had little data when they first met, CA ""took receipt"" of UKIP's membership and survey data to create a model for Leave.EU communications. A UKIP spokesman told the BBC they had asked CA to make a bid, ""showed them a sample of data"" and then said ""thanks, but no thanks"", adding that the party's ""root data wasn't very good"". ""We submitted a contract for Â£41,500 for phase one,"" said Ms Kaiser, referring to the preliminary work she says was undertaken by CA. She said this work was not  reported to the Electoral Commission and never paid for. ""We never had a contract with Leave.EU, the contract was with the UK Independence Party for the analysis of this data but it was meant to benefit Leave.EU,"" she added. ""Normally you don't charge for a bid,"" UKIP told the BBC, adding that ""in case we wanted the work"" Mr Banks donated the same amount of money to the party, but the money ended up being used for something else. CA denies doing any paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU. ""Eldon shared no data with anyone and to suggest they did is again another lie to attack Arron Banks and Leave.EU directly,"" a Leave.EU spokesperson said.

Mr Wigmore said ""it was a conversation not a statement of facts"". He is also heard discussing contacts with Cambridge Analytica. Mr Wigmore was talking to university lecturer Emma Briant for an upcoming book on the Trump campaign. He told Ms Briant ""the only way"" Leave.EU would be successful was to ""follow the Trump doctrine"". ""The more outrageous we are, the more attention we'll get, and the more attention we get, the more outrageous we'll be,"" said Mr Wigmore. Mr Wigmore admitted that campaigners were concerned they would be blamed for creating ""a wave of hatred and racism"". He told Ms Briant: ""The propaganda machine of the Nazis, for instance - you take away all the hideous horror and that kind of stuff, it was very clever, the way they managed to do what they did. ""In its pure marketing sense, you can see the logic of what they were saying, why they were saying it, and how they presented things, and the imagery. ""Having been on the sharp end of this campaign, you think: crikey, this is not new, and it's just ... using the tools that you have at the time."" Mr Wigmore has since said his comments on Nazism were in a ""historical context around the Remain campaign's project fear and how propaganda has been used in the context of social media"". Ms Briant also spoke to the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL Group, Nigel Oakes. Mr Oakes told her that Mr Trump ""leveraged an artificial enemy"" in the shape of the Muslims. ""Hitler attacked the Jews. He didn't have a problem with the Jews at all, but the people didn't like the Jews and so he just leveraged an artificial enemy... that's exactly what Trump did.

Will technology destroy our democracy?,"This video can not be played Could the spread of social media and digital technology undermine democracy? Jamie Bartlett, the author of The People versus Tech, believes it could. He argues there is a compatibility problem between democracy and technology. Institutions and regulations - like a free press, an informed citizenry, rules about election advertising - keep democracy working. All voters get the same facts and messages. But big data analysis will enable politicians to target voters individually with highly targeted messaging that regulators canât easily see, exploiting people's psychological vulnerabilities.

Actress kidnapped by North Korea dies,"Ms Choi was one of South Korea's most famous actresses during the peak of her popularity A South Korean actress, once kidnapped by North Korea and forced to make films for the state, has died at 91. Choi Eun-hee was a leading actress in the South when she was kidnapped on the orders of then leader-in-waiting Kim Jong-il in the late 1970s. Her ex-husband, a famous film director, was also abducted several months later. The duo later escaped. North Korea has always denied abducting the couple, saying they had sought sanctuary there. Ms Choi died on Monday afternoon in hospital in South Korea. ""My mother passed when she went to hospital for kidney dialysis this afternoon,""Ms Choi's eldest son, director Shin Jeong-gyun, told news outlet Yonhap.,external Born in November 1926 in South Korea's Gyeonggi province, Ms Choi began her film career in 1947. Kidnapped by North Korea - and forced to make films Ten things about North Korea's film industry What's behind North Korea's surge of friendly visitors? She and her then-husband Shin Sang-ok eventually rose to be among South Korea's most celebrated film directors and stars. This still of Ms Choi and Mr Shin is taken from a film about the couple, titled ""The Lovers and the Despot"" But by the late 1970s, the couple had divorced and Choi's career had hit a downturn. It was during that time that Choi was approached by someone posing as a Hong Kong businessman with a proposal to form a film-making company which would revive her fortunes. According to a book ""A Kim Jong-il Production"", she was persuaded to go to Hong Kong.Once in Hong Kong, she was grabbed and sedated by a group of men. Eight days later she was in Pyongyang in a luxurious villa that was constantly guarded. Despite being divorced, Mr Shin and his ex-wife had remained close and he went to Hong Kong to look for her. He too was later abducted. Mr Shin and Ms Choi are shown here with Kim Jong-il (centre) The late Mr Kim, who ruled North Korea from his father's death in 1994 until his own in 2011, was said to be a great film buff, and an avid watcher of Hollywood movies. He had hoped that the couple's presence in the North could help their film industry compete on the international stage. After eight years, the couple won Mr Kim's trust and were allowed to travel to Vienna to promote their films. While in Vienna, the duo sought political asylum at the US embassy. They returned to South Korea years later and Mr Shin died in 2006. The outlandish tale has gone on to grip audiences across the globe. In 2016, a film titled ""The Lovers and the Despot"" premiered, following the life of the couple as they were kidnapped and taken to North Korea.

Pound remains close to post-Brexit high,"The pound has hit its highest level since the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016. The pound gained more than 0.2% to $1.437 in morning trade, beating a post-Brexit vote high set in January. However, the pound fell back slightly followingofficial employment datashowing that wage growth continued to lag one key measure of inflation. Sterling has been boosted by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates. Dollar weakness after uncertainty about US trade policy has also been a contributory factor, traders said. The pound sank in June 2016 after the Brexit vote, hitting $1.2068 in January of last year. But since the beginning of 2017, it has started to recover. Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon, said the main reasons for the pound's comeback against the dollar since the start of 2017 had been expectations about UK rate rises and increasing optimism over the Brexit process. In November 2017, the Bank of England put up interest ratesfor the first time in 10 years, and in February the Bank hinted at an increased pace of rate hikes. Most analysts expect it to raise interest rates again in May. ""Momentum is a huge factor,"" Mr Derrick said. ""There's a lot of optimism around sterling."" There are certain elements about sterling's performance that ""make me scratch my head"", Mr Derrick said. The market is pricing in the best possible outcome from Brexit, with an orderly transition, whereas ""all sorts of different outcomes could emerge"", he said. For example, he said, it was still not clear how the issue of the Northern Ireland border would be resolved. He added that the dollar's weakness might also be short-lived. British holidaymakers could find their pound stretches further, but conversely, tourists may not find the UK quite so attractive. Tourism, which contributes billions to the UK economy, boomed in 2017 after the fall in the pound.Many Britons also chose to holiday at home. Exporters also may not benefit from a stronger pound. The amount ofgoods exportedby the UK manufacturing sector rose sharply after the referendum, with growth hitting a peak of 9.7% in March 2017. However, companies which import goods or services tend to benefit from a stronger pound, because it makes the items they buy cheaper. The pound fell sharply against the euro following the referendum and has not been back above â¬1.20 since. In 2015, the European Central Bank launched a massive stimulus programme designed to counter deflation and revitalise the economy after the financial crisis. The euro strengthened in 2017 on the back of an improving eurozone economy and predictions that the ECB could start to scale back its bond-buying programme.

"Facebook facial recognition faces lawsuitDamages could amount to ""billions of dollars"", the judge says.7h7 hours agoTechnology","Facebook must face a class action lawsuit over its use of facial recognition technology, a California judge has ruled. The lawsuit alleges that Facebook gathered biometric information without users' explicit consent. It involves the ""tag suggestions"" technology, which spots users' friends in uploaded photos. The lawsuit says this breaches Illinois state law. Facebook said the case had no merit and it would fight it vigorously. However in his order, US District Judge James Donato wrote that Facebook seemed to believe individual lawsuits would be preferable to a class action ""because statutory damages could amount to billions of dollars"". On Monday, Judge Donato ruled to certify a class of Facebook users - a key legal hurdle for a class action suit. In a successful class action suit, any person in that group could be entitled to compensation. The class of people in question is made up of Facebook users ""in Illinois for whom Facebook created and stored a face template after 7 June 2011,"" according to the court order. The decision comes days after Facebook chief executiveMark Zuckerberg faced intensive questioning by US lawmakersover the company's collection and use of user data. He is also due to meet European Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip in San Francisco this week, reports Bloomberg. Zuckerberg: I'm still the man to run Facebook Facebook chief's data was harvested June 2011 was the date on which Facebook rolled out its ""tag suggestions"" feature. The feature suggests who might be present in uploaded photos, based on an existing database of faces. In Judge Donato's ruling, he laid out the four-step process behind the technology: Initially, the software tries to detectanyfaces in an uploaded photo It standardises and aligns them for size and direction Then, for each face, Facebook computes a facesignature- a mathematical representation of the face in that photo Face signatures are then run through a stored database of user facetemplatesto look for similar matches The tag suggestions feature is not currently available in the UK On its help pages, Facebook says the face templates,externalare made from information about the similarities in every photo the user has been tagged in. ""If you've never been tagged in a photo on Facebook or have untagged yourself in all photos of you on Facebook, then we do not have this summary information for you,"" the company says. The feature is not available to users in most countries, including the UK - and can be turned off in settings for US users. In December 2017 Facebook announced that userswould be notified if a picture of them was uploaded by someone else, even if they hadn't been tagged in it. Due to privacy regulations, this feature would not be available in Europe or Canada, the firm said at the time.

Leave.EU figure praised Nazi tacticsAn inquiry publishes recordings of a Leave.EU figure appearing to compare its Brexit campaign to the Nazis.9m10 minutes agoUK Politics,"Brittany Kaiser, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, has been giving evidence to a parliamentary committee Misuse of data was ""rife"" among the businesses and campaigns of Leave.EU chairman and ex-UKIP donor Arron Banks, a former Cambridge Analytica (CA) employee has told MPs. Brittany Kaiser said Mr Banks asked the consultancy firm for a joint strategy for Leave.EU, UKIP and Eldon Insurance. Ms Kaiser said CA ""took receipt"" of UKIP's membership data as part of this. Leave.EU refutes Ms Kaiser's statements and CA said it has never received data from any Arron Banks company. Ms Kaiser was giving evidence to the House of Commons' digital, culture, media and sport committee, which is conducting an inquiry into fake news. Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting of personal Facebook data and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US presidential election and Brexit referendum. Meanwhile, committee chair Damian Collins has said there is no legal reason for the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, to not attend the inquiry on Wednesday. Mr Collins said representatives for Mr Nix had said he would miss the hearing as he was ""subject to a criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner's office"". Facebook suspends Brexit data firm How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded Chris Wylie: 'I want a democratic mandate for Brexit' Leave.EU was fronted by then UKIP leader Nigel Farage and funded by millionaire Mr Banks, but failed in its bid to be named the official Brexit campaign group. It denies that Cambridge Analytica undertook any work for the campaign. But Ms Kaiser says she pitched them a detailed strategy. ""Arron Banks asked us to design a strategy where we could work with Leave.EU, UKIP and Eldon Insurance together"", she told MPs. Ms Kaiser said she saw data from Eldon Insurance - which is owned by Mr Banks and carries out claims for Go Skippy - used by the Leave.EU with her ""own eyes"". She said that as Leave.EU had little data when they first met, CA ""took receipt"" of UKIP's membership and survey data to create a model for Leave.EU communications. A UKIP spokesman told the BBC they had asked CA to make a bid, ""showed them a sample of data"" and then said ""thanks, but no thanks"", adding that the party's ""root data wasn't very good"". ""We submitted a contract for Â£41,500 for phase one,"" said Ms Kaiser, referring to the preliminary work she says was undertaken by CA. She said this work was not  reported to the Electoral Commission and never paid for. ""We never had a contract with Leave.EU, the contract was with the UK Independence Party for the analysis of this data but it was meant to benefit Leave.EU,"" she added. ""Normally you don't charge for a bid,"" UKIP told the BBC, adding that ""in case we wanted the work"" Mr Banks donated the same amount of money to the party, but the money ended up being used for something else. CA denies doing any paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU. ""Eldon shared no data with anyone and to suggest they did is again another lie to attack Arron Banks and Leave.EU directly,"" a Leave.EU spokesperson said. Brittany Kaiser (far right) of Cambridge Analytica sits alongside Brexit campaigner Aaron Banks during a Leave.EU news conference in 2015 Meanwhile, Leave.EU's Andy Wigmore has been recorded appearing to compare the tactics it used to keep immigration at the top of the referendum debate to the ""clever"" techniques of the Nazis. Mr Wigmore said ""it was a conversation not a statement of facts"". He is also heard discussing contacts with Cambridge Analytica. Mr Wigmore was talking to university lecturer Emma Briant for an upcoming book on the Trump campaign. He told Ms Briant ""the only way"" Leave.EU would be successful was to ""follow the Trump doctrine"". ""The more outrageous we are, the more attention we'll get, and the more attention we get, the more outrageous we'll be,"" said Mr Wigmore. Mr Wigmore admitted that campaigners were concerned they would be blamed for creating ""a wave of hatred and racism"". He told Ms Briant: ""The propaganda machine of the Nazis, for instance - you take away all the hideous horror and that kind of stuff, it was very clever, the way they managed to do what they did. ""In its pure marketing sense, you can see the logic of what they were saying, why they were saying it, and how they presented things, and the imagery. ""Having been on the sharp end of this campaign, you think: crikey, this is not new, and it's just ... using the tools that you have at the time."" Mr Wigmore has since said his comments on Nazism were in a ""historical context around the Remain campaign's project fear and how propaganda has been used in the context of social media"". Ms Briant also spoke to the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL Group, Nigel Oakes. Mr Oakes told her that Mr Trump ""leveraged an artificial enemy"" in the shape of the Muslims. ""Hitler attacked the Jews. He didn't have a problem with the Jews at all, but the people didn't like the Jews and so he just leveraged an artificial enemy... that's exactly what Trump did. He leveraged Muslims,"" Mr Oakes told Ms Briant. This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded Ms Briant said she was ""shocked"" Nazism had come up in the two interviews and felt a ""moral obligation"" to share the recordings. A CA spokesperson said Mr Oakes was speaking in ""a personal capacity about the historical use of propaganda"" and ""has never worked for Cambridge Analytica and did not work on the Trump campaign in any way"". But Mr Collins said the recordings made clear that Leave.EU benefited from their work with CA and the campaign had questions to answer about how it developed its database. ""We're very interested to understand more about this work Cambridge Analytica did for Leave.EU. Leave.EU may not have paid for that themselves but nevertheless a huge amount of work was done which, I believe, they benefited from,"" Mr Collins told Today.

May urged to fix Windrush issue quickly,"This video can not be played Theresa May's Windrush apology to Caribbean leaders Prime Minister Theresa May has apologised to Caribbean leaders over the Windrush generation controversy, at a Downing Street meeting. She said she was ""genuinely sorry"" about the anxiety caused by the Home Office threatening the children of Commonwealth citizens with deportation. The UK government ""valued"" the contribution they had made, she said, and they had a right to stay in the UK. It comes amid reports some are still facing deportation. The deportation of one man, which had been due to take place on Wednesday, has been halted following an intervention by Labour MP David Lammy. The Tottenham MP said the mother of 35-year-old Mozi Haynes got in touch saying her son was due to be removed from the country after two failed applications to stay. Who are the Windrush generation? 'A nightmare, and it's not over yet' Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? UK makes Commonwealth education aid pledge Mr Lammy later tweeted that he had been contacted by Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes, who had said that Mr Haynes would not now be deported on Wednesday and his case was ""being reviewed"". The Tottenham MP, who has called the controversy a ""national disgrace,"" urged the children of the Windrush generation facing deportation to contact him, promising ""justice will be done"". Mr Lammy said that of 12,056 deportations in 2015, 901 were over 50 years of age. and 303 were to Jamaica. He is calling on the Home Office to review all such cases since 2014 to ""ensure no wrongful detentions have taken place"". The Home Office said it was making efforts to speak to Mr Haynes to advise him that there is no requirement for him to leave the UK. Officials say it is not a Windrush case and was never an ""enforced removal"". The department said it was looking at 49 cases relating to Windrush migrants as a result of calls received on Tuesday. A former Home Office employee has, meanwhile,told The Guardian,externalthat thousands of landing card slips recording Windrush immigrants' arrival dates in the UK were destroyed in 2010 during an office move. The former worker, who is not named by the newspaper, said managers were warned by staff that destroying the cards would make it harder to check the records of older Caribbean-born residents experiencing difficulties proving their right to remain in the UK. In Pictures: The Windrush generation Windrush peers attack Home Office The government said the decision to ""dispose of"" the cards had been an ""operational"" one, taken by officials at the UK Border Agency, rather than the then Home Secretary Theresa May. A Home Office spokesman said: ""Registration slips provided details of an individual's date of entry, they did not provide any reliable evidence relating to ongoing residence in the UK or their immigration status. ""So it would be misleading and inaccurate to suggest that registration slips would therefore have a bearing on immigration cases whereby Commonwealth citizens are proving residency in the UK."" The prime minister's spokesman said things like school records, exam certificates, employment records and bills were seen by the Home Office as ""more reliable evidence of ongoing residence"". In her apology to Caribbean leaders, Theresa May said she wanted to ""dispel any impression that my government is in some sense clamping down on Commonwealth citizens, particularly those from the Caribbean who have built a life here"". She said the current controversy had arisen because of new rules, introduced by her as home secretary, designed to make sure only those with the right to remain in the UK could access the welfare system and the NHS. ""This has resulted in some people, through no fault of their own, now needing to be able to evidence their immigration status,"" she told the foreign ministers and leaders of 12 Caribbean nations in Downing Street. ""And the overwhelming majority of the Windrush generation do have the documents that they need, but we are working hard to help those who do not."" This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK The PM added: ""Those who arrived from the Caribbean before 1973 and lived here permanently without significant periods of time away in the last 30 years have the right to remain in the UK. ""As do the vast majority of long-term residents who arrived later, and I don't want anybody to be in any doubt about their right to remain here in the United Kingdom."" A new taskforce and helpline has been established for those people who arrived from the Commonwealth decades ago as children but were now being incorrectly identified as illegal immigrants. Mrs May said people involved in the process of establishing their status should not be ""left out of pocket"" as a result and would not have to pay for documentation. Cases have emerged -such as these in the Guardian,external- of people who have lost their jobs, rights to health and benefits and faced deportation despite being able to show they have paid tax and National Insurance for decades. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness said he had accepted Theresa May's apology, adding: ""I believe that the right thing is being done at this time."" He said he did not know how many people had been affected by the controversy, but it was ""at least"" in the hundreds. Asked if Mrs May was to blame for the situation, he said: ""I can't answer that question. The truth is that she has said there has been a policy change, that this was an unintended consequence. ""As Caribbean leaders we have to accept that in good faith."" He added that Mrs May had not been able to say ""definitively"" that nobody had been deported as a result of issues with paperwork. Andrew Holness said he had accepted Mrs May's apology Timothy Harris, prime minister of St Kitts and Nevis, said: ""We see this basically as the start of the dialogue, as evidence is uncovered which requires correction."" He said he hoped the British government would ""make good any injustice"" suffered by individuals, including by offering compensation. Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, also backed compensation for those affected and told BBC News there should be ""reprisals for those who dropped the ball"" in the UK government. Thousands of people arrived in the UK as children in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration 70 years ago, often on their parents' passports. They are known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the ship, the Empire Windrush, that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. Under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. However, the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for the individuals to now prove they are in the UK legally. Changes to immigration law in 2012, which require people to have documentation to work, rent a property or access benefits, including healthcare, have highlighted the issue and left people fearful about their status.

UK makes Commonwealth education aid pledgeTheresa May tells Commonwealth leaders children should spend at least 12 years in education.2m3 minutes agoUK Politics,"Theresa May has called for ""concrete measures"" to ensure girls in Commonwealth countries spend at least 12 years in education. The prime minister pledged Â£212m, which Downing Street said would allow almost one million more girls to go to school. Too often they were forced out by ""discrimination, poverty, or simply the expectations of society"", she said. It comes as Commonwealth leaders gather in London for their summit, which is held every two years. Landale: What next for the Commonwealth? May to meet leaders after Windrush apology Formerly known as the British Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Nations is a loose association of former British colonies and current dependencies, along with some countries that have no historical ties to Britain. Speaking to an audience including Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, Mrs May said international experts agreed young people need 12 years of quality education if they are to fulfil their potential. ""Across the Commonwealth, tens of millions of young people - usually, but not always, girls - are denied the education that would allow them to get on in life. ""All too often, young people receive only the most basic education before being forced out of school through discrimination, poverty or simply the expectations of society."" Announcing the Â£212m from the foreign aid budget, she urged Commonwealth nations to agree to the 12-year goal, calling for ""concrete measures that will allow it to become a reality"". She also focused on the fight against malaria, saying the Commonwealth has a ""particular duty"" to tackle the disease. ""We cannot, in good conscience, talk about the young people of the world, about securing a legacy for our children and grandchildren, without tackling a disease that, worldwide, kills one of them every two minutes,"" she said. The flags of Commonwealth nations are flying at Westminster ahead of the summit Mrs May also said the UK would support any Commonwealth nation seeking to reform ""outdated"" legislation which criminalised same-sex relationships or failed to protect women and girls. ""As a family of nations we must respect one another's cultures and traditions but we must do so in a manner consistent with our common value of equality - a value that is clearly stated in the Commonwealth Charter. ""Nobody should face discrimination or persecution because of who they are or who they love and the UK stands ready to help any Commonwealth member wanting to reform outdated legislation that makes such discrimination possible."" The prime minister also used her speech to urge the Commonwealth to work together to combat cyber threats to security. ""I look forward to all our members agreeing a new cyber declaration. A powerful statement of intent, it will ensure that the internet remains free and open across the Commonwealth. ""It will help protect our people and our businesses from ever more sophisticated digital threats. And it will do much to counter those who would abuse the freedom of the internet to undermine our values, our security, even our democracies.""

Recycling hope for plastic-hungry enzymeScience created a 'wonder material' in plastic; now nature is helping to unmake it.,"Scientists have improved a naturally occurring enzyme which can digest some of our most commonly polluting plastics. PET, the strong plastic commonly used in bottles, takes hundreds of years to break down in the environment. The modified enzyme, known as PETase, can start breaking down the same material in just a few days. This could revolutionise the recycling process, allowing plastics to be re-used more effectively. UK consumers use around 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year but more than three billion are not recycled. Five ways to break up with plastic Could plant-based plastics help tackle pollution? Ocean plastic could triple within a decade Originally discovered in Japan, the enzyme is produced by a bacterium which ""eats"" PET. Ideonella sakaiensisuses the plastic as its major energy source. Researchersreported in 2016,externalthat they had found the strain living in sediments at a bottle recycling site in the port city of Sakai. PET is commonly used to make plastic bottles ""[PET] has only been around in vast quantities over the last 50 years, so it's actually not a very long timescale for a bacteria to have evolved to eat something so man-made,"" commented Prof John McGeehan, who was involved in the current study. Polyesters, the group of plastics that PET (also called polyethylene terephthalate) belongs to, do occur in nature. ""They protect plant leaves,"" explained the University of Portsmouth researcher. ""Bacteria have been evolving for millions of years to eat that."" The switch to PET was nevertheless ""quite unexpected"" and an international team of scientists set out to determine how the PETase enzyme had evolved. A high definition 3D model of the enzyme was created, using the powerful x-ray beamline at Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire. Once they understood its structure, the team noted that they could improve the performance of PETase by adjusting a few residues on its surface. The detailed model of PETase allowed researchers to see how the enzyme could be improved This suggests that the natural enzyme isn't fully optimized yet and there is the potential to engineer it. PETase was also tested on PEF plastic, a proposed plant-based alternative to PET that is similarly slow to degrade in nature. ""We were absolutely stunned when we did that experiment because it actually works better on PEF than PET,"" Prof McGeehan told BBC News. by David Shukman, Science Editor The team behind the research at Portsmouth University includes PhD students and even undergraduates, and when I visited their lab their excitement was infectious. They know that it took clever chemistry to design the PET polymer used in so many billions of bottles and they are delighted to have helped find a way to unpick it. They have grown up with the scourge of plastic pollution and feel highly motivated about trying to tackle it. Yet big challenges lie ahead in turning an ingenious discovery into a real-world application. Developing a technique for producing the enzyme cheaply will be one key hurdle; another will be to harness its power on an industrial scale. But this is an example of accelerated science. A type of bacteria evolved to live off plastic in the last few decades. The enzyme it uses to digest PET was only recently identified. Now we have details of the newly engineered and more efficient version of that enzyme. In the search for scientific solutions to the plastic pollution crisis, momentum like this is vital. Polyesters, industrially produced from petroleum, are widely used in plastic bottles and clothing. Current recycling processes mean that polyester materials follow a downward quality spiral, losing some of their properties each time they go through the cycle. Bottles become fleeces, then carpets, after which they often end up in landfill. PETase reverses the manufacturing process, reducing polyesters to their building blocks, ready to be used again. This video can not be played Engineered PETase was shown to begin breaking down polyesters within a few days ""They could be used to make more plastic and that would avoid using any more oil...Then basically we'd close the loop. We'd actually have proper recycling,"" explained Prof McGeehan. The enzyme is a number of years away from being deployed on a widespread scale. It will need to degrade PET faster than its current time of a few days before becoming economically viable as part of the recycling landscape. Prof McGeehan is hopeful that this marks the beginning of a shift in the management of plastics. ""There is an urgent need to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfill and the environment, and I think if we can adopt these technologies we actually have a potential solution in the future to doing that"" he added.

Wage growth fails to overtake inflation,"The year-long squeeze on wages is nearing an end, official figures for the three months to February suggest. Using the consumer prices index (CPI) average wages went up by 2.8%, still below the 2.9% inflation rate. But the Office for National Statistics said,externalwhen wages are compared with their new measure of inflation, including housing costs (CPIH), average weekly earnings rose by 0.2% year-on-year. Inflation started to overtake wages in February last year, squeezing incomes. Meanwhile, unemployment in the latest three-month period fell by 16,000 to 1.42 million, with the 4.2% unemployment rate the lowest since the three months to May 1975. The Bank of England has said it expects the fall in unemployment to start pushing up pay more quickly, which is the main reason why it has said it is likely to raise interest rates more quickly than it previously thought. The number of people in work has reached a record high of 32.2 million. The strength or otherwise of people's incomes is one of the most important drivers of our economy. Not only is it of obvious importance to people individually - if each year I feel a little richer I tend to have a more positive outlook on life - but it is also the engine at the heart of our country's growth. Household consumption accounts for about 60% of the value of the UK economy. We are not just a nation of shopkeepers, we are a nation of shoppers. If consumers are on average worse off - as they have been for the last year - then spending levels are put under pressure and economic activity slows. That means we are producing less wealth, less tax income and less money for spending on things like the health service. Tuesday's better news on incomes - month-on-month wages are now rising faster than prices - does not mean the good times are suddenly back. On the more reliable three-month measure, December and February wages still rose less quickly than inflation. And for many millions of people the last decade of anaemic incomes growth has left wages pretty much where they were in 2007. And we haven't seen figures that miserable since Queen Victoria was on the throne. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said: ""Another milestone for employment has been reached under this government as employment reaches a record high, up 3.2 million since 2010 - the 16th time the employment record has been broken in the same period. ""Day-by-day we are helping people turn their lives around by getting into employment. Jobs are key to transforming lives and work is the best route out of poverty."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Unions have negotiated pay rises for workers across the UK, from the counters at McDonald's to the factory floor at Ford. ""But wage growth is still weak. Workers are Â£14 a week worse off than they were in 2007 - with pay packets not expected to return to their pre-crisis level until 2025."" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The continued rise in employment, coupled with a further drop in the unemployment rate, is further evidence that the UK jobs market remains in good shape, with firms continuing to recruit despite sluggish economic conditions. However, Mr Thiru said spending was unlikely to increase with ""consumers expected to remain under pressure from uncomfortably high debt levels, particularly if interest rates rise further."" Meanwhile, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, does not think the figures mean an interest rate rise in May is a certainty. He tweeted that,externalthe figures ""place little pressure on the MPS to hike next month"". However, Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, disagrees. ""The figures reinforce expectations the Bank of England will lift interest rates at its May policy meeting. Markets are now pricing in an 85% chance of a rate rise,"" he said.

Warning on 'inflated' World Cup tickets,"Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium will host the first game of the FIFA World Cup 2018 Football fans risk paying inflated prices for World Cup tickets that might not be valid if they use secondary ticketing sites, Which? has warned. The consumer group found tickets for the England vs Tunisia match priced as high as Â£11,237. Football's governing body Fifa has warned it can void any ticket purchased on an unauthorised ticketing website. In March Which? found five ticketing websites including Stubhub and Ticombo that were selling World Cup tickets. Stubhub said tickets had appeared on its UK website due to a ""technical error"" and there were no World Cup tickets currently available. ""StubHub fully complies with applicable laws. Therefore, we do not allow the resale of World Cup tickets on Stubhub.co.uk,"" a spokesperson said. However, Ticombo said it was not breaking the law by trading tickets and neither were fans. ""If Fifa has a problem with fans wishing to sell their ticket to a third party, it has a problem not with Ticombo, but with the free market itself,"" it said. The 2018 Fifa World Cup kicks off at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow on 14 June. The final round of ticket sales by FIFA starts on 18 April. More details can be found on its website.,external Fifa says that strict admission checks will be made on tickets during the tournament and fans will need to have a special identification document to be able to enter the stadiums. Which? urges fans to only buy tickets from authorised sellers. ""Football fans need to be aware that if they buy a World Cup ticket from an unofficial source, they risk paying inflated prices and potentially not getting into the game at all,"" said Alex Neill from Which?. ""If you don't want to risk watching the World Cup from the sidelines, you should only buy from the official Fifa reselling website,"" he advised.

""Bacteria have been evolving for millions of years to eat that."" The switch to PET was nevertheless ""quite unexpected"" and an international team of scientists set out to determine how the PETase enzyme had evolved. A high definition 3D model of the enzyme was created, using the powerful x-ray beamline at Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire. Once they understood its structure, the team noted that they could improve the performance of PETase by adjusting a few residues on its surface. The detailed model of PETase allowed researchers to see how the enzyme could be improved This suggests that the natural enzyme isn't fully optimized yet and there is the potential to engineer it. PETase was also tested on PEF plastic, a proposed plant-based alternative to PET that is similarly slow to degrade in nature. ""We were absolutely stunned when we did that experiment because it actually works better on PEF than PET,"" Prof McGeehan told BBC News. by David Shukman, Science Editor The team behind the research at Portsmouth University includes PhD students and even undergraduates, and when I visited their lab their excitement was infectious. They know that it took clever chemistry to design the PET polymer used in so many billions of bottles and they are delighted to have helped find a way to unpick it. They have grown up with the scourge of plastic pollution and feel highly motivated about trying to tackle it. Yet big challenges lie ahead in turning an ingenious discovery into a real-world application. Developing a technique for producing the enzyme cheaply will be one key hurdle; another will be to harness its power on an industrial scale. But this is an example of accelerated science. A type of bacteria evolved to live off plastic in the last few decades. The enzyme it uses to digest PET was only recently identified. Now we have details of the newly engineered and more efficient version of that enzyme. In the search for scientific solutions to the plastic pollution crisis, momentum like this is vital. Polyesters, industrially produced from petroleum, are widely used in plastic bottles and clothing. Current recycling processes mean that polyester materials follow a downward quality spiral, losing some of their properties each time they go through the cycle. Bottles become fleeces, then carpets, after which they often end up in landfill. PETase reverses the manufacturing process, reducing polyesters to their building blocks, ready to be used again. This video can not be played Engineered PETase was shown to begin breaking down polyesters within a few days ""They could be used to make more plastic and that would avoid using any more oil...Then basically we'd close the loop. We'd actually have proper recycling,"" explained Prof McGeehan. The enzyme is a number of years away from being deployed on a widespread scale. It will need to degrade PET faster than its current time of a few days before becoming economically viable as part of the recycling landscape. Prof McGeehan is hopeful that this marks the beginning of a shift in the management of plastics. ""There is an urgent need to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfill and the environment, and I think if we can adopt these technologies we actually have a potential solution in the future to doing that"" he added.

Pound climbs to highest since Brexit vote,"The pound has hit its highest level since the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016. The pound gained more than 0.2% to $1.437 in morning trade, beating a post-Brexit vote high set in January. However, the pound fell back slightly followingofficial employment datashowing that wage growth continued to lag one key measure of inflation. Sterling has been boosted by expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates. Dollar weakness after uncertainty about US trade policy has also been a contributory factor, traders said. The pound sank in June 2016 after the Brexit vote, hitting $1.2068 in January of last year. But since the beginning of 2017, it has started to recover. Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon, said the main reasons for the pound's comeback against the dollar since the start of 2017 had been expectations about UK rate rises and increasing optimism over the Brexit process. In November 2017, the Bank of England put up interest ratesfor the first time in 10 years, and in February the Bank hinted at an increased pace of rate hikes. Most analysts expect it to raise interest rates again in May. ""Momentum is a huge factor,"" Mr Derrick said. ""There's a lot of optimism around sterling."" There are certain elements about sterling's performance that ""make me scratch my head"", Mr Derrick said. The market is pricing in the best possible outcome from Brexit, with an orderly transition, whereas ""all sorts of different outcomes could emerge"", he said. For example, he said, it was still not clear how the issue of the Northern Ireland border would be resolved. He added that the dollar's weakness might also be short-lived. British holidaymakers could find their pound stretches further, but conversely, tourists may not find the UK quite so attractive. Tourism, which contributes billions to the UK economy, boomed in 2017 after the fall in the pound.Many Britons also chose to holiday at home. Exporters also may not benefit from a stronger pound. The amount ofgoods exportedby the UK manufacturing sector rose sharply after the referendum, with growth hitting a peak of 9.7% in March 2017. However, companies which import goods or services tend to benefit from a stronger pound, because it makes the items they buy cheaper. The pound fell sharply against the euro following the referendum and has not been back above â¬1.20 since. In 2015, the European Central Bank launched a massive stimulus programme designed to counter deflation and revitalise the economy after the financial crisis. The euro strengthened in 2017 on the back of an improving eurozone economy and predictions that the ECB could start to scale back its bond-buying programme.

Pound powers ahead against the dollar,"The pound has continued its recent strong run against the dollar pushing firmly above $1.43. It is the seventh session in a row that the pound has made gains against the US currency. The strong run means that, among the G10 group of rich nations, the UK has the best-performing currency this year. Traders say the prospect of higher UK interest rates has made the pound more attractive while the dollar has been hit by fears of trade disputes. The pound started the week with a gain ofalmost a cent to $1.4323, whileagainst the euroit was 0.2% higher at â¬1.1569. Following the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 the pound sank, hitting $1.2068 in January of last year. Since then it has made a comeback. Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Rabobank, said the recent strong run can be dated back to September 2017 when it became clear the Bank of England was ready to raise interest rates. In November, the Bank increased the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade - from 0.25% to 0.5%. And in February the pound's momentumwas maintained when the Bank hinted at an accelerated pace of interest rate increases. Most analysts expect it to raise interest rates again in May. According to Ms Foley, any indication about what happens to interest rates after that is the key to the pound's next move. Some clues may come from some important economic data this week. On Tuesday the latest UK unemployment and wage data is released and Wednesday brings the latest inflation figures. Ms Foley said Tuesday's data on earnings growth should be the ""most interesting"", as weak wage growth has been one reason why the Bank of England has been slow to raise rates. If the data remains weak then the Bank may not feel pressure to make another rate increase after May, she said. Another big factor governing the pound's progress is the progress of Brexit talks. Trade negotiations start again this week and will be closely monitored. If those talks go badly then the pound could be undermined.

Which? warns on World Cup tickets,"Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium will host the first game of the FIFA World Cup 2018 Football fans risk paying inflated prices for World Cup tickets that might not be valid if they use secondary ticketing sites, Which? has warned. The consumer group found tickets for the England vs Tunisia match priced as high as Â£11,237. Football's governing body Fifa has warned it can void any ticket purchased on an unauthorised ticketing website. In March Which? found five ticketing websites including Stubhub and Ticombo that were selling World Cup tickets. Stubhub said tickets had appeared on its UK website due to a ""technical error"" and there were no World Cup tickets currently available. ""StubHub fully complies with applicable laws. Therefore, we do not allow the resale of World Cup tickets on Stubhub.co.uk,"" a spokesperson said. However, Ticombo said it was not breaking the law by trading tickets and neither were fans. ""If Fifa has a problem with fans wishing to sell their ticket to a third party, it has a problem not with Ticombo, but with the free market itself,"" it said. The 2018 Fifa World Cup kicks off at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow on 14 June. The final round of ticket sales by FIFA starts on 18 April. More details can be found on its website.,external Fifa says that strict admission checks will be made on tickets during the tournament and fans will need to have a special identification document to be able to enter the stadiums. Which? urges fans to only buy tickets from authorised sellers. ""Football fans need to be aware that if they buy a World Cup ticket from an unofficial source, they risk paying inflated prices and potentially not getting into the game at all,"" said Alex Neill from Which?.

Actress kidnapped by North Korea dies at 92,"Ms Choi was one of South Korea's most famous actresses during the peak of her popularity A South Korean actress, once kidnapped by North Korea and forced to make films for the state, has died at 91. Choi Eun-hee was a leading actress in the South when she was kidnapped on the orders of then leader-in-waiting Kim Jong-il in the late 1970s. Her ex-husband, a famous film director, was also abducted several months later. The duo later escaped. North Korea has always denied abducting the couple, saying they had sought sanctuary there. Ms Choi died on Monday afternoon in hospital in South Korea. ""My mother passed when she went to hospital for kidney dialysis this afternoon,""Ms Choi's eldest son, director Shin Jeong-gyun, told news outlet Yonhap.,external Born in November 1926 in South Korea's Gyeonggi province, Ms Choi began her film career in 1947. Kidnapped by North Korea - and forced to make films Ten things about North Korea's film industry What's behind North Korea's surge of friendly visitors? She and her then-husband Shin Sang-ok eventually rose to be among South Korea's most celebrated film directors and stars. This still of Ms Choi and Mr Shin is taken from a film about the couple, titled ""The Lovers and the Despot"" But by the late 1970s, the couple had divorced and Choi's career had hit a downturn. It was during that time that Choi was approached by someone posing as a Hong Kong businessman with a proposal to form a film-making company which would revive her fortunes. According to a book ""A Kim Jong-il Production"", she was persuaded to go to Hong Kong.Once in Hong Kong, she was grabbed and sedated by a group of men. Eight days later she was in Pyongyang in a luxurious villa that was constantly guarded. Despite being divorced, Mr Shin and his ex-wife had remained close and he went to Hong Kong to look for her. He too was later abducted. Mr Shin and Ms Choi are shown here with Kim Jong-il (centre) The late Mr Kim, who ruled North Korea from his father's death in 1994 until his own in 2011, was said to be a great film buff, and an avid watcher of Hollywood movies. He had hoped that the couple's presence in the North could help their film industry compete on the international stage. After eight years, the couple won Mr Kim's trust and were allowed to travel to Vienna to promote their films. While in Vienna, the duo sought political asylum at the US embassy. They returned to South Korea years later and Mr Shin died in 2006. The outlandish tale has gone on to grip audiences across the globe. In 2016, a film titled ""The Lovers and the Despot"" premiered, following the life of the couple as they were kidnapped and taken to North Korea. Ms Choi's passing has been widely mourned across South Korea. ""I went to see her movie when I was in high school,"" said 82-year-old actress Um Aing-ran. ""After seeing her acting I decided to become an actress."" Other social media users also remembered her. ""You were such a beauty. You really had a rough life, you are gone now but your passion for acting will never be forgotten,"" said one user on Naver. ""I hope you reunited with Mr Shin and be happy."" ""We say there is no life without a story. But her life was so dramatic,"" said another Naver user. ""I [will] remember your elegance. Rest in peace.""

Delay for Nasa planet-hunterThe launch of the Tess mission to find new worlds beyond our Solar System is delayed by 48 hours.,"Tess's four-camera system will search about 85% of the sky during its primary mission The launch of Nasa's Tess planet-hunter has been postponed and it will not now lift off until Wednesday at the earliest. The telescope was due to go up from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 18:32 local time on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. But the flight was stood down some three hours before lift-off. SpaceX said it wanted some additional time to understand an issue related to the guidance, navigation and control of its vehicle. The company added that its teams were now working towards an 18 April launch at 18:51 EDT (2351 BST). The BBC understands that scientists on the mission also want a delay so they can run some extra checks on the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite itself. When Tess does get up, it will stare at stars for weeks at a time, hoping to catch the dips in brightness that occur when orbiting worlds traverse their faces. The expectation is that it could identify some 2,000-3,000 planets in its first two years of operation. The satellite, which carries four camera-detectors, will essentially compile a catalogue that other telescopes - both on the ground and in space - can then focus in on for more detailed analysis. ""Think of it as a phone book; you'll be able to look up the ones that interest you,"" said Sara Seager from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which leads the Tess project. ""But it's not just quantity; it's quality as well - because the planets we do find will be bright enough and close enough to Earth that we really can do follow-up measurements with them."" This video can not be played Sara Seager: ""Tess will orbit in a giant ellipse that goes far away from Earth"" Perhaps the key actor in this future study will be the successor to Hubble - the James Webb space observatory, due in orbit from 2020. It promises an ability to resolve the atmospheres of some of the new worlds, to look for gases that might hint at the presence of life. James Webb will ""tease out the chemical compositions of those atmospheres and look for whatever's there,"" said Paul Hertz, the astrophysics director at Nasa. ""People are very interested in looking for, what on Earth, are bio-signatures, such as methane, carbon dioxide, water vapour and oxygen."" Bill Chaplin is an astroseismologist from Birmingham University, UK. He is interested in the variations in brightness of the stars that will be observed by Tess. This variability is a consequence of resonances in the stars' outer layers, and it allows the British professor to pull out a lot of extra information. ""We can measure the stars' fundamental properties. We can say how massive they are and how old they are. In addition, we can form a picture of what the inside of a star looks like. So, in essence we can do the equivalent of an ultrasound scan on them.""

Facebook facial recognition to go on trial,"Facebook must face a class action lawsuit over its use of facial recognition technology, a California judge has ruled. The lawsuit alleges that Facebook gathered biometric information without users' explicit consent. It involves the ""tag suggestions"" technology, which spots users' friends in uploaded photos. The lawsuit says this breaches Illinois state law. Facebook said the case had no merit and it would fight it vigorously. However in his order, US District Judge James Donato wrote that Facebook seemed to believe individual lawsuits would be preferable to a class action ""because statutory damages could amount to billions of dollars"". On Monday, Judge Donato ruled to certify a class of Facebook users - a key legal hurdle for a class action suit. In a successful class action suit, any person in that group could be entitled to compensation. The class of people in question is made up of Facebook users ""in Illinois for whom Facebook created and stored a face template after 7 June 2011,"" according to the court order. The decision comes days after Facebook chief executiveMark Zuckerberg faced intensive questioning by US lawmakersover the company's collection and use of user data. He is also due to meet European Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip in San Francisco this week, reports Bloomberg. Zuckerberg: I'm still the man to run Facebook Facebook chief's data was harvested June 2011 was the date on which Facebook rolled out its ""tag suggestions"" feature. The feature suggests who might be present in uploaded photos, based on an existing database of faces. In Judge Donato's ruling, he laid out the four-step process behind the technology: Initially, the software tries to detectanyfaces in an uploaded photo It standardises and aligns them for size and direction Then, for each face, Facebook computes a facesignature- a mathematical representation of the face in that photo Face signatures are then run through a stored database of user facetemplatesto look for similar matches The tag suggestions feature is not currently available in the UK On its help pages, Facebook says the face templates,externalare made from information about the similarities in every photo the user has been tagged in. ""If you've never been tagged in a photo on Facebook or have untagged yourself in all photos of you on Facebook, then we do not have this summary information for you,"" the company says. The feature is not available to users in most countries, including the UK - and can be turned off in settings for US users. In December 2017 Facebook announced that userswould be notified if a picture of them was uploaded by someone else, even if they hadn't been tagged in it. Due to privacy regulations, this feature would not be available in Europe or Canada, the firm said at the time.

He also said he was ""thankful no-one was hurt"" in the three-car collision in Richmond, London, on 18 March. The court heard he had been more than twice the drink drive limit. In a letter read out in court, McPartlin also said he was ""ashamed and mortified"" and ""accepts full responsibility"" for what happened. McPartlin had a previous ""examplary character"", the judge said The fine is thought to be one of the largest handed down in a British court for a drink driving offence. The mother of the Britain's Got Talent and Saturday Night Takeaway presenter was in the passenger seat of his Mini at the time of the collision, the court heard. In a witness statement, the driver of one of the cars said he and his wife ""could have died as a result of Mr McPartlin's reckless driving"". In court, Ant McPartlin - wearing a dark three-piece suit and black tie - looked down and slowly nodded a number of times as he heard that he was being fined and given a 20-month disqualification from driving. Extracts from a statement that he had given the police included the words ""ashamed"", ""mortified"", ""sorrow"" and ""regret"". There was no Dec to support him in court. This was Ant alone, behind the glass of a witness box - the furthest from his TV persona that he had ever been seen in public. Outside court there were more apologies from McPartlin in a prepared statement and then a hasty exit into a waiting people carrier as shouted questions, not unexpectedly, went unanswered. Britain's Got Talent's pre-recorded audition shows mean that he will still be on Saturday night TV for the next two months. But his brief emergence at the top of the steps at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court could be his last live appearance for a long time. The court heard McPartlin had 75 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath when he was breathalysed - the legal limit is 35 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath. District Judge Barbara Barnes described McPartlin as a ""well-known and successful entertainer"", taking his weekly income of about Â£130,000 into consideration when calculating the fine. McPartlin said the court appearance was a ""turning point"" for him Sentencing him, the district judge said: ""At the time when it happened you were struggling with various personal problems and also alcohol issues for some months. ""This incident happened, sadly, when it seems you suffered a brief relapse."" She described McPartlin's previous ""exemplary character"", adding: ""I think it will have quite an impact on you to know you're no longer a man of good character."" She added: ""Because of the seriousness of this offence, the financial pain must be imposed on you as on any other offender."" McPartlin's driving ban can be reduced by five months, to a total of 15 months, if he completes a drink-drive referral programme by mid-May 2019. The judge said he was ""no longer a man of good character"" Prosecutor Katie Sinnett-Jones told the court the incident happened at around 3.50pm on 18 March on Lower Richmond Road. She said McPartlin was driving around a ""sharp bend and lost control"" and then ended up on the wrong side of the road. He collided with another Mini car before driving ""straight into the front of an oncoming car"". McPartlin arrived at court to a media scrum McPartlin's vehicle ""came to a halt and was no longer driveable due to the damage caused"", she added. In a statement read to the court, the driver of the other Mini said: ""Myself and my family were in deep shock as we believed we could have died as a result of Mr McPartlin's reckless driving."" McPartlin's barrister Liam Walker said his client has expressed both his ""sorrow and regret"" and knows the consequences could have been much worse. The presenter knows people in the public eye should provide a positive example to others and his court appearance is a ""turning point"" for him, the lawyer added. The Metropolitan Police previously said that a number of individuals were treated at the scene for minor injuries, and a child passenger from one of the cars was taken to hospital to be checked as a precaution. Ant and Dec present Britain's Got Talent on ITV McPartlin's barrister said his client had been seeking help for ""alcohol and emotional issues"" at the time of the crash. He told the judge the incident was down to ""a brief relapse"" unbeknownst to McPartlin's mother. ""Anthony McPartlin is sorry and is doing everything he can to ensure this never happens again,"" Mr Walker said. ""He hopes that in time he can make himself better and that he might be forgiven by all of the many people he knows and he feels he has let down terribly."" After he was charged, his publicist confirmed McPartlin wastaking time off from his TV commitments. He is currently seeking treatment. His presenting partner Declan Donnelly hosted the final two episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway alone and will also host Britain's Got Talent on his own, although McPartlin was seen on the ITV show over the weekend as the talent show aired its pre-recorded audition shows.

Delay for Nasa planet-hunter,"Tess's four-camera system will search about 85% of the sky during its primary mission The launch of Nasa's Tess planet-hunter has been postponed and it will not now lift off until Wednesday at the earliest. The telescope was due to go up from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 18:32 local time on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. But the flight was stood down some three hours before lift-off. SpaceX said it wanted some additional time to understand an issue related to the guidance, navigation and control of its vehicle. The company added that its teams were now working towards an 18 April launch at 18:51 EDT (2351 BST). The BBC understands that scientists on the mission also want a delay so they can run some extra checks on the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite itself. When Tess does get up, it will stare at stars for weeks at a time, hoping to catch the dips in brightness that occur when orbiting worlds traverse their faces. The expectation is that it could identify some 2,000-3,000 planets in its first two years of operation. The satellite, which carries four camera-detectors, will essentially compile a catalogue that other telescopes - both on the ground and in space - can then focus in on for more detailed analysis. ""Think of it as a phone book; you'll be able to look up the ones that interest you,"" said Sara Seager from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which leads the Tess project. ""But it's not just quantity; it's quality as well - because the planets we do find will be bright enough and close enough to Earth that we really can do follow-up measurements with them."" This video can not be played Sara Seager: ""Tess will orbit in a giant ellipse that goes far away from Earth"" Perhaps the key actor in this future study will be the successor to Hubble - the James Webb space observatory, due in orbit from 2020. It promises an ability to resolve the atmospheres of some of the new worlds, to look for gases that might hint at the presence of life. James Webb will ""tease out the chemical compositions of those atmospheres and look for whatever's there,"" said Paul Hertz, the astrophysics director at Nasa. ""People are very interested in looking for, what on Earth, are bio-signatures, such as methane, carbon dioxide, water vapour and oxygen."" Bill Chaplin is an astroseismologist from Birmingham University, UK. He is interested in the variations in brightness of the stars that will be observed by Tess. This variability is a consequence of resonances in the stars' outer layers, and it allows the British professor to pull out a lot of extra information. ""We can measure the stars' fundamental properties. We can say how massive they are and how old they are. In addition, we can form a picture of what the inside of a star looks like. So, in essence we can do the equivalent of an ultrasound scan on them.""

Chemical inspectors to be allowed in Douma,"This video can not be played Seth Doane from CBS News visits the scene of the 'chemical attack' in Douma Efforts by international experts to examine the scene of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria have been delayed again after a UN risk assessment team came under fire. Shots were fired when a security team visited Douma on Tuesday to prepare for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors' visit. Nobody was injured and the team returned to the capital, Damascus. Western states have accused the Syrian government of a chemical attack. The US, UK and France bombed several Syrian government sites on Saturday in retaliation as the government and its main ally Russia denied chemical weapons had been used. Western powers have suggested the government and Russia, which nominally control Douma after rebel forces withdrew, may be delaying the OPCW visit to tamper with evidence. Local medical organisations and rescue workers say more than 40 people died when two devices were dropped on Douma, while it was still under rebel control. How do you test for chemical weapons? What we know about the 'chemical attack' The UN security detail set out to perform reconnaissance in Douma ahead of the arrival of the actual inspectors, who were scheduled to go in on Wednesday. As OPCW chief Ahmet Uzumcu explained in a statement, the two suspected attack sites are under the control of the Russian military police as part of an agreement with the rebels to keep out the Syrian military. When the security team arrived at the first site, a large crowd gathered and the UN decided to withdraw. At the second site, ""the team came under small arms fire and an explosive was detonated,"" said Mr Uzumcu. The OPCW inspectors are staying at the Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus At that point the UN team decided to return to Damascus. Mr Uzumcu said he did not currently know when the OPCW inspectors could deploy to Douma. ""This incident again highlights the highly volatile environment in which the FFM [fact-finding mission] is having to work and the security risks our staff are facing,"" he said. The nine-strong FFM team has been waiting in Damascus since Saturday.

On the day of the suspected chemical attack, Douma was still under rebel control, the last rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region outside Damascus after a bloody government offensive. Thousands of people were sheltering in basements from the government's bombardment, when two bombs filled with chemicals were allegedly dropped several hours apart on two separate locations. The US, UK and France say that, based on open-source information and their own intelligence, they are confidentchlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used,external. The government denies using chemical weapons and says the attack was fabricated.

Windrush generation treatment 'appalling'The home secretary apologises to those affected and promises fees for documentation will be waived.5h5 hours agoUK Politics,"The Windrush generation began arriving in the UK in 1948 The home secretary has apologised for the treatment of the Windrush generation, saying it was ""wrong"" and ""appalling"" that some face deportation. Many immigrants who arrived from the Commonwealth decades ago as children have been told they are here illegally. Amber Rudd said they would be helped to attain required documents for free and added she was concerned her department ""sometimes loses sight"" of individuals. Labour's David Lammy said it was a ""day of national shame"". The Tottenham MP said it was ""inhumane and cruel"" that it had taken the government so long to act. This video can not be played David Lammy: ""This is a day of national shame"" Thousands of people arrived in the UK as children in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration 70 years ago. They are known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the ship, the Empire Windrush, that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. Under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. However, the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for the individuals to now prove they are in the UK legally. Changes to immigration law in 2012, which requires people to have documentation to work, rent a property or access benefits, including healthcare, has highlighted the issue and left people fearful about their status. Who are the Windrush generation? In Pictures: The Windrush generation Windrush peers attack Home Office Michael Braithwaite, who moved to the UK from Barbados when he was nine, was let go from his 15-year job as a special needs teaching assistant after his employers ruled he was an illegal immigrant. He said: ""I fell to pieces inside. I didn't actually show it externally until I came home and I sat and I cried. ""My whole life sunk right down to my feet. I was distraught."" This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite Home Secretary Ms Rudd confirmed new measures to the House of Commons to help the Windrush generation. These include: A new taskforce dedicated to helping those affected Plans to work with departments across government to gather evidence on behalf of immigrants - documentation for every year is usually expected, such as bank statements or payslips A pledge that all cases will be resolved in two weeks All fees for new documentation waived so people are not ""out of pocket"" - normally Â£229 A new website will be set up with information and a direct contact point Ms Rudd also said she was ""concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes lose sight of the individual"", but it was why she decided to act. When asked how many of the Windrush generation had been deported as a result of this issue, Ms Rudd said she was ""not aware of any person being removed"" and would have to speak to High Commissioners of different Commonwealth countries to find out. This video can not be played Immigration minister Caroline Nokes: ""We have made some mistakes, which we cannot continue to make"" Earlier, immigration minister Caroline Nokes wasasked by ITV News,externalif any people had been deported. She said: ""There have been some horrendous situations, which as a minister have appalled me."" Told by the reporter ""that's a yes"", and asked how many, she said: ""No, I don't know the numbers, but what I'm determined to do going forward is we'll have no more of this."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the government should consider compensation for anyone who had been wrongly deported. This video can not be played Trevor Phillips: ""The government thought this was a group of people who really didn't matter"" A Home Office spokeswoman said that any people who believe they or a family member have been wrongly deported should get in contact so their case can be reviewed. The prime minister reversed her decision not to meet Commonwealth leaders to discuss the issue after the letter from Mr Lammy and MPs across the house. A meeting is now set for Tuesday. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he welcomed Mrs May's decision to meet other leaders, but added: ""She must now go further and make an immediate commitment to recognise and secure the rights of Commonwealth citizens."" By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent When a home secretary describes her own department's treatment of people as ""appalling"" and criticises it for ""losing sight of the individual"", it's clear something has gone very wrong. Amber Rudd's admission in the House of Commons that she could not say whether any of the Windrush immigrants had been wrongly deported only made things worse. More than one MP harked back to the department's previous leadership under Theresa May. Her intention to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants had led to what David Lammy called a ""day of shame"" for the government. A steady stream of stories about mishandling of cases, a minister appearing unsure about deportations and an apparent U-turn from Number 10 on a meeting with Caribbean leaders have all fuelled criticism of the government. The secretary of state promised to sort things out, a special task force would handle cases ""sensitively"" and apologies were given all round. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University estimates there are 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971. People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parents' passports without their own ID documents. The Empire Windrush arriving at Tilbury Docks with 482 Jamaicans on board Many have never applied for a passport in their own name or had their immigration status formalised, as they regarded themselves as British. TheGuardian newspaper has highlighted a number of cases,externalof such people being threatened with deportation.

Minister calls 'rape clause' an 'opportunity'Esther McVey was heckled by spectators as she gave evidence to a Scottish Parliament committee.4h4 hours agoScotland politics,"This video can not be played The social security committee was disrupted as UK minister Esther McVey gave evidence to MSPs Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has been criticised for describing the so-called ""rape clause"" as an opportunity for victims to get help. The minister was giving evidence to the social security committee at Holyrood. She told MSPs that sexual assault victims having to give DWP staff details of their ordeal was offering ""potentially double support"". The session was disrupted twice by heckling from members of the public. Ms McVey was invited to the hearing to discuss the universal credit policy and the controversial""rape clause""changes to child tax credits. What is the child tax credit 'rape clause' Reforms of the welfare system, which came into force last April, mean child tax credits are now capped at two children. A clause in the new rules means mothers who have a third child as a result of rape can be exempted - but would have to provide evidence to do so. There has been a political row over the policy, which Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has called ""disgusting"". The committee was interrupted by members of the public Green MSP Alison Johnstone told Monday morning's committee there had been ""almost universal condemnation"" at Holyrood of the two-child limit. She said Scottish Women's Aid and Rape Crisis Scotland had refused to act as third party referrers for rape victims. She asked if the minster was comfortable that women had to prove non-consensual conception in order to access a benefit. Ms McVey replied: ""There will be no invasive or delving questions asked."" She added: ""What we are doing is providing extra help where people have got more children that they couldn't have planned. ""This could give them an opportunity to talk about, maybe, something that has happened that they never had before so it is potentially double support - them getting the money they need and maybe an outlet which they might possibly need."" This led to protests from an audience member and a brief suspension as audience tensions spilled over. Esther McVey's comments prompted angry outbursts from some members of the public Labour MSP Pauline McNeill condemned the minister's comments after the hearing. She said: ""This was a disgraceful performance from a work and pensions secretary who is completely out of touch with the reality of life for low income women on tax credits. ""To badge up the vile rape clause as some sort of virtuous policy to provide support is simply skin-crawling."" The Department for Work and Pensions insisted the changes would be delivered in a ""compassionate"" manner. A DWP spokesperson said: ""We're ensuring women in these awful circumstances are supported in every way so they can receive the help that they need. ""We have always been clear that this policy will be delivered in the most effective, compassionate way, with the right exceptions and safeguards in place."" Earlier, SNP MSP Ben Macpherson's call for an apology from the UK minister over the impact of welfare reforms led to shouting from the audience about claimants who took their own lives. The MSP explained that he has had constituents cry in front of him over issues aroundUniversal Credit, calling it a ""cynical and critical system"". Mr Macpherson said he wanted to give the minister the opportunity to apologise to those who had suffered due to welfare reform. But when Ms McVey stated the aim of Universal Credit was for it to be a supportive system, shouts from the viewing gallery halted the session temporarily. ""I am not oblivious to people who are incredibly vulnerable or who are in need,"" she said. Referring to the disruption from the audience, she said it was clear the gentleman felt strongly that something needed to be said about the case of a vulnerable person.

Young face renting 'all their lives'Resolution Foundation report reveals a third of millennials are never likely to own their home.1han hour agoBusinessComments,"Up to a third of young people face living in private rented accommodation all their lives, a new report by the Resolution Foundation has found. The think tank, which aims to improve the standard of living of low and middle-income families, said 40% of ""millennials"" - those born between 1980 and 1996 - were living in rented housing by the age of 30. That was twice as many as ""generation X"" - those born between 1965 and 1980. The government said it was already putting policies in place to improve the housing market. The Foundation's Home Improvements report said ""generation rent"" needed much more help. It called for more affordable homes for first-time buyers to be built, as well as better protection for those who rent. Although renting is often a reasonable choice for people who have few ties, the private rented sector is ""far less fit for purpose"" for those with children because of a lack of security. The report reveals that a record 1.8 million families with children rent privately, up from 600,000 15 years ago. It adds that while housing benefit should be able to help millennial families, its value has been reduced relative to the generation who came before them. Four ways to fix the rental market Big landlords are trying to solve Britain's renting mess Renting in retirement: How feasible is it? Where can I afford to rent or buy? Are you a private tenant? Share your stories,external Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Britain's housing problems have developed into a full-blown crisis and young people are bearing the brunt - paying a record share of their income on housing in return for living in smaller, rented accommodation. ""While there have been some steps recently to support housebuilding and first-time buyers, up to a third of millennials still face the prospect of renting from cradle to grave. ""If we want to tackle Britain's housing crisis we have to improve conditions for the millions of families living in private rented accommodation. That means raising standards and reducing the risks associating with renting through tenancy reform.""

The accountancy firm PwC predicts that as the price of owning a home rises, 7.2 million households will be in rented accommodation by 2025, compared with 5.4m now and 2.3m in 2001.

"Russia denies tampering with Syria siteInternational inspectors will be allowed to visit Douma on Wednesday, the Russian military announces.","This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media Russia has denied interfering with evidence at the site of the suspected Syrian chemical attack, which led to Western air strikes on Saturday. In an interview for BBC's Hardtalk, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: ""I can guarantee that Russia has not tampered with the site."" The US raised concern at the international chemical weapons agency. International inspectors will be allowed to visit the site on Wednesday, the Russian military has announced. A nine-strong team from the agency, the OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), has been waiting nearby in the Syrian capital Damascus for the green light. Douma was a rebel stronghold at the time of the attack on 7 April and is now under the control of the Syrian government and Russian military. This video can not be played Masa, survivor of suspected chemical attack: ""Instead of breathing air, we breathed the smell of blood"" UK Prime Minister Theresa May has defended Britain's involvement in the air strikes, saying it was to prevent ""further human suffering"", as opposition parties said MPs should have been consulted in advance. Catch up on the aftermath of the air strikes: What was targeted? UK PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes Were the Syria air strikes legal? Reality Check: Does Russia always use a veto on Syria? The suspected attack, denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, reportedly killed dozens of people in Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Two bombs filled with chemicals were reportedly dropped several hours apart on the town. Syrian medical sources say bodies were found foaming at the mouth, and with discoloured skin and cornea burns. US sources said they had obtained blood and urine samples from victims which had tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent. What we know about the 'chemical attack' Why is there a war in Syria? Kenneth Ward, US envoy to the OPCW, said: ""It is our understanding the Russians may have visited the attack site. The OPCW is gathering at its headquarters in The Hague ""We are concerned they may have tampered with it with the intent of thwarting the efforts of the OPCW Fact- Finding Mission to conduct an effective investigation."" Speaking to the BBC, the Russian foreign minister denied chemical weapons had been used in Douma. ""I cannot be impolite with the heads of other states, but you quoted the leaders of France and the UK and US and, frankly speaking, all the evidence they quoted was based on media reports and social media."" The event did not take place, he said. ""What did take place was the staged thing,"" he added. Mr Lavrov also questioned why the US, UK and France had carried out their retaliatory air strikes before OPCW inspectors were able to visit the site. Russia and the West, he added, were facing a situation worse than during the Cold War due to a lack of channels of communication. In other developments: The US says it is considering fresh economic sanctions against Russia ""in the near future"" EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg said they understood the air strikes had had ""the sole objective"" of preventing further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government OPCW emergency talks were held in The Hague on Monday. The UK's envoy to the OPCW, Peter Wilson, called for the inspectors to be given ""unfettered access"" to Douma and dismissed as ""ludicrous"" Russian suggestions that Britain had helped stage a fake attack. At the end of the day, the Russian embassy held a press conference at which Russian chemical and biological protection troops commander Maj-Gen Igor Kirillov announced that inspectors would visit Douma on Wednesday. A UN security team would first check the area on Tuesday, the general said. The OPCW itself has not  confirmed the plans. The US says 105 missiles were launched and it believes none were intercepted by Syrian defences. It says Syria's chemical weapons programme has been set back years. This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded The Russians say 71 missiles were shot down by Syrian systems. One of the three sites hit was the Barzeh complex, which the US says was a centre for development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons, although Syria denies this. The other two were suspected chemical weapons facilities at Him Shinshar near Homs. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday he had persuaded US President Donald Trump not to pull troops out of Syriaand instead commit ""for the long term"". The US has some 2,000 troops in eastern Syria, mainly supporting the fight against the Islamic State group. This video can not be played From chlorine to Novichok, chemical weapons have been used for more than a century But soon after Mr Macron's comments, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said an early exit was still desirable. ""The US mission has not changed - the president has been clear that he wants US forces to come home as quickly as possible."" Mr Macron said later that France and the US shared the same aim in Syria: the defeat of the Islamic State group. ""The White House is right to recall that the military engagement is against Daesh [IS] and will finish the day that the war against Daesh has been completed,"" he said. ""France has the same position."" Addressing the French parliament, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Saturday's operation had not been the ""prelude to a war"".
