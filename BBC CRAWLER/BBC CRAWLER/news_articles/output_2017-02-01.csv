Anthony Zurcher: Democrats in dilemma over Supreme Court,"In a season of Democratic Party frustration and anger, Donald Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the US Supreme Court Tuesday night is a particularly bitter pill to swallow. When the seat opened nearly a year ago following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Democrats imagined a durable liberal majority on the court for the first time since the 1960s. Even as the Republican Senate majority broke with longstanding tradition and blocked any consideration of President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, Democrats comforted themselves with the prospect of Hillary Clinton's likely victory in November's presidential election. They entertained the possibility that she would instead pick someone younger and even more progressive than the decidedly moderate Mr Garland. Then the election happened - setting up the inevitability of Tuesday night's prime-time announcement. President Trump, standing in the East Room of the White House, sprayed lemon on their open wounds, noting that the next Supreme Court justice would follow in Scalia's conservative footsteps. Republicans, across the board, are thrilled with the pick. Mr Gorsuch has a sterling legal reputation and indisputable right-wing pedigree. While Mr Trump has proven an uncertain quantity when it comes to fealty to other party orthodoxies, they view his court pick as their trust rewarded. This video can not be played Donald Trump picks Neil Gorsuch as US Supreme Court nominee ""President Trump won 81% of the evangelical vote in no small measure because he made an ironclad pledge that if elected he would fill the vacancy on the US Supreme Court with a strict constructionist who would respect the Constitution and the rule of law, not legislate from the bench,"" Faith and Freedom Coalition Chair Ralph Reed said in a press release. ""We never doubted then-candidate Trump's sincerity or commitment, and by nominating Judge Gorsuch, he has now kept that promise."" As great as was conservative joy, so were the depths of liberal anger - likely only stoked by calls by Republicans, from Mr Trump on down, to give their nominee a fair shake. ""The default is if you are generally qualified and not extreme you are confirmed,"" White House press spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday afternoon. It's a sentiment that has not been welcomed by those on the left. ""The Democrats should treat Trump's [Supreme Court] pick with the exact same courtesy the GOP showed Merrick Garland,""tweeted,externalDan Pfeifer, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. ""Don't flinch, don't back down."" Senate Democrats considering Mr Gorsuch's nomination have a powerful weapon at their disposal, should they choose to use it - the filibuster. If 41 of the 48 members of their caucus are on board, they could block a confirmation vote indefinitely. It's something some Democrats are already promising to do. ""This is a stolen seat,"" Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said, pledging to invoke the filibuster power. ""We will use every lever in our power to stop this."" Such a scorched-earth strategy puts Senate Democrats in a bit of a bind, however. This video can not be played Labor union leader Mary Kay Henry: ""This judge is a step backwards"" First of all, if they do indeed filibuster, Republicans may simply do away with the procedure entirely - the so-called ""nuclear option"" - as Democrats did for all other presidential nominees in 2013, allowing Mr Gorsuch to be confirmed with a simple majority. ""If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,"" Mr Trump urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a meeting on Wednesday. In fact, Democratic pressure could prompt Republicans to do away with the Senate tradition entirely, allowing their party to enact all legislation without minority consent. That would make it significantly easier for Congress to pass conservative priorities like Obamacare replacement, weakening union power, education reform and sweeping deregulation. Already some Democrats are giving indications they may not take such a hard-line stand. ""I'm not going to do to President Trump's nominee what the Republicans in the Senate did to President Obama's,"" Delaware Senator Chris Coons said in a television interview. Mr Coons is in a safely Democratic seat. The 10 Senate Democrats up for 2018 re-election in states Mr Trump carried last year may be under even more pressure to avoid total war with the president over a Supreme Court nomination. While the base may be angry, they will need independent and moderate conservative votes if they want to stay in office. Ronald Klain, a former legal adviser to Democratic President Bill Clinton, offers another reason why Democrats should be cautious when choosing how to handle Mr Gorsuch's nomination. The real battle is not over this seat - it's the next one. While it seems unlikely any of the four liberal justices will willingly vacate their seats during the Trump administration, 80-year-old Anthony Kennedy - who leans conservative but has proven to be a swing vote - may be gauging retirement and will be watching the proceedings closely. ""While it is tempting to begin the confirmation process with an intent to avenge the injustice done to President Barack Obama and his nominee,""Klain writes,external, ""an attitude of score-settling and partisan bitterness would likely be off-putting to Kennedy."" The Democratic base may not care. They're angry, and they're out for blood - and if they don't get it from Republicans, they may turn on their own. ""Senate Democrats, let's be very clear: You will filibuster and block this Supreme Court nominee or we will find a true progressive and primary you in next election,"" liberal filmmaker Michael Mooretweeted,external. More than 1,000 Democrats showed up at a town hall by Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse after he voted to support Mr Trump's CIA nominee. Around 200 protesters picketed California Senator Dianne Feinstein's California home in response to her votes for several of his cabinet picks. Democrats ignore this sentiment at their own peril - and their recent efforts to delay confirmation of Mr Trump's cabinet appointments may be evidence that they are getting the message. The situation is similar to the one the Republican Party found itself in following Barack Obama's election. At first, they thought they could harness conservative Tea Party anger to defeat Democrats. They did - but the Tea Party brought down a lot of establishment Republicans, as well. This damaged the party's electoral chances in the short term, likely costing them the Senate in 2010 and 2014. It also contributed to Mr Trump's rise and eventual victory in 2016, however. That, alone, should be enough to give Democrats officeholders many a sleepless night.

Martin Bashir: Religious groups unhappy with Trump's ban,"Donald Trump's immigration order goes against the teachings of the bible, say church leaders He may have secured the votes of four out of five white evangelical Christians and a majority of white Catholics, but President Donald Trump's decision to issue an executive order barring immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries and blocking all refugees from Syria is attracting criticism from across the spectrum of religious belief. The Reverend Samuel Rodriguez, who prayed at Mr Trump's inauguration and is president of the world's largest Hispanic Christian organisation, representing more than 100 million evangelicals, is signatory to a group letter asking Mr Trump to reconsider his suspension of refugee resettlement. The letter,external, signed by eight other Christian leaders, says: ""The Bible teaches us that each person - including each refugee, regardless of their country of origin, religious background, or any other qualifier - is made in the Image of God, with inherent dignity and potential. ""Their lives matter to God, and they matter to us."" Another clergyman who took part in the presidential inauguration, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, told reporters on Sunday that the executive order ""at first blush causes us some apprehension"". Cardinal Dolan, who has been described as a friend of the president, said he needed time to hear the views of legal experts before consolidating a final opinion. The United States' largest Muslim civil rights organisation, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), denounced Mr Trump's order and has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals whom it believes have been unconstitutionally prevented from entering the United States. The lawsuit, which was filed in a US District Court in Virginia, says the executive order is unconstitutional because ""its apparent purpose and underlying motive is to ban people of the Islamic faith in Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States"". Jewish leaders have condemned the recent travel ban These criticisms are being echoed in Britain.  At the annual dinner of charity World Jewish Relief, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis condemned Mr Trump's action. ""President Trump has signed an executive order that seeks to discriminate based totally on religion or nationality,"" he said. ""We as Jews, perhaps more than any others, know what it's like to be the victims of discrimination."" He added: ""There are so many millions of refugees who are receiving no hope from the United States of America, of all countries."" Who's affected by the ban? Will the ban affect fight against IS? US travel ban: Why these seven countries? Is Trump's immigration order legal? The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, issued a statement expressing shock at the new immigration restrictions. ""It is extraordinary that any civilised country should stigmatise and ban citizens of other nations in the matter of providing humanitarian protection. ""In Christ, we are called to welcome the stranger especially when in desperate need."" On the same day as Mr Trump issued his order, he gave an interview to the Christian Broadcasting Network in which he claimed that his actions were not designed to discriminate against Muslims but instead to offer support to Christians, whom he said had been ""horribly treated"". Pope Francis has urged compassion towards refugees, including from Syria ""If you were a Christian in Syria,"" he went on, ""it was impossible, at least very, very tough, to get in the United States"". ""If you were a Muslim, you could come in. But if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible."" Figures from the Refugee Processing Center do show that as far as Syria is concerned, just a few dozen Christians entered the US in 2016 compared with 15,000 Muslims. But Christians make up fewer than 10% of the Syrian population and theUNHCR notes that they are less likely,externalto seek refuge via its programme. However, when other countries are taken into account, the US admitted almost as many Christian refugees (37,521) as Muslim refugees (38,901) in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. In addition to referencing facts, several Church leaders are appealing to theology to defend their opposition to Mr Trump's order. Dr Tim Keller, the minister of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York and the author of Generous Justice, argues that the parable of the Good Samaritan in the New Testament explains why offering assistance to those in need must be a bedrock of Christian faith and practice. ""By depicting a Samaritan helping a Jew,"" he writes, ""Jesus could not have found a more forceful way to say that anyone at all in need - regardless of race, politics, class, and religion - is your neighbour. ""Not everyone is your brother or sister in the faith, but everyone is your neighbour, and you must love your neighbour.""

Mark Easton: Nigerian ex-governor challenges UK conviction,"James Ibori was released from a UK prison in December after serving four years of a 13-year sentence A Nigerian politician is appealing against his British conviction for corruption, claiming the Metropolitan Police investigation was itself mired in corruption. James Iboriwas released in Decemberafter four years in a British prison, but prosecutors have since admitted they have documents suggesting police officers involved in the case took bribes. The UK government spent years and millions getting Ibori out of Nigeria and into a British court in one of the most expensive and complex police investigations undertaken. Ministers wanted to prove their determination to tackle corruption in Africa. Ibori, a former London DIY store cashier, wasjailed for fraudtotalling nearly Â£50m in April 2012. But now the tables have been turned with Ibori claiming the British authorities were themselves corrupt. ""I have been unfairly treated, that's all I can say,"" Mr Ibori told the BBC, confirming that he plans to appeal against his conviction for money laundering. ""Yes, I am, of course. I have made that decision personally and I have instructed my solicitors."" Ibori was extradited from Nigeria to London in 2010 Ibori was believed to have laundered large sums in the UK, just part of hundreds of millions of dollars it was claimed he had embezzled from the Nigerian people. On a state salary of just Â£4,000 a year he had bought a fleet of luxury cars and expensive properties. He was also looking to buy a private jet. In 2005 the Department for International Development funded a special police unit inside Scotland Yard to go after corrupt African politicians. Its prime target was Ibori. Its aim: to get him into a British court and convict him for corruption. Having been extradited to London in 2010, Ibori was convicted and sentenced to 13 years for money laundering two years later. But since he was jailed, documents have emerged suggesting that at least one officer involved in the Ibori investigation had taken thousands of pounds in bribes. Last year, after repeatedly telling judges there was no evidence of police corruption, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) admitted they had found substantial material that supported the allegations. Last summer, defence lawyers learned more about an undercover Scotland Yard investigation called Operation Limonium. ""There exists intelligence that supports the assertion that [a police officer] received payment in return for information in respect of the Ibori case,"" the CPS admitted. The officer in question has always denied taking bribes and internal police investigations have previously exonerated him. Details of how Scotland Yard tapped phones and conducted covert surveillance on a number of officers in the unit investigating Ibori emerged for the first time. Ibori bought expensive properties and cars, including this Bentley, on a salary of Â£4,000 a year Other documents alleging officers had taken bribes were sent to the authorities anonymously in 2011 by a lawyer convicted as part of the Ibori case. Former solicitor Bhadresh Gohil says he was trying to alert them to the police corruption. ""I brought this case to the attention of the Met police, the commissioner of the Met police Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, I brought it to the attention of Alison Saunders, the head of the CPS. I also drew it to the attention of the then Home Secretary Theresa May,"" Mr Gohil says. ""Unfortunately, no-one did anything about this."" What they did do was attempt to prosecute Mr Gohil for perverting the course of justice by faking the documents. With the CPS release of the new documents, that case collapsed. The British authorities managed to get their man before a judge in 2012, but now James Ibori is willingly returning to the courts looking to put the reputation of the UK's criminal justice system on trial. The irony will not be lost on government ministers.

Tim Bowler: Will globalisation take away your job?,"Protests against globalisation have become increasingly common Millions around the globe may have taken to the streets in recent years to protest against the impact of globalisation on their jobs and communities - but this backlash is only likely to grow as globalisation itself becomes more disruptive. The stark warning comes from Richard Baldwin, president of the Centre for Economic Policy Research think-tank, who has been studying global trade for the past 30 years. Technological advances could now mean white-collar, office-based workers and professionals are at risk of losing their jobs, Prof Baldwin argues. In the US, voter anger with globalisation may have led to Donald Trump's election victory, but those who voted for him could be disappointed as his aim of bringing back jobs is unlikely to work, says Prof Baldwin, who also worked as an economist under President George HW Bush. Robots are now increasingly used in surgery; the first transatlantic operation - with the patient in France and surgeons in the US - was carried out in 2001 Protectionist trade barriers won't work in the 21st Century, he says. ""Knowledge crossing borders in massive amounts [is the] big new disruptive thing."" It's going to help people in Africa and Asia compete more effectively with people in the West, as communication advances mean workers in the developing world will be able to control robots to do jobs in Europe and the US at lower cost, he says. Developing world labour costs can be a tenth of what they are in the West, says Prof Baldwin. ""They can't get here to take the jobs but technology will soon allow virtual migration, thanks to telerobotics and telepresence."" Some of the first post-war Jamaican migrants to the UK - future migration could well be virtual Ever-faster internet speeds becoming globally more widely available, coupled with the rapidly falling prices of robots will allow workers, for example in the Philippines or China, to remotely provide services to a country like the UK - where the sector accounts for about 80% of the economy. ""What it will do is unbundle our jobs and change the nature of our occupation. Some of the things you do absolutely require your judgement - but parts of your job could be off-shored, just as some stages in a factory can be off-shored. ""All you need is more computing power, more transmitting power and cheaper robots - and all that is happening."" This video can not be played Could 'virtual migration' hit middle class jobs? Security guards in US shopping malls could be replaced by robots controlled by security personnel based in Peru, and hotel cleaners in Europe could be replaced by robots driven by staff based in the Philippines, he argues in his book The Great Convergence. The use of robots has grown exponentially since the mid-20th Century. A Ford factory in 1914; the development of robots has radically altered such production lines... ...now spot the workers; this is a BMW production line in the UK in 2013 A typical industrial robot can cost about Â£4 an hour to operate, compared to average total European labour costs of about Â£40 an hour - or Â£9 an hour in China. And robots are getting cheaper to buy and are increasingly able to do more complex tasks. This means the increased use of robots is also threatening millions of jobs in developing countries, says theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development,external(Unctad), as well as in developed economies. And it's not just in factories; the worldwide number of domestic household robots will rise to 31 million between 2016 and 2019, says theInternational Federation of Robotics,external(IFR), with sales of robots for cleaning floors, mowing lawns, and cleaning swimming pools forecast to grow to about $13bn (Â£10.3bn) in this period. Napoleon's defeat in 1815 after almost 25 years of war triggered a growth in world trade In the 19th Century, the first wave of the industrial revolution triggered an upsurge in global trade. Steam power, the end of the Napoleonic wars and the subsequent era of peace cut the costs of moving goods internationally. Global wealth became increasingly concentrated among just a few nations; the G7 group - the US, Germany, Japan, France, the UK, Canada and Italy - saw their share of the world's wealth rise significantly. But from the 1990s a second wave of globalisation kicked in, with the rise of information and communications technology. There's been a dramatic change of gear, and ""a century's worth of rich nations' rise has been reversed in just two decades,"" says Prof Baldwin. Old-style globalisation ""worked on a calendar that ticked year by year"" whereas the current wave of globalisation is being driven by IT which is changing and disrupting economies and societies with increasing rapidity, he says. All of this has created a backlash, especially in developed economies, as many voters say they are losing out or seeing little of the benefits that globalisation supposedly brings. Globalisation has sparked protests around the world... Prof Baldwin says protectionist policies, such as those of Donald Trump, are ultimately counterproductive. If firms become inefficient by being forced to move jobs back to the US, then ultimately they will lose their business to international competitors. ""People are so angry they are doing things that are not in their own interest. ""Cures are being sold which are not related to the problem."" Globalisation has been a factor in the election of Donald Trump in the US... ...and the UK's vote to leave the European Union He points out that the backlash is not the same in every single country. It often depends on how governments deal with workers who may be displaced by technology. ""For instance, in Japan they take care of their workers, and there really isn't an anti-globalisation feeling there,"" he says - unlike in the UK and the US. As a consequence, even businesses that are benefiting from greater automation are increasingly sensitive about the potentially negative social and political consequences. Increasingly sophisticated robots mean many jobs that used to exist are not going to return, says Prof Baldwin Similarly, in Europe the bosses of bothDeutsche Telekom,externalandSiemens,externalhave advocated paying a basic income to workers replaced by technology. We may see a move to protectionism as countries try to preserve jobs within their economies, but this is unlikely to work in the long term, says Prof Baldwin. The trick is to accept ""21st Century reality"", he says, and the fact that many jobs simply aren't going to come back. Protesters in Bordeaux with a banner reading ""together against unemployment and social precariousness"" Governments need to pay more attention to social policy, says Prof Baldwin. ""In the post-war period of globalisation we liberalised trade but at the same time we expanded social welfare - instituted low-cost education and retraining for workers. ""In essence there was a set of complementary policies that reassured workers that they would have a good chance of taking advantage of globalisation."" The challenges all this is throwing up for governments are many, but Prof Baldwin says it should be possible to develop policies that embrace globalisation - and give workers displaced by it the support they need.

Laura Kuenssberg: Past the point of no-return,"It's begun. After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off. This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero. Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted. As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past.

James Landale: The politics behind state visits,"George Osborne was keen to use Xi Jinping's state visit to bolster UK-China trade ties Astate visitis the ultimate weapon of British diplomacy, the bunker buster of soft power that can break down the hardest of tyrannical hearts. Few world leaders can resist the siren lure of all that royal bling: horse-drawn coaches, state banquets, processions down the Mall, the sheer scale of all that gold leaf and pomp and flummery that allows them a brief window into a royal fantasy that many countries envy but can rarely match. This weapon is deployed sparingly, normally no more than twice a year. But it does get used. Trump state visit 'difficult' for Queen What is a state visit? In pictures: UK protests against Trump's travel ban If Donald Trump does touch down for a little red carpet treatment later this year, it will be the110th time the Queen has welcomed another head of state to these shores in her reign,external. And for now, despite the protests andgrowing online petition,Downing Street is continuing to stand firm, insisting that the invitation to the president stands. So state visits are not merely ceremonial affairs, they are political and purposeful. They are used by the British government of the day to further what they see as Britain's national interests. In 1973, the Queen welcomed President Mobutu of what was then called Zaire in Africa, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was a brutal, corrupt dictator but he was also seen as a vital anti-communist ally in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. So he got an invite to the Palace. President Mobutu's 1973 visit was extremely controversial President Suharto of Indonesia, another repressive leader who happened to be anti-communist, was also granted a state visit in 1979 for the same reasons. In 1971, Emperor Hirohito of Japan was welcomed by the Queen for a state visit as a deliberate attempt to help usher the country back into the family of nations after its post-war isolation. Not surprisingly, the invitation of the man who had led Japan during World War Two was hugely controversial, and many former army veterans and prisoners of war turned their backs on the royal procession in silent protest. Some wore red gloves to symbolise the blood they saw as being on his hands while others whistled ribald old army tunes. A tree the Emperor had planted was uprooted. In 1978, Nicolae Ceausescu, the notorious Romanian communist leader, and his wife Elena were given a state visit in the vain hope that they might be encouraged to introduce some pro-Western reforms. The Queen was so repulsed by them that, according to the royal author Robert Hardman, while out walking her dogs, she hid behind a bush in the Palace gardens to avoid bumping into the couple who were also out strolling. More than a decade later both Ceausescu and his wife were executed by a revolutionary firing squad. Huge crowds greeted Nelson Mandela in Brixton during his 1996 state visit And even the most uncontroversial of state visits, that of President Mandela in 1996, was not without political purpose. There was a feeling in the Foreign Office that South Africa was beginning to slip away from the West towards the unaligned nations, and they wanted to hug Madiba close and remind his country of Britain's anti-apartheid credentials. More recently, in 2014, the state visit of the Irish president to Britain was used as another step of reconciliation. The Irish president's state visit in 2014 drew former IRA leader Martin McGuiness to Windsor Castle Martin McGuiness, the former Northern Ireland deputy first minister and former IRA leader, not only put on white tie and tails for a state banquet at Windsor Castle, but he also stood for a toast to the Queen. And the state visit of President Xi in 2015 was a deliberate attempt by George Osborne, the then Chancellor, to curry favour with the Chinese and boost British trade links. As for American presidents, only two have been granted full state visits during the current Queen's reign: President Bush in 2003 and President Obama in 2011. What is unusual is the speed with which Mr Trump has been issued with an invitation for a state visit, just days into his presidency. Both Messrs Bush and Obama had to wait until well into their terms of office before they got the call. The haste reflects the importance the prime minister places on securing a good relationship with the new president and winning a post-Brexit trade deal, even if there is some political cost. Mr Bush's visit was by no means uncontroversial, coming so soon after the beginning of the Iraq war. There were demonstrations throughout the trip, including one involving tens of thousands in central London when an effigy of the president was toppled over in a parody of events in Baghdad. President Obama made a state visit half way through his first term of office So the Queen may be above politics but state visits are not. They are used for diplomacy and are often controversial. And whatever protests may surround any Trump state visit, the Queen will have seen it all before. Rarely has she shown herself unable to cope with whomsoever the government brings round for tea. As one royal insider told me dryly: ""She does have some experience in these matters."" Or as former foreign secretaryWilliam Hague wrote more bluntly in the Telegraph this morning,external, ""A Queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride.""

'We must stay optimistic',"Mariam has to study by candlelight and use a shop's generator to charge up her computer Mariam Hammad, despite every adversity of war and hardship, is trying to be a student in Aleppo in the dark heart of Syria's civil war. ""My city has turned to ruins,"" she says. Despite being in constant danger, forced out of her home twice by shelling and living without regular supplies of electricity or water, this 22-year-old has refused to give up being a student. Four years ago, she had just left school and begun at the University of Aleppo when it was hit by rockets, killing dozens of students around her. ""I saw my friends killed and still now I can't forget what happened,"" Mariam says. ""I saw a lot of students hurt and injured. There was blood, death. Everything was terrible."" There was intense danger at home too. ""I came so near to death many times,"" Mariam says. ""My family and I rented a house that was only 500m from the front lines, and a lot of rockets fell in my neighbourhood. Mariam has refused to give up her ambition to be a student and get a degree ""Many of my neighbours were killed, and mortars hit my home twice."" She remembers waking during an attack, unable to see in the dust and darkness and not knowing who was alive or dead. Mariam talks of life in Aleppo becoming a mix of ""horror and danger"". ""I was crying so much when I saw my city in front of my eyes, everything destroyed,"" she says. But her reaction has been to stubbornly carry on and to use her studies as a way of honouring those who have died. She became an online student in a warzone, following a degree course run by the US-basedUniversity of the People,external, making a conscious decision to be ""optimistic"" and to make plans to ""rebuild"". This week in Aleppo the temperature has fallen below 0C But this is far from straightforward, she says over a patchy Skype line. ""The hardest thing about being a student in Aleppo? Actually, it's being alive,"" Mariam says. There are still occasional rockets and mortar blasts, despite a ceasefire, but there are also big practical problems that would have put off a less determined student. ""We haven't had electricity for two years,"" she says. Instead, people rely on generators that might operate for a few hours at a time. Mariam goes to a local shop with a small generator, where it can take 12 hours to charge up her mobile phone and an old laptop, and then she ekes out the charge so she can study. Families are living in the wreckage of their city Internet connections are sporadic and weak - and when an exam was approaching, there was an internet blackout. Worried that she would be failed, Mariam began to make preparations to travel to Damascus to find a way of sitting the exam. Even by the standards of a civil war, she says, this would have been extremely dangerous, but friends managed to make contact with the university, and she was able to re-arrange the exam. More stories from theBBC's Global education series,externallooking at education from an international perspective, andhow to get in touch. You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. Heat and light are daily challenges, particularly in winter, with temperatures in Aleppo below freezing this week. Water is available only every three or four weeks. ""When we have water, we store huge amounts,"" she says, filling every container. There have been long battles between government and rebel armies in Aleppo, but there are also forces of the so-called Islamic State not far from the city. Mariam says they tried to cut a road to the city a few days ago - but she says there is also the battle of ideas and the need to protect the right to education. Their presence makes her even more determined to keep studying. Despite the dangers, the hunger for education has remained in Aleppo While the high technology of war has rained down on Syria, this young woman has to study at night by candlelight. But she doesn't complain. Instead, she talks with understated longing for one single ""normal day"" as a student. And what would she do with it? ""I want to do a lot of things in this day,"" she says. ""I want to go to my university like any normal student. I want to go with my friends. I want to sit with my family."" She pauses. ""And I want to see everyone I lost,"" she says. But in the face of such awful destruction, why is she worrying about getting a degree? Mariam says the experience of war has made education seem even more important - something positive that links people to the chance of rebuilding a better life. Carrying bread in the streets of Aleppo ""We have this strong motivation to seek it no matter what,"" she says. ""You can see that in young children going to their schools, even though they can be hit at any time."" ""Education was always important in my life. ""It gives me hope that I can have a better future. ""It will help me to rebuild my country and everything that's been destroyed."" Mariam is studying a business degree with the University of the People, based in California, which supports people around the world who otherwise would not have access to university - including 15 students in Aleppo. The ceasefire has made it safer for civilians to walk in the street The online university, backed by the likes of the Gates Foundation, Hewlett Packard and Google, offers accredited four-year degree courses, taught by volunteer academics and retired university staff. The university's president, Shai Reshef, says: ""We are an alternative for those who have no other alternative."" Mariam sees her studying as a kind of lifeline and source of hope - and she says any other students around the world should appreciate the chances they have. Students were killed when the University of Aleppo was hit in 2013 She can only dream of having a ""normal life like them"". ""I hope that whoever sees my story will not be discouraged by difficulties they face,"" she says. ""I believe that after every hardship comes a great rebirth, and in honour of ever friend, neighbour and Syrian who lost his life due to this war, we must stay optimistic."" And if that faith wavers?

Who is Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch?,"This video can not be played Judge Gorsuch spoke of his ""most solemn assignment"" President Trump's Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil Gorsuch, is the youngest such nominee in a quarter of a century. The 49-year-old Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, would succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia if confirmed. He is favoured by many conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law as Scalia. Judge Gorsuch was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. Battle brews on Trump Supreme Court Pick Meet the Supremes Judge Gorsuch began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, the latter of whom he could now serve alongside. This video can not be played President Donald Trump: ""Was that a surprise? Was it?"" He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was ""an inexhaustible store"" of Winston Churchill quotes. Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic. His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration. He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home. Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings. He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. ""All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,"" he wrote. In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that ""American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom"". He said they keep ""relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda"". This video can not be played The Supreme Court has been without a full bench for almost a full year. Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage. His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge ""in the mould"" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority. Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores v Sebelius case. Justice Scalia (front row, second from left) was one of five justices that made up the conservative majority on the court Judge Gorsuch has also expressed concern about ""executive overreach"", a criticism that was often directed at the Obama administration's use of presidential orders to overcome congressional gridlock. He has sharply questioned a landmark Supreme Court ruling determining that courts should defer to government agencies when it comes to interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. Conservatives blame the 1984 decision involving the Chevron oil company for handing too much power to the regulatory state. In an August 2016 concurring opinion, Judge Gorsuch wrote that ""executive bureaucracies [were being allowed] to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design"". In a 2013 case, he upheld a lower court's ruling that a police officer was protected under qualified-immunity law after he used a stun gun on a 22-year-old student, who died from the incident.

Was pollution worse in London than Beijing?,"The claim:Air pollution in London last week was worse than it was in Beijing. Reality Check verdict:Some one-off readings were higher in London last week, but this was an unrepresentative snapshot and Beijing is generally far worse. On 22 January, recordings of particulate air pollution were higher in London than in Beijing. Ruth Cadbury is the Labour MP for Brentford and Isleworth, a part of London that has seen unusually high levels of air pollution recently. Last week saw the highest level recorded in the capital since April 2011. The spike was attributed to cold, calm and settled weather, meaning winds were not dispersing local pollutants. Different countries measure air pollution in different ways. The UK government uses a one (lowest) to 10 (highest) scale. Last week's levels in London were a 10. Another measure is the Air Quality Index (AQI). Last Monday, according to this measure, some parts of London showed particulate levels a bit higher than in Beijing. But this was just a snapshot and not the case for most of the week. On Wednesday afternoon, the overall AQI level in Beijing was about three times higher than in London, and recordings were even higher on the Chinese city's industrial outskirts. The World Health Organization gathers average particulate levels from cities around the world. They suggest that Beijing's levels are about five times worse than London's. The cities with the dirtiest air are Zabol in Iran and Onitsha in Nigeria. In the UK, overall emissions of all types of air pollution have fallen dramatically since 1970. Pollution in Beijing is much worse than in London - or in Stockholm, wherethe same claim was made this week,external.

Can we believe petition signature numbers?,"The numbers of people who have signed a petition calling for President Trump not to be allowed to make a state visit to the UK has been widely reported. Can it be believed? The number reported byParliament's petitions website,externalis at about 1.8 million. There is also a petition saying thatPresident Trump should be welcomed,externalwith a state visit, which has passed 200,000 signatures. Any British citizen or UK resident is entitled to sign a petition on the site and asked to confirm their status when they do so. An email is then sent to the address given, containing a link that signatories must click on before they are counted. The House of Commons says: ""All petitions are checked for fraudulent activity, using both automated and manual checks. The checks prevent fraudulent signatures being added to petitions by individuals trying to repeatedly sign, or automated attacks (bots)."" It adds that there is a balance to be made between making it easy for people to sign while making it harder to do so repeatedly. Signatories are required to confirm that they are entitled to sign The procedures have been tightened up since last June, when at least 77,000 fraudulent signatures wereremoved from a petitioncalling for a second EU referendum. An investigation was launched after posts were found on websites from people claiming to have written programs that would automatically sign the petition thousands of times. The House of Commons will not give details of either the original or new security procedures it has put in place. It is not immediately obvious how the system works to prevent people voting more than once, but fraudulent signatures have been disqualified in the past.

NHS staff trigger Google cyber-defences,"NHS staff using Google's search engine has triggered one of its cybersecurity defences. NHS Digital confirmed so many NHS staff use the search engine that it had started asking them to take a quiz to verify they were ""not a robot"". News sitethe Register reported,externalone NHS Trust had told staff to ""use Bing"" instead. Google indicated its systems were designed to spot unusual traffic and were working as intended. Detecting suspicious traffic from one network can help defeat potential cyber-attacks, such as attempts to try to overwhelm a website. The BBC understands Google is not deliberately singling out NHS traffic. A Google spokeswoman said: ""Our systems are simply checking that searches are being carried out by humans and not by robots in order to keep web users safe. Once a user has filled out the Captcha [security check], they can continue to use Google as normal."" The NHS is one of the biggest employers in the world, with more than a million members of staff. An email sent by an NHS system administrator suggested the number of staff using the search engine was ""causing Google to think it is suffering from a cyber-attack"". NHS Digital told the Register: ""We are aware of the current issue concerning NHS IP addresses which occasionally results in users being directed to a simple verification form when accessing Google. ""We are currently in discussion with Google as to how we can help them to resolve the issue."" NHS Digital was unable to suggest what NHS staff may be searching for using Google.

'Polite' moose falls into family basement,"A family in the US state of Idaho had quite a shock when they awoke to find a moose had fallen into their home. The animal tumbled through an unlatched window into the basement of the property in the community of Hailey, in the state of Idaho. According to the Idaho Mountain Express, the female moose spent about three hours in the house after the mishap early on Sunday morning. Wildlife officials sedated the animal before releasing it unharmed. Canadians warned over car-licking moose Moose on the loose as Alaska warms Two Alaskan moose found encased in ice Homeowner Julie Emericktold the Mountain Express,external: ""She was absolutely the most polite, gracious beast that you could have in your house."" Blaine County Sheriff's deputies and Idaho Department of Fish and Game officers initially tried to shoo the moose upstairs. But Fish and Game said on its Facebook page: ""The moose was having none of it, charging the officers several times."" When that failed, a wildlife officer shot the moose with a tranquilliser dart. The Idaho moose is sedated before being carried up the stairs Ms Emerick said eight officers carried the approximately 600lb (270kg) animal up the stairs. ""With a lot of grunting and groaning they got her up the stairs and out the door,"" she said. Ms Emerick said the groggy beast came round and ran off about a quarter of an hour later. The night-time intruder caused hardly any damage to the basement room, she added. Heavy snow has driven moose and other wildlife into populated areas in search of food, according to wildlife officials.

National dish?,"""Halal snack pack"" has been named People's Choice Word of the Year 2016 by Australia's Macquarie Dictionary. A snack pack, also known as an HSP, is a hearty pile of kebab meat, chips and sauce which has become a staple of Australian takeaway shops. It's perhaps an unlikely platform for political debate, but this year the dish rocketed into Australia's national consciousness, becoming a symbol of peaceful multiculturalism for many, but for others, an unwelcome sign of the growing influence of Islam. Politician Pauline Hanson takes the view that halal meat is unacceptable in Australia This year the dish, made to Islamic religious standards, found its way into politics, after right-wing anti-Islam politician Pauline Hanson refused an invitation to eat one. In congratulating her on her election to the Senate in July, Labor Senator Sam Dastyari - a ""non-practising Muslim"" - told Ms Hanson: ""I'll take you out for halal snack pack out in Western Sydney, whenever you want."" Mr Dastyari was arguably slightly trolling Ms Hanson,whose One Nation party believes,externalthat by ""buying halal certified products, it means that you are financially supporting the Islamisation of Australia"". ""It's not happening, not interested in halal, thank you,"" she replied, arguing (without evidence) that ""98% of Australians"" were also against halal. What is halal meat? The Australian MP fighting the trolls The dish subsequently enjoyed a surge in popularity.One Melbourne kebab shop,externaleven added ""The Pauline Hanson"" to its menu - ""Lamb kebab roasted to perfection in the rotisserie, mint yoghurt, chilli sauce, cheese, beer battered chips"". The halal snack pack is an Australian creation, but its creators were immigrants or descendants of recent immigrants from the Middle East and Europe. It's a fusion of these cuisines, and even has its ownappreciation society on Facebook,external, for ""sharing great snack pack stories and discussing possible best snack pack in world"". The forum asks members to ""show us a sick pic of ur halal snacky, whered ya get it?, is it sick?, is it halal? and salrite or na? also, is it a halal snack pack mountain or na?"" The group, which has close to 180,000 members, was inspired by a visit its founders made to Oz Turk Jr, a kebab shop in Sydney. ""Before, we used to sell 10 kebabs for one snack pack, now it's 10 snack packs to one kebab,"" says owner Ufuk Bozouglu. An Australian Muslim of Turkish origin, he credits his mum for the popularity of his snack packs, saying ""she taught me you should only sell what you'd eat"". Mr Bozouglu says his customers are mainly students living locally - who'll queue for up to 40 minute at peak times - but one boy travels two-and-a-half-hours each week to buy one of his snack packs, which cost about A$10.50 each ($8; Â£6.30), with cheese. He says he's never seen anyone be perturbed by the fact his meat is halal. ""Where we live, it's very multicultural, and people see it doesn't matter if you're Christian, Hindu, whatever. You become friends and have respect for each other."" ""The people that it does matter to, they're usually from small areas so they only thing they see [about Muslims] is what they read in the paper. ""People around this area, they're all together,"" he says. ""Sometimes, you go on Facebook and it's just hate towards Muslims,"" he says, but on the snack pack appreciation forum, it's all about the food. Keysar Trad, president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, says normalising words used by other languages can only be a good thing. ""Especially if you're able to find it in the dictionary, it takes away the mystery,"" he said. ""It brings people comfort and satisfaction that there's nothing sinister about the word halal. It's all about what's positive, what is good and wholesome."" The popularity of halal snack packs ""demystifies the word, demystifies the culture from which those words are borrowed and hopefully, helps built harmony in society"". The Macquarie committee said,externalthe choice of the halal snack pack as word of the year ""tells us about something once confined largely to the Muslim community that is now surfacing throughout the broader Australian community"". The dictionary's editor, Susan Butler, even said it was ""the duty of lexicographers to, as much as is humanly possible, eat the food items that they put in the dictionary"". ""How can you write the definition of HSP with enthusiasm if you have never sampled it? So today I ate my first HSP. ""I can understand why this dish has become the fast food item of the day. It is carbo-loaded, calorific sinfulness. Once started on it, you cannot stop."" Reflecting similar trends, the dictionary committee last week named ""fake news"" it's Word of the Year, saying it ""captures an interesting evolution in the creation of deceptive content as a way of herding people in a specific direction"".

"Cats, laughing and knitting","Joining a club or learning something new helps some people overcome isolation Loneliness in the UK is an epidemic affecting people of all ages and backgrounds,according to a commissionstarted by the murdered MP Jo Cox. But if you find yourself feeling lonely, what can you do about it? For many people, loneliness is not solved overnight - but people from all walks of life, including single fathers, millennials in a new city, widows, teenage mothers, and happily married husbands, have told the BBC their tips for making their days a bit brighter. ""At St John Fisher Church in North Harrow, we started a knitting group for ladies at home to get together over a cup of tea and knit for charities. We laugh and chat all afternoon."" - Teresa Arrigo ""My saving grace was the internet - I found a group for widowed people called Way Up (for the over-50s. Way is for the under-50s). The group showed me that after I was widowed I discovered that, despite people expecting me to get over it, all the different emotions I experienced were normal and OK."" - Angie Cole ""My lifesaver is the internet - websites for counting penguins and watching aguy and his chicken sail around the world."" - Diane Keel Helen Stenson exercises to meet people and structure her week ""I am a single dad. My loneliness hit me when I had to sell the business to look after my young children full-time. What helps now is going to the gym and a bit of voluntary work while the kids are at school."" - Qamar Qureshi ""I am often lonely. I am currently in the USA as my husband is on secondment and knew no-one when we arrived. I cannot work, so the days are long. The solution for me is to get out, even if it's only for a walk - it helps as you usually see someone to say hello to. I also joined a gym, which gives structure to my week."" - Helen Stenson ""I am a mum of two young children, and I definitely found that going to baby groups when they were little and mixing with other parents helped me to stop feeling as lonely. I still try to go to groups with them now, when I can. As much as you might not feel like going out, it does help, and it feels like a real achievement when you do, so that is a boost too."" - Emily Holbrook ""I am 79 years old and was always feeling lonely in the evenings - I told my daughter that I would like a kitten, so she searched a cat sanctuary and I chose a little black one and called him Barney. He was eight weeks old when I got him, and he has completely changed my life around because he wants attention all day. I cannot imagine my life now without him. I am disabled but manage to look after him very well, and he is a happy little boy of five months."" - Joan Gutteridge ""My cat - she is a constant companion at home and a real comfort. I have to keep going to make sure she has everything she needs, and she relies on me as her significant other. She has become more cuddly, which I find makes me happy."" - Kerry Williams Joan and her cat Barney spending time together ""When I reached rock-bottom, I signed up to volunteer for two charities - one helping disadvantaged families and children, and the other in conservation work. I also joined a community choir, got an allotment - and adopted a cat. I am beginning to feel a lot more connected to my community, and a lot less lonely."" - Nancy Saunders ""I offered my time to Age UK, and I help in a day centre. I've met lovely people, and, even better, I'm giving something to the community."" - Ruth Some people find exercising or laughing cheers them up ""Self-employed people like me struggle. I worked as a video producer and TV repair person from home for over 20 years. I employed a part-time co-worker, scheduled meetings with other professionals once a month, joined a networking breakfast group, joined a gym for badminton classes, joined a club (in my case a video club) - any excuse to meet up, especially with other like-minded professionals."" -  David James ""Join the University of the Third Age. It is a collection of older people who want to follow new interests or carry on with existing ones. There are groups for cycling, motorcycling, cooking, languages, sewing. The list is endless - all you need to do is contact their local group, you will be given a warm welcome."" - John Watts ""My advice would be find your local toddlers' club. I now attend one with my grandson and have made new friends. Also join the library - ours has great children's story times."" - Nina Kent ""A few months ago, I came across a phone app called Meetup. It's changed my life already. I've been on a few 'meetups' and met some lovely groups of normal people. I've been on walks, quiz nights, [a] comedy show, booked a weekend in Cornwall and even started Kung-fu."" - Keith Littlebury ""I use the internet to overcome loneliness - I use YouTube for music, documentaries and stand-up comedy.

Job hopping,"Peter Capaldi is bowing out at Christmas after four years playing Dr Who Three years is the maximum length of time anyone should stay in a job, declared actor Peter Capaldi when he explained why he was stepping down from the Dr Who role after four years. ""I've never done one job for three years. This is the first time I've done this and I feel it's time for me to move on to different challenges,"" he said. It's a pretty short tenure compared to the old days when people secured a job after leaving school or university and then stayed there until they collected their golden carriage clock. But increasingly, changing one's job every few years is considered the norm. In fact, a UK worker will change employer every five years on average, according toresearch by life insurance firm LV=,external. In the US, it's even shorter with people staying with a single employer for just over four years,according to official statistics,external. But is there a magic number, one that will make sure you don't stop progressing, but also doesn't make you look too, well, flighty? Almost a quarter of employed people are currently looking for new roles, according to HR body the CIPD Claire McCartney, adviser for the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, says there's no such thing. ""It's very specific to the person. It depends on their career plans, assuming they have any career plans and whether they feel they get the right amount of challenge and flexibility,"" she says. Ms McCartney does, however, believe there's a minimum tenure, saying just three months in one role before moving on wouldn't look good, unless it was driven by  a change in personal circumstances. She also says the size of an organisation can often be a factor in determining how long a person stays, with a smaller company often offering less opportunity for people to progress than a larger rival. Victoria Bethlehem, the group head of talent acquisition at recruitment firm Adecco, says she looks favourably on a prospective employee who has changed roles every three to five years. ""Immobility is never desirable in a curriculum. This does not necessarily mean that the candidate needs to have changed several companies and employers. ""What's important is to see the candidate has an open attitude to change and a continuous learning approach, driving him or her to embrace new challenges,"" she adds. Changing jobs regularly is seen as positive if it moves your career forward, say experts In certain sectors, regular change is not only desirable, but a necessity, according to Robert Archer, regional director of human resources at recruitment firm PageGroup. ""In technology, advertising and public relations, where professionals are known to change jobs every few years or even months, job hopping can be considered to be a necessity in order to keep up with changes in the market,"" he says. But Nigel Heap, managing director at recruitment firm Hays UK & Ireland, warns ""there can sometimes be a stigma associated with 'job hopping'."" ""Constantly moving to new roles without demonstrating a good reason might make new employers wary. They may question your ability to commit to an organisation and it may appear that you cannot adapt to new environments and challenges. ""If you do move jobs frequently it's important that you clearly outline how long you were in each job on your CV, and support this with clear evidence of what you have learned in each role and what value you can bring to future employers,"" he says. By far the most influential element driving how often you change jobs is age. In the US, the average tenure of workers aged 55 to 64 was 10.1 years, more than three times the 2.8 years of workers aged 25 to 34, according to the most recent US statistics. The UK doesn't record such data, but London-based Dr Clare Gerada is an example of an older worker who has stayed at the same place for many years. She has worked for the NHS for 40 years and spent 25 years at the same practice. Clare Gerada started working for the NHS when she was just 14 years old Dr Gerada says this is partly down to her role which offers lots of flexibility and change, but she believes people are inherently designed to put roots down. ""Of course when you're young you should move around and do things and experiment, gain experience, but there has to be a point I think that you put roots down and actually start to grow in that job,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. But so-called millennials, those born between 1980 and 1999, have very different expectations about jobs. Several surveys suggest that these younger workers aren't motivated by the same factors as previous generations, such as a job for life, but instead value a good work-life balance and a sense of purpose beyond financial success. Job hopping too often could make new employers question your commitment It's a drastically different outlook from the generations before who are used to the more traditional hierarchy of large corporate firms - staying at the same firm and working a set number of years in a particular post before progressing. Almost a quarter of employed people are currently looking for new roles, according to the CIPD's latestEmployee Outlook survey,externalwhich polled 2,000 UK employees. For companies of course it poses a challenge. Constantly losing staff and their knowledge and having to recruit and retain replacements is costly. Ms McCartney says firms need to do more to try and retain staff, for example holding regular casual chats with staff on career progression. ""Companies need to be more creative. There might not be room for promotion, but cross-function working, opportunities to work on special projects and secondments are all ways of boosting skills,"" she says. But she also says it's important for firms to stay on good terms with departing staff, who may decide to return later on in a different role adding wider experience to their existing knowledge of the firm. ""It's not about organisations holding on to people at all costs,"" she says.

'Pushed to the limit',"Many Australians head to the beach to cool off, but that is often not possible for the old and very young As a homesick teenager in Britain in the early 1900s, the writer Dorothea Mackellar yearned for the ""pitiless blue sky"" of Australia. ""I love a sunburnt country,"" she declared in her timeless poem My Country, and more than a century after those famous words were crafted, parts of Australia have endured another savage summer of heat. Sydney has had its hottest December and January nights on record and there have been new year heatwaves in Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. The bursts of scorching conditions are not only uncomfortable, they can be a silent killer. Doctors are worried that many Australians are underestimating the dangers posed by the heat, the nation'sdeadliest natural hazard,external. In 2009, 173 people died in theBlack Saturday bushfiresin the state of Victoria, one of the most fire-prone regions in the world. However, more than twice as many victims lost their lives in a heatwave that preceded the fires. ""What we are seeing increasingly is weather that really pushes us to our limits,"" Dr Tessa Kennedy from the Australian Medical Association of New South Wales told the BBC. ""Many people don't know that heatwaves are actually more harmful to human health than bushfires and floods."" Fans cool off at the Sydney International tennis tournament earlier this month A man endures the heat near Sydney's Coogee beach Mackellar's epic love of the bush was forged in sun-baked rural New South Wales where her family owned land near Gunnedah. About 200km (124 miles) to the north, the people of Moree have been sweltering through an unprecedented heatwave. The temperature in the farming town that sits atop rich black-soil plains exceeded 35C every day in January, a record in New South Wales, beating the previous benchmark of 17 consecutive days. Meteorologists believe it could near another record this week - seven successive days above 40C. ""We are sick of it,"" said Katrina Humphries, the mayor of the Moree Plains Shire Council. ""Our son Robert and daughter-in-law Jacqueline moved back to Norfolk [in England] a couple of years ago because the heat here was so horrific. ""We slow down a lot though the middle of the day and look forward to the day when it cools down and we get some rain."" It's the very young, infirm and those over the age of 75 who are most risk from searing temperatures. Heat-related illness, which can occur when body temperature exceeds 37.8C, includes dehydration, cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. The consequences can be catastrophic, resulting in heart attacks, brain damage and death. Finding out exactly how the heat has killed an individual is often hard because many victims have pre-existing medical conditions, which can be exacerbated when it is very hot. In early January, a Virgin Australia pilot died of dehydration and exhaustion while quad-biking in the Beerburrum State Forest, north of Brisbane. It was reported that 30-year old Matthew Hall's body temperature had reached 42C, which caused his organs to shut down. He died of critical heat stroke, two weeks before his wife was due to give birth to their first child. More than 500 people die of heat stress across the nation each year, according to the Australia Medical Association. The symptoms of heat exhaustion include a rapid heart rate, headaches, nausea and fainting. A heat-stressed koala is given water amid sweltering conditions in Adelaide last summer As the mercury climbs, spare a thought for those workers who have to endure roasting conditions on roofs, building sites or fuel depots, although they should be protected by strict health and safety laws. ""If it is 38C you are supposed to be not working,"" Tony Sheldon, the head of the Transport Workers Union, told the BBC. ""There are a number of precautions that should be taken; hydration, proper clothing, rest periods. It is critical that people have those opportunities to get out of the heat and they have a legal right to do that."" Australia's Bureau of Meteorology defines a heatwave as ""three days or more of high maximum and minimum temperatures that is unusual for that location"". This video can not be played Dr Angie Bone of Public Health England offers some tips and dispels some myths on staying cool Conservationists have argued that Australia's fabled alfresco lifestyle could be in jeopardy because more severe heat could restrict the amount of time people can safely spend outside. Scientists, too, believe that the world's driest inhabited continent is becoming hotter. ""There is clear evidence that heatwaves are intensifying in Australia. The overall trend in heatwaves is caused by global warming,"" said Andy Pitman, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System, a collaboration of various universities and research organisations. Victoria's catastrophic 2009 bushfires, dubbed Black Saturday, killed 173 people ""I was recently in southern Sicily and no-one was out and about in the extreme heat - activities took place in the morning and evening. One can imagineâ¦ problems for sports that take all day [cricket, for example]. There are also major economic risks - human productivity drops off in the heat, so construction is already at risk. Agriculture is threatened by extreme heat, too."" As the latest blanket of oppressive heat and humidity smothered Sydney, the city seemed to slip into slow-motion to cope, although there were some die-hard runners pounding the pavements. ""Ah, I'm not too bad, mate,"" said one man, his face lobster-red and shirt dripping with sweat. ""Us Aussies grew up with it, so it is not a big deal.""

Viewpoint: The trouble with diesel,"London has experienced a number of high pollution days recently The former head of the Downing Street policy unit, Camilla Cavendish, assesses government efforts to control traffic pollution. Last week, the Mayor of London issued his first ""black alert"" warning about air pollution. With pollution levels as high as they've been for five years, Londoners were advised to limit the amount of time they spent exercising outside. Today's pollution is usually invisible. But standing outside Sir John Cass Foundation School in the City of London, where some younger pupils had restricted time in the playground during the high pollution episode, we found parents who feel they can smell and taste it. ""It's a sad state of affairs when you've got to tell your kids not to breathe too deeply,"" said one father of two. ""Sadiq Khan (London's Mayor) really does need to ban diesel cars."" Another father drives a black cab: ""I drove in towards the school, and looking towards the city you couldn't see the top of the Gherkin. I was thinking that can't be fog, must be pollution. ""I can't wait until they bring out hybrids or something because I feel I'm contributing to the pollution obviously. So I'm doubly worried about it."" People are increasingly being warned about the dangers of diesel pollution I took a close interest in this problem when I was head of the Downing Street Policy Unit under David Cameron. One of my children is asthmatic, so I have followed the growing health evidence  - and the court battle. In November, after a series of challenges from an environmental law firm, the High Court ruled that the government must produce a credible plan to stop breaching air quality standards, by July of this year. Many things contribute to air pollution: central heating, wood burners, generators. But there is growing concern about diesel emissions from traffic. The government wants five major cities - Birmingham, Leeds, Southampton, Derby and Nottingham - to create clean zones which would charge some of the most polluting vehicles. In addition, London is creating an ultra-low emissions zone. But will this work? And will it be enough? Pollution monitors are in use in London's Oxford Street In 2012, the World Health Organization classified outdoor air pollution as a cause of cancer. The UK government estimates that the harm done by particulates, tiny particles we can't see, in shortening our lives is equivalent to 29,000 premature deaths a year. Add in nitrogen dioxide emissions, which, like particulates, are partly generated by diesel traffic, and that figure rises to about 40,000. This would make air pollution more deadly than obesity and alcoholism combined. We asked Frank Kelly, prof of environmental health at King's College London, what 29,000 premature deaths means. ""Everyone in the UK from birth is losing an average of six months off their life,"" he says. In practice, he explained, some individuals will suffer more than that, and some less. Prof Kelly also described the developing body of science. We have known for a long time that particulates could enter the lung. But new evidence links pollution to heart attacks, strokes, even dementia. There is also concern about the impact on children's development. Dr Satish Rao, consultant in respiratory medicine at Birmingham Children's Hospital, told us that traffic pollution can aggravate the symptoms of children who already have respiratory problems, but that it can also affect the lung growth of those who are healthy. A fog shrouded Piccadilly Circus in London in 1956 In 1952, worries about pollution reached a peak with the Great Smog which is said to have killed more than 4,000 Londoners. In 1956, Parliament passed the Clean Air Act to tackle smoke and sulphur dioxide. The Act required everyone to do their bit: factories had to make their chimneys higher, householders had to burn smokeless fuels, and the government moved some power stations out of cities. Today, many campaigners believe that we need a modern Clean Air Act with a similar combination of carrots and sticks, to tackle particulates and nitrogen dioxide. Such an Act could clean up trains, taxis and buses, widen the network of emissions zones, and subsidise drivers to scrap older diesel vehicles in favour of electric. We asked every campaigner we interviewed what this might cost. None would name a figure. But it would be expensive. Few people can afford to swap their diesel car or van for an electric model without subsidy. The Mayor of London has no legal powers to ban diesel cars from the city but he hopes to introduce a Â£10-a-day T-charge for the most polluting vehicles - broadly those registered before 2005 - on top of the congestion charge. Apart from charges, where else could the money been found? One option might be to unfreeze fuel duty. Last year, the Chancellor said this year's freeze is equivalent to a tax cut of Â£850m. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said that it will force the five cities (not London) to charge drivers of most buses and coaches and most diesel taxis, but not private cars. Councillor Lisa Trickett says Birmingham City Council may have to restrict car use However, councillor Lisa Trickett, cabinet member for air quality at Birmingham City Council, told us she thinks Birmingham may have to restrict private car use too, if the targets are to be met. That would be hugely controversial. Millions of us drive diesel cars, having been encouraged to buy them by successive governments on the basis that they have lower carbon emissions than petrol. The headache for government is that the UK is a leading manufacturer of diesel engines so bans on diesel could have an impact on the economy. And 95% of vans are currently diesel-powered. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, does not think that diesel has had its day. ""Diesel is the power trend, the engine for all the commercial vehicles; it will be around for some time,"" he says. ""And the diesel engines of today have got immeasurably cleaner than those of yesterday. What we need to do is continue to improve them so that you can address both the NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions, in the same way that we've addressed the particulate emissions, sulphur emissions, lead and petrol and so forth. It's an evolution of technology."" Registrations of new ultra-low emissions vehicles, such as plug-in electric cars, are rising Jim Farley, chief executive of Ford Europe, told us that the company produces both petrol and diesel engines in the UK, and that as long as we have flexible manufacturing, his operations can switch between both if customers demand it. Mr Farley also has his eye on the electric market. The UK already makes a quarter of Europe's electric cars, and the prime minister recently announced a new institute which will do groundbreaking research into batteries. So there is hope. But the stakes are rising. Today's pollution is largely invisible. But just because we can't see it, doesn't mean we should ignore it. Camilla Cavendish took a close interest in the problem when she was head of the Downing Street Policy Unit under David Cameron. She's been looking at the issue of air pollution forBBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Trump's new EU 'assault' and fairer rail fares,"As the world learns more about the tactics of the Trump administration, the Financial Times has been talking to the president's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro. Like his boss, he doesn't shrink from saying what he thinks. He accuses Germany of exploitinga ""grossly under-valued"" euro,external- which makes its exports cheaper - to gain an unfair trading advantage over other EU countries and the United States. He also confirms that negotiations about a trade deal between the EU and the US are dead. The FT says that while criticism of German policy during Barack Obama's presidency was ""cloaked in diplomatic language"", Mr Navarro's comments ""highlight an apparent willingness by the Trump administration to antagonise EU leaders"". The Daily Telegraph also leads on Mr Navarro's comments, which it calls ""incendiary"". Mr Trump's trade chief had""put the US on a collision course with Germany"",external, the paper added. It sees the comments as a ""new front in the president's assault on the EU"". A bid toend Britain's ""rip-off"" rail fares,externalwill represent the system's ""biggest overhaul in more than 30 years"", the Times says. Thousands of expensive long-distance fares will be scrapped from the National Rail database to ensure travellers get a cheaper deal, it says. A new website will make it easier for passengers,the Metro adds,external. The website is based on an algorithm mathematicians developed to quickly calculate whether there is a cheaper way to do things, the paper says. According to the Metro, the best deals are on trips over an hour long, as longer journeys offer more opportunities to tweak the route and ticketing. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, says current fares are ""baffling"" for passengers. The Times unveilsplans for a test that all newly qualified doctors,external- as well as doctors from abroad - would have to sit before they could practice in Britain. It's being proposed by the General Medical Council. The GMC's president tells the paper that the existing system, under which 34 British medical schools set their own criteria, is inherently unfair and fails to ensure that all doctors starting to practice meet common standards. The cost of ""health tourism"" is the main front page story for both the Daily Mail and the Sun. Both tell the story of a Nigerian woman who gave birth to quads in a London hospital and whose care will cost the NHS Â£500,000. She appears in a BBC documentary, ""Hospital"", which is on BBC Two tonight. The Sun says the failure to make health tourists pay for their care is an outrage and that the NHS is seen as""a soft touch"" worldwide,external. There is plenty of advice for MPs preparing to vote on Brexit. The Daily Express,externalhopes they'll respect the referendum result, while the Daily Mail says up to 100 MPs are ready to vote against triggering Article 50 and, in its words, defy the 16 million people who voted to leave the European Union. ""They still don't get it"",externalis the paper's headline. The Daily Telegraph says the speech by Labour's Sir Keir Starmer setting out why Remainers must accept the outcome of the referendum was ""soberly compelling"". The paper tips him as a future Labour leader. Meanwhile, the Guardian fears Britain's relationship with Europe is on course to collapse: it urges wavering MPs to ""get real and vote to stop this madness"". The paper,externalalso gives prominence to the gloomy predictions of the Resolution Foundation, which says this parliament could be the worst for living standards and inequality since the early 1980s. The campaigning think tank forecasts that rising inflation and a slowdown in jobs growth will hit poorest households hardest. The plight of Gerry and Kate McCann - who yesterday lost their libel case against a Portuguese former detective - is thefront page story in the Daily Mirror,external. The McCanns originally sued ex-police chief Goncalo Amaral after he wrote a book claiming they were responsible for their daughter Madeleine's disappearance. The paper says they now face a bill for legal costs estimated at Â£500,000. The Daily Telegraph says the result also raisesthe ""nightmare prospect"",externalthat the couple could be sued for damages by the former policeman. And finally, the Times reports that dozens offamilies in Cornwall could lose their homes,externalunder compulsory purchase orders to protect them from pollution. Cornwall council is considering - as a last resort - moving people out of areas where air pollution exceeds legal limits. It says that would be cheaper than a new road bypass costing tens of millions of pounds. In an editorial,external, the paper says this is the kind of eccentric idea that ends up on the table in local government when ministers refuse to take action. It urges the government to do more to reduce air pollution, which is linked to more than 40,000 deaths a year.

Skin trade,"Tim Steiner has an elaborate tattoo on his back that was designed by a famous artist and sold to a German art collector. When Steiner dies his skin will be framed - until then he spends his life sitting in galleries with his shirt off. ""The work of art is on my back, I'm just the guy carrying it around,"" says the 40-year-old former tattoo parlour manager from Zurich. A decade ago, his then girlfriend met a Belgian artist called Wim Delvoye, who'd become well known for his controversial work tattooing pigs. Delvoye told her he was looking for someone to agree to be a human canvas for a new work and asked if she knew anyone who might be interested. ""She called me on the phone, and I said spontaneously, 'I'd like to do that,'"" Steiner says. Two years later, after 40 hours of tattooing, the image spread across his entire back - a Madonna crowned by a Mexican-style skull, with yellow rays emanating from her halo. There are swooping swallows, red and blue roses, and at the base of Steiner's back two Chinese-style koi fish, ridden by children, can be seen swimming past lotus flowers. The artist has signed the work on the right hand side. Collectors can buy the pig skins tattooed by Wim Delvoye once the pigs have died of old age ""It's the ultimate art form in my eyes,"" Steiner says. ""Tattooers are incredible artists who've never really been accepted in the contemporary art world. Painting on canvas is one thing, painting on skin with needles is a whole other story."" The work, entitled TIM, sold for 150,000 euros (Â£130,000) to German art collector Rik Reinking in 2008, with Steiner receiving one third of the sum. ""My skin belongs to Rik Reinking now,"" he says. ""My back is the canvas, I am the temporary frame."" As part of the deal, when Steiner dies his back is to be skinned, and the skin framed permanently, taking up a place in Reinking's personal art collection. ""Gruesome is relative,"" Steiner says to those who find the idea macabre. ""It's an old concept - in Japanese tattoo history it's been done many, many times. If it's framed nicely and looks good, I think it's not such a bad idea."" Delvoye worked for 40 hours to complete the piece But this aspect of the work often sparks intense debate. ""It becomes a huge discussion matter every time, and those confrontations with people have been very exciting and interesting,"" Steiner says. ""People are either very into the idea, or say it's going too far - they're outraged or say it's against human rights. They come with ideas of slavery or prostitution."" Tim Steiner spoke to the BBC World Service programme Outlook in 2008 Listen to last year's edition ofOutlook Weekend: Skin As part of his contract, Steiner must exhibit the tattoo by sitting topless in a gallery at least three times a year. His first exhibition took place in Zurich in June 2006 - when the tattoo was still a work-in-progress. When the 10th anniversary fell last year, he was in the middle of his longest-ever exhibition, a whole year at the Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart, Tasmania, working five hours a day, six days a week. That came to an end on Tuesday. ""Sit on your desk, with your legs dangling off, straight backed and holding on to your knees for 15 minutes - it's tough,"" he says. ""I did this for 1,500 hours. It was by far the most outrageously intense experience of my life. ""All that changed throughout the days was my state of mind - sometimes heaven, sometimes hell, always totally alert."" The only thing separating Steiner from visitors to the gallery is a line on the floor - a line that that in the past some have crossed. ""I've been touched, blown on, screamed at, pushed and spat on, it's often been quite a circus,"" he says. ""But I wasn't touched a single time on this trip, it's a miracle."" Steiner takes in the view during his first stint at Mona in 2012 When people try to speak to him he doesn't move or reply. He just sits still. ""Many people think I'm a sculpture, and have quite a shock once they find out I'm actually alive,"" he says. But he rejects the idea that this is performance art. ""If the name Wim Delvoye was not attached to this tattoo, it would have no artistic relevance,"" he insists. It is part of Delvoye's intention, though, to show the difference between a picture on the wall and a ""living canvas"" that changes over time. ""I can get fat, scarred, burned, anything,"" Steiner says. ""It's the process of living. I've had two lower back operations."" One of the joys of working at Mona has been having the gallery to himself before opening time. ""To be in there by myself, with my headphones in, roaming around and doing my stretches surrounded by stunning art in this mystical building was surreal,"" he says. And he will be back there in November, for a six-month stint, after appearances in Denmark and Switzerland. ""This whole experience has convinced me that this is what I am here to do. Sit on boxes,"" he says. ""And one day TIM will just hang there. Beautiful.""

Premier League clubs net transfer profit,"Odion Ighalo, Robbie Brady, Manolo Gabbiadini and Mamadou Sakho were among the deadline-day deals Premier League clubs have recorded a transfer window profit for the first time - despite spending reaching a six-year January high of Â£215m. Southampton and Burnley made late deadline-day deals, while Odion Ighalo moved from Watford to China for Â£20m. Saints paid about Â£14m for Napoli's Manolo Gabbiadini, and the Clarets signed Robbie Brady for up to Â£13m However, top-flight sides brought in Â£40m more than they paid out, according to finance analysts Deloitte. All the deadline-day deal as they happened - plus the rest of January's transfers Track every Premier League transfer, day by day Latest transfer gossip Premier League teams have spent a record Â£1.38bn on transfers in the 2016-17 season, after a summer outlay of Â£1.165bn. Spending in January 2017 is the second highest - behind the record mark of Â£225m six years ago - and dwarfs the Â£35m spent in the first January transfer window in 2003. While the window is now closed for the major European leagues, there could still be departures as big-spending China has an official deadline of 28 February. All figures based on transfers reported as at 00:30 GMT on 1 February Deadline-day sales were led by Nigeria strikerIghalo, 27, moving to Chinese Super League club Changchun Yatai. Burnley were one of the busier sides, recruiting 25-year-old Republic of Ireland internationalBradyfrom Norwich for a club-record fee having earlier snapped up another midfielder, Ashley Westwood, from Aston Villa. Southampton bolstered their attacking options by bringing inGabbiadini,25, while Crystal Palace secured Liverpool centre-back Mamadou Sakho on loan and signed Serbia midfielder Luka Milivojevic from Greek side Olympiakos. Swansea City signed Aston Villa forward Jordan Ayew in aswap dealthat saw Wales defender Neil Taylor go the other way. Several mooted moves did not go through on a relatively low-key day, with Celtic keeper Craig Gordon and striker Moussa Dembele staying with the Scottish champions despite reported interest from Chelsea. Sunderland, thwarted in their attempts to signforward Leonardo Ulloafrom Premier League champions Leicester City, had a bid of about Â£12m rejected by Southampton for forward Jay Rodriguez. Dembele tweeted a photo of Leonardo DiCaprio delivering the ""I'm not leaving"" speech from the Wolf of Wall Street film, with himself in a similar pose Championship clubs spent a record Â£40m on deadline day, led by Aston Villa signing forwardScott Hoganfrom Brentford for a fee that could reach Â£12m. Wigan sold winger Yanic Wildschut to Norwich for Â£7m, but they ended the day witheight new players. Sheffield Wednesday have to wait until Wednesday to see if their Â£9.5m move for Middlesbrough striker Jordan Rhodes had gone through in time. Midfielder Ravel Morrison returned to QPR on a late loan deal from Italian side Lazio, and highly rated West Ham defender Reece Oxford, 18, moved to Reading on loan for the rest of the season. Bristol City teased their rivals Rovers, who are based four miles away StrikerMatty Taylorcaused a stir by leaving Bristol Rovers, where he has scored 19 times this season, for local rivals Bristol City - the first time a player has done so since 1987. Championship side City wasted no time in winding up their League One foes, with manager Lee Johnson saying: ""It'll be a big step up in standard for him."" Meanwhile, Neil Danns' tour of the clubs of the north west beginning with a B saw him tick off Blackpool. The midfielder's loan deal from Bury follows spells at Bolton and Blackburn. He has also squeezed in Birmingham City and Bristol City along the way. Everton were the Premier League club to spend the most on a single player, paying Manchester United Â£22m forFrance midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin. However, the biggest fee was the Â£60m paid to Chelsea by Chinese Super League side Shanghai SIPG forBrazil attacking midfielder Oscar. Also departing the Premier League was Dimitri Payet - with West Ham accusing the France forward of lacking ""commitment and respect"" as he rejoined Marseille for Â£25m. The top six sides did not shell out - the only new purchase among the leading sides being Arsenal's surprise signing of left-backCohen Bramallfrom non-league Hednesford Town for Â£40,000. He had just been made redundant from his job in a car factory before a trial with the Gunners. Premier League clubs spent Â£215m to buy new players in the January window, recording a net transfer profit of Â£40m compared with a net spend of Â£100m last year. The bottom six clubs accounted for half of total expenditure, with sides in the bottom half of the table spending Â£145m (67% of total expenditure). Deadline-day spending by top-flight clubs totalled Â£60m, up Â£20m on last year, and the second-highest ever after Â£135m in 2011. Championship sides spent a total of Â£80m, a big increase on last year's total of Â£35m and a new record for a January transfer window for the division. The Â£40m spent on deadline day was the same amount spent by Premier League clubs on deadline day in January 2016. The Premier League was once again the highest-spending league in European football. The next highest was France's Ligue 1, with total transfer expenditure of about Â£130m. ""The sales of Oscar, Dimitri Payet, Odion Ighalo and Memphis Depay, as well as around Â£20m worth of sales to Championship clubs, have helped Premier League clubs record net receipts for the first time in a transfer window,"" said Deloitte spokesman Dan Jones. ""As was the case last year, it is clubs in the bottom half of the table who have driven expenditure this January, investing in their squads in an attempt to secure survival."" Andy Brassell, European football expert Germanydoesn't really get the last-minute English spirit of deadline day, with the Bundesliga wrapping things up at the civilised hour of 6pm local time as usual. Bayern Munich made a pair of big signings in Hoffenheim's Niklas Sule and Sebastian Rudy, but they won't arrive until summer. Borussia Dortmund moved quickly to snap up 17-year-old Sweden striker Alexander Isak and Bayer Leverkusen also spent big on a youngster on deadline day, paying 12m euros (Â£10.3m) for Jamaican teenager Leon Bailey from Genk. Thank goodness, then, forTurkey'staste for the grand gesture, with champions Besiktas and surprise title-chasers Baskasehir both going for striking experience in Demba Ba (on loan from Shanghai Shenhua) and Emmanuel Adebayor (free agent) respectively. Former Arsenal, Manchester City, Tottenham and Crystal Palace striker Emmanuel Adebayor was a free agent It was a quiet window for Serie A inItaly, with Juventus spending big on young talent but parking it for the future; for example, Mattia Caldara, a 15m euro (Â£12.9m) signing, is staying with his current club Atalanta on loan. With Barcelona typically quiet and Real Madrid barred from involvement, it was similarly sedate inSpain.Villarreal's sale of Alexandre Pato to Tianjin Quanjian for 18m euros (Â£15.4m) was comfortably the biggest transfer in La Liga, though Jese's loan move to his hometown club of Las Palmas was a romantic subplot on deadline day. Francewas busier than usual this winter, with Julian Draxler (36m euros/Â£30.8m) and Goncalo Guedes (30m euros/Â£25.7m) both joining Paris St-Germain for big fees, and Lyon splashing out on Memphis Depay (18m euros/Â£15m). On deadline day it was Lille, under new ownership, who were busiest, signing no less than six in a frenetic 24 hours, led by winger Anwar El Ghazi from Ajax for 8m euros (Â£6.9m).

No... it's not Trump's brother,"Okay, you've probably guessed it. This isn't Donald Trump's Kenyan half-brother. But that hasn't stopped the internet having a good laugh at this man's uncannily Trump-esque locks. When the photo was shared on American comedian and radio host Ricky Smiley's Facebook page back in January, hundreds joined in on the comments, and thousands more shared the post. And that's not the only comedy meme. Another makes the claim that the man in the photo is one 'Nyirongo Trump' of Malawi. But who is the man in the memes? Well, we've had a dig round and we've deduced his identity. Are you ready? It is in fact Ghanaian president Nana Akufo-Addo. A reverse image search on the meme led Trending to the original - un-Photoshopped - image, where he is seen greeting a celebrity supporter of his New Patriotic Party (NPP), Ghanaian actor Kofi Adu. Nana Akufo-Addo meeting Ghanaian actor Kofi Adu So how many have picked up on the man's true identity? On the original Rickey Smiley show Facebook post, out of 311 comments, only two people seem to have noticed that the man is, in fact, the Ghanaian president. Despite not being Trump's half-brother, President Addo has been nicknamed 'Nana Trump' by some of his supporters, mainly due to the fact that his campaign and inauguration happened in very close time-proximity to President Trump's. And it seems that the meme traces its origin back to an image that was shared by some of his supporters back in December, with the text ""Nana Trump: Make Ghana great again"". Mystery solved.

Tim Bowler: Will globalisation take away your job?1 February 2017 (00:11:36),"Protests against globalisation have become increasingly common Millions around the globe may have taken to the streets in recent years to protest against the impact of globalisation on their jobs and communities - but this backlash is only likely to grow as globalisation itself becomes more disruptive. The stark warning comes from Richard Baldwin, president of the Centre for Economic Policy Research think-tank, who has been studying global trade for the past 30 years. Technological advances could now mean white-collar, office-based workers and professionals are at risk of losing their jobs, Prof Baldwin argues. In the US, voter anger with globalisation may have led to Donald Trump's election victory, but those who voted for him could be disappointed as his aim of bringing back jobs is unlikely to work, says Prof Baldwin, who also worked as an economist under President George HW Bush. Robots are now increasingly used in surgery; the first transatlantic operation - with the patient in France and surgeons in the US - was carried out in 2001 Protectionist trade barriers won't work in the 21st Century, he says. ""Knowledge crossing borders in massive amounts [is the] big new disruptive thing."" It's going to help people in Africa and Asia compete more effectively with people in the West, as communication advances mean workers in the developing world will be able to control robots to do jobs in Europe and the US at lower cost, he says. Developing world labour costs can be a tenth of what they are in the West, says Prof Baldwin. ""They can't get here to take the jobs but technology will soon allow virtual migration, thanks to telerobotics and telepresence."" Some of the first post-war Jamaican migrants to the UK - future migration could well be virtual Ever-faster internet speeds becoming globally more widely available, coupled with the rapidly falling prices of robots will allow workers, for example in the Philippines or China, to remotely provide services to a country like the UK - where the sector accounts for about 80% of the economy. ""What it will do is unbundle our jobs and change the nature of our occupation. Some of the things you do absolutely require your judgement - but parts of your job could be off-shored, just as some stages in a factory can be off-shored. ""All you need is more computing power, more transmitting power and cheaper robots - and all that is happening."" This video can not be played Could 'virtual migration' hit middle class jobs? Security guards in US shopping malls could be replaced by robots controlled by security personnel based in Peru, and hotel cleaners in Europe could be replaced by robots driven by staff based in the Philippines, he argues in his book The Great Convergence. The use of robots has grown exponentially since the mid-20th Century. A Ford factory in 1914; the development of robots has radically altered such production lines... ...now spot the workers; this is a BMW production line in the UK in 2013 A typical industrial robot can cost about Â£4 an hour to operate, compared to average total European labour costs of about Â£40 an hour - or Â£9 an hour in China. And robots are getting cheaper to buy and are increasingly able to do more complex tasks. This means the increased use of robots is also threatening millions of jobs in developing countries, says theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development,external(Unctad), as well as in developed economies. And it's not just in factories; the worldwide number of domestic household robots will rise to 31 million between 2016 and 2019, says theInternational Federation of Robotics,external(IFR), with sales of robots for cleaning floors, mowing lawns, and cleaning swimming pools forecast to grow to about $13bn (Â£10.3bn) in this period. Napoleon's defeat in 1815 after almost 25 years of war triggered a growth in world trade In the 19th Century, the first wave of the industrial revolution triggered an upsurge in global trade. Steam power, the end of the Napoleonic wars and the subsequent era of peace cut the costs of moving goods internationally. Global wealth became increasingly concentrated among just a few nations; the G7 group - the US, Germany, Japan, France, the UK, Canada and Italy - saw their share of the world's wealth rise significantly. But from the 1990s a second wave of globalisation kicked in, with the rise of information and communications technology. There's been a dramatic change of gear, and ""a century's worth of rich nations' rise has been reversed in just two decades,"" says Prof Baldwin. Old-style globalisation ""worked on a calendar that ticked year by year"" whereas the current wave of globalisation is being driven by IT which is changing and disrupting economies and societies with increasing rapidity, he says. All of this has created a backlash, especially in developed economies, as many voters say they are losing out or seeing little of the benefits that globalisation supposedly brings. Globalisation has sparked protests around the world... Prof Baldwin says protectionist policies, such as those of Donald Trump, are ultimately counterproductive. If firms become inefficient by being forced to move jobs back to the US, then ultimately they will lose their business to international competitors. ""People are so angry they are doing things that are not in their own interest. ""Cures are being sold which are not related to the problem."" Globalisation has been a factor in the election of Donald Trump in the US... ...and the UK's vote to leave the European Union He points out that the backlash is not the same in every single country. It often depends on how governments deal with workers who may be displaced by technology. ""For instance, in Japan they take care of their workers, and there really isn't an anti-globalisation feeling there,"" he says - unlike in the UK and the US. As a consequence, even businesses that are benefiting from greater automation are increasingly sensitive about the potentially negative social and political consequences. Increasingly sophisticated robots mean many jobs that used to exist are not going to return, says Prof Baldwin Similarly, in Europe the bosses of bothDeutsche Telekom,externalandSiemens,externalhave advocated paying a basic income to workers replaced by technology. We may see a move to protectionism as countries try to preserve jobs within their economies, but this is unlikely to work in the long term, says Prof Baldwin. The trick is to accept ""21st Century reality"", he says, and the fact that many jobs simply aren't going to come back. Protesters in Bordeaux with a banner reading ""together against unemployment and social precariousness"" Governments need to pay more attention to social policy, says Prof Baldwin. ""In the post-war period of globalisation we liberalised trade but at the same time we expanded social welfare - instituted low-cost education and retraining for workers. ""In essence there was a set of complementary policies that reassured workers that they would have a good chance of taking advantage of globalisation."" The challenges all this is throwing up for governments are many, but Prof Baldwin says it should be possible to develop policies that embrace globalisation - and give workers displaced by it the support they need.

Jenny Hill: Germany's rising tide of populism31 January 2017 (01:43:05),"Germany's Baltic coastline can be a bleak place out of season. In the small fishing village of Freest, boats creak idly against their moorings. A lone fisherman, stark in his yellow overalls, stands on deck, scraping the scales from yesterday's catch. It feels a long way from Berlin. And inside the quayside smokehouse, as she carefully threads sprats on to long metal skewers, fish factory worker Ines tells me she feels forgotten by Angela Merkel's government. ""They just look after the big cities,"" she says. ""But these small communities up here - no. Nothing is being done for us. Nothing gets through to us."" It can be hard to make a good living here, especially in the winter. The workers in the smokehouse worry about unemployment. This is not a rich community and they feel it's time for political change. Fertile ground then for Germany's right wing, anti-Islam party Alternative for Germany (AfD). A regular poll for the national broadcaster suggests it would take 15% of the vote if the general election was held tomorrow. Ines. who works in a smoked fish factory, says she feels forgotten by the German government The party may well complicate coalition building come the autumn. Angela Merkel's CDU party still leads those polls at 37%, but her junior coalition partner, the SPD, is at 20% Roland delivers another load of slippery, silvery fish to the smokehouse. He pushes his woolly cap off and tells me AfD will be getting his vote. ""The other parties avoid the real problems,"" he explains. ""Merkel just sticks to her views, even though she sees what she's got us into - like the terror attacks. If she hadn't brought those people into the country,"" he insists, ""the victims of the Berlin Christmas markets would still be alive."" What does Alternative for Germany want? Angela Merkel's CDU suffers Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania poll blow Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Profile: German right-wing AfD leader Frauke Petry Freest is in the northern state of Mecklenburg Vorpommern. It is also home to Mrs Merkel's constituency. Last year AfD beat her Conservatives into third place in the regional election and now, they want to compound that humiliation by putting up a candidate - Leif-Erik Holm - directly against her. Mr Holm, a smartly-dressed former radio presenter who believes a large proportion of Europe's Muslims hold radical views and want to establish a global caliphate, is, in reality, unlikely to take the chancellor's seat. But it's not impossible. ""We have a big problem with radical Islam and we need to talk about it,"" he tells me. ""It's been taboo in Germany. The AfD broke that taboo and thank heavens people now talk about their fears. Just look at who's carrying out terror attacks in Europe, they're all extreme Islamists."" ""We don't create fear. We talk about it,"" says the AfD's Leif-Erik Holm It is AfD's vociferous anti-Islam, anti-migrant position which, critics argue, is key to its success. Certainly, support for what originally began as an anti-euro party surged during the latter part of the refugee crisis, as party leaders began to campaign against Mrs Merkel's asylum policy. But Mr Holm rejects the notion that AfD is a one issue party, seeking political gain by whipping up fear of Muslim immigrants. ""During the regional election hustings we spoke with people in small towns and villages and realised fear was the most prominent theme. We don't create fear, we talk about it - the everyday fear that people have of terrorism, of uncontrolled mass immigration. ""That's what we work with as politicians. We make politics for the people."" Geert Wilders, Frauke Petry and Marine Le Pen recently shared a platform in the German city of Koblenz AfD's anti-EU rhetoric is also growing louder as it seeks to emulate the success of the giants of Europe's far right. It recently hosted a rally of the right in the German city of Koblenz, sharing a stage - and a platform - with the French presidential candidate Marine le Pen and Geert Wilders, whose Freedom Party leads the polls ahead of the Dutch general election. Both Ms Le Pen and Mr Wilders have pledged referendums on EU membership. AfD's manifesto now promises to pull Germany out if significant structural reforms are not implemented. During the rally (from which the mainstream German broadcasters and press were banned) its leader Frauke Petry likened the EU to Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union and joined Ms Le Pen and Mr Wilders in their calls for a revolution in Europe. This was a show of solidarity, a display of unity from Europe's right. Emboldened by Brexit and Donald Trump's victory, the leaders are keen to focus on the threefold message which unites them; a visceral dislike of Islam, a loathing of Mrs Merkel's refugee policy and that contempt for the EU. And they believe 2017 will be their year. Angela Merkel is to stand for a fourth term as chancellor It's hard to say whether they create, reflect or exploit social division, but an interesting recent German survey gave a fascinating glimpse into what might motivate AfD supporters. The poll found, for example, that despite last year's terror attack in Berlin, 73% of those polled felt safe in Germany. But when the researchers asked AfD supporters, they found that only 34% felt secure. Similarly, when asked whether life is better or worse than 50 years ago, 17% of Germans said it is worse, but this figure rises to 40% among AfD supporters. In 2017, Europe's real election battles will take place in communities like Freest, where people feel forgotten by their national governments and left behind by establishment parties. If Europe's leaders want to halt the rise of the right, they must reconnect with those voters and regain their trust. Because in this windblown harbour on the German coast, those who feel left out in the cold are warming to what Europe's right already refer to (prematurely perhaps) as the ""patriotic spring"".

Aleppo's online student,"Mariam has to study by candlelight and use a shop's generator to charge up her computer Mariam Hammad, despite every adversity of war and hardship, is trying to be a student in Aleppo in the dark heart of Syria's civil war. ""My city has turned to ruins,"" she says. Despite being in constant danger, forced out of her home twice by shelling and living without regular supplies of electricity or water, this 22-year-old has refused to give up being a student. Four years ago, she had just left school and begun at the University of Aleppo when it was hit by rockets, killing dozens of students around her. ""I saw my friends killed and still now I can't forget what happened,"" Mariam says. ""I saw a lot of students hurt and injured. There was blood, death. Everything was terrible."" There was intense danger at home too. ""I came so near to death many times,"" Mariam says. ""My family and I rented a house that was only 500m from the front lines, and a lot of rockets fell in my neighbourhood. Mariam has refused to give up her ambition to be a student and get a degree ""Many of my neighbours were killed, and mortars hit my home twice."" She remembers waking during an attack, unable to see in the dust and darkness and not knowing who was alive or dead. Mariam talks of life in Aleppo becoming a mix of ""horror and danger"". ""I was crying so much when I saw my city in front of my eyes, everything destroyed,"" she says. But her reaction has been to stubbornly carry on and to use her studies as a way of honouring those who have died. She became an online student in a warzone, following a degree course run by the US-basedUniversity of the People,external, making a conscious decision to be ""optimistic"" and to make plans to ""rebuild"". This week in Aleppo the temperature has fallen below 0C But this is far from straightforward, she says over a patchy Skype line. ""The hardest thing about being a student in Aleppo? Actually, it's being alive,"" Mariam says. There are still occasional rockets and mortar blasts, despite a ceasefire, but there are also big practical problems that would have put off a less determined student. ""We haven't had electricity for two years,"" she says. Instead, people rely on generators that might operate for a few hours at a time. Mariam goes to a local shop with a small generator, where it can take 12 hours to charge up her mobile phone and an old laptop, and then she ekes out the charge so she can study. Families are living in the wreckage of their city Internet connections are sporadic and weak - and when an exam was approaching, there was an internet blackout. Worried that she would be failed, Mariam began to make preparations to travel to Damascus to find a way of sitting the exam. Even by the standards of a civil war, she says, this would have been extremely dangerous, but friends managed to make contact with the university, and she was able to re-arrange the exam.

You can join the debate at theBBC's Family & Education News Facebook page,external. Heat and light are daily challenges, particularly in winter, with temperatures in Aleppo below freezing this week. Water is available only every three or four weeks. ""When we have water, we store huge amounts,"" she says, filling every container. There have been long battles between government and rebel armies in Aleppo, but there are also forces of the so-called Islamic State not far from the city. Mariam says they tried to cut a road to the city a few days ago - but she says there is also the battle of ideas and the need to protect the right to education. Their presence makes her even more determined to keep studying. Despite the dangers, the hunger for education has remained in Aleppo While the high technology of war has rained down on Syria, this young woman has to study at night by candlelight. But she doesn't complain. Instead, she talks with understated longing for one single ""normal day"" as a student. And what would she do with it? ""I want to do a lot of things in this day,"" she says. ""I want to go to my university like any normal student. I want to go with my friends. I want to sit with my family."" She pauses. ""And I want to see everyone I lost,"" she says. But in the face of such awful destruction, why is she worrying about getting a degree? Mariam says the experience of war has made education seem even more important - something positive that links people to the chance of rebuilding a better life. Carrying bread in the streets of Aleppo ""We have this strong motivation to seek it no matter what,"" she says. ""You can see that in young children going to their schools, even though they can be hit at any time."" ""Education was always important in my life. ""It gives me hope that I can have a better future. ""It will help me to rebuild my country and everything that's been destroyed."" Mariam is studying a business degree with the University of the People, based in California, which supports people around the world who otherwise would not have access to university - including 15 students in Aleppo. The ceasefire has made it safer for civilians to walk in the street The online university, backed by the likes of the Gates Foundation, Hewlett Packard and Google, offers accredited four-year degree courses, taught by volunteer academics and retired university staff. The university's president, Shai Reshef, says: ""We are an alternative for those who have no other alternative."" Mariam sees her studying as a kind of lifeline and source of hope - and she says any other students around the world should appreciate the chances they have. Students were killed when the University of Aleppo was hit in 2013 She can only dream of having a ""normal life like them"". ""I hope that whoever sees my story will not be discouraged by difficulties they face,"" she says. ""I believe that after every hardship comes a great rebirth, and in honour of ever friend, neighbour and Syrian who lost his life due to this war, we must stay optimistic."" And if that faith wavers? ""If I feel down, my mother says to me, 'This will pass.'""

The blue roomThe secret at the heart of chimp smuggling," A secret network of wildlife traffickers selling baby chimpanzees has been exposed by a year-long BBC News investigation. The tiny animals are seized from the wild and sold as pets. The BBC’s research uncovered a notorious West African hub for wildlife trafficking, known as the “blue room”, and led to the rescue of a one-year-old chimp. In a dusty back street of Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s largest city, a tiny chimpanzee cries out for comfort. His black hair is ruffled and his dirty nappy scrapes the concrete floor as he crawls towards the familiar figures of the men who have been holding him captive. The baby chimp, ripped away from his family in the wild, is the victim of a lucrative and brutal smuggling operation, exposed by a 12-month-long BBC News investigation spanning half a dozen countries. In demand as pets in wealthy homes or as performers in commercial zoos, baby chimpanzees command a price tag of $12,500, a little under £10,000, but sometimes more. Each capture of a live infant like this one exacts a terrible cost on chimp populations. The usual tactic used by poachers is to shoot as many of the adults in a family as possible. This prevents them from resisting the capture of the baby and their bodies can then be sold as bushmeat. To obtain one infant alive, up to 10 adults are typically slaughtered. “One has to kill the mother, one has to kill the father,” explained Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, an expert in wildlife crime with Ivory Coast Police. “If our ancestors had killed them, nowadays we wouldn't even know about chimpanzees.” Once captured, these baby chimps then enter a sophisticated chain that stretches from the poachers in the jungles to middlemen, who arrange false export permits and transport, and ultimately to the buyers. The animals are in high demand in the Gulf states, south-east Asia and China, with buyers prepared to pay high prices and additional fees to help bypass international controls. And while they may be well looked-after while they are young, chimpanzees soon become too strong and potentially violent to be kept in a home. Karl Ammann, a Swiss wildlife activist who campaigns against chimp trafficking, describes it as a “kind of slavery” and warns that when chimps cease being cute infants, they face a terrible fate. “They still have 90% of their life ahead of them,” he said. “They get locked in some cage and maybe even killed in some cases because they have outlived their useful pet stage. That for me is just impossible to accept.” The baby chimp discovered by the BBC had been bought from a poacher, according to one account, for 300 Euros (£257). But it was rescued en route as a result of our research - leading Interpol officials and Ivorian detectives to expose a major trafficking ring. After months of work building relationships with dealers across a number of countries, our team tracked down the smuggling ringleaders to a house in Abidjan. Posing as prospective buyers, undercover reporters confirmed the infant chimp was at the property before alerting Interpol and local police who were waiting nearby. During the police operation, a small room about the size of a shower cubicle was discovered, decorated with small blue tiles. Inside it, they found a tiny chimp cowering in a wooden crate. The discovery was not only a moment of liberation for the little animal, but also a crucial turning point in a long search by wildlife campaigners to track down a notorious “blue room”, known to be used as a holding pen by traffickers and constantly restocked. For years, when dealers had circulated videos showing captive baby chimpanzees ready for sale, the same distinctive blue tiles were visible. Understood to be in West Africa, no-one knew which country it might be in, let alone which city, until our research led police to it. This revelation provides new insight into the potential scale of loss suffered by great apes, including chimpanzees. An estimated 3,000great apes, including orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees, are lost from the wild every yearas a result of illegal trade, according to the UN Environment Programme. They are either sold, killed during the hunt or die in captivity. About two thirds of the apes lost are chimpanzees - an endangered species. Western chimpanzees, like the one freed in Abidjan, are judged to be especially vulnerable, so are categorised as critically endangered. There are no more than 65,000 left and probably far fewer. Some1,800 apes were seized by authorities in 23 countries while being traffickedbetween 2005 and 2011, according to the Great Ape Survival Partnership, an alliance of more than 100 governments and other organisations. A quarter of those apes rescued were chimps. Although it is unknown how many smuggled apes reach their destinations undetected, the BBC’s investigation suggests the total is almost certain to be higher than previously thought. The illegal trade in great apes is made possible by the determination of the smugglers and the ease with which international laws on buying and selling endangered species can be evaded. Trading of endangered wild animals and plants is tightly controlled under the Cites agreement - theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora- which aims to protect all wildlife under threat. Under the convention, chimpanzees, which are awarded the highest level of protection (a listing under what is known as Appendix 1), can only be exported under a very limited number of exemptions. For example, the animals need to have been bred in captivity (which is not known to happen in West Africa) and exporting and importing organisations need to be registered with Cites. Despite this, the BBC’s investigation revealed that with the right money and the right connections the smuggling networks can evade these controls. In fact, our team was able to buy two permits to export chimps for $4,000 each. Posing as buyers for a client in Thailand, the team obtained their first permit in the Egyptian capital Cairo, which has long been known as a centre for animal trafficking. Our undercover reporter began negotiations over a secure messaging service with two pet traders, Mahmoud Khaled and Ramadan Abdelnaiem. The pair shared videos of infant chimps held inside the infamous blue-tiled room and offered to secure Cites permits allowing the animals to be exported. Khaled even promised to provide video footage of the chimp’s progress en route to its destination. “When [the] thing is shipped and put in boxes, you will receive a video,” he said. “When it goes to the airport, you receive a video, when it lands at the airport, you will receive a video. [When] it is shipped, you will receive a video. When it is put in the airplane, you receive a video...” While Khaled offered to obtain a Cites Appendix 1 permit, enabling the export of chimps, Ramadan suggested an alternative technique: getting permits for less endangered animals and then hiding the chimps among them. Both these methods are recognised by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime as “wildlife laundering”, when smugglers use fraudulent paperwork or mix protected species with legal shipments of wildlife. A video sent to the BBC’s undercover team by a dealer in West Africa shows how chimps and other endangered animals are smuggled in secret compartments in specially-designed crates. Here, this baby chimpanzee was hidden below animals including parrots, civet cats and mongoose which have less protection in international law. The shipment was made from West Africa and destined for Nepal. The chimp shown in this video, however, never made it. Messages found on the dealer’s mobile phone revealed that the chimpanzee had died, still hidden in the crate in transit at Istanbul airport. The BBC undercover team accepted Khaled’s offer and picked up the Appendix 1 permit two weeks later. Clumsily filled-in, with spelling mistakes and other inaccuracies, it appeared to be signed and stamped by a Jordanian government official. It showed our fake address and a simple internet search would have revealed it was not a Cites-registered institution. The next step was to see if we could arrange to buy the chimps, but at this point Khaled, called the deal off, afraid of being exposed. With the Egyptian deal fallen through, the team decided to deal directly with the source of the chimpanzees in West Africa. This time pretending to be an Indonesian pet shop acting for wealthy clients, our team made contact with a young dealer in Guinea called Ibrahima Traore. Again communicating over a secure messaging service, the team built up a relationship with Traore, aged just 22, who began to send us videos of chimpanzees -  once more in the setting of the blue room. It became clear that the room was being constantly re-stocked. Traore said he could sell us one or two baby chimps as well as a Cites permit. This time, the document the BBC team received looked genuine, though it was falsely filled in, and was signed and stamped by the national parks of Liberia. As the relationship with Traore developed, he began to reveal the scale of his illegal operation. He said he held chimpanzees at farms in Guinea, his home country, as well as in Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ivory Coast. In a conversation filmed secretly, Traore boasted of being able to circumvent international controls and having “someone important on the inside”. “I’m not afraid - you can import everywhere you want - send everywhere you want,” he said. Traore also told of how he shipped chimpanzees without any Cites documentation at all - by hiding them amongst other less-protected animals. One of his videos demonstrated how to smuggle chimps in secret compartments. Confronted with the BBC’s evidence, the secretary-general of Cites, John Scanlon, said that while he wasn’t shocked by the ease with which fraudulent permits for the export of baby chimps were purchased, he was “dismayed”. Although he believed the permit system was “sound and secure” overall, he said there were instances, particularly in West and Central Africa, where there was “an abuse of permits”. “There is corruption in the system,” he told the BBC. “We’ve brought it to the attention of our governments at a standing committee meeting several months ago. We said if we can’t get a handle on corruption, we are not going to stop illegal trade in wildlife.” For this reason, Cites was pushing to introduce an electronic system of permissions that would be harder to fake, he explained. “These things are not easy, but we are onto it, we are seeing it and we are doing our best.” But, despite this, Mr Scanlon said he did not believe there was a surge in the illegal trade in great apes, including chimpanzees. “If we did, I can assure you there would be a rush of attention to this issue and a rush of resources to stop it, but we are not seeing it,” he said. He stressed that wherever the abuse of permits was observed, the governments of those countries implicated were warned and punished. There were about 30 trade suspensions currently in place, he confirmed. Law enforcement efforts, however, appear to lag far behind the rates of illegal trade. Just 27 arrests were made in Africa and Asia in connection with the great ape trade between 2005 and 2011, and one-quarter of the arrests never led to prosecutions prosecuted, according to the UN Environment Programme. At Interpol, which facilitates international law enforcement cooperation, wildlife smuggling is a priority, but national governments have stipulated that the funding and investigative effort should be focused on the highest-profile threats, such as the slaughter of elephants and rhinos. David Higgins, manager of Interpol’s Environmental Security Unit, admitted the region of West Africa had not been a priority - and nor had the smuggling of great apes. Because such crimes did not threaten the economic well-being of a country, or its political stability, they did not compel governments to respond, he said, and the resources were simply not there. “Without the funding, we can’t do anything,” he said. “So with primates, unfortunately, our information is not as strong as it could be.” He urged states to step up and offer the required financial investment. “Yes, we need the global community’s attention on this and we call upon that level of support.” Back in Ivory Coast, it was the trafficking ringleader, Ibrahima Traore, who eventually led our reporters - and Interpol - to the blue room. He sent a video of the baby chimp and himself inside the room holding a piece of paper showing the date at the time of the deal - to show that the footage was genuine and that the animal had previously been captured and was ready for sale. His face was clearly visible and he seemed not to worry about incriminating himself. Days later our undercover reporter visited the property - purportedly to discuss arrangements for buying the chimpanzee - where they confirmed its presence and tipped off police. Ibrahima Traore was arrested and, along with his uncle Mohamed, is facing charges related to wildlife trafficking. The data captured from his phones and laptops revealed a goldmine of information about a sprawling international network of great ape traffickers, working across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Cites certificates found on Traore’s computer documented the possible illegal movement of dozens of different species of primates, as well as other endangered species. The evidence also implicated Traore’s brother, Aboubacar, who was named in a Cites document last year because of his smuggling of endangered birds including African grey parrots. Ibrahima Traore’s father, Alhassane, also appeared to be involved. Records showed his bank account in Guinea’s capital Conakry was used to deposit payments – and it was that account that the BBC team was told to use. The detective in charge in Ivory Coast, Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, pledged to delve into the entire illegal supply chain - from the hunters to the traffickers to the buyers. “In 10 years, in 20 years, we won’t have any more chimpanzees,” he warned. “This species will disappear. That’s the reason why this cause was taken up by Interpol. Personally I am committed to fight against this phenomenon. “These are rare species and it should not be us, in our generation, that wipes them out.” As for the baby male chimp discovered in the blue room, he was initially taken to the Interpol building in Abidjan, before being handed over to wildlife officials from the Ministry of Water and Forests. They took him to the zoo in Abidjan, where he was fed and comforted and given a name by keepers: Nemley junior. He was then shown an older female who acts as an adoptive mother to two other infant chimps. After being gradually introduced to this new family, Nemley junior may live with them. But caring for an infant chimp is a long-term and costly commitment so two wildlife organisations with experience of infant chimpanzees have offered him homes in specialists sanctuaries, including the Born Free Foundation. Will Travers, president of Born Free, described the exotic pet trade as “sickening and cruel” and promised to help relocate the baby chimp. “If given the opportunity, we will do all we can, with the help of our specialists and the full participation of the local government agencies, to try and relocate Nemley junior to a registered chimpanzee sanctuary, where this little victim of the illegal wildlife trade can be given a life worth living, in the company of other chimps, for the rest of his life.” But whatever happens next, the orphan has certainly been left traumatised, according to Dr Cleve Hicks of the University of Warsaw, a specialist in chimp behaviour who set up a chimp sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Mainly they have a broken heart - they’ve seen their mothers die,” he said. Dan Bucknall, of the wildlife charity Tusk, agreed that recovery could be “very difficult with such clever sentient animals” but added that chimpanzees were resilient creatures. “In the right hands, with good carers, and with constant attention, they can do OK and the prospects are good.”"
