Living with the paramilitaries next door,"This video can not be played Emma Vardy reports from Derry's Creggan Estate In the area of Londonderry known as Creggan, normality belies an undercurrent of violence. This mainly Catholic housing estate is one of Northern Ireland's last hotbeds from where the New IRA try to advance their diminishing cause. It feels a world apart. Forgotten. Challenging the political voice of the New IRA Two Saoradh activists 'in New IRA leadership' Pro-IRA graffiti marks many walls. Some has been painted over, but the most prominent remain. ""The police will forget about you, we won't"". Next to the local shops, outside a school are makeshift signs. ""Informants will be shot"". Anywhere else, you may imagine such threats would immediately be taken down. But not in Derry. Fear creates a culture of silence. ""That is saying to people, 'just you keep quiet and we'll do what we like here'."" Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during attacks on police in Derry Fr Joe Gormley knows the cost when paramilitaries attempt to assert control. The priest anointed journalist Lyra McKeethe night she was shot dead by the New IRA while observing rioting in April. The 29-year-old writer and campaigner was standing near a police 4x4 vehicle when a masked gunman fired towards officers and onlookers. ""These people claim to be fighting for some kind of human rights but they treat people like animals if they don't agree with them,"" Fr Gormley explained. ""They don't speak for the people of Creggan, but people here would be afraid, having signs like that outside a school like that is tantamount to abuse of our children."" The authorities will not intervene to remove these IRA signs Paramilitaries do not live in the shadows. In a small community, they are people's neighbours, family members, friends. Many do not agree with their extremist views, but still have to live with them. Police say Thomas Ashe Mellon and Fergal Melaugh areprominent members of the New IRA. But in Derry you'll just as easily run into them shopping at a supermarket. A new placard reads: ""Salute the men and women of violence"". What is Saoradh? Founded in 2016, Saoradh has the support of prisoners from the dissident group referred to as the New IRA in Maghaberry and Portlaoise prisons. Several high-profile dissidents, including Colin Duffy and Nuala Perry, have also been linked to the party. It is chaired by Brian Kenna. According to its constitution, Saoradh's objective is to ""effect an end to Britain's illegal occupation of the six counties"" and establish a 32-county Irish socialist republic. The party has been highly critical of Sinn FÃ©in in the past, with its chairman describing members as ""false prophets who have been defeated and consumed by the very system they claim to oppose"". Saoradh, which has offices in Belfast and Derry, campaigns for the release of all republican prisoners. Since Lyra McKee's death, what police say are the New IRA's political wing, have launched a fresh drive to rally support. The anti-British, anti-police messages, are stark. Saoradh also recruit young people into their youth wing, Eistigi. Neighbourhood police officers face a serious dissident threat in Derry Neighbourhood police officers in Derry are trying to build trust with the community in the face of anti-police campaigns. ""We're basically trying to get people to understand that we're doing a job, we're there to help them,"" said police constable Chris White. ""We do our best to get out and speak to people, letting them see that we're willing to engage with them and we're there to help them."" Emma Vardy questions a protester on a picket line supporting IRA prisoners Police usually patrol the Creggan in armoured land rovers. But they have promised the community they will be on the beat more, and face-to-face in future. The New IRA claims to be continuing a long-standing armed struggle to end the British governance of Northern Ireland. Lyra McKee was a ""hero"" to the LGBT comminity in Northern Ireland, says a friend Lyra McKee was a 29-year-old journalist, writer and campaigner. She was shot dead while observing a riot in Derry's Creggan estate in April 2019. Ms McKee was considered a ""rising star"" in the world of journalism and had written for publications including Buzzfeed, Private Eye and The Atlantic. 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' She was named Sky News young journalist of the year in 2006 and Forbes Magazine named her as one of their 30 under 30 in media in Europe in 2016. She had also signed a two-book deal with publisher Faber and Faber. Ms McKee was known for her writing and advocacy on issues such as mental health and LGBT rights. Originally from north Belfast, the journalist had moved to Derry to live with her partner, Sara Canning, who she described in a newspaper article in February as ""the love of my life"". This year, the group has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks. The group said it was behind a bombwhich exploded outside Derry's court house, explosives in letters to train stations and airports across the UK, anda bomb found under a police officer's car in Belfast. Last week,dissidents tried to murder police officers in Craigavon, County Armagh, luring them towards a deadly booby-trap device. During the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles, Derry saw some of the worst of the violence between paramilitaries, the Army and police. The walls of the city are etched with murals depictingBloody Sunday, the day in January 1972 that 13 people were killed and 15 people were wounded after members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in the Bogside. Those tensions still live on today. ""The Troubles began here in the city in '68, and they have never really gone away,"" explained one man, who passes by as we are filming the anti-police placards. ""Feelings do run high here. ""I'm not saying I support that message, but I certainly understand it."" So, how do police overcome it then? ""I think it's going to take another generation"" replied Constable White. Police believe the IRA gunman who shot Lyra McKee in April is a local teenager. Officers have said they know that people within the community have the answers. But no one has yet been charged. Community workers have told the BBC they are negotiating with the dissidents to try to get the IRA threats removed. The council, police, and other authorities will not intervene. Many believe it is something only the community of Creggan can resolve within itself.

Inquiry closed into MP who grabbed activist,"This video can not be played Climate change protesters interrupt Chancellor Philip Hammond's speech A Tory MP criticised for grabbing a female climate activist has said he is ""relieved"" to learn a Whitehall inquiry into his conduct has been closed. After the incident in June, Mark Field apologised and referred himself to the Cabinet Office for investigation. He was also suspended as a Foreign Office minister,and last week was sacked in Boris Johnson's reshuffle. Police said they would be taking no further action, while Downing Street said Mr Field had left government. A spokeswoman said Mr Johnson viewed it as ""a matter for the previous PM"". Mr Field also referred himself to the Conservative Party for investigation and that inquiry is continuing. Labour's shadow policing minister Louise Haigh said: ""Never mind not being fit for a job in government, Mark Field isn't fit to be an MP. ""Having previously failed to condemn his actions, this is a test of Boris Johnson's attitude towards women - he should kick him out of the Conservative Party immediately,"" she added. What is the law on tackling intruders? Greenpeace accuses minister of assault Climate protesters disrupt Hammond's speech Protesters from Greenpeace - wearing suits, red dresses and sashes with ""climate emergency"" written on them - entered Mansion House in the City of London on 20 June, as then Chancellor Philip Hammond was beginning a speech on the state of the economy. As Janet Barker walked past his table, Mr Field stood up, stopped her and pushed her against a column. The MP - who represents the Cities of London and Westminster - then put a hand on the back of her neck and led her out of the room. Footage of the incident was widely shared on social media, with several Labour politicians calling for him to be sacked. Mr Field told ITV News at the time that guests had ""understandably felt threatened"" and he had ""instinctively reacted"" when Ms Barker rushed past because he feared she might be armed. Following the closure of the Cabinet Office's inquiry, he said: ""The City of London Police took eye witness testimony and examined CCTV evidence before exonerating my actions as proportionate and lawful in the circumstances of the serious breach in security. ""Naturally, having co-operated in full with the Cabinet Office investigation, I am hugely relieved that the  the matter is now considered closed. ""I have been deeply touched by the letters and emails of support from thousands of men and women from across the country, many from political opponents."" Mark Field said he feared the activist could have been armed Ms Barker told the BBC at the time the purpose of the protest had been to speak to ""men who are in power, the bankers, the investors that are continuing to invest into fossil fuels"". She said Mr Field ""manhandled"" her ""in a way in which was very disagreeable"", but she did not intend to complain to police. In a statement, City of London Police said it had received a number of reports that an offence of assault had occurred. ""Following careful assessment and giving consideration to the events of that evening and the subsequent views of Janet Barker in relation to the action of Mark Field MP, City of London Police will be taking no further action against Mr Field.""

Love Island winners crowned in live finalThe winning couple of the hit ITV2 show was announced by Caroline Flack on Monday night's final.Entertainment & Arts,"Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea will share the Â£50,000 prize money Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea have been crowned the winners of this year's Love Island. It's a surprising end to the series - as Tommy Fury and Molly-Mae Hague had been the bookies' favourites to win for several weeks. Amber is a beauty therapist and model from Newcastle, while Greg is a rugby player from Limerick, Ireland. Presenter Caroline Flack announced them as the winners of the hugely successful ITV2 show on Monday evening. The show's finale attracted an average audience of 3.63 million - peaking at 4.05 million - and gained a 21.4% average audience share. That put it ahead of BBC One's Who Do You Think You Are? and ITV's Long Lost Family: What Happened Next, which aired at the same time. According to ITV, it was the most watched episode of the series to date and the most watched Love Island final ever. Amber, 21, said she could ""not believe it"", while 24-year-old Greg described their win as ""crazy."" Congratulating the winning couple, Fury added: ""Amber has had a hard time in here, she deserves everything that's coming to her."" Greg did not join the show until earlier this month, but Amber has been in the villa since the series began at the start of June. Gaslighting to girl code: How Love Island reflects society ""It would be fair to say I've had quite a journey in the villa this summer. There have been so many highs, but I've still had some quite low lows,"" Amber said during the final. ""[Greg] came in in the 11th hour; just when I thought there was nothing left for me in the villa, everything changed. He picked me up when I was at my most vulnerable, and helped me rediscover my smile."" She added: ""It's been absolutely wild... a rollercoaster of emotion."" Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom revealed on Tuesday it had received 3,094 complaints about this series, with Maura Higgins's attempts to kiss Tommy Fury sparking the most complaints. Some 709 viewers took issue with the episode, claiming the Irish model had sexually harassed the boxer by trying to kiss him on multiple occasions. Ofcom assessed the complaints about the 14 June broadcast but determined theydid not warrant investigation. by Steven McIntosh, Entertainment reporter Amber Gill is one of only three finalists to have stayed in the villa from day one Amber is one of just three finalists to have entered the villa on day one. And, as a result, viewers feel they've been on a journey with her. She may have come across as a tough nut to crack in the early days, but she has opened up and shown her more vulnerable side in recent weeks. No contestant has been through the wringer quite as much as Amber, perhaps most notably in her relationship with Michael, which left her visibly heartbroken. Therefore, when the loveable Greg entered the villa and made a beeline for her, viewers were just glad to finally see Amber happy. ""Thank you for helping build me back up,"" she told Greg during the final. ""You've always been so sweet and lovely to me, and you've managed to bring out my soft side, which not many realised existed. ""You picked me up when I was my most vulnerable, and helped me rediscover my smile."" Tommy and Molly-Mae might have been the favourites after spending 54 days in the villa as a couple, but when it comes to the British public, never underestimate an underdog. The winning couple receive Â£50,000 in prize money - which they will share between them. In an twist which occurs every year, Greg was given the option to ""steal"" the prize money in full for himself, before deciding to share it with Amber. Tommy and Molly-Mae finished in second place, Ovie and India third, and Curtis and Maura fourth. Presenter Caroline Flack announced Greg and Amber as the winners Amber and Greg's surprise win went down well with viewers on social media, with some drawing attention to how late Greg joined the series. ""Greg worked for a fortnight, bagged Â£25K and a beautiful woman in Amber. Definition of Winning!""tweeted Chizzy Akudolu.,external ""Genuinely a great redemption story. What an impact Greg's had too. Just a good, good lad,""added Metro's Jay Jaffa,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""A lot of madness went down for Amber but we truly righted all those wrongs."" ""Love the fact the poster couple didn't win #LoveIsland - congrats to Amber and Greg,""added Miles O'Leary.,external This series of Love Island, the fifth, has been a huge success for ITV2 - andbroke the channel's all-time ratings recordearlier this month. The show, which is filmed in Majorca, has become a significant money-maker for ITV with its predominantly young and female audience particularly valuable to advertisers. None of the couples from last year's series of Love Island are still together. However, earlier series have produced couples who have got married or had children. For example, Cara De La Hoyde and Nathan Massey, who won the 2016 series, are now married and have a baby son. There will be twice as much Love Island next year - after ITV announced a second series which will launch this winter.

Gaslighting to girl code: How Love Island reflects society ""It would be fair to say I've had quite a journey in the villa this summer. There have been so many highs, but I've still had some quite low lows,"" Amber said during the final. ""[Greg] came in in the 11th hour; just when I thought there was nothing left for me in the villa, everything changed. He picked me up when I was at my most vulnerable, and helped me rediscover my smile."" She added: ""It's been absolutely wild... a rollercoaster of emotion."" Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom revealed on Tuesday it had received 3,094 complaints about this series, with Maura Higgins's attempts to kiss Tommy Fury sparking the most complaints. Some 709 viewers took issue with the episode, claiming the Irish model had sexually harassed the boxer by trying to kiss him on multiple occasions. Ofcom assessed the complaints about the 14 June broadcast but determined theydid not warrant investigation. by Steven McIntosh, Entertainment reporter Amber Gill is one of only three finalists to have stayed in the villa from day one Amber is one of just three finalists to have entered the villa on day one. And, as a result, viewers feel they've been on a journey with her. She may have come across as a tough nut to crack in the early days, but she has opened up and shown her more vulnerable side in recent weeks. No contestant has been through the wringer quite as much as Amber, perhaps most notably in her relationship with Michael, which left her visibly heartbroken. Therefore, when the loveable Greg entered the villa and made a beeline for her, viewers were just glad to finally see Amber happy. ""Thank you for helping build me back up,"" she told Greg during the final. ""You've always been so sweet and lovely to me, and you've managed to bring out my soft side, which not many realised existed. ""You picked me up when I was my most vulnerable, and helped me rediscover my smile."" Tommy and Molly-Mae might have been the favourites after spending 54 days in the villa as a couple, but when it comes to the British public, never underestimate an underdog. The winning couple receive Â£50,000 in prize money - which they will share between them. In an twist which occurs every year, Greg was given the option to ""steal"" the prize money in full for himself, before deciding to share it with Amber. Tommy and Molly-Mae finished in second place, Ovie and India third, and Curtis and Maura fourth. Presenter Caroline Flack announced Greg and Amber as the winners Amber and Greg's surprise win went down well with viewers on social media, with some drawing attention to how late Greg joined the series.

Old Town Road beats US singles chart record,"Lil Nas X, right, recently released a remix of his song with Billy Ray Cyrus, left Old Town Road, the viral rap song by Lil Nas X, has become the longest-running number one in US chart history. The song has now topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 17 weeks, overtaking Luis Fonsi's Despacito and Mariah Carey's One Sweet Day, which both spent 16 weeks at number one. It had 72.5 million streams and 46,000 downloads in the past seven days,external. Carey sent ""love and congratulations"",externalto Lil Nas X, after hearing her 26-year-old record had been smashed. The rapper, a college dropout from Atlanta, whose real name is Montero Hill, recorded the song last October, using a backing track he bought online for $30 (Â£24.70). With its blend of country music and trap beats, it achieved notoriety on the social media app TikTok, where thousands of people filmed themselves lip-syncing to the song in cowboy boots and ten-gallon hats. By March, he had signed a deal with Columbia Records, and the song gained early press coverage afterBillboard banned it from their country charts, for allegedly failing to ""embrace enough elements of today's country music"". The decision attracted criticism over the conservatism of the country establishment, as well as accusations of racism. Billboard denied that race played any part in its ruling. Allow YouTube content?

Nonetheless, the added attention helped Old Town Road rise up the main charts, eventually hitting number one in April. Its tenure at the top has been extended by the astute tactic of releasing remixes and alternate videos to top up its streaming numbers. The most popular remix features country star Billy Ray Cyrus, while other versions contain cameos from Young Thug and RM of the K-pop band BTS. And while the original video was created using footage from the Wild West video game Red Dead Redemption, the ""official"" clip - released in the seventh week of its chart reign - is a big-budget production featuring cameos from Chris Rock, Diplo, Vince Staples and Rico Nasty. All the different versions of the song are close enough to the original, and so count towards one single total in the US charts. This video can not be played Lil Nas X told BBC Breakfast he felt like he was ""opening doors for more people"" On hearing that he'd toppled the Billboard record, Lil Nas Xposted a long essay,externalexplaining the origins of his song. ""I went looking for beats on YouTube... when suddenly I came across a country-trap-sounding masterpiece,"" he wrote, ""I immediately knew I would make something special out of it. ""I jokingly/seriously saw myself as a loner cowboy, needing to run away from it all. I went out on my sister's porch and listened to the beat over and over. Then it came to me!"" He added: ""This song has changed my life and the way I see the world around me in less than a year. ""I'm so thankful this blessing has been placed upon me."" The rapper also shared a few photos documenting the rise of Old Town Road, including a short video of him andBilly Ray Cyrus,externalin the studio,on his Instagram account,external. During the star's 17 weeks at number one, seven separate songs have peaked at number two - most notably Billie Eilish's Bad Guy, which has spent seven weeks in the  runners-up position.

Scotland's largest offshore wind farm opened,"Beatrice is an offshore wind farm off Scotland's Caithness coast Scotland's largest offshore wind farm has been officially opened by Prince Charles. The Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm, located about eight miles  (13km) off the coast of Wick in the far north, can generate enough energy to power 450,000 homes. The Â£2.65bn project, which involves 84 huge turbines, came fully online in May and achieved 588MW of electricity. It is Scotland's single largest source of renewable energy. The development, construction and operation were led by SSE Renewables in a joint venture with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Red Rock Power Limited. Construction started in May 2016 and SSE said it was completed on time and Â£100m under budget. The turbines were installed in a three-year phase of the scheme Part of the project involved redeveloping buildings in Wick, the Caithness town where about 90 staff will look after the operations and maintenance of the wind farm over its 25-year lifespan. Prince Charles, who is known in Scotland as the Duke of Rothesay, visited the offices of Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited and SSE Renewables in Wick to mark the official opening. The two harbour-front buildings used for the Wick base were originally designed by renowned Scottish architect Thomas Telford for use in the herring industry. The electricity generated by Beatrice travels along subsea and underground cables before coming ashore near Keith in Moray and connecting to the Blackhillock substation. The Walney extension, opened in 2018, is the largest in the world The world's largest offshore wind farm isWalney, off the coast of Cumbria. It is said to be able to generate sufficient power for 600,000 homes. Two other offshore sites have output greater than Beatrice: London Array, which is 10 miles north of Ramsgate in the Thames Estuary. Gemini Wind Farm, in the Netherlands. The others in the top 10, in order of output, are: Gode Wind, in Germany Gwynt y Mor, off Llandudno in Conwy county. Race Bank, off the Norfolk and Lincolnshire coast. Greater Gabbard, off the Suffolk and Essex coast. Dudgeon, off the Norfolk coast. Veja Mate, in Germany Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, said the scale of the project was ""truly staggering"". ""Scotland has a quarter of Europe's offshore wind resource and Beatrice represents one of the first steps in tapping it,"" she said. ""As our offshore wind projects continue to build out we'll see the environmental and economic benefits of offshore wind grow across Scotland, with jobs and investment transforming communities, as they already are in Wick."" The Beatrice turbines are installed in sea depths of up to 183ft (56m) She added: ""With the right support from government, a supply chain which is competitive on price, quality and timescales and the commitment of industry, offshore wind has a bright future in Scotland as we work towards meeting some of the world's most challenging climate change targets and building a smart energy system with renewable energy at its heart."" The Beatrice project is the fourth largest offshore wind farm in the world, with only two projects in England and one off the Netherlands generating more energy. However, the Beatrice array is built in deeper water, with jacket foundations each weighing in at about 1,000 tonnes installed in sea depths of up to 183ft (56m). Earlier this month it was announced thatwind power output in Scotland hit a record high during the first six months of 2019. Figures from Weather Energy calculated the energy produced by turbines could power every home in Scotland and part of the north of England.

TikTok owner ByteDance developing smartphone,"The creator of a hugely popular video-sharing app has announced it is branching out into making smartphones. TikTok is the fastest-growing social media app, with about 500 million regular users. The app, which lets people post 15-second videos, is estimated to have been downloaded more than a billion times on app stores. TikTok developer ByteDance is making the move after acquiring patents and employees from device-maker Smartisan. Besides TikTok, ByteDance owns several popular AI-based video and news apps, such as Slack alternative Lark, video-chat app Flipchat, and news aggregator Toutiao, but TikTok is by far its most popular offering. The app has done so well with both Western and Asian audiences that it recently unseated Uber to become the world's largest privately backed start-up, with a valuation of $75bn (Â£61.4bn). Missing husband found on TikTok in India TikTok's fans 'exploited' for digital gifts When gummy bears singing Adele rule online According to Chinese financial magazine Caijing, the new phone has been in development for seven months. Meitu's selfie phones target beauty-conscious young people ByteDance is not the first developer to capitalise on a popular app. In 2013, Chinese selfie-app-maker Meitu started making phones tailored to consumers who really like to take photos of themselves. Meitu's phones, promoted by popular Chinese social media influencers, feature dual pixel cameras with faster auto-focus as well as artificial intelligence to select the best customised photo-editing filters for each user. But China has become a very competitive market for smartphone-makers and there are doubts yet another device will be able to stand out. Facebook Home, which launched in 2013 on Android devices, flopped in less than a year ""It's extremely difficult for any new entrants to break into the smartphone market profitably, particularly at a time when big brands such as Apple, Samsung and Huawei are carpet-bombing consumers with millions of pounds worth of marketing,"" Ben Wood, technology analyst at CCS Insight, told BBC News. ""There are always niches that open up in the smartphone market but they tend to be 'firework products', starting with a big bang and quickly disappearing."" Technology giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon have also branched out beyond their primary businesses but with varying success. While Facebook is successful in social networks and communication, acquiring popular apps such as Whatsapp and Instagram, it failed to branch out into mobile with its own Android launcher app, Home. Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos at the launch of the Fire Phone in June 2014 Similarly, Google's Pixel phones have been a winner but its social network,Google+, was finally shut down earlier this yearafter gradually declining use of the service. And Amazon's tablets and e-readers have been popular with consumers but its Fire Phone saw a frosty reception after it launched in May 2014. Within five months, Amazon reported it had suffered a $170m writedown (Â£110m) due to the product. And it laid off smartphone engineers beforepulling the product off the shelves in September 2015.

'How my idea to start schools at 10am reached the very top'," By Jon Kelly It was October 2018, late in the morning, deep into the school term, and Hannah Kidner sat in a classroom looking at her laptop. Hannah was 16, studying for her A-levels, and her politics teacher had just set an assignment - start an online petition on a subject you care about. As it happened, therewassomething that had been bothering her. She began typing: “School should start at 10am as teenagers are too tired.” Hannah certainly was. In fact, she was exhausted. That morning, in a farmhouse in a remote valley on Dartmoor, her alarm had started buzzing at 6.15am. It went off early so her mum could drive her to a nearby town in time to catch a 7.20am bus, which then trundled along Devon roads for an hour and a quarter before finally dropping her at school in Tiverton. Sometimes on her daily commute, as the Sun rose over the fields outside, she’d manage to shut her eyes for a while. But even when she did, and no matter how early she’d gone to bed the night before, she’d arrive for lessons feeling as though she’d barely had a couple of hours’ rest. Earlier that year, Hannah had written an essay for her biology class about the importance of sleep, and it had prompted her to start reading for herself. She discovered scientific studies had suggested that adolescents had a late-running biological rhythm, and that starting lessons at 10am could have enormous benefits for them. This all made sense to Hannah. It explained why she never felt alert, or able to properly focus, until the morning break. She read that schools in Surrey, in France and in the US state of Washington had experimented with pushing back the start of the school day. Surely this was a no-brainer? Now her politics teacher was explaining how e-petitions worked. There was a website, the teacher said, run by the House of Commons and the government, and a committee of backbench MPs overseeing it. If you started an e-petition that met all the rules, and it managed to attract 10,000 signatures, the committee would make sure the relevant ministry responded. If it reached 100,000, the committee would consider it for a debate in Parliament. Any UK citizen or resident could set one up, regardless of age, so long as they had a valid email account. “I thought: actually, you know what? I’m interested in this,” Hannah recalls. “Let’s see if anyone else will be.” She went to the e-petitions website and followed the instructions. She had to find five people to support it, but that wasn’t difficult in a classroom filled with pupils who’d also made long journeys through the countryside that morning. A few days later she had an email telling her that her petition had been approved. And that, so she thought, was the end of the matter. Nobody would care and nobody would sign it. Autumn turned to winter and her rides to and from school took place almost entirely in darkness. She didn’t think about her petition again. Then in January 2019, as she left school one day, she checked Instagram to find she had a message from a stranger: was she the same Hannah Kidner who started a petition about school start times? “Um, yeah,” she thought, wondering what on earth had prompted this. She went back to the e-petitions site for the first time in months. Hers was there on the front page, the most popular on the site, with 57,000 signatures. By the time she got home that evening, it had reached 65,000. It turned out that far more people cared about school start times than Hannah had ever imagined. She hadn’t been expecting this, and had no idea what would happen next. If you ever wish to stare deep inside the United Kingdom’s collective subconsciousness, and take a sample of the variety of the current hopes, fears, aspirations, worries, preoccupations, aversions and enthusiasms of the British populace, you could do far worse than browse the “open petitions” section of the e-petitions website: Price cap on flight tickets and holidays during school holidays(31,250 signatures at time of writing).Remove the ban on Tyler, The Creator, entering the UK(seven).Install microplastic filters on new washing machines as standard(16,182).Amend animal welfare law to make pet theft a specific offence(115,188).Ban the deliberate release of balloons and lanterns(3,035).Fund the art form of comic books to the same level that opera is supported(688).Revoke the BBC’s royal charter(4,135) Since the system was set up in 2015, e-petitions have become an indelible feature of the British political system, not to mention most people’s social media feeds. Unlike petition sites such as Change.org and 38 Degrees, the official House of Commons and UK government site offers citizens a direct route to raise their grievances with those in authority. And it’s proved popular. Following the 2017 general election, an average of 290 e-petitions each week have reached the five-signature threshold and made it on to the site. The highest number in a single seven-day period was 2,900; the lowest was 150. There’s a theory – though no-one has figures to back it up - that more are started on rainy days than sunny ones. Some are closely tied to the news agenda - most notably, one entitledRevoke Article 50 and remain in the EU, which has attracted more than six million signatures since it was launched in February 2019, and at one stage caused Parliament’s website to crash. (There have been many petitions on a range of Brexit permutations, urging MPs to “honour the referendum result” or hold a second plebiscite on EU membership or leave without a deal.) In 2017, more than 1.6 million people signed another petition calling for US President Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK to be cancelled. But there’s another category - those like Hannah’s - based around issues that might not otherwise have won much media or parliamentary attention, but which to a large number of people matter a great deal indeed. Gemma Weir knew her petition had to be worded carefully. Her cause felt urgent, but she had to keep her language calm and measured if she was to have any chance of success, and the stakes were too high to get anything wrong. Four years earlier, in 2013, the phone had rung at Gemma’s home in Portsmouth. It was the hospital, asking her to come in. Tests had shown her three-week-old daughter, Ivy, had cystic fibrosis, a genetic condition that causes fatal lung damage. Only half of those with the disorder live to see their 40thbirthday. The next few months were a mess of anxiety for Gemma. After spending all day caring for Ivy, she would stay up to all hours reading about CF. Infections could make Ivy sick, Gemma learned, and she became a germophobe on her daughter’s behalf. She realised she’d have to give up her job as a call centre manager to care for Ivy full-time. But there was one glimmer of hope. The nurse who’d broken the news of Ivy’s diagnosis told Gemma that a life-extending combination drug treatment was coming. It wasn’t a cure, he’d said, but it would allow people with Ivy’s gene mutation to live with it as though it were asthma or diabetes. “That’s what kept me sane,” says Gemma, now 35. “I had that to focus on – there are going to be drugs that will come along to save her.” Clinical trials showed the treatment, known as Orkambi, could improve lung function for people with CF. In 2015 it was licensed for use in the UK. But in 2016, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice) rejected it for patients in England on the grounds of cost-effectiveness. Vertex, Orkambi’s manufacturer, wanted over £100,000 per patient for a year’s treatment. A tussle ensued between the company and the NHS over the price, and the treatment remained unavailable for NHS England patients, except in rare cases on compassionate grounds. Like other parents of children with CF, Gemma was optimistic that the NHS and Vertex would come together to reach an agreement: “We were all being very British about it. Give them time, be respectful.” But no deal was forthcoming. Campaigners wrote to their MPs and tried to get the media interested, and still nothing changed. Gemma knew she couldn’t wait forever on Ivy’s behalf. Eventually, her patience ran out. Parents of children with CF cannot meet face-to-face because of the risk of cross-infection, so there was already a thriving online community. On one Facebook group, Gemma declared she was going to start an e-petition. “Nothing’s happening,” she remembers telling the other parents. “We’ve got to stand up. Our voices must be heard. Let’s get it in Parliament.” The petition, which Gemma started with her friend, Michelle Frank, urged the government to help find a solution. They knew they couldn’t be too strident or aggressive: they had to ask for a resolution of the problem, not demand it, Gemma says. On the day they put it live, the petition gained 10,000 signatures. By the end of the following evening, it had 25,000. “We spammed it everywhere,” she remembers. “I got banned from Facebook for three weeks. Tagging people, popping it into community posts, mum and baby pages, it just went like wildfire.” There was a response from the Department of Health. Ministers were “continuing to engage” with Vertex, Nice and NHS England, it said. Gemma wasn’t impressed. “That was a bit of a fob-off really,” she says. But she hadn’t really expected more. The aim was still 100,000 signatures, and a debate in Parliament, and if she could make MPs face up to the situation, then maybe there was hope for Ivy.  On Monday 5 November 2018, in a room in the Palace of Westminster, a tarpaulin-draped Big Ben looms outside the window. This is the base of a team of House of Commons employees whose job is to support and advise MPs on the Petitions Committee, and to check incoming e-petitions comply with the rules. This afternoon, the British public have pyrotechnics on their minds. The most popular e-petition on the UK government and Parliament’s website is titledBan the sale of fireworks to the public. Displays for licensed venues only, and so far it has been signed 103,000 times. “As of this time last week, this had maybe 1,000 signatures,” says David Slater, the committee’s clerk, leaning forward as he peers at the petition on his screen. Then over the weekend, as combustibles popped and whizzed through UK skies, the tally began increasing at a rate of 500 an hour. Now the signatures are coming in at more like 3,000 an hour. Slater says most people sign petitions after seeing them on Facebook - or occasionally another social network (for instance, Hannah’s petitions about school start times was widely shared on Instagram). A map on the committee website shows each UK constituency colour-coded by how many residents have signed the fireworks petition. South-west England, where it is proving most popular, glows red. Northern Ireland, where a licence is already required to buy, possess or use outdoor fireworks, is yellow, indicating that fewer are putting their names to it. Slater has only been in his job a few months, at this point, but he already knows there are certain subjects that tend to come up at the same time each year, and fireworks is one of them. Back in May and June, as GCSE season reached its climax, there were regular calls for students to be allowed to take open books into exams; now, as the festive season looms, it will soon be time for demands that Christmas advertising be banned until the first day of Advent. David Slater, Petitions Committee clerk David Slater, Petitions Committee clerk But petitions such as Hannah’s or Gemma’s, on subjects hitherto off the radar for the mass media or Parliament, often prove most successful. In 2016, after temp worker Nicola Thorp was sent home from her job as a receptionist for wearing flat shoes, she launched a petition calling for companies to be banned from instructing women to wear high heels at work. Signed by more than 150,000 people, it led not just to a debate in Parliament but to a joint report by the Petitions and Women and Equalities Committees, which found existing laws were not proving effective in preventing discrimination. A petition urging car insurance for young drivers to be capped at £1,250 a year attracted 185,000 signatures by the time it closed in 2017. It was started by 19-year-old Rhys Parker from Lowestoft in Suffolk, and MPs in the subsequent debate said they had been inundated with stories of young people living in rural areas - many of whom relied on their cars to carry out caring responsibilities - who felt unfairly penalised. Another petition, that demanded shops should be closed on Boxing Day to give retail workers a rest, was signed by nearly 150,000 people. One calling for greater action against tool theft from vans was signed by more than 40,000. “It gives you such amazing insight into what people care about,” says Kate Anderson, one of the moderators, who also works on engagement and communications for the committee. “It’s quite different from things you see reported.” Reaching 100,000 signatures guarantees that a petition will beconsideredfor a debate in Westminster Hall – where votes do not take place, unlike in the main Commons chamber - but not necessarily that onewilltake place. But equally, the committee has the discretion to schedule a debate in Westminster Hall even if a petition doesn’t reach 100,000 signatures. In March 2018, MPs debated a petition to make British Sign Language (BSL) part of the national curriculum, even though it had only been signed by 35,203 people. The committee said it recognised that the number of BSL users was relatively small, and that reaching the 100,000 target would be more difficult to achieve. Later that year, it scheduled another debate on public holidays for Hindu and Muslim festivals, following petitions that attracted 11,853 and 52,451 signatures respectively. The BSL petition was started by Wayne Barrow, aged 28. Although he grew up in Birmingham with the ability to hear, he learned BSL from his profoundly deaf parents and was signing before he could speak. “Deaf culture is a part of my culture because of my parents,” he says. “I see all the barriers they faced. You want everyone you love to get all the best access in life.” It had been his third attempt at starting a petition on the subject. His first had attracted a tiny number of signatures and the second had been put on hold when the 2017 general election was called. The decision to hold a debate despite not reaching the threshold felt like a vindication. “I was just so ecstatic that it was being recognised,” he says. For most petitioners, however, 100,000 is the target to reach, and getting there is no easy task. One January morning in 2016, Maria Lester sat on a commuter train rattling through south-west London as she anxiously refreshed the browser on her phone. Her petition calling for extra funding for brain tumour research had been open for nearly six months. There were just a few days left before it would be closed for signatures, and it was still - just - agonisingly short of 100,000. Maria started it as a tribute to her brother, Stephen Realf, who had died of brain cancer 18 months previously,  aged 26. He’d been just 19 and a trainee pilot with the RAF when he received his diagnosis. “In Stephen’s case, one of the absolute worst and cruellest things about it was that it robbed him of his flying career,” says Maria, now 39. “I think, for him, having to leave the RAF was as upsetting as being told he had this tumour.” As the first anniversary of his death approached, Maria, a journalist, had written an article for a magazine paying tribute to her brother. While researching it, she’d learned brain tumours were on the increase in the UK, but that they received only £7.7m per year, or 1.5% of the cash spent on cancer research. After checking her parents were on board, Maria decided to start an e-petition calling for that figure to be raised. Maria’s magazine article had given it an early boost, and the charity Brain Tumour Research had helped publicise it. Families of people with brain tumours contacted their local newspapers and radio stations to explain why they too were backing Maria. Pilot Officer Stephen Realf Pilot Officer Stephen Realf At first Maria’s goal had just been to get to 10,000 – a target that was reached in the first week. But she was deeply disappointed by the response she received from the Department of Health, much of which was taken up with running through the National Cancer Research Institute’s funding criteria. “It was so clinical,” she says. “I thought then I wanted to get to 100,000.” The Petitions Committee – whose chair, Helen Jones, was also underwhelmed with the government’s response - announced it would hold its first ever inquiry into brain tumour research funding. It was a significant vote of confidence. But three weeks out from the February deadline, the petition was still 46,000 signatures short of the figure needed to trigger a parliamentary debate. From his home in Rugby, Warwickshire, Maria’s dad, Peter Realf, a retired photographer, told her not to give up. “There’s three weeks left – I’m going to spend it on Twitter,” he said. He’d never used social media before the petition had been launched, but now he was determined to spread the word. “I’ll never forgive myself if I don’t give it my best shot,” he told his daughter.  Sue Farrington-Smith CEO, of Brain Tumour Research, with Peter Realf, Maria Lester and Liz Realf Sue Farrington-Smith CEO, of Brain Tumour Research, with Peter Realf, Maria Lester and Liz Realf Each morning Peter would wake up and check his smartphone to see how the petition was doing; his wife Liz would check her tablet. Peter would then dedicate the rest of the day to sharing Stephen’s story – targeting celebrities with large Twitter followings. After Piers Morgan had been persuaded to share the petition with his six million followers, Peter urged the presenter’s sometime rival Lord Sugar (five million followers) not to be outdone and to tweet about it too. Stephen had been a Tottenham fan, and Peter would go to Spurs Facebook groups, explain that his son used to sit in the West Stand at White Hart Lane and ask his fellow supporters to sign up. It seemed to be working. With a week to go they were 30,000 short. The Petitions Committee had been in touch to say they would consider scheduling a debate even if it fell short of 100,000, but Stephen’s family were determined to leave no room for doubt. One morning as the deadline approached, Liz and Peter lay in bed watching as the number of signatures inched towards 100,000. Maria clicked refresh on her phone for a final time, looked at the figure on her screen, and let out a cry of triumph that reverberated around the train carriage. Seconds later, her phone lit up with a message from her dad: “We’ve done it!” Petitions date back at least as far as ancient Egypt, when slaves building the pyramids used them to demand better working conditions. In the Middle Ages, England’s King Edward I urged his subjects to set out their grievances in petition format, and more than one million petitions were submitted to Westminster between 1780 and 1918. The House of Commons had a Public Petitions Committee that existed from the 19thCentury until it was abolished in 1974. When the Scottish Parliament was formed in 1999, it set up a committee with the same name, and this quickly proved popular. Under the Scottish system, petitions don’t have to attract a minimum number of signatures. “In Scotland, we’re lucky that we have the system we have because they do listen,” says Shaheen Blackie, 28, from Bellshill, Lanarkshire, who made an emotional appearance before MSPs at Holyrood about a petition she’d started. Her baby son, Zach, had died in her arms, of meningitis caused by a Group B Strep infection; 14,000 people backed her plea for expectant mothers to be offered automatic screening. Westminster’s current system can be traced to 2006, when Tony Blair’s government set up a Downing Street e-petitions website. This proved popular – a petition opposing government plans for road pricing was signed by 1.8 million people – but there was not, at that stage, a mechanism that might lead to Parliament debating the issues raised. The coalition government set up another e-petitions site in 2011, this time based in the Cabinet Office. But it wasn’t until 2015 that the House of Commons Petitions Committee was formed and the present collaborative system, run by government and Parliament together, came into effect (the Government Digital Service runs the technical side of the website). Helen Jones, the Labour MP for Warrington North who has chaired the committee from its inception, says there was initial resistance to the new system in some quarters, for instance when her committee rejected government responses that it deemed inadequate and demanded better ones. “One particular government minister said: ‘It was not envisaged that you would do that,’” she recalls. “I said, ‘Well, lots of things aren’t envisaged but they still happen.’” The committee insisted that petitioners were taken seriously, she says: “We wanted to give a voice to people on issues that aren’t always being heard.” Helen Jones, the Labour MP for Warrington North Helen Jones, the Labour MP for Warrington North In the Petitions Committee office, a whiteboard stands at one end of the room. On it is written a warning to the team: “Beware petitions fatigue.” The work can be emotionally taxing. Often petitions are started by people who have been bereaved or are in distress. The reports the committee commissioned into brain tumours and cystic fibrosis involved them listening to hundreds of upsetting stories. It used to be that all sensitive petitions were handled by Anne-Marie Griffiths, Slater’s predecessor as committee clerk. “She went away on holiday and I said, ‘There’s no way one person can be reading all these,’” recalls committee staff member Kate Anderson. “Itisdifficult, so we vary it now.” The task of moderating the hundreds of petitions started each week that meet the rules is a considerable one. The team aims to assess and publish each petition within seven days but it can take longer if it’s a complicated issue, or if they’re particularly busy - Slater says they are currently taking longer because they’re receiving a higher-than-average number of petitions. As of September 2018, a little over half were being rejected for not meeting the Petitions Committee’s standards - most commonly because they were judged to be unclear, not the government or Parliament’s responsibility, or a duplicate of an existing petition (big news events tend to generate a lot of these, according to Slater). Petitions also can’t call for anyone to be sacked. In the committee’s early days a petition calling for a vote of no confidence in then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt attracted 339,000 signatures, but the rules were changed shortly afterwards. The whiteboard carries another warning too: “Beware fake news.” While latitude is allowed for competing interpretations of facts, the rules don’t allow any petitions that start from a false premise or include statements that are demonstrably untrue, so fact-checking is part of the moderator’s job. But when changes are required before a petition can be accepted, the team say they try to be helpful. For example, Nicola Thorp’s high heels petition was initially rejected for being unclear, said Anderson: “It was: ‘Stop forcing women to wear high heels to work.’” This didn’t represent a clear action by the House of Commons or the government. The team suggested amending the wording so that it called for a change in the law: “She went away with our suggestion, came back and it did very well.” The moderators also say they’ll give additional support to people who have been recently bereaved or those who struggle with language. If the petitioner mentions their own employment or medical circumstances, moderators will email them to double-check they really are happy for this to be seen by thousands of people, or even millions. If they mention other people, the team will make sure these third parties don’t mind being mentioned - the rules state that individuals outside the public eye shouldn’t be named without their consent. “We want to help people start petitions,” says Kate Anderson. “We’re not looking for reasons to reject them. It’s about making sure they get the petition they want. “We do get people saying: ‘How can you possibly say this is unclear?’ But you also get people who take the suggestion and start the petition again. It’s a better petition.” Petitions will also be rejected if they are “nonsense or a joke”. Anderson says not many joke petitions make it through, and anyway most would struggle to attract five signatures, or would fall foul of the rule that says the issue must fall within Parliament’s area of responsibility. But sometimes just how serious an issue really is can be a matter of debate. Matt Parker, 38, says he had to convince the moderators that he was deadly serious when he began a petition to change the symbol used on UK road signs to indicate a football stadium “to a geometrically correct football”. Parker had been travelling south on the M6 when the idea first came to him. Just before junction 26, he noticed that a brown sign pointing towards Liverpool depicted a football made up entirely of white and dark hexagons. Parker, a qualified maths teacher and stand-up comedian, knew this was impossible - to form a sphere, the ball would need to include a number of pentagons, too. The sign annoyed Parker, not just because he knew it was wrong, but also because of the signal it sent that mathematical accuracy didn’t matter. It occurred to him that starting a petition would be a useful way to raise public engagement in the subject he loved. When he submitted it, however, he says the moderators didn’t believe he was serious. “I was like, ‘Hey, why has this been rejected?’ And they said that they thought I was probably joking.” After managing to convince them that he was 100% committed to the cause of geometric correctness, the petition went live and attracted 22,536 signatures. (In its official response, the Department for Transport rejected calls to amend the signs on grounds of cost and because the “level of attention needed to understand the geometry could distract a driver’s view away from the road”.) Rejected petitions are published, in the spirit of openness and visibility - unless they are judged to be libellous, likely to cause offence or breach someone’s privacy. One Twitter user (the team are keen to stress that it has nothing to do with the committee or the House of Commons) set up an automated feed, @rejectpetitions, that tweets details of every e-petition that fails to make it through moderation. Currently, it has just under 9,000 followers, a testament to the fascination with this aspect of the 21stCentury democratic process. As she walked through the corridors of Westminster, Nieva Restarick felt goosebumps standing up on her arms. It was July 2018, and around her, portraits and statues of statesmen and women loomed, and she thought about how much history had been made in this place. Nieva, who was born in the Philippines, turned to her English-born husband Richard and told him: “You must be very proud. Look! This is your heritage.” But it was her heritage, too. In 2010, when she’d applied for British citizenship, she’d had to sit a test called Life in the United Kingdom. She’d read up on the way laws were made in this building. Now, MPs were about to debate a petition she’d started, and Nieva had faith that they would see the justice of her cause. Nieva had lived in the UK since 2006, the year she’d married Richard, a mechanic. The couple had met online, and she’d thrown herself into life in his hometown of Thetford, Norfolk. She’d worked as a bookkeeper, made friends around the town, and with Richard had brought up a daughter. But it was hard being away from her family in Mandaluyong, the city she’d grown up in. They’d been a tight-knit unit. Her parents hadn’t had much money but had sacrificed everything so Nieva could go to university in Manila. She was especially close to her sister, Nerissa, who was 13 months her junior. When Nerissa had her heart broken by her first love, “I wasn’t there for her,” recalls Nieva, 37, and the guilt gnawed at her. Nieva and Richard would spend their holidays visiting her family in the Philippines, and at first it was straightforward enough to arrange visas for them to visit Norfolk. But in 2015 the rules were tightened and, soon after, Nerissa’s application was refused. She’d secured a visitors’ visa without any trouble four times previously, and never overstayed her welcome, claimed benefits or worked in the UK. She had a secure job back home as a teacher. But now Nerissa was told she didn’t have enough money in her account to qualify. Their mother, Nanita, 69, who’d recently been widowed, didn’t feel able to travel to the UK without her. Richard, 40, saw how tough the separation was on his wife. “I didn’t expect her to be isolated from her family,” he says. “It shouldn’t be a punishment for wanting to be with your husband in the UK."" Nieva, left, with her mother and sister Nieva, left, with her mother and sister Starting an e-petition felt like Nieva’s last hope. It called for automatic approval of visitor’s visas for family members of British citizens. In her preamble to it, Nieva wrote that she recognised they should not have access to public funds, not be allowed to work and that there should be checks to ensure they didn’t pose a threat to national security. But if their UK-based family could support them, they should be allowed in. “Not being a citizen doesn’t make our parent, siblings, children or grandchildren any less a part of our family,” the petition read. “The only requirement should be that a British relative sponsors them.” It was signed 71,178 times – not enough to be automatically considered for a debate, but the Petitions Committee voted to allow it to be debated anyway, alongside a similar petition on visiting rights for parents of British citizens. When the debate finally started in Westminster Hall, Nieva and Richard watched as MP after MP stood up to tell of stories like theirs – about constituents who were British citizens, but whose families couldn’t come to see them because of the new visa rules. Nieva knew the government had already responded, saying it had no plans to change the rules. But the Petitions Committee staff had been so helpful, and so many people had signed, and now, feeling awed by the grandeur of the building, she started to feel hope. But when a minister stood up, it was to say the government hadn’t changed its mind. Despite herself, Nieva was crestfallen. “I think it’s my own fault for expecting more,” she says. “I trusted you guys, the British. I thought you always came up with the best solution. I thought one of those intelligent heads would come out and say: ‘Let’s do it this way.’” Maria Lester’s brain tumour funding petition had a very different outcome. There was standing room only when it was debated in Westminster Hall in April 2016, and at the end a government minister stood up to announce a working group would be set up. The Petitions Committee had already published a report calling for extra support. Eventually, in May 2018, a government and charity sector package of £65m was announced in honour of the late Baroness Tessa Jowell, who had also campaigned on the issue. It wasn’t as much as the petition had called for – the £65m would be spent over five years, whereas the petition sought £30-35m per year – but she had a tangible achievement to show for all her family’s campaigning. It was also a testament to her late brother. “I think Stephen always wanted to make a difference and he thought it would be in the RAF,” Maria says. “But he’d be pleased that his story is out there.” There have been other notable successes. In 2019, another petition to give legal protection to police horses and dogs attacked on duty led to legislation known as Finn’s Law, after a German shepherd that was stabbed by an armed robber. But the effectiveness of a petition cannot always be measured by whether it results in a change of the law. In the future, Helen Jones would like the committee to have time allocated on the floor of the House of Commons so it can put down motions that MPs can vote on. “Most petitioners are pleased that they’ve been heard and that their point has been put - but there are some things where you would want to move to a vote.” Another thing she says she’d like to change is that petitions are most likely to be started “in places like London and Bristol”. To that effect, she’s made a point of visiting areas such as the West Midlands and Southampton, where fewer are initiated, to explain how the process works. In Gemma Weir’s case, the deadlock between Vertex and NHS England remains. But she says the petition wasn’t in vain – securing parliamentary time to discuss the treatment of cystic fibrosis was a huge step forward for her fellow campaigners. “The debate was about getting support, getting our stories heard, making the MPs aware of what was going on,” she says. Hannah Kidner was back in her politics classroom. Today’s lesson - the Department for Education’s response to her petition (in fact, its second response, as the Petitions Committee had sent back the first, demanding a better one). It had just been released, and Hannah and her fellow pupils read it together. The response made the point there weren’t actually any specific legal requirements about the length of the school day. Schools had the ability to set their own hours, and it was up to them, not the government, to make decisions about starting and finishing times. “We trust head teachers to decide how best to structure their school day to support their pupils’ education,” the statement continued. Actually, thought Hannah, that’s fair enough. “I thought it was a good response,” she says. “I mean, it didn't say that action would be taken. But it did say: ‘We acknowledge this.’ And that, for me, was what I really wanted.” Later that month, Hannah travelled to London with her parents to hear MPs debate the issue. In the oak-panelled surroundings of Westminster Hall, she listened as Daniel Zeichner (Labour, Cambridge) ran through the scientific research that had been published on teenagers’ sleep times, John Howell (Conservative, Henley) raised the issue of how childcare might be affected if different schools had different hours, and Martyn Day (SNP, Linlithgow) called for further study into whether it was more sleep that teenagers needed or better sleep. Hannah was impressed. “They’d taken an interest in it and taken it on board and looked into it,” she says. Before, having grown up in the countryside surrounded by animals, her ambition had been to become a vet. Now, having seen the system from the inside, she’s started thinking she should study politics at university. “It's made me realise that youcanmake a difference,” she says, “if you put your mind to it.” Author: Jon Kelly Photography: Getty Images, Emma Lynch/BBC, RAF,  Peter Realf, Nieva Restarick Production & design: Emma Lynch Editor: Stephen Mulvey"
Pound sinks to 28-month low on Brexit fears,"The pound sank to a 28-month low against the dollar as Boris Johnson's government toughened its rhetoric on Brexit. Sterling dipped 1.1% to $1.2242 and â¬1.1004 respectively. The currency could fall further, according to analysts at ING Group, as traders appear to have been betting on a last-minute deal being reached. Many business lobby groups have asked that no-deal be withdrawn as an option to keep investment flowing into the UK. The pound dropped after ""the events over the weekend, where the current stance of the new government became clear"", said Petr Krpata, a currency strategist at ING Group. Michael Gove, who is in charge of planning for no-deal, has said the UK government is currently ""working on the assumption"" of that very outcome. He said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels, but writing in the Sunday Times, he added: ""No deal is now a very real prospect."" Five holiday destinations where a weak pound still goes far Tourists facing travel money 'shock' this summer The pound's fall: A tale of two cities How does Brexit affect the pound? Mr Krpata says ING Group's assumption is that an early election will take place and that the pound will sink as low as â¬1.05 and $1.18. The last low for sterling was $1.2049, reached in January 2017. The record low was $1.0545 from March 1985, just before G7 powers acted to constrain a particularly strong US currency. Sterling suffered today, at the worst possible time for holidaymakers, as the probability of leaving the EU without a deal rises. It dropped to its lowest level versus the dollar since the Article 50 process began in March 2017, just about staying above $1.22. It reached a two-year low versus the euro of below â¬1.10. The weakness is now broad based - there was also a fall against the Yen. It is now a trend, down between 6% and 9% against the major currencies since the beginning of May. This will mean rising consumer prices. The rough rule of thumb would see this 6% trade-weighted fall add about 1 percentage point to inflation, enough to complicate the decisions of the Bank of England over interest rates. In theory, a lower pound helps some exporters and, for example, the domestic UK tourism industry. But so much of our manufacturing base needs to import components in order to make those exports, that this effect has not been strong in the years following the significant pound devaluation after the 2016 Brexit vote. Currencies fluctuate, of course, but the path for the pound has been firmly down, as markets start to calculate that the odds on No Deal are far closer to evens than, as the PM has suggested, ""a million to one"". During a visit to Scotland, Mr Johnson said the existing withdrawal agreement negotiated with European leaders was ""dead"" and had ""got to go"". EU member nations have said renegotiating the deal is not an option. Today's prices mean even fewer euros and dollars at the bureau de change for holidaymakers. At the Post Office, Â£1 buys â¬1.0817 or $1.2041,according to its website.,external Separately, UK government debt prices gained as traders bet on a higher chance that interest rates will be cut. The country's 10-year bonds, considered the benchmark, are changing hands for a price that yields as low as 0.627%, the lowest in nearly three years. This implies that the cost of borrowing for the government has fallen.

"Council-tenant Airbnb host fined Â£100,000","An Airbnb host who rented out his central London council flat to tourists has been fined Â£100,000 and evicted. Council tenant Toby Harman, 37, created the fake identity ""Lara"" on Airbnb to rent out his studio apartment. The flat, in Victoria, had been advertised since 2013 and received more than 300 reviews,Westminster City Council,externalsaid. Anti-fraud software had found Harman's first name in reviews and connected the listing to him. Harman's bank statements showed he had been receiving payments from Airbnb for a number of years. He had been taken to court and, after a failed appeal, evicted and ordered to pay Â£100,974 in unlawful profits,the Times reported,external. 'My Airbnb flat was turned into a pop-up brothel' London firms helping landlords break letting laws What Airbnb really does to a neighbourhood Airbnb told BBC News the council property listing had been removed from its website earlier this year. ""We regularly remind hosts to check and follow local rules - including on subsidised housing - and we take action on issues brought to our attention,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Airbnb... works with London to limit how often hosts can share their space and we support proposals from the mayor of London for a registration system to help local authorities regulate short-term lets and ensure rules are applied equally to hosts on all platforms in the capital."" Toby Harman posed as ""Lara"" to sub-let his studio apartment on Airbnb Westminster Council said it was currently investigating at least 1,500 properties in the borough for short-term letting. ""Social housing is there to provide much-needed homes for our residents, not to generate illicit profits for dishonest tenants,"" the council's Andrew Smith said. ""It's illegal for council tenants to sublet their homes and we carry out tenancy checks, as well as monitoring short-term letting websites for any potential illegal sublets."" It said it would now be able to allocate the property to someone else. ""We're also pressing government to introduce a national registration scheme to make it far easier for us to take action against anyone who breaks the rules on short-term letting,"" he added. London's Airbnb market has quadrupled since 2015, from 20,000 to 80,000 listings. One of the most popular areas for Airbnb listings in the country is Shoreditch, particularly the area around Brick Lane. Arla Propertymark, the professional body representing UK lettings agents, told the BBC that people renting out their homes for days or weeks at a time is on the rise. ""We increasingly hear anecdotal evidence from our members in the big cities London, Birmingham and Manchester) about properties that have been let on tenancy agreements appearing on short-term letting sites...which is reducing the number of properties within the traditional rental market,"" said Arla Propertymark's chief executive David Cox. One legal expert said that most private residential landlords would not allow their properties to be sub-let. Louise Hebborn, partner at the law firm Stephensons said that almost all ""well-drafted"" Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreements include a provision that bans the act, which would cover listing rooms on Airbnb. London's Airbnb market has quadrupled since 2015, due to higher house prices and accommodation costs ""Landlords in general are very cautious of having multiple people in properties because the implication of that is that the landlord has to have a Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence,"" she said. There would also be concerns about whether the property was adequately insured, she added. She said that her law firm had been involved in cases where tenants had been taken to court for breaking the rules.

Vauxhall owner 'could move Astra production from UK',"The chief executive of Vauxhall-owner PSA says it could move all production from its Ellesmere Port factory if Brexit makes it unprofitable. Carlos Tavarestold the Financial Times,externalthat the carmaker has alternatives to the plant which it could use. The move would probably lead to the closure of the site, the FT said, threatening 1,000 jobs. That would leave Vauxhall's Luton-based van plant as its last presence in the UK. ""Frankly I would prefer to put it [the Astra car] in Ellesmere Port, but if the conditions are bad and I cannot make it profitable, then I have to protect the rest of the company and I will not do it,"" Mr Tavares told the paper. ""We have an alternative to Ellesmere Port."" In June, the carmaker announced plans to manufacture the next generation of the Astra, its best selling car, in Ellesmere Port and another factory in Germany. At the time, it warned that its decision would depend on the final Brexit terms. However, Mr Tavares has now gone further, indicating that the firm has another plant in mind should the UK leave the EU without a deal. In an official statement on Monday, PSA confirmed the group was still looking to manufacture the next-generation Astra at Russelsheim and Ellesmere Port. But it warned that the final decision on the role of the Ellesmere Port plant would be conditional on the ""final terms of the UK's exit from the European Union"". ""PSA Groupe has put in to place a comprehensive 'no-deal' contingency plan that covers human resources, taxation, customs, logistics, production, regulation, supply chain and IT,"" it added. The firm said it would closely monitor political developments and engage with politicians to understand the various potential Brexit outcomes. Vauxhall employs about 1,000 people at Ellesmere Port At the weekend, Michael Gove, who has been charged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to prepare for leaving the EU with no deal, said the government was now ""working on the assumption"" of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Gove said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels, but writing in the Sunday Times, he added: ""No deal is now a very real prospect."" Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of Unite, said the union and PSA had been in positive discussions about a new vehicle agreement and securing new models for the Ellesmere Port plant. ""All that hard work is now hanging by a thread as Boris Johnson and his government of hard Brexiteers play no-deal roulette with the livelihoods of thousands of Vauxhall workers and their colleagues in the supply chain,"" he added. ""A no-deal Brexit, or a deal that throws up barriers and tariffs, would be catastrophic for Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port workers and the UK car industry and make plants inefficient, components less attractive and cars built in the UK more expensive for export."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The UK automotive industry remains one of our great success stories. ""We are at the forefront of designing and manufacturing cutting-edge vehicles, and we continue to talk to industry, including the automotive sector, in the run-up to exit day, to ensure they are prepared to maximise the opportunities of our exit from the EU."" By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent This isn't the first time Carlos Tavares has warned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Vauxhall, but it is the most explicit threat he's made so far. Last year, for example, he told methere could be ""dramatic consequences"" for the firm's UK plants, but refused to specify what those consequences might be. Now he is being specific. Production of the next generation Vauxhall Astra could be moved from Ellesmere Port to another plant in southern Europe. Yet it is only a month since PSA Group first unveiled its plans to build the new car in Cheshire. So what's changed? In a word, nothing. That decision was always contingent on a suitable Brexit arrangement being reached to safeguard frictionless trade across the Channel. At the time, company insiders said no-deal was not an option. Now, with a new Prime Minister in office, Mr Tavares is offering him a clear-cut choice. Get a deal, and the future of the plant could be secured. Go for no-deal and - he says - the work will go elsewhere. The Confederation of British Industryhas warned the governmentthat neither the UK or EU is ready for a no-deal Brexit. And the car industry lobby group, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned on Friday that ""no-deal Brexit is simply not an option."" Car production has been falling in the UK over the past year, amid increasing pleas from the industry for a Brexit deal. The UK's automotive industry has received a series of blows in recent months, with Honda announcing it will close its Swindon plant in 2021. Ford also said its Bridgend engine plant in south Wales would close in September 2020 with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Japanese car producers, including Nissan, have said that Brexit uncertainty is not helping them ""plan for the future"". Earlier this year, Nissan opted to build the next X-Trail model in Japan, rather than in Sunderland.

Work on Boeing crash plane ânot adequately fundedâBoeing is making billions from the 737 Max but an ex-engineer says production resources were lacking.Business,"A former Boeing engineer has told the BBC's Panorama programme that work on the production line of the 737 Max plane was not adequately funded. The aircraft is currently grounded after two crashes which killed 346 people. The 737 Max is the company's fastest selling plane and has earned the company billions of dollars in sales. Boeing denies the claims and says it's committed to making the 737 Max one of the safest aircraft ever to fly. This video can not be played Boeing 737 Max: Work on production line ""not adequately funded"" Adam Dickson worked at Boeing for 30 years and led a team of engineers who worked on the 737 Max.  He said they were under constant pressure to keep costs down. ""Certainly what I saw was a lack of sufficient resources to do the job in its entirety,"" he says. ""The culture was very cost centred, incredibly pressurised. Engineers were given targets to get certain amount of cost out of the aeroplane."" Adam Dickson worked for three decades at Boeing Mr Dickson said engineers were under pressure to downplay new features on the 737 Max. He said by classifying them as minor rather than major changes, Boeing would face less scrutiny from the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration. ""The goal was to show that those differences were so similar to the previous design that it would not require a major design classification in the certification process. There was a lot of interest and pressure on the certification and analysis engineers in particular, to look at any changes to the Max as minor changes."" He said that downplaying the changes reduced scrutiny in a way that could impact safety. Now even his own family have fears about the plane's safety. ""My family won't fly on a 737 Max. It's frightening to see such a major incident because of a system that didn't function properly or accurately."" Boeing and the battle over blame What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit? Boeing said its former engineer's comments were incorrect. ""We did not cut corners or push the 737 Max out before it was ready,"" it said. ""We have always held true to our values of safety, quality and integrity and those values are complementary and mutually reinforcing with productivity and company performance."" Boeing says that safety is one of its values Passengers first flew on the 737 Max in 2017, but airlines have been making advance purchases since the plane was first marketed in 2011 Five thousand have been ordered - making it the fastest-selling plane in Boeing's history. Some of the money from those sales has been used to fund big pay-outs for company executives and shareholders. Since 2013, Boeing has paid $17bn (Â£13.74bn) in dividends to shareholders and has spent a further $43bn buying its own shares - a spending spree that has helped Boeing treble its share price in just five years. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has also been paid more than $70m. Economist William Lazonick says senior management were too focused on making money. Critics have accused Boeing of paying more attention to the stock market than the safety of its passengers. Economist William Lazonick said senior management were too focused on making money. ""If you supercharge the incentives of top executives and tell them that their job is to get the stock price up, they're not going to pay the kind of attention they need to pay to ensuring they produce a safe plane,"" he said. Boeing said it ""follows a balanced cash deployment strategy that ensures investment in our core businesses and workforce, returns value to shareholders and maintains our strong balance sheet and credit rating"". The 737 Max has been grounded since March and there is currently no sign of regulators allowing the plane back in the skies. Boeing warns it may halt 737 Max production Boeing takes $5bn hit to cover 737 Max crisis Boeing has been trying to fix the software that forced the aircraft in Indonesia and Ethiopia down. MCAS was designed to operate when the plane was flying at a steep, nose-up angle - and would automatically attempt to move the nose downwards. It was meant to make the controls feel more predictable and familiar to pilots who were used to older versions of the 737. This video can not be played The MCAS system explained But pilots didn't know about MCAS because it wasn't included in training materials or the 1,600-page manual for the Max. Boeing's system also had a fatal flaw - it used a single sensor to work out the angle the plane was flying at. On both the Indonesian and Ethiopian flights, that sensor stopped working properly.  This resulted in MCAS forcing the aircraft downwards even though they were already on the correct course. The pilots struggled to regain control, because MCAS was designed to kick back in every few seconds. The Indonesian plane was forced down more than 20 times before it crashed. Boeing said it wasn't relying on the single sensor, because the pilots were there as back up. It said there was a way to override MCAS - a standard procedure that pilots should have known about from flying the old 737. The company has said the pilots didn't completely follow the correct operating procedures when things went wrong. But 737 pilots like Chris Brady say it is wrong to blame the pilots. ""If you're going to design and certify an airliner with such a complicated, obscure failure mode as happened to that crew, it's no wonder that your average crew aren't able to deal with it,"" he said. Boeing said it is focusing on implementing the software update, finalising pilot training and rebuilding trust with customers. ""Boeing truly regrets the loss of life and will continue to work with communities, customers and the aviation industry to help with the healing process,"" it said. ""In any accident we must learn from what happened.  It's also important to avoid speculating ahead of the final investigative reports.""

Johnson to 'hold out the hand' for Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there is ""every chance"" the UK can get a deal with the EU Boris Johnson has pledged to ""hold out the hand"" and ""go the extra thousand miles"" to strike a new Brexit deal. During a visit to Scotland, the prime minister said the existing withdrawal agreement negotiated with European leaders was ""dead"" and had ""got to go"". However, he said there was ""every chance we can get a deal"". But Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Mr Johnson had set the UK on an ""almost inevitable path to a no-deal Brexit"". Preparations for leaving the European Union without a withdrawal deal are being ramped up, with Mr Johnson saying the UK must leave the EU by 31 October. While in Scotland he met Ms Sturgeon and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson - both of whom have positioned themselves against a no-deal exit. Don't underestimate Boris Johnson, EU warned Could PMâs trickiest meeting be with one of his own? Gove: No-deal Brexit now 'assumed' by government Johnson 'absolutely' rules out early election Two committees have been set up as the UK government intensifies preparations for a possible no-deal exit, including a ""daily operations committee"" of senior ministers. Meanwhile, the pound has sunk toa 28-month low against the dollar, apparently due to concerns about Brexit. Speaking at the Faslane naval base near Glasgow, Mr Johnson said his ""assumption is that we can get a new deal"", but said it was ""responsible for any government to prepare for no deal if we absolutely have to"". He said: ""I don't want the UK to be aloof or hanging back, I want us to engage, to hold out the hand, to go the extra thousand miles, and what we want to do is make it absolutely clear that the backstop is no good, it's dead, it's got to go. ""The withdrawal agreement is dead, it's got to go. But there is scope for us to do a new deal. ""We will make it very clear to our friends - we're talking to the Irish today - what the limits are and what we want to do. ""We're very confident that with goodwill on both sides, two mature political entities, the UK and EU, can get this thing done."" Mr Johnson announced a new Office for Veterans' Affairs while visiting the Faslane naval base Meanwhile,the prime minister's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, has urged his EU counterparts not to ""underestimate"" Mr Johnsonor his commitment to the 31 October deadline. Mr Johnson has faced scrutiny over his Brexit strategy from colleagues and opponents alike during his visit to Scotland. Ms Davidson has previously said Mr Johnson has her ""full support"" in his efforts to secure a withdrawal agreement with the EU, but that she will not support a no-deal Brexit. After a meeting at Holyrood, the Scottish Tory leader said the pair had discussed their ""shared determination to strengthen the Union"", adding Mr Johnson had ""made clear the government's preference is to leave the EU with a deal"". Mr Johnson, meanwhile, said he was Ms Davidson's ""number one fan"". Analysis by BBC Scotland editor Sarah Smith Ruth Davidson met Mr Johnson at the Scottish Parliament Boris Johnson's toughest meeting might not have been with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, but rather Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson. Ms Davidson made no secret of the fact that she did not want Mr Johnson as PM. And in the few days since he took charge relations have already gone further south. He ignored his Scottish leader's advice not to sack the Scottish Secretary David Mundell and replace him with the pro-Brexit MP Alister Jack. He then further snubbed the Scottish contingent of parliamentarians when heput an MP who sits for an English seatinto the Scotland office as a minister. Ms Davidson has said publicly that she would not support a no-deal exit from the EU and that as leader of the Scottish party she does not have to sign up to any loyalty pledge to support a no deal. She believes the PM would have sacked her if he could. But he can't - and she will take full advantage of her ability to speak out. Read more from Sarah Ms Sturgeon - who hosted Mr Johnson at her official Bute House residence - has also pledged to fight against a no-deal exit, saying it would cost 100,000 jobs and ""plunge the economy into recession"". Speaking after what she described as a ""very lively exchange"" with Mr Johnson, she also said she believed he was really pursuing a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played Sturgeon: UK government's Brexit path ""dangerous"" ""He says he wants to get a deal, but what is not clear to me is how he intends to get from the very hard-line, fixed position that he's taken to a position where a deal is possible, if the EU also sticks to the very consistent position it has taken,"" she said. ""That makes me think that whatever Boris Johnson is saying about his preference being to strike a deal, in reality he is pursuing a no-deal Brexit."" She added that she had made clear to Mr Johnson her opposition to Brexit and no-deal and that the people of Scotland should be able to ""choose their own future"". A No 10 spokesman said the PM told Ms Sturgeon he ""was a passionate believer in the power of the Union"" and ""would work tirelessly to strengthen the United Kingdom and improve the lives of people right across Scotland"". Mr Johnson said his preference was to negotiate a new deal that abolished the backstop - but the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October ""come what may"", the spokesman added. Mr Johnson is met Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at Bute House in Edinburgh Mr Johnson also used his trip to Scotland to announce funding for projects to boost the economy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay claimed the Â£300m ""isn't new funding"" and was already under negotiation before Mr Johnson became prime minister. Welsh Labour also hit out at the funding plans,calling them ""very thin stuff""which would not make up for a ""chronic lack of investment"". This video can not be played Emotions were high as Boris Johnson arrived at Bute House The UK government, however, insisted the money was new, with Scottish Secretary Alister Jack saying city deals would help ""create jobs and boost local economies"". The growth deal plan comes after Mr Johnson announced a Â£3.6bn towns fund over the weekend, which will initially support 100 places in England. As part of his visit to Scotland, the prime minister also announcedplans for a new Office for Veterans' Affairswithin the UK government, to coordinate medical treatment and training and ""ensure no veteran is disadvantaged because of their service"". The prime minister also plans to go to Wales to meet members of its farming community and Northern Ireland to discuss ongoing efforts to restore devolution at Stormont. Who is in charge of what?

The background you need on the protests,"This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Hong Kong has seen several months of pro-democracy protests - and China appears to be tightening its grip. The protests began in June 2019 over plans - later put on ice, and finally withdrawn in September - that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China. They then spread to reflect wider demands for democratic reform, and an inquiry into alleged police brutality. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law, which critics believe could be used to crack down on rights and political activists. This is not all happening in a vacuum. There's a lot of important context - some of it stretching back decades - that helps explain what is going on. It's important to remember that Hong Kong is significantly different from other Chinese cities. To understand this, you need to look at its history. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests It was a British colony for more than 150 years - part of it, Hong Kong island, was ceded to the UK after a war in 1842. Later, China also leased the rest of Hong Kong - the New Territories - to the British for 99 years. It became a busy trading port, and its economy took off in the 1950s as it became a manufacturing hub. The territory was also popular with migrants and dissidents fleeing instability, poverty or persecution in mainland China. Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Young, radical and ready for tear gas Read more about Hong Kong's history Then, in the early 1980s, as the deadline for the 99-year-lease approached, Britain and China began talks on the future of Hong Kong - with the communist government in China arguing that all of Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese rule. The two sides signed a treaty in 1984 that would see Hong Kong return to China in 1997, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". This meant that while becoming part of one country with China, Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. As a result, Hong Kong has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly, free speech and freedom of the press are protected. For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, where the military opened fire on unarmed protesters in Beijing. Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China - but they are widely thought to be on the decline. Rights groups have accused China of meddling in Hong Kong, citing examples such as legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators, and the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers, and a tycoon - who all eventually re-emerged in custody in China. There are also accusations that press and academic freedoms have been deteriorating. In March, China effectively expelled several US journalists - but also prohibited them from working in Hong Kong. The public broadcaster RTHK has come under pressure from Hong Kong's government, first for broadcasting an interview with the World Health Organization about Taiwan, and then for targeting police in its satirical news show ""Headliner"". The local examinations body also came under fire for a world history question about relations between Japan and China, with the government demanding the exam question be invalidated. The government said it was a professional, rather than political, decision, but many academics expressed concern. This video can not be played Police use tear gas on protesters Another sticking point has been democratic reform. Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee - a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible voters. Not all the 70 members of the territory's lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, are directly chosen by Hong Kong's voters. Most seats not directly elected are occupied by pro-Beijing lawmakers. Some elected members have even been disbarredafter Beijing issued a controversial legal ruling that effectively disqualified them. Hope and defiance on the streets of Hong Kong Were triads involved in Hong Kong attacks? Hong Kong'smini-constitution, the Basic Law,external, says that ultimately both the leader, and the Legislative Council, should be elected in a more democratic way - but there's been disagreement over what this should look like. The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee, but critics called this a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature. In 28 years' time in 2047, the Basic Law expires - and what happens to Hong Kong's autonomy after that is unclear. While most people in Hong Kong are ethnic Chinese, and although Hong Kong is part of China, a majority of people there don't identify as Chinese. Surveys from the University of Hong Kong show thatmost people identify themselves as ""Hong Kongers"",external-only 11% would call themselves ""Chinese"",external- and 71% of people saythey do not feel proud about being Chinese citizens,external. The difference is particularly pronounced amongst the young. ""The younger the respondents, the less likely they feel proud of becoming a national citizen of China, and also the more negative they are toward the Central Government's policies on Hong Kong,"" the university's public opinion programme says. Hong Kongers have described legal, social and cultural differences - and the fact Hong Kong was a separate colony for 150 years - as reasons why they don't identify with their compatriots in mainland China. There has also been a rise in anti-mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong in recent years, with people complaining about rude tourists disregarding local norms or driving up the cost of living. Some young activists have even called for Hong Kong's independence from China, something that alarms the Beijing government. Demonstrations in 2014 went on for several weeks There's a rich history of dissent in Hong Kong, stretching back further even than the past few years. In 1966, demonstrations broke out after the Star Ferry Company decided to increase its fares. The protests escalated into riots, a full curfew was declared and hundreds of troops took to the streets. Do protests ever work in China? Young and unhappy in HK Protests have continued since 1997, but now the biggest ones tend to be of a political nature - and bring demonstrators into conflict with mainland China's position. This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake inside the Legislative Council after protests in 2019 While Hong Kongers have a degree of autonomy, they have little liberty in the polls, meaning protests are one of the few ways they can make their opinions heard. As a result, many see taking to the streets as their only way of forcing change. And, in the past, some protests have been successful. In 2003,up to 500,000 people took to the streets,externalto protest against a controversial security bill the Hong Kong government was trying to pass. The local government also backed down over""patriotic education"" classesfollowing rallies against the move. However, the Chinese government has adopted a harder stance in recent years, particularly with any movements it views as a direct challenge to its own authority. In 2014, demonstrators took to the streets peacefully for several weeks, demanding Hong Kongers be given the right to elect their own leader. But the so-called Umbrella movement eventually fizzled out with no concessions from Beijing. In June 2019, protesters took to the streets again, demonstrating against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. This time, clashes between police and activists became increasingly violent. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 The bill was halted, and later fully withdrawn, but demonstrations continued for months, with demands for full democracy and an independent inquiry into police actions. In April this year, Hong Kong police arrested 15 of the city's most high-profile pro-democracy activists for taking part in unauthorised assemblies. In May, Hong Kong's police watchdog said it found no significant wrongdoing on the police's part during the 2019 protests - in a report that was criticised by many rights groups and external experts. The street protests have mostly died down during the coronavirus pandemic, although some small demonstrations, including singing protesters in shopping malls, have started again as restrictions are gradually eased. Now, China is proposing to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, which could be similar to the one withdrawn in 2003. It says the legislation is ""highly necessary"" and would ""safeguard national security in Hong Kong"". However, the new proposal is also controversial because it is expected to circumvent Hong Kong's own law-making processes - leading to accusations that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.

Work on Boeing crash plane ânot adequately fundedâ,"A former Boeing engineer has told the BBC's Panorama programme that work on the production line of the 737 Max plane was not adequately funded. The aircraft is currently grounded after two crashes which killed 346 people. The 737 Max is the company's fastest selling plane and has earned the company billions of dollars in sales. Boeing denies the claims and says it's committed to making the 737 Max one of the safest aircraft ever to fly. This video can not be played Boeing 737 Max: Work on production line ""not adequately funded"" Adam Dickson worked at Boeing for 30 years and led a team of engineers who worked on the 737 Max.  He said they were under constant pressure to keep costs down. ""Certainly what I saw was a lack of sufficient resources to do the job in its entirety,"" he says. ""The culture was very cost centred, incredibly pressurised. Engineers were given targets to get certain amount of cost out of the aeroplane."" Adam Dickson worked for three decades at Boeing Mr Dickson said engineers were under pressure to downplay new features on the 737 Max. He said by classifying them as minor rather than major changes, Boeing would face less scrutiny from the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration. ""The goal was to show that those differences were so similar to the previous design that it would not require a major design classification in the certification process. There was a lot of interest and pressure on the certification and analysis engineers in particular, to look at any changes to the Max as minor changes."" He said that downplaying the changes reduced scrutiny in a way that could impact safety. Now even his own family have fears about the plane's safety. ""My family won't fly on a 737 Max. It's frightening to see such a major incident because of a system that didn't function properly or accurately."" Boeing and the battle over blame What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit? Boeing said its former engineer's comments were incorrect. ""We did not cut corners or push the 737 Max out before it was ready,"" it said. ""We have always held true to our values of safety, quality and integrity and those values are complementary and mutually reinforcing with productivity and company performance."" Boeing says that safety is one of its values Passengers first flew on the 737 Max in 2017, but airlines have been making advance purchases since the plane was first marketed in 2011 Five thousand have been ordered - making it the fastest-selling plane in Boeing's history. Some of the money from those sales has been used to fund big pay-outs for company executives and shareholders. Since 2013, Boeing has paid $17bn (Â£13.74bn) in dividends to shareholders and has spent a further $43bn buying its own shares - a spending spree that has helped Boeing treble its share price in just five years. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has also been paid more than $70m. Economist William Lazonick says senior management were too focused on making money. Critics have accused Boeing of paying more attention to the stock market than the safety of its passengers. Economist William Lazonick said senior management were too focused on making money. ""If you supercharge the incentives of top executives and tell them that their job is to get the stock price up, they're not going to pay the kind of attention they need to pay to ensuring they produce a safe plane,"" he said. Boeing said it ""follows a balanced cash deployment strategy that ensures investment in our core businesses and workforce, returns value to shareholders and maintains our strong balance sheet and credit rating"". The 737 Max has been grounded since March and there is currently no sign of regulators allowing the plane back in the skies. Boeing warns it may halt 737 Max production Boeing takes $5bn hit to cover 737 Max crisis Boeing has been trying to fix the software that forced the aircraft in Indonesia and Ethiopia down. MCAS was designed to operate when the plane was flying at a steep, nose-up angle - and would automatically attempt to move the nose downwards. It was meant to make the controls feel more predictable and familiar to pilots who were used to older versions of the 737. This video can not be played The MCAS system explained But pilots didn't know about MCAS because it wasn't included in training materials or the 1,600-page manual for the Max. Boeing's system also had a fatal flaw - it used a single sensor to work out the angle the plane was flying at. On both the Indonesian and Ethiopian flights, that sensor stopped working properly.  This resulted in MCAS forcing the aircraft downwards even though they were already on the correct course. The pilots struggled to regain control, because MCAS was designed to kick back in every few seconds. The Indonesian plane was forced down more than 20 times before it crashed. Boeing said it wasn't relying on the single sensor, because the pilots were there as back up. It said there was a way to override MCAS - a standard procedure that pilots should have known about from flying the old 737. The company has said the pilots didn't completely follow the correct operating procedures when things went wrong. But 737 pilots like Chris Brady say it is wrong to blame the pilots. ""If you're going to design and certify an airliner with such a complicated, obscure failure mode as happened to that crew, it's no wonder that your average crew aren't able to deal with it,"" he said. Boeing said it is focusing on implementing the software update, finalising pilot training and rebuilding trust with customers. ""Boeing truly regrets the loss of life and will continue to work with communities, customers and the aviation industry to help with the healing process,"" it said. ""In any accident we must learn from what happened.  It's also important to avoid speculating ahead of the final investigative reports.""

"Parents' court challenge over Christian assembliesAn Oxfordshire couple say ""harmful aspects of evangelism"" are spreading into their children's school.Oxford","Burford Primary School joined the Oxford Diocesan Schools Trust in 2015 A couple are taking the Church of England to court over Christian school assemblies which they say are ""indoctrinating"" their children. Lee and Lizanne Harris have been granted a judicial review in their challenge to the Oxford Diocesan Schools Trust, which runs Burford Primary School. They said the school should provide an ""inclusive"" alternative. The trust said the school had ""acted entirely appropriately"". Trust chief executive Anne Davey said: ""It has provided exactly what the law requires, which includes provision for children to be withdrawn if parents so request."" The couple said they had asked the school to provide ""a meaningful alternative of equal educational worth"" after withdrawing their children from assemblies. They claim the children were instead left in a room with a teaching assistant and an iPad. They said they were concerned Christian stories were presented as fact, and said visiting church officials expressed ""harmful views"" to children. In a statement they said: ""We enrolled our children into a state community school - which is meant to have no religious character. ""But over time we noticed harmful aspects of evangelism spreading into assembly and other parts of the school. ""We take this step very reluctantly but feel strongly that we need to try to make our children's education as inclusive as possible."" The trust said all publicly-funded schools in England and Wales were required to hold daily religious worship.

"The UK 'will legalise cannabis', say MPs","A group of cross-party MPs who've been on a fact-finding trip to Canada predict the UK will fully legalise cannabis use within five to ten years. Canada became the first G7 country to allow recreational use of the drug in 2018. Of the three politicians in the group one had a significant shift in his position. Labour's David Lammy now backs legalisation, against his party's official stance. Mr Lammy, alongside Conservative Jonathan Djanogly and Liberal Democrat Sir Norman Lamb were all filmed on their journey for a Radio 1 Newsbeat documentary called Legalising Weed: Canada's Story. This video can not be played Legalising Weed: Canada's Story Currently cannabis is designated as a Class B drug in the UK and anyone caught with it could face up to five years in prison. However, there has been a shift in approach towards medicinal cannabis products, which can now be legally prescribed to some patients. The decision to relax those rules followedan outcry over two boyswith severe epilepsy being denied access to cannabis oil. It's argued that where cannabis has been legalised for medical use, authorised recreational use often follows. Tottenham MP David Lammy visits a legally-grown cannabis crop in Canada ""I want the market legalised, regulated and taken away from crime gangs,"" said Tottenham MP David Lammy after returning from visiting Toronto. ""For young people not to be criminalised by use and properly educated. ""I want to see the strength of the stuff reduced, labelled and properly organised in this country."" The Liberal Democrat Party already officially backs legalising cannabis in the UK. Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? MP for North Norfolk, Sir Norman Lamb led that policy decision. Whilst in Canada he wanted to legally sample cannabis oil to try to help him sleep. But he was very aware that such a product would be illegal in the UK. He may be the only serving British MP to ever openly take a cannabis product on camera. ""Taking this oil is purely for sleeping for relaxation, I will take it before bed and before my flight home."" It's different to the cannabis oils available legitimately in the UK because it containedTHC, the compound that gets users high. ""I was really anxious because I was chairing the technology and science select committee and I was travelling back over night, and I thought if I get back with no sleep it will be a challenge."" He said he did not feel high but it did help him fall asleep. ""I slept incredibly well. ""I took the drops and I slept very well on the plane home, I actually slept through breakfast."" The trip was organised by a UK-based campaign group, Volte Face, which wants the UK to legalise the drug. It's part sponsored by a big North American cannabis company called MPX. Newsbeat suggested that it was trying to use its money to influence British politicians. Scott Boyes says his company wants to make profit out of selling cannabis responsibly in the UK ""We're moving it away from organised crime to a legitimate commercial industry,"" Scott Boyes, MPX CEO, told us. ""We've had a lot of UK investors invest in our company and we're moving into six countries. ""A lot of the money we have raised has come out of the UK, so I don't consider it interfering with other people's politics and a lot of the expenses have been born by themselves."" Sir Norman Lamb and David Lammy decided to fund their own flights and accommodation. But the MPs also realise Canada's experience has not been without problems. In the documentary we hear from Piper Courtenay whose title is Cannabis Editor for a weekly newspaper. She describes how technically illegal, but often described as ""grey"", cannabis providers still thrive. The limits on fully licensed products mean there's still a market for things like edibles and other cannabis products. Around half of the cannabis bought in Canada still comes from illegal sources. ""It's certainly better than the legal product I have tried so far, because they genuinely care about growing good craft cannabis,"" she tells us. Products on sale at a legal shop in Canada All three MPs on the trip believed that the UK would follow Canada's lead and legalise cannabis for recreational use in the next decade. But Conservative MP for Huntingdon, Jonathan Djanogly, was perhaps unsurprisingly given his party name, the most conservative with his predictions. ""I think we have got a lot to learn before the legalisation of recreational cannabis, which I think will happen at some point,"" Jonathan Djanogly told us. ""I think we're on a 10 to 15 year cycle which would mirror what has happened in Canada."" The other MPs felt it would happen sooner and closer to five years. However, the government told Newsbeat it ""has no intention of changing the law"" when it comes to legalisation. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The legalisation of these substances would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery they can cause to families and society.""

Man trapped in rocks 'rescued toddler from sea',"Emergency services were at the scene for more than three hours A man who had to be rescued after he got trapped in rocks had saved a toddler from the water as the tide came in on the Norfolk coast. The man, in his 20s, became stuck after rescuing one of his children near Sheringham's east promenade, senior coastguard Tony Garbutt said. He was up to his neck in the water for several hours and freed by firefighters who cut through the rock. Emergency services kept his head above water and gave him breathing apparatus. Mr Garbutt said the man sustained some injuries but they were not serious. The toddler was unharmed. HM Coastguard and Sheringham RNLI co-ordinated the rescue effort after the alarm was raised at 17:30 BST. Mr Garbutt said the man had been leaving the beach with his family when one of his children slipped. Then as he stepped over to grab the child the man slipped and became stuck. The coastguard earlier described the incident as ""a very frightening experience"". Spokesman Sam Stockdale said: ""It's such good news that this man has been freed. Everyone worked together on scene to look after the man and also to free him as soon as was practically possible."" Witness Lissy Jackson said she had seen the rescue workers at the scene:  ""I saw a number of [them] crowded round the rocks attempting to free the man. ""I later then saw two large trucks pull in with equipment to aid in breaking rocks to break the man free."" Sheringham sea front. (Library picture, 2014) Retired coastguard station manager Stuart Facey told the North Norfolk News he had been walking his dog when the Coastguard arrived. ""I saw someone obviously stuck in the rocks, it was high tide and water was coming over him so it was a very scary situation,"" he said. ""I've seen people climb into the cavities in the rocks and the problem is that even if you are able to move a rock to free someone who is stuck, another can fall into its place, it can be a life or death situation."" Norfolk Police, Norfolk Fire and Rescue and the East of England Ambulance Service were also in attendance.

Air fare wars and Brexit hit Ryanair,"Ryanair has reported a sharp fall in quarterly profits as it reduced fares to drive up passenger numbers. Profits fell 21% to â¬243m (Â£219m) for the three months to the end of June, as the average ticket price fell 6%. The airline was also hit by higher costs for fuel and staff. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the two weakest markets were Germany, where Ryanair faced fierce competition on price, and the UK, where there were Brexit uncertainties. Mr O'Leary said that in Germany, ""Lufthansa was allowed to buy Air Berlin and is selling this excess capacity at below cost prices"". Meanwhile in the UK, ""Brexit concerns weigh negatively on consumer confidence and spending"". He added that ""the current weak fare environment has continued into the second quarter and we expect [first half] fares to be down approximately 6%"". Ryanair said the drop in fares had been partially offset by 14% higher ancillary revenue, such as from baggage, food and other fees. ""The June quarter results were not quite as bad as feared,"" Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said in a note, adding that ticket revenue was ""slightly light"" compared with forecasts but that revenue from optional extras was ""better than anticipated"". In a call with analysts, the airline boss also warned that Ryanair might cut routes from London to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""An obvious one [to cut] if there is a hard Brexit at the end of October, we have three UK domestic routes... they would readily fall out straight away,"" he said. ""There is a longer-term question mark over those in a hard Brexit,"" Mr O'Leary said. ""Frankly... we are not growing in Edinburgh, Glasgow or Belfast."" Ryanair to cut flights after 737 Max delays Ryanair expects to win in airline 'fare wars' Earlier this month, the carrier said it was adjusting its schedules because of the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max family of jets. It cut the number of new Max jets it was expecting to operate next summer from 58 to 30. However, Mr O'Leary said on Monday that he was ""concerned that the Max return to service keeps slipping"". He said the estimate for how many 737 Max planes Ryanair operates next summer could drop to 20, ""which would significantly truncate our growth rate"". But, he also said that the number could move to 10 or zero if the situation was not sorted out ""pretty quickly with the regulator"". The forecast for profits after tax for the year remains unchanged at between â¬750m and â¬950m (Â£675m-Â£850m). In recent weeks, the airline has been hit by the threat of strike action by pilots in the UK and Ireland and cabin crew in Portugal. Chief financial officer Niall Sorohan has said the airline is open to talks with staff.

Flood warnings as deluge causes travel chaos,"A car was left submerged in floodwater on the A34 near Alderley Edge in Cheshire Commuters faced delays as heavy rain caused disruption to the North West's road and rail network on Monday. Trains were cancelled between Manchester and towns including Wigan and Stalybridge. The A555 Manchester Airport Relief Road remained closed. The equivalent ofhalf a month's rain fellon the region in the space of 24 hours, the Met Office said. In Manchester, canal boat owners feared being swept away as water levels rose. The Met Office said rain would return to the region on Tuesday, when a warning was in place for thunderstorms. Flood warnings were in place across the North West at the start of Monday Roads remain closed due to flooding in Holmes Chapel, Northwich and Frodsham in Cheshire. Part of the Manchester Airport link-road has reopened after flooding in two places, although drivers have been warned of congestion during the evening rush hour. National Rail said trains were unable to run between Manchester Victoria and Todmorden in West Yorkshire because of flooding, while the A34 in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, was also closed. This video can not be played Three weeks' worth of rain fell in 48 hours in West Yorkshire. Met Office meteorologist Helen Roberts said 100mm (4in) of rain - more than the 89.5mm monthly average for July - had fallen in Rochdale in 48 hours over the weekend. Mavis and Jack Ripley were mopping up at their home in Turf Hill Road, Rochdale, after several properties in the town were flooded during Sunday's downpour. Mavis and Jack Ripley said their home had been flooded five times in the last five years The couple said a mixture of water and sewage rose through the drains into their house. They called for the local authority to improve drainage after a number of similar floods in recent years. Rochdale Council has been approached for comment. A man and a boy made the most of weather in Sale, Manchester Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said it had dealt with 116 emergency calls in 24 hours up to 08:00 BST on Monday. The brigade dealt with flooding in Sale and Rochdale and used a boat to rescue five people trapped in vehicles surrounded by floodwater in Stannybrook Road, Failsworth, at 19:50 on Sunday.

Photographer Ashley Stocks spoke to owners of canal boats moored at Castlefield in Manchester on Sunday night who feared fast-flowing water could wash their barges away. Boat owners feared their barges would be swept away as water levels rose in Manchester In Preston, Lancashire, fire crews were called to rescue two people and a dog from the River Ribble at 16:00 BST on Sunday. BBC Radio Manchester reporter Anna Jameson reported that a pump to help keep the A555 clear of water had failed. It is the second time the Â£290m road, which links Hazel Grove in Stockport with Manchester Airport, has been closed because of flooding since it opened in October 2018. Cheadle MP Mary Robinson said the closure of the road was an ""emergency"" but there needed to be ""better communication"" from Stockport Council with local drivers who use the road. Stockport Council has apologised for its ""lack of communication"" with residents over the problems on Sunday and overnight. Caroline Simpson, corporate director with the council, said: ""I would like to apologise because information was absolutely key for people making journeys. If our website was not up to date I can only apologise."" A spokesman for Stockport Council said contractors responsible for maintaining the pumps were at the scene and the road would reopen when the water had ""been cleared and the road cleaned"". There were no reports of airport passengers being delayed as a consequence. The Environment Agency has lifted a flood warning covering Calderdale in West Yorkshire. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said it had been been dealing with ""widespread flooding"" in towns and properties.

"Council-tenant Airbnb host fined Â£100,000A council tenant used a fake identity to rent out his central London flat to tourists on Airbnb.Technology","An Airbnb host who rented out his central London council flat to tourists has been fined Â£100,000 and evicted. Council tenant Toby Harman, 37, created the fake identity ""Lara"" on Airbnb to rent out his studio apartment. The flat, in Victoria, had been advertised since 2013 and received more than 300 reviews,Westminster City Council,externalsaid. Anti-fraud software had found Harman's first name in reviews and connected the listing to him. Harman's bank statements showed he had been receiving payments from Airbnb for a number of years. He had been taken to court and, after a failed appeal, evicted and ordered to pay Â£100,974 in unlawful profits,the Times reported,external. 'My Airbnb flat was turned into a pop-up brothel' London firms helping landlords break letting laws What Airbnb really does to a neighbourhood Airbnb told BBC News the council property listing had been removed from its website earlier this year. ""We regularly remind hosts to check and follow local rules - including on subsidised housing - and we take action on issues brought to our attention,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Airbnb... works with London to limit how often hosts can share their space and we support proposals from the mayor of London for a registration system to help local authorities regulate short-term lets and ensure rules are applied equally to hosts on all platforms in the capital."" Toby Harman posed as ""Lara"" to sub-let his studio apartment on Airbnb Westminster Council said it was currently investigating at least 1,500 properties in the borough for short-term letting. ""Social housing is there to provide much-needed homes for our residents, not to generate illicit profits for dishonest tenants,"" the council's Andrew Smith said. ""It's illegal for council tenants to sublet their homes and we carry out tenancy checks, as well as monitoring short-term letting websites for any potential illegal sublets."" It said it would now be able to allocate the property to someone else. ""We're also pressing government to introduce a national registration scheme to make it far easier for us to take action against anyone who breaks the rules on short-term letting,"" he added. London's Airbnb market has quadrupled since 2015, from 20,000 to 80,000 listings. One of the most popular areas for Airbnb listings in the country is Shoreditch, particularly the area around Brick Lane. Arla Propertymark, the professional body representing UK lettings agents, told the BBC that people renting out their homes for days or weeks at a time is on the rise. ""We increasingly hear anecdotal evidence from our members in the big cities London, Birmingham and Manchester) about properties that have been let on tenancy agreements appearing on short-term letting sites...which is reducing the number of properties within the traditional rental market,"" said Arla Propertymark's chief executive David Cox. One legal expert said that most private residential landlords would not allow their properties to be sub-let. Louise Hebborn, partner at the law firm Stephensons said that almost all ""well-drafted"" Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreements include a provision that bans the act, which would cover listing rooms on Airbnb. London's Airbnb market has quadrupled since 2015, due to higher house prices and accommodation costs ""Landlords in general are very cautious of having multiple people in properties because the implication of that is that the landlord has to have a Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMO) licence,"" she said. There would also be concerns about whether the property was adequately insured, she added. She said that her law firm had been involved in cases where tenants had been taken to court for breaking the rules.

Scotland's largest offshore wind farm to be openedPrince Charles will visit the offices of the Beatrice Offshore wind farm to officially open the project.Scotland,"Beatrice is an offshore wind farm off Scotland's Caithness coast Scotland's largest offshore wind farm has been officially opened by Prince Charles. The Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm, located about eight miles  (13km) off the coast of Wick in the far north, can generate enough energy to power 450,000 homes. The Â£2.65bn project, which involves 84 huge turbines, came fully online in May and achieved 588MW of electricity. It is Scotland's single largest source of renewable energy. The development, construction and operation were led by SSE Renewables in a joint venture with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Red Rock Power Limited. Construction started in May 2016 and SSE said it was completed on time and Â£100m under budget. The turbines were installed in a three-year phase of the scheme Part of the project involved redeveloping buildings in Wick, the Caithness town where about 90 staff will look after the operations and maintenance of the wind farm over its 25-year lifespan. Prince Charles, who is known in Scotland as the Duke of Rothesay, visited the offices of Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited and SSE Renewables in Wick to mark the official opening. The two harbour-front buildings used for the Wick base were originally designed by renowned Scottish architect Thomas Telford for use in the herring industry. The electricity generated by Beatrice travels along subsea and underground cables before coming ashore near Keith in Moray and connecting to the Blackhillock substation. The Walney extension, opened in 2018, is the largest in the world The world's largest offshore wind farm isWalney, off the coast of Cumbria. It is said to be able to generate sufficient power for 600,000 homes. Two other offshore sites have output greater than Beatrice: London Array, which is 10 miles north of Ramsgate in the Thames Estuary. Gemini Wind Farm, in the Netherlands. The others in the top 10, in order of output, are: Gode Wind, in Germany Gwynt y Mor, off Llandudno in Conwy county. Race Bank, off the Norfolk and Lincolnshire coast. Greater Gabbard, off the Suffolk and Essex coast. Dudgeon, off the Norfolk coast. Veja Mate, in Germany Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, said the scale of the project was ""truly staggering"". ""Scotland has a quarter of Europe's offshore wind resource and Beatrice represents one of the first steps in tapping it,"" she said. ""As our offshore wind projects continue to build out we'll see the environmental and economic benefits of offshore wind grow across Scotland, with jobs and investment transforming communities, as they already are in Wick."" The Beatrice turbines are installed in sea depths of up to 183ft (56m) She added: ""With the right support from government, a supply chain which is competitive on price, quality and timescales and the commitment of industry, offshore wind has a bright future in Scotland as we work towards meeting some of the world's most challenging climate change targets and building a smart energy system with renewable energy at its heart."" The Beatrice project is the fourth largest offshore wind farm in the world, with only two projects in England and one off the Netherlands generating more energy. However, the Beatrice array is built in deeper water, with jacket foundations each weighing in at about 1,000 tonnes installed in sea depths of up to 183ft (56m). Earlier this month it was announced thatwind power output in Scotland hit a record high during the first six months of 2019. Figures from Weather Energy calculated the energy produced by turbines could power every home in Scotland and part of the north of England. WWF Scotland described the trend as a ""wind energy revolution"".

In Case You Missed ItSee All,"US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is reportedly prone to dozing off in meetings. He's not the only one. So is there a trick to stopping those eyelids from suddenly feeling so, so heavy? Meeting-induced sleepiness - it happens to the best of us. Former vice-presidents Joe Biden and Dick Cheney; former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich; Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas - all famous faces who have made headlines for being caught napping during speeches and meetings. Mr Ross is the latest politician to be criticised for being reportedly unable to ""stop falling asleep in meetings"" at his department,according to Politico.,externalBut his staff denied his focus was so erratic that long meetings were avoided. So how can you avoid the tempting pull of sleep during your next meeting - and how might you keep everyone awake the next time you have to lead one? Elise Keith, founder of Lucid Meetings, a US-based meeting coaching company, says that while time preferences may vary among individuals, research indicates that some periods may be better for achieving certain goals. ""Things like status updates and logical thinking - you want to do those earlier in the morning,"" she says. When impressing people is important - like status updates, sales demos, interviews - the morning, ""when sharpness and enthusiasm are at their height"", is best. ""Closer to the end of the day is a really good time for brainstorming... because the energy that you had in the morning has started to wear off,"" she says. ""People loosen up, which is also what you want when you're trying to elicit cool ideas."" And of course, never do meetings in the ""dead zone"" period - right after lunch. Why I hate meetings - and how to make them better UK-based author and workplace culture expert Judi James, however, says the exact time ""matters less than we think"" and ensuring a meeting has a clearly stated end time is more important. ""We often fall asleep in meetings out of boredom, not tiredness."" While some sessions must take place wherever the work can get done, meeting in unconventional locations can help boost creativity. Standing meetings - where, as the name suggests, participants talk without sitting down - have also been praised by many efficiency experts for keeping things efficient. Ms Keith suggests walking meetings or spaces outside for more creative sessions. ""The kind of meeting that leaves people to fall asleep is one where they probably shouldn't be there in the first place... or where other people are talking at them,"" Ms Keith says. ""Have clarity of what the meeting is about and a plan for reaching the outcomes of that meeting, which then allows you to only invite relevant people."" One recent study,externalfound American workers on average felt just 33% of leaders were well-prepared for meetings. And most managers, Ms Keith notes, may spend 80% of their time in meetings without ever having been trained how to lead one. Ensuring a clear agenda is a common piece of advice from productivity gurus. Annette Catino, a healthcare executive and entrepreneur,told the New York Times,externalan agenda was essential, ""because if I don't know why we're in the meeting, and you don't know why we're there, then there's no reason for a meeting"". ""One of the ways that people stay awake is that they're in a meeting that's interesting to them and relevant to their work."" And if you're not certain who should be there? Make the meetings optional and see who shows, Ms Keith suggests. *If you're still with us, now might be a good time for a stand-up-and-stretch break. Ms James recommends standing up from your desk every half-hour or to stretch and ""invigorate"" yourself throughout the day. And though some companies like Google, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and online retailer Zappos, have offered employees spaces to get some shut eye during the work day, Ms James cautions that ""power naps aren't always effective as they help you see the workplace as a sleep place"". How to nap successfully at work How long is the ideal nap? While Ms James suggests turning down hot drinks or carb-heavy snacks before a meeting if you are prone to drowsiness, Ms Keith says the right kind of snacks can help improve meeting culture. Snacks can keep people alert, for one thing, but are also a ""symbol of caring"" in many cultures. ""Why not bring that into your meetings? Why not show the people there that they are cared for, they belong, their wellbeing is something that matters to you?"" Of course, avoiding loud or smelly snacks is important, as is being mindful of participants' dietary restrictions. Putting it simply - you can't fall asleep if you're participating. ""Speak up during the first three minutes,"" Ms James recommends. ""It gets your voice into the room and allows you to feel like a contributor not a listener."" Ms James also suggests making active body language contributions - ""nod , use eye contact, and non-verbal responses to what you hear"". Taking notes can also be helpful in keeping your brain alert. ""If the meeting is dragging on, make yourself the note taker, search for key points, decisions that seem to be getting made but nobody is articulating clearly,"" Ms Keith says. ""Raise your hand, interject, make sure they get called out. You can help other people be heard and ask questions."" For leaders, Ms James says make sure to adhere to the agenda and only the agenda - tacking on ""other business"", she warns, is ""when the bores kick off"". When all else fails, keeping your hands busy can help. Ms Keith's fidgeting tool of choice is a pipe cleaner - simple, and quiet, if a little odd. Doodling is another longstanding go-to for bored meeting goers, but Ms James says it can make you even more drowsy. Sometimes, it may just take a pinch on your own arm instead, she adds. Both Ms James and Ms Keith agree, if you succumb to sleep, it may be best to leave. ""Make a swift excuse that doesn't sound attacking, and if possible, get up quietly, apologise and leave,"" Ms James recommends. And if you notice a colleague drifting off, only nudge them awake if you are friends. And after any such meeting, Ms Keith emphasises the importance of providing honest feedback. ""If you're in there and you're sleeping because the meeting is so poorly planned, so disengaging, and such a big waste of your time, then that's a massive bit of wasted investment for your company and the leading cause of employee disengagement,"" she says. ""That's the kind of thing that makes people quit.""

The homeless players aiming for football gloryDriving lessons: 'I wrote off my instructor's car'VideoVideo,"This video can not be played Street Football Wales is behind hosting this year's tournament Wayne Ellaway spent 20 years in a destructive cycle of prison sentences, substance misuse and sofa surfing. He said he lost many friends to drugs over the years and does not understand how he survived. During that time, he also used to wander around Cardiff's Bute Park in a ""desperate mess"". But from Saturday he will be back in the same park as head coach of Wales' men's/mixed and women's teams taking part in football's Homeless World Cup. The 17th edition of the tournament, which is being held in Cardiff, runs from 27 July to 3 August and features about 500 players from 48 countries. What is the Homeless World Cup? 'Football has changed my life' Homelessness problem 'worst in decades' A melting pot of cultures at Homeless World Cup Mr Ellaway, from Cardiff, had stopped taking drugs by the time he played for Wales at the 2015 tournament in Amsterdam. Now he hopes those in the team he is coaching can use the experience to help rebuild their own lives. ""I think they can see where I've come from,"" said Mr Ellaway, who now has a home and job as an outreach worker. Wayne Ellaway is hoping Bute Park will be the scene of glory for his Wales teams ""I used to walk around Bute Park lonely, desolate, desperate, nowhere to go, homeless, and now I'll be coaching Wales at the Homeless World Cup on the park I used to walk around in a desperate mess."" He added: ""I'm so grateful for another opportunity. In 2015 I thought it was over [after the tournament] but it's just continued to get better and better and better. ""To be socially excluded for so long, to be homeless, to be addicted to drugs, to be vulnerable and to be in all of these positions - and then you see them now, young confident men, young confident women who are now socially included and no longer socially excluded. ""That's what it's all about for me - the human part. The football is fantastic but it's the human beings behind the football."" Jennifer Gattrell will be one of those players in the women's team over the next week. ""On the day, when I'm lining up singing the national anthem, I think that's when it starts kicking in,"" the 34-year-old goalkeeper said. ""For years I hated playing in goals. It's only the last two years I've embraced it and if people say I'm good, then I'm good enough for this."" Jennifer Gattrell now has the keys to her own home Ms Gattrell was homeless for about a year and a quarter after her grandmother was taken into a nursing home. During that period, she also lost her job, friends and family but now has the keys to her own home. ""I just want to make my nan proud. I just wish she was here to see the day,"" she said. Osian Lloyd is getting the chance to play at the second attempt after missing out in Oslo two years ago because his passport did not arrive in time. ""It's a whole better tournament playing in your home country in front of your home crowd - I'm raring to go,"" he said. The 19-year-old from Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, has previously spent time on the streets and sofa surfing, but said football had helped turn his life around. ""It gives me a purpose,"" he said. ""Family situations have changed dramatically as well. I went to see them the other day for the first time in like a year and a half. Osian Lloyd says he has had a tattoo to mark playing in the tournament ""It's not just football, it changes your whole life."" He added: ""I've been offered a place in Swansea to live and to be more involved with football and different opportunities with jobs, my career and myself. ""It's given me that platform to believe I can do what I want."" Bonny Jewell, 27, from Cardiff, has also got plans once the tournament is over. ""I've always wanted to represent my country in sports and having my father there as well as my two children there. They are proud of what I've achieved. ""Next, I'm setting up a project for the homeless doing shared accommodations and hostels as well as a community centre, a charity shop and a cafe. ""I really want to help them change their lives because it's not nice. You don't know their background but all they ask for is a conversation. It makes their day. You can't do too much."" Bonny Jewell says football is a fun way of getting to know people and ""all about having a laugh"" Their involvement comes through Street Football Wales (SFW). SFW founder Keri Harris was working for The Big Issue Cymru when, in 2003, he was tasked with putting a team together for the first Homeless World Cup in Austria. It was life-changing for Keri as he realised Wales needed a programme which offered social inclusion through sport. SFW is behind Cardiff hosting this year's Homeless World Cup. ""To be able to go out and play in front of a home crowd, hear your national anthem in front of hundreds of people, that's going to be an emotional thing, and hopefully inspirational as well,"" he said. ""They can lift themselves and do the nation proud."" What is the Homeless World Cup?
