Huge crowds rally peacefully in Hong Kong,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows extent of Hong Kong protest Organisers say 1.7 million people turned out at Sunday's pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong, amid increasingly severe warnings by Beijing. Police put the figure much lower at 128,000, counting only those at an officially sanctioned rally. Activists and police have clashed over the past 11 weeks, but this weekend's protest remained peaceful. The protests were sparked by a controversial extradition bill, which has since been suspended. They have now morphed into a broader movement demanding democratic reform and an investigation into alleged police brutality. Hong Kong police: We donât need Beijingâs help How could China intervene? What is mainland China hearing? The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far The protest's organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front, were denied authorisation for a march through the city, but police allowed a pre-approved demonstration in the city's Victoria Park. One of the marchers, named as Mr Wong, told the BBC's Lam Cho Wai at the scene: ""We have been fighting for more than two months, but our government has no response at all. We could just come out again and again."" Large crowds also marched in the nearby areas of Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Wan Chai in defiance of the police ban. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence A spokesman for the Hong Kong government said that although the demonstrations were generally peaceful, they had seriously affected traffic and caused much inconvenience. Hong Kong protests spread across the globe He added that it was ""most important to restore social order as soon as possible"". Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hong Kong The push to drive Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement in a more peaceful direction this weekend seems to have worked. From toddlers to the elderly, protesters turned out to join a massive rally. Entire families were seen dressed in black getting soaked together when the heavens opened and driving rain struck the city. These demonstrations wanted to draw again on a wide pool of public support after shocking images of escalating violence here caused many to rethink the direction of the pro-democracy push. When it was announced inside an already full Victoria Park that underground train stations had been closed because too many people were flooding in trying to reach the rally, there was a huge cheer from the crowd. Today has reinvigorated people's faith in this cause and, at the moment, made it feel like a decent proportion of this city's population are preparing to keep fighting right up to 2047, when Hong Kong is due to lose its special status and become a Chinese city like all others. The violence has intensified in the past few weeks, and police have frequently fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Last weekend activists occupied the airport, leading to hundreds of flights being cancelled. There were further clashes with police on Tuesday. This video can not be played The BBC's Stephen McDonell observed the new quick-moving tactics of police against protesters on Saturday The turmoil has plunged one of Asia's leading financial centres into crisis. Many businesses remained closed on Sunday amid fears of further violence. The Chinese government hardened its rhetoric following the airport unrest,condemning it as ""behaviour that is close to terrorism"". It was the second time in a week that Chinese officials had publicly likened the protests to terrorist activity. Some observers believe that the repeated use of such language suggests that China is losing patience with the protesters and signals that an intervention by Beijing is increasingly likely. Thousands of armed police have been stationed across the border in Shenzhen. ""If Hong Kong's situation deteriorates to a point uncontrollable by the Hong Kong government, the central government will not sit by and watch,"" Chen Wen of the Chinese embassy in London told BBC Radio 4. ""We have enough powers and enough solutions to quell any unrest within the limit of basic law."" US President Donald Trump warned on Sunday that if China were to carry out a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown on the protesters, it would make a trade deal between Washington and Beijing ""a very hard thing to do"". It was sparked by a bill that would allow extradition from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. Critics argue that the proposal would undermine the territory's judicial independence and could be used to target those who speak out against the Chinese government. Sunday's protest began in Victoria park The former British colony has a special status, with its own legal system and judiciary, and rights and freedoms not seen in mainland China. The bill - announced by the government in February - was suspended following mass rallies in June. But the protesters want it withdrawn altogether. Their current demands are: Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill The withdrawal of the ""riot"" description used about the 12 June protests An amnesty for all arrested protesters An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality Universal suffrage in elections for Hong Kong's chief executive (the city's leader), and Legislative Council. Some also want the resignation of Carrie Lam, the current chief executive, whom they view as a puppet of Beijing.

Chancellor: I won't shift stamp duty to sellers,"Chancellor Sajid Javid has said he has no plans to make house sellers rather than buyers pay stamp duty tax. ""I wouldn't support that,"" the chancellor said in a tweet on Sunday. His comments came afterthe Times reported on Saturday,externalthat Mr Javid was considering the idea, to save first-time buyers from paying the tax. ""I know from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government that we need bold measures on housing - but this isn't one of them,"" Mr Javid said. Allow Twitter content?

Stamp duty - a purchase tax paid in England and Northern Ireland on properties worth more than Â£125,000 -was abolished in 2017 for first-time buyers spending up to Â£300,000on a house. Forcing home sellers rather than buyers to pay the stamp duty tax would have made house purchases cheaper for those buying their first home or people trying to upgrade to larger homes, but could have made owners of larger homes reluctant to downsize. The latest housing figures suggest that both house prices and sales are losing momentum amid Brexit uncertainty. Key aspects of the housing market were ""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) saidearlier this month. In the interview with the Times, Mr Javid refused to give details of his plans to reform the tax system, instead saying ""wait and see for the Budget"" which is due to take place in the autumn. According to the newspaper Mr Javid said: ""I'm a low-tax guy. I want to see simpler taxes."" The report added: ""he said that he was looking at various options when asked about stamp duty reforms including reversing liability from those buying property to those selling"". Mr Javid also said he had not yet decided whether to hold the Budget before 31 October, the date the UK is expected to leave the EU. It's a tax that people who buy property or land must pay. In England and Northern Ireland buyers pay Stamp Duty Land Tax, in Scotland it is Land and Buildings Transaction Tax while in Wales buyers pay Land Transaction Tax. In England and Northern Ireland the tax falls due on homes sold for Â£125,000 or more. However, first-time buyers pay no tax up to Â£300,000 and 5% on any portion between Â£300,000 and Â£500,000. For people who have bought a home before, the rates are 2% on Â£125,001-Â£250,000, 5% on Â£250,001-Â£925,000, 10% on Â£925,001-Â£1.5m, and 12% on any value above Â£1.5m. So if you are not a first-time buyer, and you buy a house for Â£275,000, the Stamp Duty you owe is calculated as follows: 0% on the first Â£125,000 = Â£0 2% on the next Â£125,000 = Â£2,500 5% on the final Â£25,000 = Â£1,250 Total Stamp Duty = Â£3,750 In Scotland, the rates on Land and Buildings Transaction Tax are 2% on Â£145,001-Â£250,000, 5% on Â£250,001-Â£325,000, 10% on Â£325,001-Â£750,000, and 12% on any value above Â£750,000. In Wales, the rates on Land Transaction Tax are 3.5% on Â£180,001-Â£250,000, 5% on Â£250,001-Â£400,000, 7.5% on Â£400,001-Â£750,000, 10% on Â£750,001-Â£1.5m, and 12% on any value above Â£1.5m. One organisation which had long been proposing the switch is the Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT). ""Switching liability would be considerably fairer, simpler, more effective and cheaper than the current stamp duty regime,"" said Phil Hall, head of public affairs and public policy at the AAT. The association claims such a move ""would remove every single first-time buyer across the country from stamp duty liability while crucially also helping those already on the property ladder to move up"". It reckons the move will protect the Â£9.3bn currently raised ""because although those paying will change, the amount will not"". But critics predict that sellers would simply add the stamp duty to the house price, meaning the buyer would effectively end up paying the tax anyway.

More than Â£100k raised for killed PC's family,"PC Andrew Harper was married four weeks ago More than Â£100,000 has been donated to a crowdfunding page set up to support the family of a police officer who was killed in Berkshire. PC Andrew Harper, 28, died onThursday in Sulhamstead when he was dragged along the road by a vehicle. A fundraising page set up by the Thames Valley Police Federation passed the Â£100,000 mark on Sunday. Ten males aged between 13 and 30 have been held on suspicion of murder and remain in custody. Thames Valley Police said on Saturday it had been granted an extra 36 hours to question the suspects. PC Harper was killed after responding to a burglary at the A4 Bath Road from Lambdens Hill and Ufton Lane. Since his death, people have been laying tributes in the grass near to where he died. A box at the scene has PC Harper's shoulder number and a photo of his wife Lissie, who he married last month. Reading and Cardiff City's players stood for a minute's silence in remembrance of PC Andrew Harper The fundraising page says: ""We confront danger on a daily basis. We know there is a risk when we put on the uniform but we do so as we are proud to protect the public. ""Sadly on very rare and horrendous occasions a colleague makes the ultimate sacrifice. We will ensure that heroism is never forgotten."" One tribute from his family read: ""We will never recover our darling Andrew. ""You will never feel the pain of growing old or a broken heart. ""I feel your presence warming me in my darkest hours and minutes and know there's enough to share with all those who love and need you right now. Floral tributes have been left at the scene near the A4 Bath Road ""Sleep tight sweetheart, see you one day."" Forensic officers have spent most of the weekend searching the grass and surrounding area. On Saturday Thames Valley Police's Det Supt Ailsa Kent told a press conference PC Harper's cause of deathhas been recorded as multiple injuries. ""[That] is consistent with our current belief that Andrew was caught between a vehicle and the road and then dragged for a distance,"" she said. Det Supt Kent said it remained unclear how PC Harper ""came to be out of his vehicle and then caught under the suspect vehicle"". She said the 10 boys and men had been arrested at council-run caravan and mobile home site, Four Houses Corner, about three miles from where PC Harper died. This video can not be played ""We are shocked and saddened by the death of our colleague"" Relatives of PC Harper have also paid tribute on social media to the ""loveliest person that you will ever meet"".

"Wildfires displace 4,000 on Gran Canaria","This video can not be played Wildfires rip through Gran Canaria About 9,000 people have been evacuated as wildfires rip through Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. The fires, which started on Saturday, are advancing on two fronts in a mountainous area of the island. In a press conference on Monday, authorities called the incident ""an unprecedented environmental tragedy"". Efforts to tackle the fires are being hampered by high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity, officials said. About 14 planes and helicopters, as well as about 700 firefighters on the ground including 200 from the military, have been deployed. The blaze has so far spared residential areas and tourist hotspots, but has spread into the island's Tamadaba natural park, home to some of the island's oldest pine forests. ""The fire is not contained nor stabilised or controlled,"" Canary Islands regional president Angel Victor Torres told a news conference on Sunday. Planes and helicopters have been deployed to tackle the blazes The fires are threatening old areas of pine forest In some areas, the flames were so high that water-dropping planes were unable to operate. The fires started near the town of Tejeda. Overnight, the affected area increased from 3400 to 6000 hectares and flames as high as 50 metres (164 ft) were reported. Requests for assistance had been made to the Spanish central government, Mr Torres added.

Lidl lines up suppliers to cover no-deal costs,"Tariffs on food such as beef and milk can be high Lidl's Irish business has reminded British suppliers they are expected to pay any EU import tariffs imposed on goods crossing borders after Brexit. Currently, as both countries are member states, no tariffs are paid. But Lidl's current contracts with suppliers contain a clause saying goods must be delivered with tariffs paid. The supermarket said it had held workshops with British suppliers to make sure they had the necessary information to ""avoid any disruption"". ""We have been working closely for over two years with external consultants, not only to get our business Brexit ready, but also to ensure our valued suppliers are as prepared as possible. ""All existing Lidl contracts contain a DDP ('delivered duty paid') clause. In an effort to understand the level of preparedness of key UK suppliers we are communicating proactively with them and working together to resolve any potential barriers to supply,"" the supermarket said in a statement. Gove: No-deal dossier is 'worst-case scenario' What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana? The delivered duty paid clause means that the cost of transporting goods, including tariffs on EU exports, are the responsibility of the supplier. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, tariffs on EU exports would come into force automatically, according to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. EU tariffs on food can be both high and complex. On some types of beef it is 12.8% plus 265 euros per 100kg for meat from outside the EU. The average for dairy products is more than 35%. Supplierstold the Times,externalnewspaper that other supermarkets are also likely to enforce deals similar to Lidl's agreement. A supermarket source told the newspaper that the potential costs were too high for all suppliers to be able to cover them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal on 31 October. While he has committed to cutting most tariffs on foreign goods being imported into the UK, tariffs for goods exported from the UK to the EU are outside of his control. Dr Peter Holmes, fellow of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, told the BBC: ""The UK suppliers will pay tariffs going into the EU, and EU suppliers will pay tariffs going into the UK [if there are any]. ""You can avoid this if you sign a free trade agreement, and the UK can unilaterally remove all trade tariffs but it has to do so for all trading partners and this would not remove the tariffs on UK exports to the EU."" He said that suddenly implementing WTO rules would be a ""serious shock"" to the economy. ""The point to make is that, tariffs are in general passed on from the supplier to the consumer, so it doesn't really make any difference who actually directly pays them. If Lidl lines up suppliers to cover no-deal costs, as soon as they can suppliers will pass those costs on, or withdraw from the market.""

"Sinn FÃ©in call PM 'reckless' after Brexit leakDUP leader Arlene Foster says she believes the dossier is ""outdated"" and leaked to undermine the PM.Northern Ireland","Boris Johnson has pledged to lead the UK out of the EU by 31 October with or without a deal Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit is ""reckless"", Sinn FÃ©in has said, after a leaked dossier warned of a hard border and food shortages if there is no deal. The party's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill accused the prime minister of treating the Northern Ireland peace process as ""a commodity"" in EU talks. Ms O'Neill was responding to the leak which was reported in theSunday Times,external. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said she believes the leaked dossier is ""outdated"". Gove: No-deal dossier is 'worst-case scenario' Brexit: A really simple guide Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop ""It comes from a time before Boris Johnson was prime minister, that's the first thing to say,"" Mrs Foster told BBC News NI. ""Secondly, it's been leaked with the idea really to undermine the prime minister before he goes out to Europe and meets European leaders this week."" Arlene Foster's party is in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Conservative government The dossier obtained by the Sunday newspaper is a cross-government study on preparations for a no-deal Brexit, codenamed Operation Yellowhammer. The dossier warns that the UK will face possible food, fuel and medicine shortages if it leaves the EU without a deal. It also suggests that plans to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland are unlikely to prove sustainable, and there could be months of disruption at UK ports. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, who is responsible for no-deal Brexit planning, tweeted on Sunday that Operation Yellowhammer is a ""worst case scenario"". He added that the government has taken ""significant additional steps"" over the past three weeks to ensure UK is prepared to leave on 31 October. Allow Twitter content?

""The consequences of a no-deal Brexit will result in a hard border which threatens our hard won peace and undermines the political and economic progress of the past 21 years, enjoyed across the whole island,"" she said.

Convicted businessman regrets Lib Dem donationMichael Brown says his 2005 gift of Â£2.4m - a party record - led to recognition and pain for his family.UK,"Michael Campbell-Brown now works for the outsourcing company Serco A convicted businessman who donated Â£2.4m to the Liberal Democrats has said it was the ""stupidest"" thing he has ever done in his life. Michael Brown made the payment - a record sum for the party - in 2005. But a year later, he was jailed for perjury and then fled the UK for the Caribbean while facing other criminal charges. He told BBC News he now regrets the donation because it led to an ""onslaught of recognition"". ""I feel bad because giving the money brought me to the forefront... and caused an enormous amount of pain on my family,"" he said.

Michael Brown prison sentence extended Lib Dem donor Michael Brown to start jail term Fraudster Michael Brown held in Dominican Republic jail In a wide-ranging interview - his first for 12 years - Michael Brown, now known as Michael Campbell-Brown, revealed he is using his experience of being a prisoner to help other inmates adapt. The 53-year-old is employed by outsourcing giant Serco, which runs six prisons in England and Scotland, to improve procedures in the first days after offenders are locked up, when they are most vulnerable and at risk of suicide. He trains prisoners to be ""mentors"" so they can advise and guide new arrivals.

Following his release, he faced the prospect of being sent back to jail after he was charged with further offences, relating to the theft of an investment of almost Â£8m from Martin Edwards, the former Manchester United chairman. ""I'd brought shame on my family, I'd brought stress on my family and I thought, there's two ways I can deal with this - one is to take the final step, the other one is to circle the wagons and get out of Dodge,"" he said. In 2008, while on bail awaiting trial, he took a cab to Gatwick airport and, using a false passport, he flew to the Dominican Republic under the name ""Darren Nally"". The Dominican Republic does not have an extradition treaty with Britain. He remained in the country for four years, during which time he was found guilty in his absence of theft, providing false information and perverting the course of justice. The court heard he had secretly spent cash from investors on the Lib Dem donation and to fund an ""extravagant"" lifestyle. His actions amounted to a ""breach of trust"", the trial judge declared. After Campbell-Brown was tracked down, he returned to the UK, where he served half of a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence. He now admits that he was motivated by a misguided desire to impress people, thinking they would respect him if he was a ""larger-than-life character"" - and by a craving to be rich. ""My greed got the better of me,"" he said, adding that he's ""horrendously sorry"" for what he did to Mr Edwards. After he was let out in 2016, Campbell-Brown began blogging and giving talks about penal issues, and worked at the publicly-run Leicester Prison and in jails run by G4S. The work stopped for a while last year, after it was reported that the Spanish authorities were investigating him over allegations of money laundering. He has denied that he's facing any ""active"" inquiries, and there has been no confirmation that any such investigations are taking place. Campbell-Brown has since been given clearance to work for Serco and was recently asked to address a conference attended by prison officers, which was organised by the well-respected Butler Trust. He now deeply regrets the controversial donation that thrust him into the spotlight. He was an admirer of the Liberal Democrats' then-leader, Charles Kennedy, and wanted to ""level"" the political playing field with the Conservatives and Labour in the 2005 general election campaign. But he said the Â£2.4 million payment, made via his firm, Fifth Avenue Partners Ltd, should have been rejected by the party. ""They should have said to me: 'But Michael, you don't live in the United Kingdom, you're not registered on the voters' roll, your company was only born six months ago; really sorry Michael, thanks for coming, but no thanks,'"" he said. ""That's what they should have done, but of course, you know, the pound signs tend to obscure absolutely everything else."" Although the Lib Dems faced calls to return the donation, they kept it after the Electoral Commission concluded they hadn't broken any rules and had accepted the payment in good faith. But Campbell-Brown no longer supports the party because of the way he believes Mr Kennedy was forced out as leader in 2006, amid concerns that his drink problem was affecting his job. He died in 2015, at the age of 55. ""They drove him out... because he was an alcoholic,"" he said. ""That person then dies an early death. I'm sorry, you're responsible for that,"" he added. The Lib Dems are disgusted by that accusation - a source said they would not ""dignify"" it with a response. As Campbell-Brown, a self-confessed ""Walter Mitty"" character, tries to rebuild his reputation, as someone committed to improving the lot of prisoners, he may find it harder than he thinks to shake off his old political connections and criminal past.

Convicted businessman regrets Lib Dem donation,"Michael Campbell-Brown now works for the outsourcing company Serco A convicted businessman who donated Â£2.4m to the Liberal Democrats has said it was the ""stupidest"" thing he has ever done in his life. Michael Brown made the payment - a record sum for the party - in 2005. But a year later, he was jailed for perjury and then fled the UK for the Caribbean while facing other criminal charges. He told BBC News he now regrets the donation because it led to an ""onslaught of recognition"". ""I feel bad because giving the money brought me to the forefront... and caused an enormous amount of pain on my family,"" he said. ""I broke the law and deserve the pain that I got - my family never deserved that."" Michael Brown prison sentence extended Lib Dem donor Michael Brown to start jail term Fraudster Michael Brown held in Dominican Republic jail In a wide-ranging interview - his first for 12 years - Michael Brown, now known as Michael Campbell-Brown, revealed he is using his experience of being a prisoner to help other inmates adapt. The 53-year-old is employed by outsourcing giant Serco, which runs six prisons in England and Scotland, to improve procedures in the first days after offenders are locked up, when they are most vulnerable and at risk of suicide. He trains prisoners to be ""mentors"" so they can advise and guide new arrivals. ""When a prisoner comes off that bus, he's nervous beyond belief and he does not know what is going to happen in the next four or five hours of his life - or the next four or five days,"" he said.

More than Â£70k raised for killed PC's family,"PC Andrew Harper was married four weeks ago More than Â£100,000 has been donated to a crowdfunding page set up to support the family of a police officer who was killed in Berkshire. PC Andrew Harper, 28, died onThursday in Sulhamstead when he was dragged along the road by a vehicle. A fundraising page set up by the Thames Valley Police Federation passed the Â£100,000 mark on Sunday. Ten males aged between 13 and 30 have been held on suspicion of murder and remain in custody. Thames Valley Police said on Saturday it had been granted an extra 36 hours to question the suspects. PC Harper was killed after responding to a burglary at the A4 Bath Road from Lambdens Hill and Ufton Lane. Since his death, people have been laying tributes in the grass near to where he died. A box at the scene has PC Harper's shoulder number and a photo of his wife Lissie, who he married last month. Reading and Cardiff City's players stood for a minute's silence in remembrance of PC Andrew Harper The fundraising page says: ""We confront danger on a daily basis. We know there is a risk when we put on the uniform but we do so as we are proud to protect the public. ""Sadly on very rare and horrendous occasions a colleague makes the ultimate sacrifice. We will ensure that heroism is never forgotten."" One tribute from his family read: ""We will never recover our darling Andrew. ""You will never feel the pain of growing old or a broken heart. ""I feel your presence warming me in my darkest hours and minutes and know there's enough to share with all those who love and need you right now. Floral tributes have been left at the scene near the A4 Bath Road ""Sleep tight sweetheart, see you one day."" Forensic officers have spent most of the weekend searching the grass and surrounding area. On Saturday Thames Valley Police's Det Supt Ailsa Kent told a press conference PC Harper's cause of deathhas been recorded as multiple injuries. ""[That] is consistent with our current belief that Andrew was caught between a vehicle and the road and then dragged for a distance,"" she said. Det Supt Kent said it remained unclear how PC Harper ""came to be out of his vehicle and then caught under the suspect vehicle"". She said the 10 boys and men had been arrested at council-run caravan and mobile home site, Four Houses Corner, about three miles from where PC Harper died. This video can not be played ""We are shocked and saddened by the death of our colleague"" Relatives of PC Harper have also paid tribute on social media to the ""loveliest person that you will ever meet"".

PM treating peace process as commodity - O'NeillMichelle O'Neill was responding to the publication of leaked government documents featuring no-deal Brexit plans.Northern Ireland,"Boris Johnson has pledged to lead the UK out of the EU by 31 October with or without a deal Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit is ""reckless"", Sinn FÃ©in has said, after a leaked dossier warned of a hard border and food shortages if there is no deal. The party's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill accused the prime minister of treating the Northern Ireland peace process as ""a commodity"" in EU talks. Ms O'Neill was responding to the leak which was reported in theSunday Times,external. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said she believes the leaked dossier is ""outdated"". Gove: No-deal dossier is 'worst-case scenario' Brexit: A really simple guide Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop ""It comes from a time before Boris Johnson was prime minister, that's the first thing to say,"" Mrs Foster told BBC News NI. ""Secondly, it's been leaked with the idea really to undermine the prime minister before he goes out to Europe and meets European leaders this week."" Arlene Foster's party is in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Conservative government The dossier obtained by the Sunday newspaper is a cross-government study on preparations for a no-deal Brexit, codenamed Operation Yellowhammer. The dossier warns that the UK will face possible food, fuel and medicine shortages if it leaves the EU without a deal. It also suggests that plans to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland are unlikely to prove sustainable, and there could be months of disruption at UK ports. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, who is responsible for no-deal Brexit planning, tweeted on Sunday that Operation Yellowhammer is a ""worst case scenario"". He added that the government has taken ""significant additional steps"" over the past three weeks to ensure UK is prepared to leave on 31 October. Allow Twitter content?

Theprime minister has said the UK will leave the EU on that date ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. Later this week Mr Johnson is due to meet with EU leadersand is expected to reiterate that the UK will leave with or without a deal. In a statement, Ms O'Neill said the contents of the leaked documents were ""of no surprise"". She added that any prospect of a hard border following a no-deal Brexit would have ""devastating effects for the island of Ireland"". ""The consequences of a no-deal Brexit will result in a hard border which threatens our hard won peace and undermines the political and economic progress of the past 21 years, enjoyed across the whole island,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said the government was ""dealing with the north of Ireland and the peace process as though it's a commodity and it is a reckless, dangerous approach to take and one which must be opposed"". Michelle O'Neill made the comments in response to leaked government documents TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said, in a tweet, that Ireland had ""always been clear"" a hard border in Ireland ""must be avoided"". He added that the backstop - agreed in Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the hope of maintaining a seamless border on the island of Ireland  - was an ""insurance policy"" designed to protect the peace process.

Meanwhile, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the leaked documents showed Boris Johnson ""doesn't care"" about the ""complexities and fragilities of relationships in Ireland"". ""This British government, far from sending a clear message to Brussels, is sending a clear message to people and business in Northern Ireland. They are willing to sacrifice our economic, political and social wellbeing to please rabid nativists in their own ranks,"" he said. Mr Eastwood added that he believed the government had no mandate for a no-deal Brexit and should reverse its position, or call a general election.

PM to tell EU leaders UK needs new Brexit deal,"Boris Johnson will tell EU leaders there needs to be a new Brexit deal when he makes his first trip abroad as PM later this week. The UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal, he will insist. Meanwhile, theSunday Times has printed leaked government documents,externalwarning of food, medicine  and fuel shortages in a no-deal scenario. A No 10 source told the BBC a former minister leaked the dossier to try to influence discussions with EU leaders. Brexit: A really simple guide 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Brexit: What happens next? The documents say the cross-government paper on preparations for a no-deal Brexit, codenamed Operation Yellowhammer, reveals the UK could face months of disruption at its ports. It also states plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are unlikely to prove sustainable. The dossier, reported by the Sunday Times, says leaving the EU without a deal could lead to: Fresh food becoming less available and prices rising A hard Irish border after plans to avoid checks fail, sparking protests Fuel becoming less available and 2,000 jobs being lost if the government sets petrol import tariffs to 0%, potentially causing two oil refineries to close UK patients having to wait longer for medicines, including insulin and flu vaccines A rise in public disorder and community tensions resulting from a shortage of food and drugs Passengers being delayed at EU airports, Eurotunnel and Dover Freight disruption at ports lasting up to three months, caused by customs checks, before traffic flow improves to 50-70% of the current rate The Downing Street source told the BBC the leaked document ""is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available"". Michael Gove, who is responsible for overseeing the devolution consequences of Brexit, said in a tweet that Operation Yellowhammer was ""a worst case scenario"". ""V significant steps have been taken in the last 3 weeks to accelerate Brexit planning,"" he added. Energy Minister Kwasi Kwarteng told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday:  ""I think there's a lot of scaremongering around and a lot of people are playing into project fear."" But a former head of the British civil service, Lord Bob Kerslake, who described the document as ""credible"", said the dossier ""lays bare the scale of the risks we are facing with no-deal Brexit in almost every area"". ""These risks are completely insane for this country to be taking and we have to explore every avenue to avoid them,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House. Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said, in a tweet, that Ireland had ""always been clear"" a hard border in Ireland ""must be avoided"". The Irish backstop - the provision in Theresa May's withdrawal agreement that could see Northern Ireland continue to follow some of the same trade rules as the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU, thus preventing a hard border - was an ""insurance policy"" designed to protect the peace process, he said. What is the Irish border backstop? Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said the leaked documents showed the effects of a no-deal Brexit should be taken more seriously. ""The government have simply, I think, pretended that this wasn't an issue,"" he said The government was in ""a real pickle"", since the ""the US has said that if that border is jeopardised, we're not going to get a trade deal with them"", he said. Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said, on Wednesday,a US-UK trade deal would not get through Congressif Brexit undermined the Good Friday Agreement. The leak comes as the prime minister prepares to travel to Berlin to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, before going to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday. Mr Johnson is expected to say Parliament cannot and will not change the outcome of the 2016 referendum and insist there must be a new deal to replace Mrs May's withdrawal agreement - defeated three times by MPs - if the UK is to leave the EU with a deal. However, it is thought their discussions will chiefly focus on issues such as foreign policy, security, trade and the environment, ahead of the G7 summit next weekend. Boris Johnson had been reluctant to fly to meet European leaders until it seemed a breakthrough was likely. But - it still doesn't. When Mr Johnson meets the EU's most powerful leaders - Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron - he will repeat his message that the UK is leaving, no matter what, at the end of October. He will tell them face-to-face for the first time that the only way the UK will sign up to a deal is if the EU thinks again, and replaces the agreement brokered by Mrs May. But there seems to be little chance of any serious progress in the coming days. No 10 does not seem particularly optimistic and says it expects both sides will say their piece, then move on to other issues. Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller said the Government had ""unequivocally"" accepted it could not shut down Parliament to clear the way for a no-deal Brexit. Could the government shut down Parliament? She told Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ""What they have said is, unequivocally, they accept that to close down Parliament, to bypass them in terms of Brexit - stopping a no-deal Brexit, in particular - is illegal."" But Ms Miller said she would continue to seek further reassurances that MPs would be able to pass legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of more than 100 MPs has urged the prime minister to recall Parliament and let it sit permanently until the UK leaves the EU. In a letter, MPs say the country is ""on the brink of an economic crisis"". It continues: ""Parliament must be recalled now in August and sit permanently until 31 October, so that the voices of the people can be heard, and that there can be proper scrutiny of your government."" Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has reiterated his call for MPs to work together to stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to the Observer,external, Mr Corbyn said his plan to be installed as an interim prime minister was the ""simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal"". The Labour leader has said, as a caretaker PM, he would delay Brexit, call a snap election, and campaign for another referendum. But Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn was ""divisive"" and instead suggested Conservative MP Ken Clarke or former Labour leader Harriet Harman could head a temporary government. Senior Tory MP rules out backing Corbyn Corbyn outlines plans to defeat no-deal Brexit Would a Labour government cancel Brexit? Elsewhere, in a letter seen by the Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson warned rebel Tory MPs their opposition to a no-deal Brexit was damaging the prospect of getting a new deal. He said it was ""plain as a pikestaff"" that the EU will ""not compromise as long as they believe there is the faintest possibility that Parliament can block Brexit on 31 October"".

Gove: No-deal dossier is 'worst-case scenario',"This video can not be played Michael Gove was questioned about what had actually changed since the document was produced A leaked cross-government study warning of the impact of a no-deal Brexit outlines a ""worst-case scenario"", cabinet minister Michael Gove has said. Details from the dossier warn of food and medicine shortages if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Mr Gove, who is responsible for no-deal preparation, said the document was old and Brexit planning had accelerated since Boris Johnson became PM. But he acknowledged no deal would bring disruption, or ""bumps in the road"". The leak comesas Mr Johnson is to meet European leaders later this week. The prime minister will insist there must be a new Brexit deal when he holds talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Brexit: A really simple guide 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Brexit: What happens next? According to Operation Yellowhammer,the dossier leaked to the Sunday Times,external, the UK could face months of disruption at its ports after a no-deal Brexit. And plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic are unlikely to prove sustainable, it adds. The dossier says leaving the EU without a deal could lead to: Fresh food becoming less available and prices rising A hard Irish border after plans to avoid checks fail, sparking protests Fuel becoming less available and 2,000 jobs being lost if the government sets petrol import tariffs to 0%, potentially causing two oil refineries to close UK patients having to wait longer for medicines, including insulin and flu vaccines A rise in public disorder and community tensions resulting from a shortage of food and drugs Passengers being delayed at EU airports, Eurotunnel and Dover Freight disruption at ports lasting up to three months, caused by customs checks, before traffic flow improves to 50-70% of the current rate The dossier warns of disruption at ports, along with food, fuel and medicine shortages A No 10 source told the BBC the dossier had been leaked by a former minister in an attempt to influence discussions with EU leaders. They added that the document ""is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available"". Responding to the leak, Mr Gove said some of the concerns about a no-deal Brexit had been ""exaggerated"". He said: ""It's certainly the case that there will be bumps in the road, some element of disruption in the event of no-deal. ""But the document that has appeared in the Sunday Times was an attempt, in the past, to work out what the very, very worst situation would be so that we could take steps to mitigate that. ""And we have taken steps."" Mr Gove also claimed some MPs were ""frustrating"" the government's chances of securing a new deal with the EU. He said: ""Sadly, there are some in the House of Commons who think they can try to prevent us leaving on October 31st. And as long as they continue to try to make that argument, then that actually gives some heart to some in the European Union that we won't leave on October 31st. ""The sooner that everyone recognises that we will leave on that day, the quicker we can move towards a good deal in everyone's interests."" Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday:  ""I think there's a lot of scaremongering around and a lot of people are playing into project fear."" But a former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake - who described the document as ""credible"" - said the dossier ""lays bare the scale of the risks we are facing with a no-deal Brexit in almost every area"". ""These risks are completely insane for this country to be taking and we have to explore every avenue to avoid them,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House.

Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's deputy leader, accused Mr Johnson oftreating the Northern Ireland peace process as a ""commodity""in Brexit negotiations. She said Ireland as a whole had been voicing concerns about a no-deal Brexit for months. The SNP's Stephen Gethins said the documents lay bare the ""sheer havoc Scotland and the UK are hurtling towards"". What is the Irish border backstop? Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said they showed the effects of a no-deal Brexit should be taken more seriously. ""The government has simply, I think, pretended that this wasn't an issue,"" he said Ministers were in ""a real pickle"" since ""the US has said that if that border is jeopardised, we're not going to get a trade deal with them"", he added.

Huge crowds march peacefully in Hong Kong,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows extent of Hong Kong protest Organisers say 1.7 million people turned out at Sunday's pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong, amid increasingly severe warnings by Beijing. Police put the figure much lower at 128,000, counting only those at an officially sanctioned rally. Activists and police have clashed over the past 11 weeks, but this weekend's protest remained peaceful. The protests were sparked by a controversial extradition bill, which has since been suspended. They have now morphed into a broader movement demanding democratic reform and an investigation into alleged police brutality. Hong Kong police: We donât need Beijingâs help How could China intervene? What is mainland China hearing? The twists and turns in Hong Kong so far The protest's organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front, were denied authorisation for a march through the city, but police allowed a pre-approved demonstration in the city's Victoria Park. One of the marchers, named as Mr Wong, told the BBC's Lam Cho Wai at the scene: ""We have been fighting for more than two months, but our government has no response at all. We could just come out again and again."" Large crowds also marched in the nearby areas of Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Wan Chai in defiance of the police ban. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence A spokesman for the Hong Kong government said that although the demonstrations were generally peaceful, they had seriously affected traffic and caused much inconvenience. Hong Kong protests spread across the globe He added that it was ""most important to restore social order as soon as possible"". Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hong Kong The push to drive Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement in a more peaceful direction this weekend seems to have worked. From toddlers to the elderly, protesters turned out to join a massive rally. Entire families were seen dressed in black getting soaked together when the heavens opened and driving rain struck the city. These demonstrations wanted to draw again on a wide pool of public support after shocking images of escalating violence here caused many to rethink the direction of the pro-democracy push. When it was announced inside an already full Victoria Park that underground train stations had been closed because too many people were flooding in trying to reach the rally, there was a huge cheer from the crowd. Today has reinvigorated people's faith in this cause and, at the moment, made it feel like a decent proportion of this city's population are preparing to keep fighting right up to 2047, when Hong Kong is due to lose its special status and become a Chinese city like all others. The violence has intensified in the past few weeks, and police have frequently fired tear gas and rubber bullets. Last weekend activists occupied the airport, leading to hundreds of flights being cancelled. There were further clashes with police on Tuesday. This video can not be played The BBC's Stephen McDonell observed the new quick-moving tactics of police against protesters on Saturday The turmoil has plunged one of Asia's leading financial centres into crisis. Many businesses remained closed on Sunday amid fears of further violence. The Chinese government hardened its rhetoric following the airport unrest,condemning it as ""behaviour that is close to terrorism"". It was the second time in a week that Chinese officials had publicly likened the protests to terrorist activity. Some observers believe that the repeated use of such language suggests that China is losing patience with the protesters and signals that an intervention by Beijing is increasingly likely. Thousands of armed police have been stationed across the border in Shenzhen. ""If Hong Kong's situation deteriorates to a point uncontrollable by the Hong Kong government, the central government will not sit by and watch,"" Chen Wen of the Chinese embassy in London told BBC Radio 4. ""We have enough powers and enough solutions to quell any unrest within the limit of basic law."" US President Donald Trump warned on Sunday that if China were to carry out a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown on the protesters, it would make a trade deal between Washington and Beijing ""a very hard thing to do"". It was sparked by a bill that would allow extradition from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. Critics argue that the proposal would undermine the territory's judicial independence and could be used to target those who speak out against the Chinese government. Sunday's protest began in Victoria park The former British colony has a special status, with its own legal system and judiciary, and rights and freedoms not seen in mainland China. The bill - announced by the government in February - was suspended following mass rallies in June. But the protesters want it withdrawn altogether. Their current demands are: Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill The withdrawal of the ""riot"" description used about the 12 June protests An amnesty for all arrested protesters An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality Universal suffrage in elections for Hong Kong's chief executive (the city's leader), and Legislative Council. Some also want the resignation of Carrie Lam, the current chief executive, whom they view as a puppet of Beijing.

"Lime and soda? No thanks, say non-drinkers","Ben Branson, founder of Seedlip: 'What do you drink when you're not drinking?' The days of lime and soda are over. ""Sugary, carbonated or fruit-based juice drinks just won't do"" for those seeking a booze-free alternative. At least, that is the view of Seedlip, which claims to be making the world's first distilled non-alcoholic spirits. ""We exist to solve this dilemma. What do you drink when you're not drinking?"" says Ben Branson, founder of the Chilterns-based business. It is a conundrum that traditional drinks firms are also trying to crack. Diageo, the world's largest spirits maker, has just bought most of Seedlip. And industry experts say it is not alone in trying to find ways to tap into the non-alcohol sector. Rival Pernod Ricard, for instance, has done a deal to distribute non-alcoholic spirit Ceder and last month launched Celtic Soul, a non-alcohol blend of dark spirits. Two years ago, Campari launched Crodino in the UK, its non-alcoholic aperitif named after a small town in north-west Italy. The firm says Crodino is the most-consumed drink of its kind in Italy since first being produced 55 years ago. Young drinkers lead the trend for alcohol-free beer Under-25s turning their backs on alcohol, study suggests Can pubs stand many more Dry Januarys? Could non-alcoholic gin ever be as good as the real thing? Nico von Stackelberg, analyst at Liberum, says: ""There's a significant rise in alcohol-free drinking across the western world, including the US. In terms of economics, it absolutely makes sense to be involved. ""Younger people do not want to be seen as drunk on social media. Heavy episodic drinking is not deemed to be cool. Importantly, the industry does not want excessive consumption and spends millions to avoid such behaviour,"" he adds. Research shows that the young are drinking less. Areport in the medical journal BMC Public Health and carried out by University College London,externalshowed that the proportion of 16 to 24-year-olds who do not drink alcohol has increased from 18% in 2005 to 29% in 2015. It points out that it is difficult to pinpoint a single factor that has caused the decline in alcohol consumption. But it is not a just a UK phenomenon. The research showed a fall in drinking in North America and elsewhere in Europe, although in Canada, rates of binge-drinking increased from 1996 to 2013.  In the UK, while rates are falling, young people remain the most likely group to be binge-drinking Dr Linda Ng Fat, lead author of the study, told the BBC that the findings suggested cultural change was leading to a reduction in drinking, and that health reasons could also be a factor. More and more alcohol-free beers are coming on to the market Alex Smith, consumer industry analyst at Shore Capital, says the push into the non-alcohol sector is consumer-led. ""Younger people are consuming less alcohol, so alcohol companies have to hedge their bets"". The beer market has been offering non-alcoholic versions for some time. In the 1980s, Kaliber from Guinness was one of the best-known, but more and more are being launched, such as Heineken 0.0% and Budweiser Prohibition Brew. The number of products on offer is growing. According to Nielsen research there were 40 non-alcoholic brands on the market two years ago. That has risen to 65 brands this year. Seedlip's founder, Mr Branson, has said his own inspiration to create a non-alcoholic sprit came after he was given a ""sickly sweet pink mocktail"". After experimentation on his family's farm, he launched his venture in 2015. He began using a small copper still and herbs from his garden to create a distilled non-alcoholic spirit - not a gin, as that would require juniper. There are three blends: one based on peas, another on bark and citrus, and another on orange, lemongrass and ginger.  25%The year-on-year increase in sales Â£117mThe total value of sales in the last year 23%The year-on-year increase in output 41mThe volume in litres of the last year's output Diageo has put Seedlip in its so-called Reserve portfolio - its luxury division - and the recommended retail price for 70cl is Â£27.99. That's about Â£7 more than the same amount of Bombay Sapphire gin. One pub chain offers Seedlip Grove - one of its three variants  - for Â£4.95, which is Â£1 more than other non-alcohol cocktails on its menu, while a glass of coke is Â£3.05. An alcoholic cocktail - a mojito - is Â£8.50. Gemma Cooper, Nielsen client business partner, says shoppers are prepared to ""pay more for great-tasting alcohol-free alternatives"". There is no duty or tax on such products, so profits should be higher too. Seedlip is the first non-alcoholic investment by Distill, an investment vehicle supported by Diageo which backs start-ups and has put more than Â£60m into 15 different new products. Diageo has also created its own non-alcohol products in-house, such as a Gordon's low-alcohol gin and tonic, launched in 2018, and Malta Guinness, a non-alcoholic unfermented beer popular in Nigeria. It does not provide a breakdown of sales and profits from non-alcohol products, nor has it disclosed how much it paid for its majority stake in Seedlip, which lost Â£4m in the year to May 2018, according to accounts at Companies House. But Diageo's John Kennedy has described it as a ""game-changing brand in the one of the most exciting categories in our industry"".

Convicted businessman regrets Â£2.4m Lib Dem donation,"Michael Campbell-Brown now works for the outsourcing company Serco A convicted businessman who donated Â£2.4m to the Liberal Democrats has said it was the ""stupidest"" thing he has ever done in his life. Michael Brown made the payment - a record sum for the party - in 2005. But a year later, he was jailed for perjury and then fled the UK for the Caribbean while facing other criminal charges. He told BBC News he now regrets the donation because it led to an ""onslaught of recognition"". ""I feel bad because giving the money brought me to the forefront... and caused an enormous amount of pain on my family,"" he said. ""I broke the law and deserve the pain that I got - my family never deserved that."" Michael Brown prison sentence extended Lib Dem donor Michael Brown to start jail term Fraudster Michael Brown held in Dominican Republic jail In a wide-ranging interview - his first for 12 years - Michael Brown, now known as Michael Campbell-Brown, revealed he is using his experience of being a prisoner to help other inmates adapt. The 53-year-old is employed by outsourcing giant Serco, which runs six prisons in England and Scotland, to improve procedures in the first days after offenders are locked up, when they are most vulnerable and at risk of suicide. He trains prisoners to be ""mentors"" so they can advise and guide new arrivals. ""When a prisoner comes off that bus, he's nervous beyond belief and he does not know what is going to happen in the next four or five hours of his life - or the next four or five days,"" he said. This video can not be played Convicted conman Michael Brown is being held in a cell in the Dominican Republic while the country works out the next step in his complex case During his first spell behind bars, which lasted 12 months, the Glasgow-born financier said he witnessed prisoners harming themselves and was ""absolutely petrified"". Following his release, he faced the prospect of being sent back to jail after he was charged with further offences, relating to the theft of an investment of almost Â£8m from Martin Edwards, the former Manchester United chairman. ""I'd brought shame on my family, I'd brought stress on my family and I thought, there's two ways I can deal with this - one is to take the final step, the other one is to circle the wagons and get out of Dodge,"" he said. In 2008, while on bail awaiting trial, he took a cab to Gatwick airport and, using a false passport, he flew to the Dominican Republic under the name ""Darren Nally"". The Dominican Republic does not have an extradition treaty with Britain. He remained in the country for four years, during which time he was found guilty in his absence of theft, providing false information and perverting the course of justice. The court heard he had secretly spent cash from investors on the Lib Dem donation and to fund an ""extravagant"" lifestyle. His actions amounted to a ""breach of trust"", the trial judge declared. After Campbell-Brown was tracked down, he returned to the UK, where he served half of a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence. He now admits that he was motivated by a misguided desire to impress people, thinking they would respect him if he was a ""larger-than-life character"" - and by a craving to be rich. ""My greed got the better of me,"" he said, adding that he's ""horrendously sorry"" for what he did to Mr Edwards. After he was let out in 2016, Campbell-Brown began blogging and giving talks about penal issues, and worked at the publicly-run Leicester Prison and in jails run by G4S. The work stopped for a while last year, after it was reported that the Spanish authorities were investigating him over allegations of money laundering. He has denied that he's facing any ""active"" inquiries, and there has been no confirmation that any such investigations are taking place. Campbell-Brown has since been given clearance to work for Serco and was recently asked to address a conference attended by prison officers, which was organised by the well-respected Butler Trust. He now deeply regrets the controversial donation that thrust him into the spotlight. He was an admirer of the Liberal Democrats' then-leader, Charles Kennedy, and wanted to ""level"" the political playing field with the Conservatives and Labour in the 2005 general election campaign. But he said the Â£2.4 million payment, made via his firm, Fifth Avenue Partners Ltd, should have been rejected by the party. ""They should have said to me: 'But Michael, you don't live in the United Kingdom, you're not registered on the voters' roll, your company was only born six months ago; really sorry Michael, thanks for coming, but no thanks,'"" he said. ""That's what they should have done, but of course, you know, the pound signs tend to obscure absolutely everything else."" Although the Lib Dems faced calls to return the donation, they kept it after the Electoral Commission concluded they hadn't broken any rules and had accepted the payment in good faith. But Campbell-Brown no longer supports the party because of the way he believes Mr Kennedy was forced out as leader in 2006, amid concerns that his drink problem was affecting his job. He died in 2015, at the age of 55. ""They drove him out... because he was an alcoholic,"" he said. ""That person then dies an early death. I'm sorry, you're responsible for that,"" he added. The Lib Dems are disgusted by that accusation - a source said they would not ""dignify"" it with a response. As Campbell-Brown, a self-confessed ""Walter Mitty"" character, tries to rebuild his reputation, as someone committed to improving the lot of prisoners, he may find it harder than he thinks to shake off his old political connections and criminal past.

10 ways no-deal could affect you,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external. The process could take up to four months. Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,the government has warned that it may become more expensive.,external Full government travel advice,external How will it affect my holidays to Europe? While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU. The government has announced a further Â£434m of funding and other measures, including: extra warehouse space for medicines securing additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone building buffer stocks booking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment making changes to regulatory requirements strengthening processes to deal with shortages However, the National Audit Office has said there are still""significant"" gapsin the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes. Government advice on medicine supply,external Should NHS patients be worried? About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries. The UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now. In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"". The government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing Â£138m. It advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevantcountry advice pages.,external Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country. However, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority. Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries. These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights. Full government advice for UK nationals living in the EU,external How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Drivers UK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK. There are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum. Statisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline.

Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure. As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal. But bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder. Will the value of your home change in 2019? Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The government has also announced Â£344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations. Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal?

This is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK. The government has also issued a ""guarantee"" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun.

PM in EU bid to get new Brexit deal,"Boris Johnson will tell EU leaders there needs to be a new Brexit deal when he makes his first trip abroad as PM later this week. The UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal, he will insist. Meanwhile, theSunday Times has printed leaked government documents,externalwarning of food, medicine  and fuel shortages in a no-deal scenario. A No 10 source told the BBC a former minister leaked the dossier to try to influence discussions with EU leaders. Brexit: A really simple guide 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Brexit: What happens next? The documents say the cross-government paper on preparations for a no-deal Brexit, codenamed Operation Yellowhammer, reveals the UK could face months of disruption at its ports. It also states plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are unlikely to prove sustainable. The dossier, reported by the Sunday Times, says leaving the EU without a deal could lead to: Fresh food becoming less available and prices rising A hard Irish border after plans to avoid checks fail, sparking protests Fuel becoming less available and 2,000 jobs being lost if the government sets petrol import tariffs to 0%, potentially causing two oil refineries to close UK patients having to wait longer for medicines, including insulin and flu vaccines A rise in public disorder and community tensions resulting from a shortage of food and drugs Passengers being delayed at EU airports, Eurotunnel and Dover Freight disruption at ports lasting up to three months, caused by customs checks, before traffic flow improves to 50-70% of the current rate The Downing Street source told the BBC the leaked document ""is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available"". Michael Gove, who is responsible for overseeing the devolution consequences of Brexit, said in a tweet that Operation Yellowhammer was ""a worst case scenario"". ""V significant steps have been taken in the last 3 weeks to accelerate Brexit planning,"" he added. Energy Minister Kwasi Kwarteng told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday:  ""I think there's a lot of scaremongering around and a lot of people are playing into project fear."" But a former head of the British civil service, Lord Bob Kerslake, who described the document as ""credible"", said the dossier ""lays bare the scale of the risks we are facing with no-deal Brexit in almost every area"". ""These risks are completely insane for this country to be taking and we have to explore every avenue to avoid them,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House. Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said, in a tweet, that Ireland had ""always been clear"" a hard border in Ireland ""must be avoided"". The Irish backstop - the provision in Theresa May's withdrawal agreement that could see Northern Ireland continue to follow some of the same trade rules as the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU, thus preventing a hard border - was an ""insurance policy"" designed to protect the peace process, he said. What is the Irish border backstop? Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said the leaked documents showed the effects of a no-deal Brexit should be taken more seriously. ""The government have simply, I think, pretended that this wasn't an issue,"" he said The government was in ""a real pickle"", since the ""the US has said that if that border is jeopardised, we're not going to get a trade deal with them"", he said. Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said, on Wednesday,a US-UK trade deal would not get through Congressif Brexit undermined the Good Friday Agreement. The leak comes as the prime minister prepares to travel to Berlin to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, before going to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday. Mr Johnson is expected to say Parliament cannot and will not change the outcome of the 2016 referendum and insist there must be a new deal to replace Mrs May's withdrawal agreement - defeated three times by MPs - if the UK is to leave the EU with a deal. However, it is thought their discussions will chiefly focus on issues such as foreign policy, security, trade and the environment, ahead of the G7 summit next weekend. Boris Johnson had been reluctant to fly to meet European leaders until it seemed a breakthrough was likely. But - it still doesn't. When Mr Johnson meets the EU's most powerful leaders - Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron - he will repeat his message that the UK is leaving, no matter what, at the end of October. He will tell them face-to-face for the first time that the only way the UK will sign up to a deal is if the EU thinks again, and replaces the agreement brokered by Mrs May. But there seems to be little chance of any serious progress in the coming days. No 10 does not seem particularly optimistic and says it expects both sides will say their piece, then move on to other issues. Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller said the Government had ""unequivocally"" accepted it could not shut down Parliament to clear the way for a no-deal Brexit. Could the government shut down Parliament? She told Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ""What they have said is, unequivocally, they accept that to close down Parliament, to bypass them in terms of Brexit - stopping a no-deal Brexit, in particular - is illegal."" But Ms Miller said she would continue to seek further reassurances that MPs would be able to pass legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of more than 100 MPs has urged the prime minister to recall Parliament and let it sit permanently until the UK leaves the EU. In a letter, MPs say the country is ""on the brink of an economic crisis"". It continues: ""Parliament must be recalled now in August and sit permanently until 31 October, so that the voices of the people can be heard, and that there can be proper scrutiny of your government."" Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has reiterated his call for MPs to work together to stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to the Observer,external, Mr Corbyn said his plan to be installed as an interim prime minister was the ""simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal"". The Labour leader has said, as a caretaker PM, he would delay Brexit, call a snap election, and campaign for another referendum. But Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn was ""divisive"" and instead suggested Conservative MP Ken Clarke or former Labour leader Harriet Harman could head a temporary government. Senior Tory MP rules out backing Corbyn Corbyn outlines plans to defeat no-deal Brexit Would a Labour government cancel Brexit? Elsewhere, in a letter seen by the Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson warned rebel Tory MPs their opposition to a no-deal Brexit was damaging the prospect of getting a new deal. He said it was ""plain as a pikestaff"" that the EU will ""not compromise as long as they believe there is the faintest possibility that Parliament can block Brexit on 31 October"".

'Earliest' tapeworms found at 'Britain's Pompeii',"Archaeologists were astonished by the ""fabulous artefacts"" found at the site The earliest evidence of fish tapeworm in Britain has been discovered preserved in human faeces, according to experts at Cambridge University. The finds were unearthed at a site dubbed ""Britain's Pompeii"",a burnt-out 3,000-year-old village at Must Farm in Cambridgeshire. Fish tapeworm can grow up to 10m (32ft) long and live coiled in the intestines. The university said the research offered the first clear understanding of prehistoric Fen people's diseases. Cambridge University's Dr Marissa Ledger said it also appeared they shared food with their dogs, because both were infected by similar parasitic worms from eating the raw fish, amphibians and molluscs. Archaeologists uncovered at least five roundhouses at the Must Farm quarry site, with many ancillary finds Experts from the Cambridge Archaeological Unit at the university said they believed the ""exceptionally well-preserved"" village was just a few months old when it burnt down. Circular wooden houses built on stilts, pots with food still inside, jewellery and evidence of fine fabric-making were just some of the finds unearthed during the 10-month long dig in 2016. In addition waterlogged ""coprolites"" - pieces of human faeces - were discovered preserved in the surrounding mud, according to a studypublished in the journal Parasitology,external. Historic England - which helped fund the dig - said the site, at Whittlesey near Peterborough, showed a ""frozen moment in time"" Teams from Cambridge and Bristol universities used microscopy techniques to detect ancient parasite eggs within the faeces and determined whether it was from a human or dog. Evidence for Echinostoma and giant kidney worms was also discovered, during months of analysis since the dig was completed. The researchers said little was known about the intestinal diseases of Bronze Age Britain. 'Important' Iron Age settlement found at Warboys dig Roman Britain: Wooden arm discovered in Northamptonshire well 'First British beer' discovered in Cambridgeshire A14 roadworks A previous study of a farming village in Somerset found evidence of parasites spread through the contamination of food by human faeces. This was less evident at Must Farm, possibly because waste was disposed of into the water around the marshy settlement. Dr Ledger said the research ""enables us for the first time to clearly understand the infectious diseases experienced by prehistoric people living in the Fens"".
