'I feel lucky but we must not forget Afghanistan',"British nationals and Afghan evacuees arrived on an RAF plane at Brize Norton on Tuesday evening People who have fled Afghanistan for the UK after the Taliban takeover have spoken of their relief to have escaped the country. UK troops are continuing to evacuate British nationals and eligible Afghans after insurgents seized control of the capital Kabul. No 10 says 306 UK nationals and 2,052 Afghans have been evacuated so far. One British aid worker said she felt ""lucky"" to escape, but that we ""must not forget Afghanistan"". Kitty Chevallier, a 24-year-old charity worker from Basingstoke in Hampshire, left Kabul via a UK evacuation flight on Monday morning. She said she was aware of how ""immensely lucky"" she was to have been helped out of Afghanistan, when others, including friends and colleagues, remained stranded. ""As we drove there at 04:00, the runways were crowded with hundreds of Afghan families hoping to get out somehow,"" she told the PA Media news agency. ""One of the strangest moments was getting on the plane, not knowing when we'd be able to come back or what the city would look and feel like when we did."" British charity worker Kitty Chevallier left Kabul via a UK evacuation flight on Monday morning Ms Chevallier had worked in Kabul since last September with Afghanaid, a UK-registered charity that promotes women's rights and provides clean water and sanitation for Afghans. She said it felt ""bizarre"" to be out of the country, but that ""the real tragedy"" was speaking to friends and colleagues ""for whom the chances of leaving the country are far, far smaller, and who have so much more to lose"". ""I've been doing what I can to help arrange their departure, where that has been possible, and I've been encouraged to see that most of them have now been given the opportunity to leave on a UN flight tomorrow,"" she added. Taliban: Women to have rights within Islamic law Patel: I don't believe Taliban on women's rights Johnson accused of failures over Afghanistan There have been fears that Afghans who worked with Western authorities or groups could be at higher risk of reprisals from the Taliban, though the group hasdenied this will happen. Ms Chevallier said while the messages from the Taliban have made it sound as though there will be no ""danger"" from them, she had heard several examples of ""scared"" aid workers getting ""threatening messages, even death threats"". She called on the UK to ""increase, not cut"" aid going to Afghanistan and said the criteria allowing people to return to the UK need to be urgently expanded ""to include aid workers and civil society activists, especially women"". This video can not be played MOD footage shows British troops assisting the evacuation effort in Afghanistan In addition to those who have already been evacuated to the UK, Downing Street said a further 2,000 Afghan applications had been completed - with ""many more being processed"". The UK government has also committed to take in up to20,000 Afghan refugees over the next few years under a new resettlement scheme - including 5,000 this year. The Refugee Council - a UK-based charity helping refugees - welcomed the government's new scheme as a ""positive first step"". But the charity wants the government to go further to resettle at least 10,000 people a year, and also to expand the eligibility for families so that Afghans living in the UK can be reunited with their loved ones. The latest plans are in addition toan existing scheme for Afghan interpreters and otherswho worked for the UK government - the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP). The Home Office says 2,000 Afghan former staff and their families have already come to the UK via this scheme this year - with a target of 5,000 by the end of 2021. Ms Chevallier shared photographs of people boarding an RAF evacuation flight The speed ofthe Taliban's takeover of major Afghan cities and the capital Kabulappeared to catch Western governments off guard. ""Everyone, I think, has been surprised by the scale and the pace at which the Taliban have taken over in Afghanistan, and that's a lesson that we've all got to learn from,"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday. The PM's official spokesman said on Wednesday that UK humanitarian aid to Afghanistan had ""effectively... doubled to Â£286m"" as ministers sought to ensure it does not fund the Taliban. Challenged on the impact ofrecent cuts to overseas aid, the PM's spokesman said: ""I think people will accept that when the situation changes on the ground, we need to react accordingly, that's what we've done."" This video can not be played ""Everybody got very emotional"": Hassina Syed describes getting out of Afghanistan on a British military plane Hassina Syed, an Afghan businesswoman and activist, said she felt great ""relief"" as the evacuation flight she was on took off from Afghanistan. She said she fled the country ""quickly"" because the situation was ""very unpredictable"". Asked about the atmosphere on the flight, she told BBC Two's Newsnight: ""Everybody got very emotional, most of us began to cry a lot."" Ms Syed said UK troops gave passengers bottled water and food, and that it was ""really touching"" to see them help soothe crying children. Women back in Afghanistan are ""worrying"" and ""want to get out"" she says, because they fear that the Taliban will ""capture them"". She said that during theTaliban's news conference on Tuesday- their first since seizing control of Kabul - there appeared to be a ""bit of changes [sic] that make us a little bit hopeful"". Jack, from Birmingham, whose name has been changed to protect his family still in Afghanistan, left the country on a UK evacuation flight this week. Speaking to PA Media, the 27-year-old said it was ""strange and frightening"". ""(Most) of those fleeing had to sit on the plane's rough floor but overall it was worth it - I am extremely thankful,"" he said. ""Family and friends are (still) there. It was tough not being able to say goodbye."" An RAF plane carrying UK nationals and Afghanslanded at Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Tuesday night,external. Half a dozen more flights are due to arrive in the UK in the next 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Defence. Amid continued chaos at Kabul's airport, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""staggering complacency"" and ""betraying"" the Afghan people. He also cited reports from NGOs that an evacuation plane left ""almost empty"" because people couldn't get through the airport. Downing Street did not deny the reports, and acknowledged there was a ""difficult situation"" on the ground. Dozens of planes from around 15 countrieshave reportedly been sent to Kabul to help with evacuations of foreign citizens and Afghan colleagues - including those from the US, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and the UK. Taliban fighters controlling access to the airport are reportedly not permitting Afghans without documents or passports to enter and have fired shots into the air to disperse approaching crowds.

PCR Test ârip offâ: Government warned in April,"The Competition and Markets Authority has told the BBC it warned government officials that consumers could face risks from the fast-growing Covid PCR testing industry in April and May. The business and competition regulator said it provided advice and market analysis to officials from the Department of Health and Social Care. It said the advice detailed potential market and consumer risks. It comes after the CMA was criticised by its former chairman this week. Lord Tyrietold the BBCthat the situation with PCR testing for travel was a 'predictable Covid rip-off', and that the competitions watchdog hadn't done enough. Cost of NHS Covid tests for UK arrivals reduced Watchdog will look at Covid test cost immediately Anger at overflowing Covid test drop boxes The government has said it was provided with some general market analysis from the CMA on the potential implications for the PCR testing market and that its advice informed the government's approach on the private provider list. The CMA said it cannot disclose this information. The revelation comes after a summer of complaints from travellers and holidaymakers who have taken a holiday or visited family who they've been cut off from because of the pandemic. The UK government has made it a condition of any international travel that tests before travel, and on your arrival in the UK are mandatory. The number of tests that are needed is dependent on your arrival from either a green or amber country or your vaccination status. Arrivals from red countries must still use quarantine hotel facilities. Some of the most common complaints from travellers mention tests listed on the government's list of providers that don't exist at the price advertised whilst others allege poor service. At the start of August, the Health Secretary asked the competition watchdog to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. In a letter to the CMA, Sajid Javid said it was time for a ""rapid high-level"" review to protect consumers. The BBC understands that a full CMA market study or investigation would require a formal consultation before an investigation could be launched and these investigations typically last between 6 and 18 months. Therefore, a wholesale reform of the market could be difficult because of time constraints. It is understood that due to the time and process needed for a full review of the market, the Government was advised it is better placed to tackle immediate issues in this market. The travel industry has been demanding action, after complaining about the 'onerous' level of testing in place, which they believe is a barrier to passenger revival. But, given the lateness of any government intervention, and the impact on the travel sector, people in industry believe the damage has already been done. Julie Lo Bue Said, chief executive of Advantage Travel Partnership, the UK's largest group of independent leisure & business travel agent experts, said ""it feels like a PR exercise for the government to come out and say 'we're looking at this now'. ""It is far too late, when the public has had to pay for all these tests,"" she added. On Friday, Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary announced that the price of PCR Covid tests provided by NHS Test & Trace for travel would fall, by Â£20 for one test to Â£68, and by Â£35 for two tests to Â£138. The Government has consistently maintained that testing for travellers is in place to protect public health.

'Game-changer' plan for 1.2bn disabled people,"A global campaign described as a ""game-changer"" has been launched to improve the lives of more than one billion disabled people by 2030. WeThe15 wants to improve inclusion, raise awareness and end discrimination of disabled people around the world. It brings together a coalition of organisations from the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to Unesco. The launch comes ahead of the delayed Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games which begin on 24 August. Using the event as a springboard, the IPC and International Disability Alliance has joined forces with arts, business and human rights organisations including UN Human Rights and The Valuable 500 to ""raise awareness, change attitudes and create more opportunities"" for disabled people. The campaign has been set-up to represent the 15% of the world's population that is disabled - about 1.2bn people, according to the World Health Organization. As part of it, the IPC, Special Olympics, Invictus Games and International Committee of Sports for the Deaf will collaborate for the first time to ensure there will be a major sport event - and platform for the campaign - every year until 2030. On Thursday, for the launch, 125 landmarks will turn purple - the internationally recognised colour of disability - from New York's Empire State Building to Moscow's Ostankino Tower and the London Eye. President of the IPC, Andrew Parsons, said: ""[The project] aims to put disability right at the heart of the inclusion agenda, alongside ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. ""I strongly believe WeThe15 could be a real game-changer."" He said collaborating with big organisations would ensure a significant presence at local, grassroots, levels to help improve people's lives. Sam Milne, from Leicester, has cerebral palsy and plays with a local basketball team. She said society's general perception of disabled people could be problematic and she had faced discrimination. Sam Milne plays basketball for a local club and says she often faces discrimination when she is out and about She said people often presume she can't speak because she uses a wheelchair and that going back to basics, such as ensuring as many places as possible are accessible, would improve her life and enable her to get out into the community more easily. One of her wishes is that more doors could be power-assisted rather than relying on strength to open them. ""I can walk a bit, but if I can't open the door how far am I going to get? This awareness needs to go down to the everyday - to the shopkeepers and the hair salons."" But she warned that awareness ""needs to grow"" and not disappear once the Paralympics is over. The WeThe15 campaign plans go beyond sport and over the next 10 years it says it will focus on different ""pillars"" which need greater equality. This year it will concentrate on access to vaccinations against Covid-19, while in the run-up to the LA Paralympics in 2028 - the home of Hollywood - it is expected to focus on disability representation in the entertainment industry, such as ensuring disabled actors play disabled characters. Tokyo 2020 will be Stef McLeod Reid's fourth Paralympic Games According to the IPC, 85% of disabled people around the world live in poverty, about 50% are unemployed and 75% of countries have no laws protecting them. Mr Parsons said: ""We want to tackle employment, we want to tackle mobility. ""Of course it will be different country-to-country. This is why we will need the local presence there to understand the challenges and that's why it's a 10-year campaign. We're trying to cover all basis and all nations."" While WeThe15 focuses on the statistic that 15% of the global population is disabled, the US government puts it much higher at 26% for its citizens while the UK government says it's 22%, but the definitions of disability often vary. In the UK a person is considered to have a disability if they report a long-standing illness or impairment which causes substantial difficulty with day-to-day activities. For long jumper and Paralympic medallist, Stef McLeod Reid, Tokyo 2020 will be her fourth Games. The track athlete, who had a foot amputated as a teenager following a boating accident, hopes WeThe15 will stop people viewing disabled people as ""other"". ""When you realise that one billion people in the world live with a disability you realise this should be at the front of every single inclusion agenda. ""There is so much potential and talent sitting there left untapped because the world is designed around this very specific idea of 'normal'."" She said ""disability is expensive"" - from purchasing the right equipment to making buildings accessible - and that needs to be addressed. ""What we are lacking, unfortunately, in different parts of the world, is money and investment and a commitment that everybody should be able to fulfil their potential."" She believes success will rely on ""shifting mindsets"" to make the ""world more accessible to everyone"".

FTSE bosses earn 86 times more than average wage,"The bosses of Britain's biggest companies earned 86 times the average full-time wage last year. The median pay of a chief executive of a FTSE-100 firm - the UK's blue chip company index - was Â£2.69m in 2020, according to the High Pay Centre. That was down 17% from Â£3.25m in 2019, before the pandemic hit. ""These are still very generous rewards,"" said High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard. The think tank's research revealed average bonus size fell from Â£1.1m in 2019 to Â£828,000 last year. Bosses 'earn average worker's salary in 34 hours' Staff shortages remain despite more out of work Meanwhile the average long term incentive plan payment fell from Â£2.4m to Â£1.38m. ""CEO pay packages are designed to reflect the experience of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders so in one sense the lower pay levels this year show the system working as intended,"" Mr Hildyard said. But he pointed out that most chief executives have already made millions of pounds over the course of their careers and the still high rewards come ""at a time when, in general, government support for the economy has probably been more important to the survival and success of the UK's biggest companies than the decisions of their executives."" The research also showed that average chief executive earnings at the nine FTSE-100 companies that used the furlough scheme to pay their employees, was Â£2.39m. Mr Hildyard said the UK's high chief executive pay reflected a wider gap between rich and poor in Britain than in most other European countries. Pascal Soriot of drugs giant AstraZeneca was the highest-earning chief executive, making Â£15.45m last year. He was considerably ahead of Brian Cassin of credit reference agency Experian who made Â£10.3m, according to the think tank's figures. In third spot was Albert Manifold of building materials company CRH who received Â£9.92m. Laxman Narasimhan of consumer goods firm Reckitt Benckiser was fourth with Â£9.24m, while the fifth highest-paid FTSE boss in 2020 was Rob Perrins of housebuilder Berkeley, who made Â£8.03m. Chief executive pay has fallen when their roles have never been more valuable, reckons Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute. ""Amid a historic global crisis the captains of industry have played a key role in keeping us fed, entertained and connected,"" he said. Generous compensation is necessary to attract top talent that delivers innovative products, creates jobs and boosts company value, Mr Lesh added. ""Investors are known to react viciously to changing CEOs because leadership is key to business success."" He said that rather than obsessing about chief executive pay, ""we should embrace policies that will boost pay for all workers as the economy recovers from Covid-19. ""This means cutting taxes and red tape that holds down incomes."" Quite apart from the reminder of the huge gap that has, over the years, opened up between the best-paid employees and the average - with chief executives on 86 times as much as the average worker - the High Pay Centre think tank's analysis is also a reminder of the weakness of the premise on which exorbitant bonuses and long-term incentive plans are based. This is namely that the key determinant of a company's success is the shareholder value it generates. In addition, it is the notion that the key determinant of that is a talented top boss who must be attracted, retained and incentivised to do their best by the offer of big money. It wasn't Pascal Soriot, the highest paid chief executive of a FTSE-listed company (pay: Â£15.45m), who led the team that came up with AstraZeneca's vaccine. That was Sarah Gilbert and Andrew Pollard of Oxford University. But the reason shareholders won't begrudge him it isn't because of what it did to AstraZeneca's profits. In fact, by offering to distribute it at no profit (unlike Pfizer), AstraZeneca's losses due to the vaccine in the first half of 2021 were more than $50m. But what it's done for the firm's reputation - and the benefit to public health - are incalculable. It's not just the bottom line that counts.

"Apple censors engraving service, report claims","Apple is a big brand in China, with flagship shops in cities such as Shanghai Apple censors references to Chinese politicians, dissidents and other topics in its engraving service, a report alleges. Citizen Lab said it had investigated filters set up for customers who wanted something engraved on a new iPhone, iPad or other Apple device. And Apple had a broad list of censored words, not just in mainland China but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Apple said its systems ""ensure local laws and customs are respected"". ""As with everything at Apple, the process for engraving is led by our values,"" chief privacy officer Jane Horvathwrote in a letter provided to CitizenLab,externalin advance of the publication of its report. And the engraving service tried not to allow trademarked phrases, alongside those that ""are vulgar or culturally insensitive, could be construed as inciting violence, or would be considered illegal according to local laws, rules, and regulations"". But CitizenLab accuses Apple of having ""thoughtlessly and inconsistently curated keyword lists"". CitizenLab, a research group at the University of Toronto known for its work in technology and human rights, said there had been previous research onthe censorship of Apple's App Store in China. But there were until now only anecdotal reports of engravings being refused, it said. Its new report found more than 1,100 filtered keywords, across six different regions,,externalmainly relating to offensive content, such as racist or sexual words. But it alleges the rules are applied inconsistently and are much wider for China. A reference to 4 June 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square - ""8964"" - was blocked in China ""Within mainland China, we found that Apple censors political content, including broad references to Chinese leadership and China's political system, names of dissidents and independent news organisations, and general terms relating to religions, democracy, and human rights,"" it says. The report also alleges that censorship ""bleeds"" into both the Hong Kong and Taiwan markets. It found: 1,045 keywords blocked in mainland China 542 in Hong Kong 397 in Taiwan In contrast, Japan, Canada and the US had between 170 and 260 filtered words. In Hong Kong, phrases referencing the ""umbrella revolution"", pro-democracy movement, and freedom of the press appeared to be blocked, along with the names of some political dissidents. In Taiwan, the report found filtering of senior members of China's ruling Communist Party, including historical figures such as Chairman Mao Zedong. Hong Kong is what is known as a special administrative region of China. The former British colony is part of China but governed under special principles and enjoys a high degree of autonomy. Taiwan, meanwhile, is self-governing but Beijing considers it a breakaway rebel province that will one day be reunited with mainland China. ""Much of this censorship exceeds Apple's legal obligations in Hong Kong and we are aware of no legal justification for the political censorship of content in Taiwan,"" the report says. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law It also cites mistakes - such as 10 people with the surname Zhang having their engravings censored, a restriction with no obvious political significance. ""Apple does not fully understand what content they censor,"" CitizenLab alleged. ""Rather than each censored keyword being born of careful consideration, many seem to have been thoughtlessly reappropriated from other sources,"" it said - possibly including a list used to censor products at a Chinese company. China was a valuable market for big technology companies, CitizenLab said. But its research ""points to a more alarming trend of the export of one jurisdiction's regulatory and political pressures to another"". There were ""growing uncertainties and dilemmas global companies face between upholding internationally acknowledged human-rights norms and making decisions purely based on commercial interests"", it added. Replying to the group, Ms Horvath said Apple's rules depended on the region - and ""no third parties or government agencies have been involved in the process"". ""To a large degree, this is not an automated process and relies on manual curation,"" she said. ""At times, that can result in engraving requests being mistakenly rejected. ""And we have a process in place to review and correct those situations when they occur.""

IMF suspends Afghanistan's access to funds,"Afghan people line up outside AZIZI Bank to take out cash as the bank suffers amid money crises in Kabul The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Afghanistan will no longer be able to access the lender's resources. The move follows the Taliban's takeover of the country last weekend. An IMF spokesperson said it was due to ""lack of clarity within the international community"" over recognising a government in Afghanistan. Resources of over $370m (Â£268m) from the IMF had been set to arrive on 23 August. These funds were part of a global IMF response to the economic crisis. Access to the IMF's reserves in Special Drawing Rights (SDR) assets, which can be converted to government-backed money, have also been blocked. SDRs are the IMF's unit of exchange based on sterling, dollars, euros, yen and yuan. ""As is always the case, the IMF is guided by the views of the international community,"" the spokesperson added. What next for Afghanistan's economy? US left too quickly, says Afghanistan bank governor The Taliban's victory will test India, and peace in South Asia It comes after an official from the Biden administration told the BBC that any central bank assets the Afghan government has in the US will not be made available to the Taliban. In aletter to the US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen,external, Congress members called for assurances that the Taliban would receive no US-backed aid. ""The potential of the SDR allocation to provide nearly half a billion dollars in unconditional liquidity to a regime with a history of supporting terrorist actions against the United States and her allies is extremely concerning,"" 17 signatories wrote. Earlier, the head of Afghanistan's central bank said the US hadcut off access to its assets- around $7bn of which are held at the U.S. Federal Reserve. Ajmal Ahmady, who fled the country at the weekend, tweeted that Da Afghanistan Bank's total reserves were approximately $9bn as of last week. But he said as per international standards, most of this was held in safe, liquid assets such as US Treasury bonds and gold offshore. ""Given that the Taliban are still on international sanction lists, it is expected (confirmed?) that such assets will be frozen and not accessible to Taliban,"" Mr Ahmady tweeted. ""We can say the accessible funds to the Taliban are perhaps 0.1-0.2% of Afghanistan's total international reserves. Not much."" Mr Ahmady added that Washington's suspended shipments of physical dollars were causing Afghanistan's currency to depreciate. The Afghan currency, the Afghani,has fallen to record lows,external. ""I believe local banks have told customers that they cannot return their dollars â because [Da Afghanistan Bank] has not supplied banks with dollars,"" he tweeted. ""This is true. Not because funds have been stolen or being held in vault, but because all dollars are in international accounts that have been frozen."" In June, the IMF gave Afghanistan its latest loan instalment which was approved in November. In the same month,the UN published a report,externalwhich stated that the ""primary sources of Taliban financing remain criminal activities,"" including ""drug trafficking and opium poppy production, extortion, kidnapping for ransom, mineral exploitation and revenues from tax collection in areas under Taliban control or influence."" The World Bank also funds many development projects in the country and has provided Afghanistan with $5.3bn since 2002. It has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment on the current status of this funding. Independent money transfer giant Western Union has also suspended money transfer services to Afghanistan ""until further notice"". The IMF has taken similar steps against other regimes not recognised by a majority of its members. This happened in April 2019 when SDR access was blocked after more than 50 member countries refused to recognise President Nicolas Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. The IMF also halted payments to Myanmar after the military junta seized control. On Monday, the IMF will complete a $650bn allocation of SDRs to its 190 member countries. The sudden advances made by the Taliban left the IMF with an urgent decision. It is about to hand out to almost all its members a reserve asset called special drawing rights. It's an exercise that is not about Afghanistan. It's about reinforcing the global economic recovery from the pandemic related crisis. And it's happening on Monday. So if the new regime in Kabul were to be excluded at this stage the IMF had to move quickly. And it has done so, reflecting what a spokesperson called a lack of clarity about the recognition of the government. That is what lies behind the IMF decision at this stage. It does also raise the possibility that financial assistance might come to be used as leverage to encourage the Taliban not to allow the abuses that many fear - and that some reports say are already taking place.

Scottish public spending deficit doubles to Â£36bn,"The notional deficit figures reflect huge changes in public spending and revenues due to the pandemic Scotland's public spending deficit more than doubled to Â£36.3bn last year as spending increased and revenues fell due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Total spending by the Scottish and UK governments and other public bodies rose to Â£99.2bn as Scotland went into lockdown. Income from taxes fell to Â£62.8bn, leaving a gap between spending and revenue equating to 22.4% of GDP. The deficit for the UK as a whole over the same period was 14.2% of GDP. Scotland's figure for the previous year - before the onset of the pandemic - wasÂ£15.1bn, or 8.6% of GDP. What is Gers and how is it calculated? The figures were calculated by Scottish government statisticians as part of the annualGovernment Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) report,external. It illustrates how public finances were hit by the pandemic, with huge spending on healthcare as well as relief programmes such as the furlough scheme and payments to businesses forced to close by lockdown. Public sector spending in Scotland increased by 21% in the 2020-21 tax year, with the figure compounded by falling revenues and the price of oil. Total spending was equivalent to Â£18,144 per person - Â£1,828 per person more than the UK average. The Fraser of Allander Institute - an economic think tank based at Strathclyde University - said the figures were ""the largest ever seen in terms of the notional deficit"", noting that the UK has also recorded its largest deficit since the second world war. Director Mairi Spowagesaid,externalthe increase in the Scottish figure relative to the UK was ""a little larger than we might have expected"", due to a larger fall in Scottish GDP caused by the contraction of the North Sea oil industry. Kate Forbes said the Scottish government should be given more powers to deal with financial crises Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the ""significant economic impact"" of the Covid-19 pandemic had ""fundamentally shifted our fiscal landscape"". She said: ""While we face continued challenges, there are welcome signs that the Scottish economy is beginning to recover strongly. Business confidence is back above pre-pandemic levels, output is increasing and job vacancies are rising. ""As we rebuild, we are pushing forward with an ambitious 10 year agenda of economic transformation to help seize Scotland's potential and deliver a more prosperous, fairer and greener economy."" Ms Forbes also called for further borrowing powers to be devolved to Holyrood as part of efforts to rebuild the economy. She said the pandemic had ""clearly demonstrated the need for fiscal reform and tat the Scottish government's financial powers are insufficient to deal with the new economic reality"". However, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the figures ""show how all of us in Scotland have benefitted from being part of a strong United Kingdom"". He added: ""We have been able to weather the Covid storm as part of the UK but we now face the challenge of rebuilding our economy and supporting our heroic NHS and other public services. Our focus remains on that task. ""We have faced a terrible crisis far, far stronger as one UK - and we will build back better as one UK."" Meanwhile, business group CBI Scotland said the Covid-19 crisis had ""served to exacerbate many of the weaknesses found in the Scottish economy pre-pandemic"". Director Tracy Black said: ""After an incredibly tough eighteen months, the Scottish government must fully commit to making economic recovery their number one priority. ""If the Scottish government plans to launch a series of ambitious spending plans, this must be backed-up by consistent revenue generation. That means supporting enterprise to deliver the jobs and growth we need by taking steps to build public and business confidence in the recovery.""

"'I feel lucky but we must not forget Afghanistan'The UK government says 306 UK nationals and 2,052 Afghans have been flown out of the country so far.UK","British nationals and Afghan evacuees arrived on an RAF plane at Brize Norton on Tuesday evening People who have fled Afghanistan for the UK after the Taliban takeover have spoken of their relief to have escaped the country. UK troops are continuing to evacuate British nationals and eligible Afghans after insurgents seized control of the capital Kabul. No 10 says 306 UK nationals and 2,052 Afghans have been evacuated so far. One British aid worker said she felt ""lucky"" to escape, but that we ""must not forget Afghanistan"". Kitty Chevallier, a 24-year-old charity worker from Basingstoke in Hampshire, left Kabul via a UK evacuation flight on Monday morning. She said she was aware of how ""immensely lucky"" she was to have been helped out of Afghanistan, when others, including friends and colleagues, remained stranded. ""As we drove there at 04:00, the runways were crowded with hundreds of Afghan families hoping to get out somehow,"" she told the PA Media news agency. ""One of the strangest moments was getting on the plane, not knowing when we'd be able to come back or what the city would look and feel like when we did."" British charity worker Kitty Chevallier left Kabul via a UK evacuation flight on Monday morning Ms Chevallier had worked in Kabul since last September with Afghanaid, a UK-registered charity that promotes women's rights and provides clean water and sanitation for Afghans. She said it felt ""bizarre"" to be out of the country, but that ""the real tragedy"" was speaking to friends and colleagues ""for whom the chances of leaving the country are far, far smaller, and who have so much more to lose"". ""I've been doing what I can to help arrange their departure, where that has been possible, and I've been encouraged to see that most of them have now been given the opportunity to leave on a UN flight tomorrow,"" she added. Taliban: Women to have rights within Islamic law Patel: I don't believe Taliban on women's rights Johnson accused of failures over Afghanistan There have been fears that Afghans who worked with Western authorities or groups could be at higher risk of reprisals from the Taliban, though the group hasdenied this will happen. Ms Chevallier said while the messages from the Taliban have made it sound as though there will be no ""danger"" from them, she had heard several examples of ""scared"" aid workers getting ""threatening messages, even death threats"". She called on the UK to ""increase, not cut"" aid going to Afghanistan and said the criteria allowing people to return to the UK need to be urgently expanded ""to include aid workers and civil society activists, especially women"". This video can not be played MOD footage shows British troops assisting the evacuation effort in Afghanistan In addition to those who have already been evacuated to the UK, Downing Street said a further 2,000 Afghan applications had been completed - with ""many more being processed"". The UK government has also committed to take in up to20,000 Afghan refugees over the next few years under a new resettlement scheme - including 5,000 this year. The Refugee Council - a UK-based charity helping refugees - welcomed the government's new scheme as a ""positive first step"". But the charity wants the government to go further to resettle at least 10,000 people a year, and also to expand the eligibility for families so that Afghans living in the UK can be reunited with their loved ones. The latest plans are in addition toan existing scheme for Afghan interpreters and otherswho worked for the UK government - the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP). The Home Office says 2,000 Afghan former staff and their families have already come to the UK via this scheme this year - with a target of 5,000 by the end of 2021. Ms Chevallier shared photographs of people boarding an RAF evacuation flight The speed ofthe Taliban's takeover of major Afghan cities and the capital Kabulappeared to catch Western governments off guard. ""Everyone, I think, has been surprised by the scale and the pace at which the Taliban have taken over in Afghanistan, and that's a lesson that we've all got to learn from,"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday. The PM's official spokesman said on Wednesday that UK humanitarian aid to Afghanistan had ""effectively... doubled to Â£286m"" as ministers sought to ensure it does not fund the Taliban. Challenged on the impact ofrecent cuts to overseas aid, the PM's spokesman said: ""I think people will accept that when the situation changes on the ground, we need to react accordingly, that's what we've done."" This video can not be played ""Everybody got very emotional"": Hassina Syed describes getting out of Afghanistan on a British military plane Hassina Syed, an Afghan businesswoman and activist, said she felt great ""relief"" as the evacuation flight she was on took off from Afghanistan. She said she fled the country ""quickly"" because the situation was ""very unpredictable"". Asked about the atmosphere on the flight, she told BBC Two's Newsnight: ""Everybody got very emotional, most of us began to cry a lot."" Ms Syed said UK troops gave passengers bottled water and food, and that it was ""really touching"" to see them help soothe crying children. Women back in Afghanistan are ""worrying"" and ""want to get out"" she says, because they fear that the Taliban will ""capture them"". She said that during theTaliban's news conference on Tuesday- their first since seizing control of Kabul - there appeared to be a ""bit of changes [sic] that make us a little bit hopeful"". Jack, from Birmingham, whose name has been changed to protect his family still in Afghanistan, left the country on a UK evacuation flight this week. Speaking to PA Media, the 27-year-old said it was ""strange and frightening"". ""(Most) of those fleeing had to sit on the plane's rough floor but overall it was worth it - I am extremely thankful,"" he said. ""Family and friends are (still) there. It was tough not being able to say goodbye."" An RAF plane carrying UK nationals and Afghanslanded at Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Tuesday night,external. Half a dozen more flights are due to arrive in the UK in the next 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Defence. Amid continued chaos at Kabul's airport, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""staggering complacency"" and ""betraying"" the Afghan people. He also cited reports from NGOs that an evacuation plane left ""almost empty"" because people couldn't get through the airport. Downing Street did not deny the reports, and acknowledged there was a ""difficult situation"" on the ground. Dozens of planes from around 15 countrieshave reportedly been sent to Kabul to help with evacuations of foreign citizens and Afghan colleagues - including those from the US, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and the UK. Taliban fighters controlling access to the airport are reportedly not permitting Afghans without documents or passports to enter and have fired shots into the air to disperse approaching crowds.

Ex-Plaid leader no longer friends with successor,"This video can not be played Leanne Wood said she has not been friends with Adam Price since his challenge to her leadership of the party in 2018 Former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood says she and Adam Price ""have not been friends for years"" since he challenged her for the party leadership in 2018. Ms Wood, Plaid leader for six years, said Mr Price's timing and the way it happened were ""a bad judgement call"". She said the party had gone backwards since. In May's Senedd election, she lost her Rhondda seat. Plaid Cymru praised her ""invaluable contribution"" to the party but said it was proud of being ""member-led"". This, it said, gave ""the leader a clear mandate through leadership elections"". Mr Price has previously described how the decision to challenge one of his ""oldest friends in politics"" was ""the most difficult thing I've had to wrestle with in my political life"". Leanne Wood says she has not spoken to Adam Price, both pictured at an election event in 2016, for years But he said deep friendships could survive ""this kind of thing"" and had felt the party was at an impasse. Adam Price replaces Wood as Plaid leader Plaid AM calls on Wood to share power Ms Wood was elected Plaid leader in 2012,before losing the positionin the 2018 contest, where she came last behind Adam Price and fellow challenger Rhun ap Iorwerth. She had won the seat of Rhondda from Labour in 2016 - a prized constituency for Plaid Cymru which has sought to expand its reach in the south Wales valleys. But Plaid failed to make further inroads at May's Senedd election. It lost Rhondda and came third behind the Conservatives overall, though it gained an extra seat. Mr Price was voted into the top job by Plaid Cymru members in the autumn of 2018. Earlier that year he threatened to challenge Ms Wood for the postif she did not agree to share the job, accusing the party of ""predictable, plodding politics"" at the time. Leanne Wood was Plaid leader for six years Speaking to the BBC'sWalescast politics podcast, Ms Wood said the co-leadership proposal was ""unconstitutional"". ""I don't feel like it was done correctly really and probably that's part of why it's been quite difficult,"" she said. ""We're not friends now. We haven't been friends for years."" Asked if that had been difficult to deal with, she replied: ""Losing a friendship is difficult isn't it? ""And losing a friendship under these political circumstances, when the project you believe in and is getting somewhere is stopped, that adds an extra layer of difficulty."" In the midst of the chaos that engulfed the political scene after the Brexit referendum of 2016, many supporters of the Remain campaign called for a second vote to be held. As leader, Ms Wood initially accepted the leave result but she also told a special party conference that Plaid should ""stand up for all those who voted to remain"". In October 2017 she said Plaidcould support a second referendumif no exit deal was agreed by March 2019. Ms Wood told Walescast the policy shift was not something she supported, and that she argued behind the scenes that the 2016 result - where Wales voted leave - should be respected. ""I always thought the idea of a second referendum was a really bad idea,"" she said. Ms Wood said the ""pressure was immense"" from Mr Price and others within the party to back a new EU poll, support for which increased under him. ""I really felt very, very strongly that if you ask people a question in a democracy you have to accept the result, no matter how much you don't like it. ""I spent a lot of time internally within Plaid Cymru trying to persuade people that we needed to accept this result, trying to persuade people that the messages and the words we were using to describe what had happened were causing great anger amongst people in some places. ""But it was a debate that people couldn't face I think."" Adam Price made independence a major plank of his 2021 election campaign As party leader Mr Price made independence a cornerstone of his party's platform, setting up a commission to look at how the party should prepare for holding a referendum. At the 2021 Senedd election,he promised an independence referendum within five yearsif Plaid won a majority of seats. It was a significant contrast to Ms Wood's approach and she told Walescast not enough ground work had been done to give answers for ""some of the very real questions"" voters had. ""It's no good just saying 'let's do it, let's go' because the only people you're going to take with you there are the people who are already behind that idea."" Having lost her seat, Ms Wood said she had no plans to return to front-line politics. ""I've decided to take some time out now over the summer to relax and reflect,"" she said. ""I've not had time off for a long time where I've not had something to do or some case to be concerned about or somebody to watch out for behind you. ""So it's refreshing and good for my well-being to be able take this time out."" A Plaid spokesman said: ""Leanne Wood has made an invaluable contribution to the work of Plaid Cymru and will undoubtedly continue to play an important role within wider Welsh public life in future. ""Plaid Cymru is proud of being a member-led party that empowers its membership to take key decisions, including granting the leader a clear mandate through leadership elections.""

US lab stands on threshold of key fusion goal,"The research takes place at the National Ignition Facility in Livermore, California A US science institute is on the verge of achieving a longstanding goal in nuclear fusion research. The National Ignition Facility uses a powerful laser to heat and compress hydrogen fuel, initiating fusion. An experiment suggests the goal of ""ignition"", where the energy released by fusion exceeds that delivered by the laser, is now within touching distance. Harnessing fusion, the process that powers the Sun, could provide a limitless, clean energy source. In a process called inertial confinement fusion, 192 beams from NIF's laser - the highest-energy example in the world - are directed towards a peppercorn-sized capsule containing deuterium and tritium, which are different forms of the element hydrogen. This compresses the fuel to 100 times the density of lead and heats it to 100 million degrees Celsius - hotter than the centre of the Sun. These conditions help kickstart thermonuclear fusion. Fusion milestone passed at US lab Man-made star to unlock cosmic secrets,external Giant laser experiment powers up,external An experiment carried out on 8 August yielded 1.35 megajoules (MJ) of energy - around 70% of the laser energy delivered to the fuel capsule. Reaching ignition means getting a fusion yield that's greater than the 1.9 MJ put in by the laser. ""This is a huge advance for fusion and for the entire fusion community,"" Debbie Callahan, a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which hosts NIF, told BBC News. As a measure of progress, the yield from this month's experiment is eight times NIF's previous record, established in Spring 2021, and 25 times the yield from experiments carried out in 2018. ""The pace of improvement in energy output has been rapid, suggesting we may soon reach more energy milestones, such as exceeding the energy input from the lasers used to kick-start the process,"" said Prof Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London. Artwork showing a pellet of hydrogen fuel inside a container called the hohlraum NIF scientists also believe they have now achieved something called ""burning plasma"", where the fusion reactions themselves provide the heat for more fusion. This is vital for making the process self-sustaining. ""Self-sustaining burn is essential to getting high yield,"" Dr Callahan explained. ""The burn wave has to propagate into the high density fuel in order to get a lot of fusion energy out. ""We believe this experiment is in this regime, although we are still doing analysis and simulations to be sure that we understand the result."" As a next step, Dr Callahan said the experiments would be repeated. ""That's fundamental to experimental science. We need to understand how reproducible and how sensitive the results are to small changes,"" she said. ""After that, we do have ideas for how to improve on this design and we will start working on those next year."" Prof Chittenden explained: ""The mega-joule of energy released in the experiment is indeed impressive in fusion terms, but in practice this is equivalent to the energy required to boil a kettle."" He added: ""Far higher fusion energies can be achieved through ignition if we can work out how to hold the fuel together for longer, to allow more of it to burn. This will be the next horizon for inertial confinement fusion."" Existing nuclear energy relies on a process called fission, where a heavy chemical element is split to produce lighter ones. Fusion works by combining two light elements to make a heavier one. Interior of the target chamber, where fusion takes place Construction on the National Ignition Facility began in 1997 and was complete by 2009. The first experiments to test the laser's power began in October 2010. NIF's other function is to help ensure the safety and reliability of America's nuclear weapons stockpile. At times, scientists who want to use the huge laser for fusion have had their time squeezed by experiments geared towards national security. But in 2013, the BBC reported that during experiments at NIF,the amount of energy released through fusion had exceeded the amount of energy absorbedby the fuel - a breakthrough and a first for any fusion facility in the world. Results from these tests were later published in the journal Nature. NIF is one of several projects around the world geared towards advancing fusion research. They include the multi-billion-euro Iter facility, currently under construction in Cadarache, France. Iter will take a different approach to the laser-driven fusion at NIF; the facility in southern France will use magnetic fields to contain hot plasma - electrically-charged gas. This concept is known as magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). But building commercially viable fusion facilities that can provide energy to the grid will require another giant leap. ""Turning this concept into a renewable source of electrical energy is likely to be a long process and will involve overcoming substantial technical challenges, such as being able to re-create this experiment several times a second to produce a steady source of power,"" said Prof Chittenden.

Northern English regions drive house price growth,"The North West of England recorded fastest rising house prices A summer surge in house price growth outside London has been revealed in official figures, but some analysts expect the market to start to cool. UK property prices rose by 13.2% in the year to the end of June, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said - the fastest rise for 17 years Prices were typically Â£31,000 higher than at the same time last year. This increase was driven by the North West and North East of England, as well as Wales, Yorkshire and the Humber. The price of the average UK home was Â£266,000, the ONS said. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ""Once again the North West leads the charge, while London property prices lag. ""This reinforces what we have been seeing for some time - the race for space means buyers' money is going further outside the capital, inevitably pushing up prices."" The latest ONS and Land Registry figures show that house prices rose fastest over the last year in the North West of England, up by 18.6%. This was followed by big increases in Wales (16.7%), in Yorkshire and the Humber (15.8%) and the North East of England (15.3%). The slowest price rises were seen in London, which recorded a 6.3% rise compared with a year earlier. How Covid has changed where we want to live Winchester least affordable UK city to buy a home The figures cover the period to the end of June. This is the point at whichstamp duty holidaysbecame less generous in England and Wales, and many thousands of deals were rushed through to beat the deadline. The tax break led to significant movement at the top end of the market. More recent data suggest some of the heat has come out of the market for more expensive detached homes since the end of June. However, Land Registry data show that there was also demand, and rapidly rising prices, among semi-detached and terraced homes. In some cases, buyers would have benefited from lower stamp duty levies, but there was also a lifestyle choice involved for some amid the pandemic. In areas where relatively few properties were on the market, failing to match demand, prices continued to grow. These included some coastal and rural locations. Mortgage rates are also at historically low levels. That means buyers in a position to put down a significant deposit have to pay very little interest on home loans. Kate Allen, owner at lettings firm Salcombe Finest, in Devon, said: ""This overheated market continues to cook and it looks like we've got a property heatwave forecast for the rest of the year."" Others suggest that any slower than expected return to normality for the economy, a resulting pressure on jobs, and the end of tax breaks could cool the market in many areas. ""As for later this year and early next, the expectation is that while we won't necessarily see prices fall, a period of zero or negligible house price growth is most likely,"" said Scott Taylor-Barr, of Shropshire-based mortgage broker, Carl Summers Financial Services.

Nando's hopes to fully reopen from SaturdayThe chain had to shut about 50 restaurants due to food shortages thought to include its signature peri-peri chicken.Business,"Nando's says it is hoping to reopen all its restaurants from Saturday after shutting about 50 outlets because of supply problems. The chicken chain's restaurants were closed after it ran out of some food, including its popular peri-peri dish. The group blamed the closures on staffing issues at its suppliers' factories. Nando's said it seconded 70 staff to the suppliers to help ""get things moving again"". A Nando's spokesperson said on Wednesday: ""The UK food industry has been experiencing disruption across its supply chain in recent weeks due to staff shortages and Covid isolations, and a number of our restaurants have been impacted."" ""However, since Monday, a team of our brilliant Nandocas have been supporting our key suppliers onsite - working in partnership to help get things moving again, and this has already had a positive impact on affected restaurants."" As a result it said it intended that all of its restaurants should be open again from this Saturday. The South African-owned chain operates more than 400 Nando's restaurants across the UK. The so-called pingdemic has hit food and other supply chains this summer, as staff have been forced to self-isolate if they have come into contact with someone with coronavirus. Dairy giant Arla reduced supermarket milk deliveries last month, blaming lorry driver shortages. Last week, KFC said some items were missing from its menus due to ""disruption"". The shortages follow a stark warning last month from Ranjit Singh Boparan, founder of the country's largest supplier of supermarket chicken, the 2 Sisters Food Group. ""Supply of chicken and turkey is under threat. Our retail partners and the wider supply chain have worked together closer than ever before to ensure we retain food supply and this is of huge credit to everyone. But we are at crisis point,"" he warned. The problem has also affected other industries, including carmakers, transport operators, restaurants and pubs. From this week fully-vaccinated staff are no longer required to self-isolate which should help ease the pressure on businesses.

Price rises cool amid clothes and shoe discounting,"The UK inflation rate fell to 2% in the year to July as the economy continued to reopen from Covid-19 restrictions. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation dipped from 2.5% in the year to June, the highest level for nearly three years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The rate fell to the Bank of England's 2% inflation target, after being higher for two months in a row. The dip in inflation was driven by price falls in clothing and footwear. Prices of games, toys and hobbies were also down and package holidays fell slightly compared with a year ago. However, those decreases were ""largely offset"" by price rises in transport, the ONS said. Average petrol prices stood at 132.6p per litre in July 2021, compared with 111.4p per litre a year earlier. The latest price is the highest recorded since September 2013. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were expecting the annual inflation to decrease a little, but added the size of the fall was a ""a bit of a surprise"". ""Today's figure puts the brakes on those who argue that inflation is about to go out of control, but there are reasons to think it does go up further later in the year,"" she said. Ms Martins said the reasons for the dip in inflation were ""quite broad based"", but added the main contributors were ""good sales"" in the clothing shops over the summer, as well as a year-on-year fall in the prices of computer games and food. However, she said there were still expectations that inflation would rise later this year. The temporary VAT cut is going to be removed for hospitality, we've got some inflationary big energy bill hikes coming. ""So we do think inflation could go up towards the end of the year and then come back down again around the turn of the year and into next year."" Regulator Ofgem has said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs, with typical gas and electricity bills likely to rise by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. July's CPI figure was below most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 2.3%. Though falls in the price of clothes drove down the inflation, it was partially offset by recent rises in second-hand car prices, the ONS said. Second-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in the last few months as a result of a delays in the supply of new cars, caused by the shortage of semiconductor chips used in their production. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said usually, a seasonal jump in transport prices was countered by a big drop in clothing prices. ""Stepping back from the detail, the big picture is that July's drop in CPI inflation will be short-lived,"" he said.""The  headline rate will rise to nearly 4% by the end of this year."" However, Mr Tombs said with energy prices ""unlikely to soar indefinitely"", and wage growth to be dampened when the furlough scheme ends, inflation would return to 2% by the end of 2022. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the rate dip ""masks the strength of inflationary pressures currently within the UK economy"". ""We expect inflation to accelerate further during the rest of this year, rising significantly above the Bank of England's 2% target, as supply chains remain under strain faced with a strong rebound in demand,"" she added. The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, increased to 3.8%. The number in July is typically used to calculate rises in regulated rail fares. However, the government said no decision had been made on national fares, with a spokesman stating it is ""considering a variety of options"". As the economy reopens, economic figures are disco-dancing in seemingly random directions. Inflation came in lower than expected, bang on the Bank of England's target of 2%, thanks to a fall in the price of clothing. But some of the comparisons reflect last year's reopening trends, for example in July 2020 clothes prices did not fall, as is usual during the sales. Some prices are difficult to calculate, such as package holidays. Other prices are still surging, such as the used car market, when in July the 12-month inflation rate was 14%, reflecting shortages of new cars due to difficulties in semiconductor production. Petrol prices are well up on a year ago too. So the broad story is that this is a pause for breath as inflation marches towards 4% this year. But the fact it has dipped provides more support for the majority of Bank of England decision makers on the Monetary Policy Committee who believe that the anticipated rise will be temporary and does not need an immediate response, in order to contain it.

'NHS abandoned me after I tried to kill myself',"Katie Yelland says she felt abandoned by NHS mental health services A woman who tried to take her own life after suffering post-natal depression says she was abandoned by NHS mental health services during the pandemic. Katie Yelland, 30, relied on family support to get her through the first lockdown after services were paused. It comes as monthly mental health referrals across the UK hit their highest point in two years. Charities warned the surge was set to continue and called for action from the UK and devolved governments. The UK government says it plans to expand and transform mental health services, backed by Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-24. Ms Yelland suffered from severe post-natal depression after her son was born in August 2019. Just weeks before the first national lockdown, she tried to take her own life. Describing how her treatment stopped after lockdown was imposed, Ms Yelland said: ""Everything just kind of built up and caved in on me. Access to the services just wasn't there. ""I was just abandoned for a good number of weeks, while the new NHS system got into place. ""Once that system was finally in place, it was then an absolute minefield trying to use it and professionals didn't know how to use it. ""I was really isolated and I felt really concerned. I was really confused and became very reliant on my family. ""It opened their eyes to how much I was struggling. ""They've just seen me happy and bubbly. They hadn't seen the internal struggle that that was going on."" Prior to the pandemic, Ms Yelland was seen weekly by a community psychiatric nurse and the perinatal mental health team. She said: ""The care from the perinatal team just completely stopped. There was nothing, just here one day, gone the next, and with the community team there was nothing. I was left for a good number of weeks, with no help, just getting worse and worse."" The BBC Shared Data Unit analysed figures from 117 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) in England, and health boards across Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Around 300,000 people were referred to NHS mental health services in Great Britain in March this year, a rise of 18% from the total in February 2020, the month before the pandemic struck. The rise is driven by an increase in referrals across England.  Some CCGs, like Leeds, Redbridge and Greater Preston, have seen referrals more than double compared to pre-Covid levels. But while referrals are rising, the number of people receiving mental health treatment remains lower than pre-pandemic levels. Over the same time period, our analysis found the number of people in contact with the service had dropped by around 67,000 - a fall of 9%. Charities have suggested a combination of social distancing restrictions and a move to online treatments has reduced capacity. Taylor Simmonds completed 14 sessions of online therapy Taylor Simmonds, 20, is autistic and suffers from severe OCD. Late last year he  referred himself to NHS community mental health services after his symptoms got out of control, but found 14 weeks of remote treatment didn't help. ""I think for some people, remote treatment really doesn't work, and it can make things worse. So having some kind of flexibility is important."" Some parts of the country are treating many more people than pre-pandemic levels. The biggest increase in England was in Blackpool, one of the UK's most deprived areas, where 4,095 adults were in contact with mental health services in March this year - 87% more than pre-pandemic levels. Concerns are also growing that a spike in urgent crisis referrals suggests people are entering the system more unwell than they would have been. MIND's head of health policy Geoff Heyes said: ""Had those people been able to get support earlier, be that through community mental health services, through talking therapies in their community, they may well have not got that unwell."" Charities Rethink Mental Illness and SANE joined in calls for action. SANE chief executive Marjorie Wallace warned the leap in referral numbers could be the beginning of a mental health surge as people who were discouraged from seeking help come forward. Rethink Mental Illness deputy chief executive Brian Dow Rethink Mental Illness deputy chief executive Brian Dow said: ""If this increase in referrals is sustained, it has the potential to place the system under real pressure. ""We're already seeing signs of stretched services across the country, with people being sent miles away for care because there aren't beds locally."" Mr Dow said the charity had seen a ""huge surge"" in the number of people seeking support. ""We also saw a worrying increase in the number of people doing searches for things such as PTSD,"" he said. ""We know that, for example, lots of people in frontline healthcare delivery did experience very serious problems, and there seems to be an acute rise in the number of people experiencing PTSD."" Meanwhile in the rest of the UK, referrals have yet to go beyond pre-pandemic levels. But charities there have called for plans to be put in place before an expected surge emerges. Scottish Association of Mental Health (SAMH) chief executive said:  ""We know in Scotland, the suicide rates at deaths by suicide had increased in the two years previous to the pandemic, and we're bracing ourselves for the figures that will be announced in August which will cover some of the pandemic period."" Kevin Stewart, the Minister for Mental Wellbeing and Social Care, said the government had already allocated Â£29.2million to improve children and adolescent mental health services. A similar picture in Wales has prompted MIND Cymru to call on the Welsh Government to act. There, the Cardiff and Vale University board has seen mental health referrals increase by 47% compared to pre-Covid levels, while the Powys Teaching board has seen increases of 23%. ""What's clear is that we're dealing with a significant amount of unmet need,"" said MIND Cymru senior policy and campaigns officer Glenn Page. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it had provided an additional Â£42m this year for mental health support. In Northern Ireland, all health boards have seen referral numbers tumble since the pandemic hit, with referrals still 29% less than pre-Covid levels by January this year. A spokeswoman for the UK government's Department for Health and Social Care said: ""As we look beyond the pandemic, we remain committed to expanding and transforming mental health services in England, backed by Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-24.""

"Nando's shuts restaurants as it runs short of foodThe chain says it will lend some of its own staff to its suppliers, to help tackle delays to deliveries.","Nando's says it will lend some of its staff to its suppliers to help ""get things moving"" in the supply chain after shortages hit some of its shops. The restaurant group has had to shut around 50 outlets temporarily after apparently running short of its staple fare: peri peri chicken. Customers were quick to react online, complaining about local closures. ""The UK supply chain is having a bit of a [night]'mare right now,"" Nando's tweeted in reply. ""This is having a knock-on effect with some of our restaurants across England, Scotland and Wales."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The chain said delivery schedules meant the situation was changing rapidly and suggested customers check the website before they visit. Food and other supply chains across the UK have struggled to operate normally this summer, due to what has been dubbed the ""pingdemic"" -  staff being required to self-isolate if they have come into contact with someone with coronavirus. Staff shortages have also have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and the furlough scheme keeping some workers out of the jobs market. Dairy giant Arla had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets due to lorry driver shortages last month, leaving some supermarket shelves short of stock. Last week rival fast food chicken store KFC said some items were missing from its menus due to ""disruption"". The problem has also affected carmakers, transport operators, restaurants and pubs. Road haulage firms have been a particular pinch point because the industry was already short of qualified drivers. From this week,fully vaccinated staff no longer have to self-isolate, a rule-change the government hopes will ease the pressure on businesses running short of staff. At the same time Nando's says it is exploring an alternative solution by offering its staff to help suppliers, although it didn't say whether any had accepted the offer, or what work they would be doing. The South African chain, famous for its peri peri sauce, operates more than 400 restaurants across the UK. Nando's said the shortages were not affecting any of their outlets in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

'NHS abandoned me after I tried to kill myself'Mental health referrals across the UK have hit their highest point for two years.UK,"Katie Yelland says she felt abandoned by NHS mental health services A woman who tried to take her own life after suffering post-natal depression says she was abandoned by NHS mental health services during the pandemic. Katie Yelland, 30, relied on family support to get her through the first lockdown after services were paused. It comes as monthly mental health referrals across the UK hit their highest point in two years. Charities warned the surge was set to continue and called for action from the UK and devolved governments. The UK government says it plans to expand and transform mental health services, backed by Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-24. Ms Yelland suffered from severe post-natal depression after her son was born in August 2019. Just weeks before the first national lockdown, she tried to take her own life. Describing how her treatment stopped after lockdown was imposed, Ms Yelland said: ""Everything just kind of built up and caved in on me. Access to the services just wasn't there. ""I was just abandoned for a good number of weeks, while the new NHS system got into place. ""Once that system was finally in place, it was then an absolute minefield trying to use it and professionals didn't know how to use it. ""I was really isolated and I felt really concerned. I was really confused and became very reliant on my family. ""It opened their eyes to how much I was struggling. ""They've just seen me happy and bubbly. They hadn't seen the internal struggle that that was going on."" Prior to the pandemic, Ms Yelland was seen weekly by a community psychiatric nurse and the perinatal mental health team. She said: ""The care from the perinatal team just completely stopped. There was nothing, just here one day, gone the next, and with the community team there was nothing. I was left for a good number of weeks, with no help, just getting worse and worse."" The BBC Shared Data Unit analysed figures from 117 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) in England, and health boards across Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Around 300,000 people were referred to NHS mental health services in Great Britain in March this year, a rise of 18% from the total in February 2020, the month before the pandemic struck. The rise is driven by an increase in referrals across England.  Some CCGs, like Leeds, Redbridge and Greater Preston, have seen referrals more than double compared to pre-Covid levels. But while referrals are rising, the number of people receiving mental health treatment remains lower than pre-pandemic levels. Over the same time period, our analysis found the number of people in contact with the service had dropped by around 67,000 - a fall of 9%. Charities have suggested a combination of social distancing restrictions and a move to online treatments has reduced capacity. Taylor Simmonds completed 14 sessions of online therapy Taylor Simmonds, 20, is autistic and suffers from severe OCD. Late last year he  referred himself to NHS community mental health services after his symptoms got out of control, but found 14 weeks of remote treatment didn't help. ""I think for some people, remote treatment really doesn't work, and it can make things worse. So having some kind of flexibility is important."" Some parts of the country are treating many more people than pre-pandemic levels. The biggest increase in England was in Blackpool, one of the UK's most deprived areas, where 4,095 adults were in contact with mental health services in March this year - 87% more than pre-pandemic levels. Concerns are also growing that a spike in urgent crisis referrals suggests people are entering the system more unwell than they would have been. MIND's head of health policy Geoff Heyes said: ""Had those people been able to get support earlier, be that through community mental health services, through talking therapies in their community, they may well have not got that unwell."" Charities Rethink Mental Illness and SANE joined in calls for action. SANE chief executive Marjorie Wallace warned the leap in referral numbers could be the beginning of a mental health surge as people who were discouraged from seeking help come forward. Rethink Mental Illness deputy chief executive Brian Dow Rethink Mental Illness deputy chief executive Brian Dow said: ""If this increase in referrals is sustained, it has the potential to place the system under real pressure. ""We're already seeing signs of stretched services across the country, with people being sent miles away for care because there aren't beds locally."" Mr Dow said the charity had seen a ""huge surge"" in the number of people seeking support. ""We also saw a worrying increase in the number of people doing searches for things such as PTSD,"" he said. ""We know that, for example, lots of people in frontline healthcare delivery did experience very serious problems, and there seems to be an acute rise in the number of people experiencing PTSD."" Meanwhile in the rest of the UK, referrals have yet to go beyond pre-pandemic levels. But charities there have called for plans to be put in place before an expected surge emerges. Scottish Association of Mental Health (SAMH) chief executive said:  ""We know in Scotland, the suicide rates at deaths by suicide had increased in the two years previous to the pandemic, and we're bracing ourselves for the figures that will be announced in August which will cover some of the pandemic period."" Kevin Stewart, the Minister for Mental Wellbeing and Social Care, said the government had already allocated Â£29.2million to improve children and adolescent mental health services. A similar picture in Wales has prompted MIND Cymru to call on the Welsh Government to act. There, the Cardiff and Vale University board has seen mental health referrals increase by 47% compared to pre-Covid levels, while the Powys Teaching board has seen increases of 23%. ""What's clear is that we're dealing with a significant amount of unmet need,"" said MIND Cymru senior policy and campaigns officer Glenn Page. A Welsh Government spokesperson said it had provided an additional Â£42m this year for mental health support. In Northern Ireland, all health boards have seen referral numbers tumble since the pandemic hit, with referrals still 29% less than pre-Covid levels by January this year. A spokeswoman for the UK government's Department for Health and Social Care said: ""As we look beyond the pandemic, we remain committed to expanding and transforming mental health services in England, backed by Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-24.""

Exiled Taliban leaders return to take charge,"An intelligence briefing for the UN says the Taliban are stepping up the search for ""collaborators"" More anti-Taliban protests have taken place in several cities At least 12 people have been killed at Kabul airport since Sunday, a Taliban official says Western countries continue evacuating nationals and Afghans who worked for them Asked in an ABC TV interview if he made any mistakes with the Afghan exit, US President Biden says: ""No"" The IMF says that Afghanistan will no longer have access to its funds Edited by Toby Luckhurst We're pausing our live page coverage of developments in Afghanistan. Thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments:  You can follow the latesthere  This video can not be played Afghanistan: Child handed over Kabul airport wall as chaos continues American soldiers stand guard as Afghan people wait to board a US military aircraft to leave Afghanistan Armed US fighter jets are making passes over Kabul and the international airport as it attempts secure the evacuation of American citizens and allies from Afghanistan, the Pentagon has said. The warplanes are not making âlow passesâ, said Pentagon press secretary, John F Kirby, but only providing âoverwatchâ. âWe will use all of the tools in our arsenal to achieve the goalâ of protecting Americans, Kirby said. Some 7,000 Americans and other evacuees, including Afghan allies, have been airlifted out of the airport since Sunday.. Most Americans doubt the war in Afghanistan was worthwhile, a recent poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found. Roughly two-thirds said they did not think the two-decade war was worth fighting, as the US conducts its hasty exit. And the war has divided Americans on President Joe Biden's handling of foreign policy, with 47% of those polled saying they approve of Biden's management of international affairs. The poll was conducted on 12-16 August, amid the Taliban's capture of Kabul. Biden, who prides himself on his foreign policy experience, has stood by the US exit, saying in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that he would not acknowledge any mistakes. The Taliban is yet
to announce how it will lead Afghanistan, but a senior leader has given some
hints, according to Tolo News. Wahidullah Hashemi said a council might be formed,externalto govern the country under the authority of the Talibanâs top leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Afghan news site reports. âDiscussions havenât been conducted
on what it will be like - perhaps we will establish a council,â he says. Mullah Hibatullah
Akhundzada has led the Taliban since May 2016 and is in charge of its political, military and religious affairs. Another figure considered a
possible contender for Afghanistan's new leader is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. He co-founded the Taliban in
Afghanistan in 1994 and has been at the heart of political negotiations with the US in recent
years, heading the groupâs political office in Qatar. You can read more on the Taliban leadership here. The first Italian evacuation flight out of Kabul landed in Rome on Wednesday An Italian diplomat has spoken about the challenging conditions in which rescue operations are taking place at Kabul airport. ""We've unfortunately had to witness dramatic scenes but we have managed in conditions of absolute emergency to bring home our compatriots and some of our Afghan colleagues,"" Tommaso Claudi,told Ansa news agency,external. The first Italian evacuation flight carrying 86 people landed in Rome on Wednesday. Later two C130 planes carrying a total of 200 people lifted off from Kabul in the afternoon and evening, Italy's defence ministry said. Claudi remained in Kabul to manage the return operations on site. ""In Afghanistan we are witnessing a great humanitarian tragedy and we are all doing our utmost,"" he said. Italy's minister of defence thanked the ""more than 1,500 Italian soldiers who are carrying out, non-stop, an extraordinary job to ensure the transport of Afghan collaborators and their families"". Taliban militants have shot dead a relative of a journalist they were hunting and seriously injured another. The militants were carrying out a house-to-house search in the western city of Herat to try to find the journalist from Deutsche Welle, who now works in Germany. Other relatives managed to escape and are now on the run. ""The killing of a close relative of one of our editors by the Taliban in Herat yesterday is inconceivably tragic, and testifies to the acute danger in which all our employees and their families in Afghanistan find themselves,"" DW's director general, Peter Limbourg said. It is evident that the Taliban are already carrying out organised searches for journalists, both in Kabul and in the provinces. We are running out of time!"" The Taliban have raided the homes of at least three DW journalists in recent weeks. The news of the killing comes as a UN document said the Taliban are intensifying their hunt for people who worked for and collaborated with Nato and US forces. Reality Check The UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace claimed this morning that Labour
Leader Keir Starmer had supported the deal between the US and the Taliban last
year. The deal â secured by Donald Trump and signed in Doha, Qatar in
February 2020 â committed to the withdrawal of US and allied (including
British) troops from Afghanistan by May 2021. After his election, US President Joe Biden continued the plan
for withdrawal but with an end date of 31 August. At the time, Mr Wallace praised Mr Trumpâs deal as a âsmall but
important step towards the chance for Afghans to live in peace, free from
terrorism"". But in the past week, Mr Wallace has described the deal as
ârottenâ. He has said that just after the deal he publicly expressed that it was a
âmistakeâ, but we have yet to find a reference to this in either Parliamentary
records or news cuttings from the time. Ben Wallace, the UK's defence secretary, initially said Donald Trump's deal with the Taliban was ""rotten"" Mr Wallace said today: âI never heard from a single Labour MP when that deal was done, 18 months agoâ¦ one single criticism. In fact, Keir Starmer supported it, as did all other parties in the House of Commons.â We have found no evidence that Mr Starmer publicly supported last yearâs deal in the period after it was announced. But it should be noted he was not Labour leader then, and nor was there any debate in the Commons over the terms of the deal. In yesterdayâs debate Mr Starmer focused on the lack of planning for the withdrawal rather than saying he had opposed it and said: âNobody believes that Britain and our allies could have remained in Afghanistan indefinitely, or that Britain could have fought alone.â Mr Wallace also said this morning that he had âfelt uncomfortableâ about the Doha deal and âmade representations to the US and others at the timeâ. The mother of a soldier killed while serving in Afghanistan has insisted British troops did make a positive difference in the war-torn country. Royal Marine Jason Mackie, who lived in Oxford, died in an explosion in Helmand province in 2009. Marine Mackie's mother said the US-led intervention in the country had provided Afghans with respite from an oppressive regime. ""There was a certain amount of normality, women's rights and education was progressing"" she said. In recent days some veterans and relatives of deceased soldiers have question whether the return of the Taliban to the countrymeant 457 British soldiers had died in vain. Read more here. Vikas PandeyBBC News, Delhi The Taliban's blisteringly fast takeover of Afghanistan has stunned security and diplomacy experts worldwide. Days after the fall of Kabul, nations are hurriedly evacuating their diplomats and citizens, leaving behind two decades of work and investments. The Taliban's rout is likely to cause a significant shift in the geopolitics of South Asia, and it could be particularly testing for India, given the country's historically tense relations and borderdisputes with Pakistan and China- both are expected to play a crucial role in Afghanistan's future. Pakistan shares a porous border with Afghanistan and has long been an active player in its northern neighbour's affairs. Now China is showing an interest in playing a bigger role in Afghanistan. Foreign minister Wang Yi's meeting with senior Taliban leaders last month shows Beijing doesn't want to be a silent player anymore. This potential geopolitical realignment could ""change things upside down"", said Gautam Mukhopadhaya, India's former ambassador to Afghanistan and Syria. Read more from Vikas Many in India and Pakistan see the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan as Islamabad's win over India. But experts say that is too simplistic a view and Pakistan's hold over the Taliban has been exaggerated. Former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra told the BBC's Vikas Pandey that the Taliban did not recognise the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""Making the Taliban respect the border will be a top priority for Islamabad,"" he says. But there is no doubt that Pakistan now has better strategic reach in Afghanistan over India but they also have bigger issues to solve. And one of them is to ensure that the Tehrik-i-Taliban - the group responsible for launching attacks in Pakistan - do not get support from the Taliban in Afghanistan. Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington, says Pakistan shares a long and porous border with Afghanistan and that can cause all kinds of issues. The Taliban has released several known militants from jails and some of them could reenter Pakistan. ""So India is not likely to be the main factor for Pakistan at the moment,"" says Kugelman. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The former head of the US military has questioned President Biden's decision to withdraw American troops in the middle of Afghanistan's ""fighting season"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Admiral Mike Mullen also criticised Biden's failure to consult with US allies before withdrawing troops. ""We have had a real struggle here with respect to our relationships"" he said. ""I certainly understand how they would be both disappointed and raising questions about who we are and what we stand for"". Admiral Mullen, who oversaw the surge of US troops into Afghanistan under President Obama, noted that the US mission had some successes, including tackling the threat posed by al-Qaeda training camps, but accepted major mistakes had been made over the past 20 years. ""We got it wrong on the nation building side"" he said. ""We got it wrong with respect to the level of corruption under Karzaiâs government and Ghaniâs government, in the police and in the military and all the way up the chain and I think in great part that was the undoing of the mission.""

The Liberal leader is seeking a third term as prime minister in an autumn federal election. Canada now has massive transport aircraft on the ground in Kabul, Trudeau said, and has forces working with Afghans to get them out of the country. âThe limit, however, is not on Canadian capacity or Canadian airlifts; the limit on getting people out is the fact that the Taliban continue to block access for Afghans,â he said. This satellite image shows the traffic jams in Kabul as thousands of citizens and foreign nationals attempt to get to the airport - the last route out of Afghanistan for many. Scenes at the airport have become increasingly desperate with footage showing children being passed over walls to foreign soldiers and people trying to climb over barbed wire into the airport compound. Heavily-armed Taliban fighters now ring the airport's perimeter fence, and there are reports of shots being fired and injuries. One journalist reported seeing Taliban fighters also use sticks and rope to lash civilians. You can read more about the perilous journey to Kabul's airport here.  The government in Uganda says it is yet to decide whether it will take in 2,000 Afghan refugees, local media there is reporting. It comes after reports that the country would temporarily host them after a request made by the US. ""No decision has been made, whether they will come or not. It's a suggestion,  a proposal, discussions are going on... no substantive decision has been made,"" Daily Monitor reported Gen Jeje Odongo, from the foreign affairs committee, as saying on Thursday. He said that Uganda had been approached because it had a reputation internationally of helping people in distress. Uganda has a long history of welcoming refugees, and is currently home to around 1.3 million people. The East African nation has the largest number of refugees in any country in Africa - and the third largest in the world. President Joe Biden on Wednesday made a series of assertions about US policy in Afghanistan and the reasons behind his decision to withdraw forces from the country. But are they true? The BBC fact-checked some of his claims, comparing them with his earlier statements on Afghanistan and the situation on the ground. ""We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong"" This figure is contested, and considered by many experts to be a substantial overestimate. A recent investigation by BBC Newsnight has uncovered evidence suggesting thatthe size of the army could be low as 50,000- much lower even than the estimates of the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. ""Are we gonna continue to lose thousands of Americans to injury and death to try to unite that country?"" Overall, since US forces invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, a total of1,897 US military personnel were killed in action in Afghanistan,externaland another 415 died from non-hostile causes, according to the US official monitoring body. From a peak at the height of the conflict a decade ago, the number of US casualties in Afghanistan has fallen in recent years. The last American combat deaths in Afghanistan were in February 2020.

Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent A recent UN report said there were still strong ethnic and marital ties between the Taliban and al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda has been relatively quiet these last few years but it hasnât gone away and now it is celebrating the return of the Taliban to power as a historic event and the start of forthcoming victories. Its branch in Yemen â Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula â once considered the most dangerous, has praised the Taliban as ""an honourable and loyal group"". This may not be what the Taliban leadership wants to hear publicly as they have promised to cut their ties to the proscribed terrorist organisation that used Afghanistan to plan the 9/11 attacks 20 years ago. There are currently estimated to be several hundred al-Qaeda militants in the country, some of whom have been reportedly sighted amidst the Talibanâs ranks. A recent UN report stated there were still strong ethnic and marital ties between the two groups. Without a Western military presence in Afghanistan, or a cooperative local intelligence service, it will now be much harder to identify and intercept al-Qaedaâs activities, especially in remote, rugged areas like Kunar province. Elsewhere in the world, al-Qaedaâs affiliates in East and West Africa have been steadily recruiting. They will have had a significant morale boost from what al-Qaeda sees as a humiliating defeat for the West. Read Frank Gardner's piece on foreign fighters in Afghanistan here BBC OS The BBC spoke with two interpreters who are still in the country Two interpreters who are still stuck in Afghanistan have explained how they fear for their lives under Taliban rule. Jay and Marwa have worked with foreign troops and government aid agencies, and spoke to BBC OS on World Service radio. ""I am still in shock, the shock of losing everything. I am not living anymore,"" Marwa said. ""I didn't have a plan to get a visa or get out. I had planned to stay here in my country to work for my people."" Marwa added that one of her former colleagues was killed two months ago and was warned by colleagues that things were getting worse. ""I had this passion to stay here and now I see how cruel people like the Taliban are,"" she added. ""The Taliban have searched my own house, they have messaged me, they have told me that I am the leader of the enemies of the Taliban,"" Jay said. ""They have seized my house, I'm not going to go there again, but it's not enough for them. They're looking for my life and the life of my family and that's exactly what they will be doing with every ally of the international forces.""

Turkey President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday urged Europe's leaders to take responsibility for the migrants now fleeing Afghanistan. Turkey has no intention of becoming ""Europe's migrant storage unit"", in the face of the ongoing chaos, he said, according to Reuters news agency. Since the Taliban's takeover this past weekend, tens of thousands of Afghans have scrambled to evacuate. Many have crossed into Turkey, according to migrant aid groups and state media. Turkey is home to some 4 million refugees, the majority of them Syrians who fled their country's civil war.The UN estimates,externalTurkey currently hosts the most refugees of any country worldwide. Now, somewhere between 500 and 2,000 Afghans are estimated to arrive in Turkey every day. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdogan also said that Turkey could engage in discussions with a Taliban-led government in Afghanistan regarding their ""common agendas"". Ned Price said the US is trying to process enough people as they possibly can Ned Price, spokesman for the US Department of State, is currently giving an update on the situation in Afghanistan. He said that the US is continuing to deploy additional consular officers to help evacuate people, including sending teams to Qatar and Kuwait. Price added that there are currently 6,000 people at Kabul airport that have been fully processed and are waiting to board planes out of the country. Some 20 flights are set to leave on Thursday evening. He said that the US has ""significantly expanded"" how many American citizens, locally employed staff and special immigrant visa applications are eligible to leave Afghanistan. Asked about those unable to reach the airport, Price said the state department had seen reports of ""congestion"" getting to the airport. ""We are doing everything we can,"" he said, adding that the US has made it clear to the Taliban that ""safe passage should be guaranteed for all of those who wish to transit to the airport"". Thursday marks the 102nd anniversary of Afghanistan's independence, and small numbers of Afghans took to the streets waving their national flag in protest against the Taliban. The militants have been replacing the black, red and green national flag with their own white one. There were reports of casualties at a similar protest in Asadabad in the east of the country on Thursday, and three people were reported killed after shots were fired at a protest in the city of Jalalabad on Wednesday.

Snake surprises shopper at Sydney supermarket,"This video can not be played Snake emerges from Australian supermarket shelf A grocery run turned into a snake rescue for an Australian woman when she was greeted by a python poking out from a supermarket shelf. Helaina Alati, 25, was at a Sydney store on Monday when the 3m non-venomous snake slithered out. The Woolworths supermarket lies on the edge of a large expanse of bushland on the city's north- west outskirts. But encountering a snake in the spice aisle is not what Ms Alati expected. Fortunately for both parties, Ms Alati is a wildlife rescuer and familiar with snakes. ""I just turned my head and he was about 20cm from my face, just looking straight at me,"" she told the BBC. She did a double-take but remained calm. No one else was around. Recognising it instantly as a diamond python, Ms Alati knew it wasn't venomous as it protruded and flicked its tongue. ""He was looking straight at me the whole time, almost like he was saying: 'Can you take me outside please?'"" she said. Helaina Alati says she alerted staff to the ""10ft python in the shop"" After filming the snake, Ms Alati alerted staff and said she could help them get it out. She retrieved a snake bag from her home, returned to the store, ""tapped him on the tail and he just slithered in"". She then released it away from houses in bushland - a natural habitat for the species around Sydney. A trained snake handler, Ms Alati has conducted at least 20 snake rescues before. She says her friends have previously joked about her being ""the snake girl"", referencing a zoo scene in a Harry Potter film where the boy wizard finds that he can talk to snakes. Ms Alati says she can't speak Parseltongue like Harry, but ""that scene's been mentioned to me a few times"". ""They kind of just gravitate to me, like maybe they just sense that I'm the kind of person into caring and protecting animals,"" she said. Wallaby hops across Sydney Harbour Bridge Kangaroo smashes way into Australian home ""To be honest, it's the most exciting thing that's happened in a little while given lockdown. The staff were all taking photos of it."" Australia's largest city has been in a lockdown since June to fight a Delta outbreak. Grocery shopping is one of the few reasons people are allowed to leave their homes. Ms Alati said she suspected the snake had been in the shop overnight, probably initially in the ceiling where diamond pythons like to nestle. It had probably lurked on the shelf all morning as ""dozens of people... passed it and grabbed spices"", she added.

Price rises ease amid clothes and shoe discounting,"The UK inflation rate fell to 2% in the year to July as the economy continued to reopen from Covid-19 restrictions. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation dipped from 2.5% in the year to June, the highest level for nearly three years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The rate fell to the Bank of England's 2% inflation target, after being higher for two months in a row. The dip in inflation was driven by price falls in clothing and footwear. Prices of games, toys and hobbies were also down and package holidays fell slightly compared with a year ago. However, those decreases were ""largely offset"" by price rises in transport, the ONS said. Average petrol prices stood at 132.6p per litre in July 2021, compared with 111.4p per litre a year earlier. The latest price is the highest recorded since September 2013. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were expecting the annual inflation to decrease a little, but added the size of the fall was a ""a bit of a surprise"". ""Today's figure puts the brakes on those who argue that inflation is about to go out of control, but there are reasons to think it does go up further later in the year,"" she said. Ms Martins said the reasons for the dip in inflation were ""quite broad based"", but added the main contributors were ""good sales"" in the clothing shops over the summer, as well as a year-on-year fall in the prices of computer games and food. However, she said there were still expectations that inflation would rise later this year. The temporary VAT cut is going to be removed for hospitality, we've got some inflationary big energy bill hikes coming. ""So we do think inflation could go up towards the end of the year and then come back down again around the turn of the year and into next year."" Regulator Ofgem has said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs, with typical gas and electricity bills likely to rise by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. July's CPI figure was below most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 2.3%. Though falls in the price of clothes drove down the inflation, it was partially offset by recent rises in second-hand car prices, the ONS said. Second-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in the last few months as a result of a delays in the supply of new cars, caused by the shortage of semiconductor chips used in their production. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said usually, a seasonal jump in transport prices was countered by a big drop in clothing prices. ""Stepping back from the detail, the big picture is that July's drop in CPI inflation will be short-lived,"" he said.""The  headline rate will rise to nearly 4% by the end of this year."" However, Mr Tombs said with energy prices ""unlikely to soar indefinitely"", and wage growth to be dampened when the furlough scheme ends, inflation would return to 2% by the end of 2022. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the rate dip ""masks the strength of inflationary pressures currently within the UK economy"". ""We expect inflation to accelerate further during the rest of this year, rising significantly above the Bank of England's 2% target, as supply chains remain under strain faced with a strong rebound in demand,"" she added. The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, increased to 3.8%. The number in July is typically used to calculate rises in regulated rail fares. However, the government said no decision had been made on national fares, with a spokesman stating it is ""considering a variety of options"". As the economy reopens, economic figures are disco-dancing in seemingly random directions. Inflation came in lower than expected, bang on the Bank of England's target of 2%, thanks to a fall in the price of clothing. But some of the comparisons reflect last year's reopening trends, for example in July 2020 clothes prices did not fall, as is usual during the sales. Some prices are difficult to calculate, such as package holidays. Other prices are still surging, such as the used car market, when in July the 12-month inflation rate was 14%, reflecting shortages of new cars due to difficulties in semiconductor production. Petrol prices are well up on a year ago too. So the broad story is that this is a pause for breath as inflation marches towards 4% this year. But the fact it has dipped provides more support for the majority of Bank of England decision makers on the Monetary Policy Committee who believe that the anticipated rise will be temporary and does not need an immediate response, in order to contain it.

Thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments:  You can follow the latesthere  This video can not be played Afghanistan: Child handed over Kabul airport wall as chaos continues American soldiers stand guard as Afghan people wait to board a US military aircraft to leave Afghanistan Armed US fighter jets are making passes over Kabul and the international airport as it attempts secure the evacuation of American citizens and allies from Afghanistan, the Pentagon has said. The warplanes are not making âlow passesâ, said Pentagon press secretary, John F Kirby, but only providing âoverwatchâ. âWe will use all of the tools in our arsenal to achieve the goalâ of protecting Americans, Kirby said. Some 7,000 Americans and other evacuees, including Afghan allies, have been airlifted out of the airport since Sunday.. Most Americans doubt the war in Afghanistan was worthwhile, a recent poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found. Roughly two-thirds said they did not think the two-decade war was worth fighting, as the US conducts its hasty exit. And the war has divided Americans on President Joe Biden's handling of foreign policy, with 47% of those polled saying they approve of Biden's management of international affairs. The poll was conducted on 12-16 August, amid the Taliban's capture of Kabul. Biden, who prides himself on his foreign policy experience, has stood by the US exit, saying in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that he would not acknowledge any mistakes. The Taliban is yet
to announce how it will lead Afghanistan, but a senior leader has given some
hints, according to Tolo News. Wahidullah Hashemi said a council might be formed,externalto govern the country under the authority of the Talibanâs top leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Afghan news site reports. âDiscussions havenât been conducted
on what it will be like - perhaps we will establish a council,â he says. Mullah Hibatullah
Akhundzada has led the Taliban since May 2016 and is in charge of its political, military and religious affairs. Another figure considered a
possible contender for Afghanistan's new leader is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. He co-founded the Taliban in
Afghanistan in 1994 and has been at the heart of political negotiations with the US in recent
years, heading the groupâs political office in Qatar. You can read more on the Taliban leadership here. The first Italian evacuation flight out of Kabul landed in Rome on Wednesday An Italian diplomat has spoken about the challenging conditions in which rescue operations are taking place at Kabul airport. ""We've unfortunately had to witness dramatic scenes but we have managed in conditions of absolute emergency to bring home our compatriots and some of our Afghan colleagues,"" Tommaso Claudi,told Ansa news agency,external. The first Italian evacuation flight carrying 86 people landed in Rome on Wednesday. Later two C130 planes carrying a total of 200 people lifted off from Kabul in the afternoon and evening, Italy's defence ministry said. Claudi remained in Kabul to manage the return operations on site. ""In Afghanistan we are witnessing a great humanitarian tragedy and we are all doing our utmost,"" he said. Italy's minister of defence thanked the ""more than 1,500 Italian soldiers who are carrying out, non-stop, an extraordinary job to ensure the transport of Afghan collaborators and their families"". Taliban militants have shot dead a relative of a journalist they were hunting and seriously injured another. The militants were carrying out a house-to-house search in the western city of Herat to try to find the journalist from Deutsche Welle, who now works in Germany. Other relatives managed to escape and are now on the run. ""The killing of a close relative of one of our editors by the Taliban in Herat yesterday is inconceivably tragic, and testifies to the acute danger in which all our employees and their families in Afghanistan find themselves,"" DW's director general, Peter Limbourg said. It is evident that the Taliban are already carrying out organised searches for journalists, both in Kabul and in the provinces. We are running out of time!"" The Taliban have raided the homes of at least three DW journalists in recent weeks. The news of the killing comes as a UN document said the Taliban are intensifying their hunt for people who worked for and collaborated with Nato and US forces. Reality Check The UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace claimed this morning that Labour
Leader Keir Starmer had supported the deal between the US and the Taliban last
year. The deal â secured by Donald Trump and signed in Doha, Qatar in
February 2020 â committed to the withdrawal of US and allied (including
British) troops from Afghanistan by May 2021. After his election, US President Joe Biden continued the plan
for withdrawal but with an end date of 31 August. At the time, Mr Wallace praised Mr Trumpâs deal as a âsmall but
important step towards the chance for Afghans to live in peace, free from
terrorism"". But in the past week, Mr Wallace has described the deal as
ârottenâ. He has said that just after the deal he publicly expressed that it was a
âmistakeâ, but we have yet to find a reference to this in either Parliamentary
records or news cuttings from the time. Ben Wallace, the UK's defence secretary, initially said Donald Trump's deal with the Taliban was ""rotten"" Mr Wallace said today: âI never heard from a single Labour MP when that deal was done, 18 months agoâ¦ one single criticism. In fact, Keir Starmer supported it, as did all other parties in the House of Commons.â We have found no evidence that Mr Starmer publicly supported last yearâs deal in the period after it was announced. But it should be noted he was not Labour leader then, and nor was there any debate in the Commons over the terms of the deal. In yesterdayâs debate Mr Starmer focused on the lack of planning for the withdrawal rather than saying he had opposed it and said: âNobody believes that Britain and our allies could have remained in Afghanistan indefinitely, or that Britain could have fought alone.â Mr Wallace also said this morning that he had âfelt uncomfortableâ about the Doha deal and âmade representations to the US and others at the timeâ. The mother of a soldier killed while serving in Afghanistan has insisted British troops did make a positive difference in the war-torn country. Royal Marine Jason Mackie, who lived in Oxford, died in an explosion in Helmand province in 2009. Marine Mackie's mother said the US-led intervention in the country had provided Afghans with respite from an oppressive regime. ""There was a certain amount of normality, women's rights and education was progressing"" she said. In recent days some veterans and relatives of deceased soldiers have question whether the return of the Taliban to the countrymeant 457 British soldiers had died in vain. Read more here. Vikas PandeyBBC News, Delhi The Taliban's blisteringly fast takeover of Afghanistan has stunned security and diplomacy experts worldwide. Days after the fall of Kabul, nations are hurriedly evacuating their diplomats and citizens, leaving behind two decades of work and investments. The Taliban's rout is likely to cause a significant shift in the geopolitics of South Asia, and it could be particularly testing for India, given the country's historically tense relations and borderdisputes with Pakistan and China- both are expected to play a crucial role in Afghanistan's future. Pakistan shares a porous border with Afghanistan and has long been an active player in its northern neighbour's affairs. Now China is showing an interest in playing a bigger role in Afghanistan. Foreign minister Wang Yi's meeting with senior Taliban leaders last month shows Beijing doesn't want to be a silent player anymore. This potential geopolitical realignment could ""change things upside down"", said Gautam Mukhopadhaya, India's former ambassador to Afghanistan and Syria. Read more from Vikas Many in India and Pakistan see the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan as Islamabad's win over India. But experts say that is too simplistic a view and Pakistan's hold over the Taliban has been exaggerated. Former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra told the BBC's Vikas Pandey that the Taliban did not recognise the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""Making the Taliban respect the border will be a top priority for Islamabad,"" he says. But there is no doubt that Pakistan now has better strategic reach in Afghanistan over India but they also have bigger issues to solve. And one of them is to ensure that the Tehrik-i-Taliban - the group responsible for launching attacks in Pakistan - do not get support from the Taliban in Afghanistan. Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington, says Pakistan shares a long and porous border with Afghanistan and that can cause all kinds of issues. The Taliban has released several known militants from jails and some of them could reenter Pakistan. ""So India is not likely to be the main factor for Pakistan at the moment,"" says Kugelman. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The former head of the US military has questioned President Biden's decision to withdraw American troops in the middle of Afghanistan's ""fighting season"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Admiral Mike Mullen also criticised Biden's failure to consult with US allies before withdrawing troops. ""We have had a real struggle here with respect to our relationships"" he said. ""I certainly understand how they would be both disappointed and raising questions about who we are and what we stand for"". Admiral Mullen, who oversaw the surge of US troops into Afghanistan under President Obama, noted that the US mission had some successes, including tackling the threat posed by al-Qaeda training camps, but accepted major mistakes had been made over the past 20 years. ""We got it wrong on the nation building side"" he said. ""We got it wrong with respect to the level of corruption under Karzaiâs government and Ghaniâs government, in the police and in the military and all the way up the chain and I think in great part that was the undoing of the mission.""

The Liberal leader is seeking a third term as prime minister in an autumn federal election. Canada now has massive transport aircraft on the ground in Kabul, Trudeau said, and has forces working with Afghans to get them out of the country. âThe limit, however, is not on Canadian capacity or Canadian airlifts; the limit on getting people out is the fact that the Taliban continue to block access for Afghans,â he said. This satellite image shows the traffic jams in Kabul as thousands of citizens and foreign nationals attempt to get to the airport - the last route out of Afghanistan for many. Scenes at the airport have become increasingly desperate with footage showing children being passed over walls to foreign soldiers and people trying to climb over barbed wire into the airport compound. Heavily-armed Taliban fighters now ring the airport's perimeter fence, and there are reports of shots being fired and injuries. One journalist reported seeing Taliban fighters also use sticks and rope to lash civilians. You can read more about the perilous journey to Kabul's airport here.  The government in Uganda says it is yet to decide whether it will take in 2,000 Afghan refugees, local media there is reporting. It comes after reports that the country would temporarily host them after a request made by the US. ""No decision has been made, whether they will come or not. It's a suggestion,  a proposal, discussions are going on... no substantive decision has been made,"" Daily Monitor reported Gen Jeje Odongo, from the foreign affairs committee, as saying on Thursday. He said that Uganda had been approached because it had a reputation internationally of helping people in distress. Uganda has a long history of welcoming refugees, and is currently home to around 1.3 million people. The East African nation has the largest number of refugees in any country in Africa - and the third largest in the world. President Joe Biden on Wednesday made a series of assertions about US policy in Afghanistan and the reasons behind his decision to withdraw forces from the country. But are they true? The BBC fact-checked some of his claims, comparing them with his earlier statements on Afghanistan and the situation on the ground. ""We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong"" This figure is contested, and considered by many experts to be a substantial overestimate. A recent investigation by BBC Newsnight has uncovered evidence suggesting thatthe size of the army could be low as 50,000- much lower even than the estimates of the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. ""Are we gonna continue to lose thousands of Americans to injury and death to try to unite that country?"" Overall, since US forces invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, a total of1,897 US military personnel were killed in action in Afghanistan,externaland another 415 died from non-hostile causes, according to the US official monitoring body. From a peak at the height of the conflict a decade ago, the number of US casualties in Afghanistan has fallen in recent years. The last American combat deaths in Afghanistan were in February 2020.

Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent A recent UN report said there were still strong ethnic and marital ties between the Taliban and al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda has been relatively quiet these last few years but it hasnât gone away and now it is celebrating the return of the Taliban to power as a historic event and the start of forthcoming victories. Its branch in Yemen â Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula â once considered the most dangerous, has praised the Taliban as ""an honourable and loyal group"". This may not be what the Taliban leadership wants to hear publicly as they have promised to cut their ties to the proscribed terrorist organisation that used Afghanistan to plan the 9/11 attacks 20 years ago. There are currently estimated to be several hundred al-Qaeda militants in the country, some of whom have been reportedly sighted amidst the Talibanâs ranks. A recent UN report stated there were still strong ethnic and marital ties between the two groups. Without a Western military presence in Afghanistan, or a cooperative local intelligence service, it will now be much harder to identify and intercept al-Qaedaâs activities, especially in remote, rugged areas like Kunar province. Elsewhere in the world, al-Qaedaâs affiliates in East and West Africa have been steadily recruiting. They will have had a significant morale boost from what al-Qaeda sees as a humiliating defeat for the West. Read Frank Gardner's piece on foreign fighters in Afghanistan here BBC OS The BBC spoke with two interpreters who are still in the country Two interpreters who are still stuck in Afghanistan have explained how they fear for their lives under Taliban rule. Jay and Marwa have worked with foreign troops and government aid agencies, and spoke to BBC OS on World Service radio. ""I am still in shock, the shock of losing everything. I am not living anymore,"" Marwa said. ""I didn't have a plan to get a visa or get out. I had planned to stay here in my country to work for my people."" Marwa added that one of her former colleagues was killed two months ago and was warned by colleagues that things were getting worse. ""I had this passion to stay here and now I see how cruel people like the Taliban are,"" she added.

Turkey President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday urged Europe's leaders to take responsibility for the migrants now fleeing Afghanistan. Turkey has no intention of becoming ""Europe's migrant storage unit"", in the face of the ongoing chaos, he said, according to Reuters news agency. Since the Taliban's takeover this past weekend, tens of thousands of Afghans have scrambled to evacuate. Many have crossed into Turkey, according to migrant aid groups and state media. Turkey is home to some 4 million refugees, the majority of them Syrians who fled their country's civil war.The UN estimates,externalTurkey currently hosts the most refugees of any country worldwide. Now, somewhere between 500 and 2,000 Afghans are estimated to arrive in Turkey every day. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdogan also said that Turkey could engage in discussions with a Taliban-led government in Afghanistan regarding their ""common agendas"". Ned Price said the US is trying to process enough people as they possibly can Ned Price, spokesman for the US Department of State, is currently giving an update on the situation in Afghanistan. He said that the US is continuing to deploy additional consular officers to help evacuate people, including sending teams to Qatar and Kuwait. Price added that there are currently 6,000 people at Kabul airport that have been fully processed and are waiting to board planes out of the country. Some 20 flights are set to leave on Thursday evening. He said that the US has ""significantly expanded"" how many American citizens, locally employed staff and special immigrant visa applications are eligible to leave Afghanistan. Asked about those unable to reach the airport, Price said the state department had seen reports of ""congestion"" getting to the airport. ""We are doing everything we can,"" he said, adding that the US has made it clear to the Taliban that ""safe passage should be guaranteed for all of those who wish to transit to the airport"". Thursday marks the 102nd anniversary of Afghanistan's independence, and small numbers of Afghans took to the streets waving their national flag in protest against the Taliban. The militants have been replacing the black, red and green national flag with their own white one. There were reports of casualties at a similar protest in Asadabad in the east of the country on Thursday, and three people were reported killed after shots were fired at a protest in the city of Jalalabad on Wednesday.

The Afghan debacle's impact on US allies and rivalsMystery Taliban spokesman finally reveals faceEx-marine: I'm not leaving Kabul without my staff'Sunday was the most horrible day in my entire life',"The Biden administration's rush for the exit in Afghanistan has been accompanied by a similar rush to judgement among pundits and commentators who, by and large, have castigated the US president for a decision that many see as unnecessary and a betrayal, both of those who served in Afghanistan and of the Afghan people themselves. The heartbreaking images from the airport in Kabul only reinforce this message. And there is justifiably a good deal of emotion to go round. The West has invested a lot of blood, time and money in Afghanistan. The Afghan people, much, much, more. It is hard to argue with the criticism of the Biden administration's precipitate departure. Afghanistan may indeed be un-salvageable, its governing structures too unrepresentative and corrupt. This though only underscores the argument that Afghanistan was not ""lost"" in the past two years but during the previous 20. Nonetheless the decision to cut and run is being seen as a terrible blow to US credibility - to its reliability as a partner, and indeed to its moral standing in world affairs. How does this square with Mr Biden's clarion cry on taking office, that America was back? Comparisons are being made with Vietnam- the similarities with helicopters shuttling US nationals away from a falling city being too much for the newspaper front-pages to resist. But in reality - despite the superficial similarities -there are some important differences, too. South Vietnam collapsed some two years after US troops left. Indeed it looks as though the Americans expected their Afghan allies to soldier on for a significant period without them. The US was humbled by Vietnam - its population deeply divided and its military morale damaged. But while Vietnam turned out to be a tragic side-show in the Cold War, the US still ultimately won that contest. Nato was not weakened. US allies around the globe did not shy away from expecting US support. The US remained the pre-eminent superpower. Afghanistan is altogether different. Internal divisions in the US over this conflict have in no way been comparable to Vietnam's. The Afghanistan mission was certainly unpopular at home but there were no mass rallies against it. This video can not be played Joe Biden: 'I stand squarely behind my decision' Crucially though, today's international context is dramatically different from that of the 1970s. The US - indeed the West in general - is engaged in multiple contests, in few of which they are outright winners. The Afghan collapse is potentially a disaster in the so-called war on terror. But in the wider conflict between democracy and authoritarianism, Washington's failure can only be seen as a serious set-back. There will be smiles in Moscow and Beijing, at least for now. The Western model of liberal interventionism - promoted as a means of spreading democracy and the rule of law - has perhaps been tested to destruction in Afghanistan. One cannot see much enthusiasm for similar undertakings in the future. Those of Washington's allies who joined in the Afghanistan project are smarting. They feel badly let down. Even British ministers, jealous of their oft touted ""special relationship"" with Washington, have been openly critical of President Biden's decision. Ten days that shook Afghanistan Biden's speech on Afghanistan fact-checked And for America's European allies in general, it underscores how dependent they are upon the US and how little their views count once the White House decides to go in one particular direction. So bad news for the West. But how long-lasting will be the smiles in Beijing, Moscow and even Islamabad? It was Pakistan that nurtured and gave safe haven to the Taliban for its own geo-strategic purposes. But if renewed Taliban rule produces a simple turning back of the clock - if international terrorism finds a renewed haven - then Pakistan may find that the growing turbulence in the region has decidedly negative consequences. China is happy to see the US failure. Indeed, if Mr Biden's reason to pull out from Afghanistan was due to his desire to re-focus US national power to rival a rising China, then this step has simply given China an opportunity to expand its own influence in Afghanistan and beyond. China, though, must have concern, too. Its shares a short border with Afghanistan.It is actively persecuting its own Muslim minorityand must be concerned at the possibility that anti-Beijing Islamist terrorists might seek to use Afghanistan as a base. No wonder then that Chinese diplomacy over recent weeks has been so eager to court the Taliban. Russia, too, must have worries about the return of instability and terrorism. Maybe it feels a little better about itself now that the US has similarly been humbled by Afghan tribal fighters, just as the Soviet Union was in the late-1980s. How America watched as Taliban won the war Taliban return raises fears of Afghan haven for terror But its chief interest is the security of a large part of Central Asia, many of whose states are allies of Moscow. This summer Russia moved tanks to the Tajikistan-Afghan frontier for exercises intended to demonstrate its determination to prevent any spill-over from an Afghan collapse. So in the short-term, the Afghan debacle certainly benefits the West's opponents. But their attitudes were not going to change anyway. What really matters are the ramifications among Washington's allies. What will they take away from the Afghan experience? Beyond the immediate crisis, will the NATO countries, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea or Japan see the US as a less reliable partner? If they do, then Mr Biden's decision to quit Afghanistan will prove fateful, indeed. Why is Kabul being compared to the fall of Saigon?

Price rises slow down driven by clothes discounts,"The UK inflation rate fell to 2% in the year to July as the economy continued to reopen from Covid-19 restrictions. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation dipped from 2.5% in the year to June, the highest level for nearly three years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The rate fell to the Bank of England's 2% inflation target, after being higher for two months in a row. The dip in inflation was driven by price falls in clothing and footwear. Prices of games, toys and hobbies were also down and package holidays fell slightly compared with a year ago. However, those decreases were ""largely offset"" by price rises in transport, the ONS said. Average petrol prices stood at 132.6p per litre in July 2021, compared with 111.4p per litre a year earlier. The latest price is the highest recorded since September 2013. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that experts were expecting the annual inflation to decrease a little, but added the size of the fall was a ""a bit of a surprise"". ""Today's figure puts the brakes on those who argue that inflation is about to go out of control, but there are reasons to think it does go up further later in the year,"" she said. Ms Martins said the reasons for the dip in inflation were ""quite broad based"", but added the main contributors were ""good sales"" in the clothing shops over the summer, as well as a year-on-year fall in the prices of computer games and food. However, she said there were still expectations that inflation would rise later this year. The temporary VAT cut is going to be removed for hospitality, we've got some inflationary big energy bill hikes coming. ""So we do think inflation could go up towards the end of the year and then come back down again around the turn of the year and into next year."" Regulator Ofgem has said the price cap for default domestic energy deals would be raised to cover suppliers' extra costs, with typical gas and electricity bills likely to rise by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. July's CPI figure was below most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 2.3%. Though falls in the price of clothes drove down the inflation, it was partially offset by recent rises in second-hand car prices, the ONS said. Second-hand car sales in the UK have more than doubled in the last few months as a result of a delays in the supply of new cars, caused by the shortage of semiconductor chips used in their production. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said usually, a seasonal jump in transport prices was countered by a big drop in clothing prices. ""Stepping back from the detail, the big picture is that July's drop in CPI inflation will be short-lived,"" he said.""The  headline rate will rise to nearly 4% by the end of this year."" However, Mr Tombs said with energy prices ""unlikely to soar indefinitely"", and wage growth to be dampened when the furlough scheme ends, inflation would return to 2% by the end of 2022. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the rate dip ""masks the strength of inflationary pressures currently within the UK economy"". ""We expect inflation to accelerate further during the rest of this year, rising significantly above the Bank of England's 2% target, as supply chains remain under strain faced with a strong rebound in demand,"" she added. The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, increased to 3.8%. The number in July is typically used to calculate rises in regulated rail fares. However, the government said no decision had been made on national fares, with a spokesman stating it is ""considering a variety of options"". As the economy reopens, economic figures are disco-dancing in seemingly random directions. Inflation came in lower than expected, bang on the Bank of England's target of 2%, thanks to a fall in the price of clothing. But some of the comparisons reflect last year's reopening trends, for example in July 2020 clothes prices did not fall, as is usual during the sales. Some prices are difficult to calculate, such as package holidays. Other prices are still surging, such as the used car market, when in July the 12-month inflation rate was 14%, reflecting shortages of new cars due to difficulties in semiconductor production. Petrol prices are well up on a year ago too. So the broad story is that this is a pause for breath as inflation marches towards 4% this year. But the fact it has dipped provides more support for the majority of Bank of England decision makers on the Monetary Policy Committee who believe that the anticipated rise will be temporary and does not need an immediate response, in order to contain it.

'Colleges need extra Â£570m due to rise in students'The IFS says England's colleges and sixth forms need extra funds to keep pace with student numbers.Family & Education,"Record numbers of GCSE passes mean extra pressure on sixth forms Colleges and sixth forms in England need an extra Â£570m to keep pace with the rising number of students, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The rise in numbers of older teenagers, and higher GCSE grades, is set to push up college numbers. The IFS says funding for 16-to-18 learning fell in real terms by 11% in colleges and 25% in schools since 2010. The government says it has announced an extra Â£291m for 2021-22 in addition to a Â£400m increase in the previous year. The IFS research says further education colleges and sixth forms in England have seen the largest falls in funding in the education sector over the past decade. Colleges' financial health 'fragile', say auditors Universities and colleges 'face cash shortfalls' Imran Tahir, research economist and co-author, said: ""These institutions now also face a plethora of additional challenges created by fast rises in student numbers and the need to help pupils catch up on lost learning."" The government gave the sector an extra Â£400m in 2020-21, a sum it described as ""the single biggest annual uplift since 2010"". But the IFS says with student numbers growing by 5% in 2020 alone, this restores funding back to 2018-19 levels, at best. The IFS calculates that an extra Â£570m will be needed in the 2022-23 academic year, just to keep funding per student at the level it was the previous year. Colleges and sixth forms will need even more money if they are to respond to the major long-term challenges they face, it says. These include helping students catch up on months of learning lost during the pandemic, and a projected rise in the number of 16 and 17-year-olds of 17% or 200,000 in England between 2019 and 2024. The researchers point out that the rate of 16 and 17-year-olds in full-time education had already risen to an historical high of 85% in 2020. This includes especially large rises in 2020 due to ""abnormally"" high GCSE results and reduced opportunities outside education during the pandemic, they say. Given that GCSE results were higher again in 2021, the researchers suggest there is likely to be a further jump in students. At the same time, the number of 16 and 17-year-olds doing apprenticeships fell to an all-time low of 3% in 2020 - with a 30% fall in numbers in 2020 alone. This reflects both the effects of the pandemic and a gradual reduction in take-up over the long term, according to the research. The chief executive of the Association of Colleges, David Hughes, said: ""There is an urgent need for the Department for Education to guarantee full funding for every student recruited by schools and colleges this autumn, much the same way they do for universities as well as seek a commitment in the Spending Review to a longer-term revenue and capital budget that anticipates demographic trends."" A Department for Education spokesman said:""Further education is playing a vital role in delivering the skills young people need to get ahead. So we can meet the needs of all 16-19-year-olds we've announced an extra Â£291m for 2021-22, in addition to the Â£400m increase in 2020-21. ""Funding for future years beyond 2021-22, including anticipated increases in the 16-19 population will be considered as part of the upcoming Spending Review.""
