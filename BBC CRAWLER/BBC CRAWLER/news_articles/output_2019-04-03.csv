Corbyn target film 'totally unacceptable',"This video can not be played Four soldiers appear to fire shots in a video posted on social media A video showing soldiers firing at a Jeremy Corbyn poster for target practice demonstrated a serious error of judgment, an Army chief has said. Brigadier Nick Perry said the Army was taking the matter ""extremely seriously"" and would fully investigate. ""The video shows totally unacceptable behaviour that falls far below the behaviour that we expect,"" he said. Labour leader Mr Corbyn said he was ""shocked"" by the clip; his party said it had confidence in the investigation. Mr Corbyn added: ""I hope the Ministry of Defence will conduct an inquiry into it and find out what was going on and who did that."" The short clip shows four paratroopers in uniform firing down the range before the camera pans to the target, a large portrait of the Labour leader. Brig Perry, commander of 16 Air Assault Brigade, said there were currently 400 soldiers from his brigade working with Nato and Afghan partners in Afghanistan, where the footage is thought to have been filmed. He said they were doing an ""outstanding job in theatre"" but this incident would be fully investigated. He stressed the Army was, and always would be, an apolitical organisation. The prime minister's official spokesperson said Theresa May was aware of the video but had not watched it, and had called it ""clearly unacceptable"". Defence secretary Gavin Williamson said he commends ""the prompt and clear leadership shown by the Army in investigating this troubling video"". Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, a former lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the video was ""disgraceful"". Rory Stewart, Conservative minister for prisons, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire that it was ""completely wrong"" and the soldiers' behaviour was ""outrageous"". ""They should not be political - they are there to defend the country and the Queen,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The emergence of the video comes at a time of heightened alarm about the safety of MPs as tensions rise over Brexit. Labour said the footage was ""alarming and unacceptable"". Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted: ""This is absolutely hideous and irresponsible under this or any climate."" And Angela Rayner, Labour's shadow education secretary, said she hoped the investigation would be conducted ""thoroughly and the conclusions made public"". It is not known when the footage was filmed. It is believed the clip first circulated on Snapchat before being posted on Twitter.

"Don't inflame Brexit tensions, police warn","Police lined up outside the House of Commons in Parliament Square Politicians and campaigners should take care not to ""inflame"" tensions in the UK caused by Brexit, a senior police chief has warned. Chairman of the National Police Chief Council (NPCC), Martin Hewitt, said people should think carefully to avoid inciting others to violence. Police have 10,000 officers ready to deploy at 24 hours' notice as part of possible no-deal Brexit preparations. However, police chiefs said the measures were only a precaution. Mr Hewitt said the NPCC was preparing for the ""worst case scenario"" and was not predicting major problems.

What preparations are being made for a no-deal? Brexit: A really simple guide The warnings follow increased concern about intimidation of MPs. Mr Hewitt said the UK was in ""an incredibly febrile atmosphere"" as a result of the debate over leaving the EU and there was a lot of ""angry talk"" on social media. He said: ""I think there is a responsibility on those individuals that have a platform and have a voice to communicate in a way that is temperate and is not in any way going to inflame people's views."" Officers in charge of policing Parliament said they had seen an increase in abuse aimed at politicians and several MPs have requested increased security. Only a small number of crimes have been linked directly to Brexit, police said, with about half being malicious communications, while the rest included verbal abuse, harassment and offences committed during protests. But hate crimes remain higher than before the 2016 EU referendum. In 2017-18, there were 94,098 hate crimes recorded, a 17% rise that is thought to have also been fuelled by the terror attacks in London and Manchester.

The young animal has now been given a new home at ZSL London Zoo, where scientists hope to eventually establish a breeding programme. The animals, which are the largest amphibians in the world, were once widespread across China. But a recent survey found barely any of them left in the wild. Dr Helen Meredith of the Amphibian Survival Alliance and Synchronicity Earth told the BBC's Rebecca Morelle the illegal wildlife trade was placing tremendous pressure on the creatures.

Former Concorde pilot and wife found dead,"Tony Meadows and his wife Paula were found dead on Tuesday A former Concorde pilot and his wife have been found dead at their home. The bodies of Tony Meadows and his wife Paula, both in their 80s, were discovered on Tuesday near the west Berkshire village of Bucklebury. Mr Meadows was part of the crew during Concorde's first passenger flight from Heathrow to New York in 1977. Thames Valley Police has launched a murder investigation but is not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Officers were called to the property in Pot Kiln Lane at about 19:35 BST. A forensic tent has been set up on land outside the property. Det Ch Insp Andy Howard said it was a ""tragic incident"" and there was no danger to the public. ""We are aware that Bucklebury is a small community and this will have an impact on its residents [and] as such people will see an increased police presence,"" he added. Police have been investigating at the couple's home near Bucklebury in west Berkshire Mr Meadows previously told the BBC in an interview for Points West that he had flown Concorde for 14 years. He said one of the highlights of his career was flying the Queen to Bahrain in 1979. A family friend said the Meadows had lived alone in their farmhouse for 35 years. She said she had spoken to one of their three ""devastated"" children on Wednesday morning. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ""They can't understand it. They haven't been able to get their minds around it really. ""Paula has dementia so she hadn't been very well for quite a while. ""But Tony always took care of her and looked after her very well, and took her for walks. ""He was a very caring person, very friendly."" Tony Meadows had previously talked about his career as a Concorde captain on BBC Points West Neighbours in nearby Frilsham spoke of their shock over the couple's deaths. One said she saw the ""nice couple"" occasionally at lunches. The woman said Mr Meadows had recently discovered he trained in the RAF with another local resident. ""They knew of each other but Tony arrived with a photograph and said 'I recognised your smile as soon as I saw you' and started talking about how he flew Concorde,"" she said.

Firms rush to meet gender pay deadline,"Hundreds of UK companies have yet to publish their gender pay figures before Thursday's midnight deadline. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said it would take enforcement action against all firms that missed the deadline. The median pay gap among companies that have so far reported is 9.7%, flat against last year. Big firms with the largest gaps include Easyjet, Lloyds Bank, Clydesdale Bank and British Gas, BBC analysis found. The BBC looked at companies' median pay gaps. Of businesses with more than 5,000 employees, some with the biggest increase in the pay gap compared with last year include Kwik Fit and Interserve FS. The median pay gap is not the same as paying women less than men to do the same work, which is illegal in the UK. But using the median pay measure is helpful in understanding the number of women in companies who hold senior roles. Want to find out the gender pay gap where you work? Try the calculator below. All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps. Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women. Type in a company name below  ...for every £10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]]    Number of companies by pay gap   If you cannot see the calculator, please click here,external More than 9,500 private sector employers have reported their figures ahead of the deadline, leaving some 500 still to do so. The EHRC has vowed to act against companies that do not comply. Chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said: ""Gender pay gap reporting is not optional. It is a legal requirement and there's simply no excuse for employers failing to comply with the regulations this year. ""We will be taking enforcement action against all organisations that have not filed by the deadline requiring them to report immediately. ""Employers that don't report on time not only risk enforcement action and potential financial penalties; they are letting down the women who work for them. They should be prepared for an unhappy workforce and potential reputational damage."" Of the companies that had reported by mid-afternoon on 4 April: 78% report a pay gap which favours men 14% have a pay gap favouring women 8% report no pay gap. By law, companies, charities and public sector departments of 250 employees or more must publish their gender pay gap figures. The first set were based on a snapshot taken in April 2017, and the most recent data relates to April 2018. Public sector firms had to report by 30 March, and charitable and private firms by 5 April. The BBC's analysis looked at private sector firms which had gender pay gap data and a consistent registration at Companies House for April 2017 and April 2018. At the garage chain Kwik Fit, the previous year's pay gap of 15.2% had favoured women, indicating that there were a high number in senior roles. But the latest data shows a reversal, with a 14% gap in favour of men. A company spokeswoman said the industry had been ""historically more appealing to men"", although it was trying to recruit more women. ""We are keen to both promote from within the company as well as recruit more women to help redress this balance,"" the spokeswoman said. The gap at Interserve FS, part of the Interserve Group, widened from 0.6% to 14.9%. Interserve FS is one of 21 entities that make up the outsourcing giant. A spokesman for Interserve Group said: ""We are committed to addressing the issues on gender pay and through the leadership of our chief executive, Debbie White, we are making good progress."" Countrywide Surveyors had the largest gap of the available reported data at 60.6%. The firm had not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. Easyjet had a pay gap of 47.9%. The firmsaid in March,externalthat the gap had widened from 45.5% as more female cabin crew had been recruited since the last pay snapshot. Most of the airline's pilots are male, and are more highly paid than cabin crew. The firm is making efforts to recruit more female pilots. Low-cost airline Jet2 had a 41.9% pay gap, compared with 49.7%. Although still a wide gap, it was also one of the businesses to have made the biggest strides in closing the division. UPS, New Look, Capita and EE also narrowed the gap. Barclays Investment Bank had a large pay gap of 44.1%. In its 2018 gender pay gap report, Barclays said it would introduce an ""accelerator programme"" for promising mid-level employees and try to recruit more female managing directors. It also said it would try to understand why women left Barclays. The pay gap at Lloyds Bank was 41.7%, while the gap at Lloyds Banking Group as a whole was flat at 32.8%. A spokesperson for the bank group said it was ""committed to attracting and retaining the best talent,"" adding that ""there is still more work to do"". ""We were the first FTSE 100 organisation to make a public commitment to having 40% of senior roles filled by women by 2020, and remain committed to both our gender target and closing the pay gap,"" the spokesperson added. While airlines and banks, including RBS, dominated the list of firms with the largest pay gaps, other businesses were in the top 10. British Gas, for example, had a pay gap of 37.5%. British Gas-owner Centrica said: ""Our gender pay gap is not due to unequal pay. It is driven by a greater proportion of men in traditionally male-dominated and higher-paid technical roles, such as gas and electrical engineering."" The Fawcett Society, a charity which campaigns for gender equality, called for tougher regulations to close the gender pay gap. ""It is disappointing, but not surprising, that there are so many employers in the UK with large pay gaps and that these pay gaps aren't being closed,"" said Sam Smethers, Fawcett Society chief executive. ""The regulations are not tough enough. It's time for action plans not excuses."" She added: ""Government needs to require employers to publish action plans that we can hold them accountable to, with meaningful sanctions in place for those who do not comply."" Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI employers' group, said: ""The business case for equality is watertight and gender pay reporting must act as a catalyst for change. ""Some of the practical action companies are taking - like setting themselves stretching targets - are having an immediate and positive impact. Other important steps like helping more women enter male-dominated sectors will make pay gaps bigger in the short term."" Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you place all the men and women working at a company into two lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend-per-woman and its total spend-per-man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things, for example fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs. The individual company data reflects information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office. The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the 'snapshot date' - the previous year. 5 April is the snapshot date for businesses and charities. 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

Last survivor of US slave ships discovered,"The last known survivor of the transatlantic slave ships, brought to the US in 1860, has been identified by an academic at Newcastle University. Sally Smith was kidnapped from West Africa by slave traders and lived until 1937 in Alabama, staying for more than 70 years on the plantation where she had been enslaved. Hannah Durkin made the discovery in first-hand accounts and census records. The previous last known survivor had been a former slave who died in 1935. Dr Durkin, whose research has been published in the journal Slavery and Abolition, says it almost seems ""shocking"" that the story is so close to living memory. The woman, who was named Sally Smith in the US but had originally been called Redoshi, was kidnapped by slave traders in 1860 from a village in what is now Benin. A monument marking the the slave trade that passed through Benin Dr Durkin believes she was 12 years old when she was transported on one of the last slave ships to go to the US, along with more than 100 other men, women and children. She was bought by an Alabama banker and plantation owner and was given his surname of Smith. A 19th Century map shows the so-called 'Slave Coast' of West Africa Even though slavery was abolished five years after her arrival in the US, Redoshi remained working on the same estate, living with her husband, who had also been abducted from the same part of West Africa, and their daughter. The researchers say she stayed on that same plantation for more than 70 years after the end of slavery - and was the last known person from the generation who made the enforced crossing from Africa. Dr Durkin says some details of Redoshi's story had been recorded in the 20th Century, when historians and civil rights activists began to document the experiences of people brought in slavery from Africa. Putting together the pieces of the story, and matching it with census and public records, Dr Durkin found that Redoshi had lived in Selma, Alabama, until her death, at about the age of 89 or 90. After the abolition of slavery, Redoshi continued to work and live on the same land for more than 70 years There would be former slaves who lived later, such as those born into slavery as children, but none of those abducted from Africa is so far known to have lived later than Redoshi. London university calls for Â£100m slavery reparation fund US university helps slavery descendants UK university benefited from slavery profits Redoshi's stories recorded living a peaceful life in her childhood before being seized by members of another local tribe and brought to slave traders. She faced a slave regime of ""beatings"", ""whippings"" and ""killings"" but, Dr Durkin's research says, there were glimpses of her resistance, showing she passed on some of her original language to her daughter and maintained her African culture and identity. ""It's only one voice but this gives us a semblance of a voice for those who were otherwise lost,"" says Dr Durkin.

The diets cutting one-in-five lives short,"The food we eat is putting 11 million of us into an early grave each year, an influential study shows. The analysis, in the Lancet,,externalfound that our daily diet is a bigger killer than smoking and is now involved in one in five deaths around the world. Salt - whether in bread, soy sauce or processed meals - shortened the highest number of lives. Researchers say this study is not about obesity, but ""poor quality"" diets damaging hearts and causing cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study is the most authoritative assessment of how people are dying in every country in the world. The latest analysis used estimates of countries' eating habits to pin down how often diet was shortening lives. The dangerous diets were those containing: Too much salt - three million deaths Too few whole grains - three million deaths Too little fruit - two million deaths Low levels of nuts, seeds, vegetables, omega-3 from seafood and fibre were the other major killers. ""We find that diet is one of the dominant drivers of health around the world, it's really quite profound,"" Prof Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington told the BBC. The lifesaving food 90% arenât eating enough of A bit of meat, a lot of veg - the flexitarian diet to feed 10bn Can a family learn to like the planetary health diet? About 10 million out of the 11 million diet-related deaths were because of cardiovascular disease and that explains why salt is such a problem. Too much salt raises blood pressure and that in turn raises the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Salt is popular with fish and chips Salt can also have a direct effect on the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart failure when the organ does not work effectively. Whole grains, fruit and vegetables have the opposite effect - they are ""cardioprotective"" and lower the risk of heart problems. Cancers and type 2 diabetes made up the rest of the diet-related deaths. No country is perfect and each favours some part of a healthy diet more than others, but this is how far the world is from an optimal diet. The healthy foods missing from the most diets around the world were nuts and seeds, according to the study. Eager readers will have noticedthey featured heavily in the planetary health diet, unveiled in January,to save lives, save the planet and feed 10 billion people. So why don't we munch them? Prof Nita Forouhi, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""The perception is they are little packs of energy that will make you fat, whereas they are packed full of good fats. ""And most people don't see them as mainstream food; and the other issue is cost."" Nuts - they are not just for squirrels. The huge fat versus sugar debate and the link between red and processed meats with cancer have attracted huge headlines in recent years. ""These can be harmful as we show, but they are much smaller issues than low whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake,"" said Prof Murray. Although, the study did show too many fizzy drinks were being drunk in every corner of the world. The researchers say it is time for health campaigns to switch from talking about nutrients like fat and sugar and instead promote healthy foods. Bad diets are knocking a couple of years off life expectancies around the world, according to the researchers. But Prof Murray warns this is just the average and says the real question we should be asking is: ""Am I going to die in my 50s from a heart attack? Or am I going to have some of the diet-related cancers in my 40s?"" Mediterranean countries, particularly France, Spain and Israel, have some of the lowest numbers of diet-related deaths in the world. Countries in South East, Southern and Central Asia are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Israel has the lowest diet-related deaths - 89 per 100,000 people a year Uzbekistan has the highest diet-related deaths - 892 per 100,000 people a year Japan and China have curiously contrasting fortunes that reflect their changing relationship with salt. China consumes enormous amounts of salt with soy and other salty sauces being a key part of the country's cuisine. But the rising popularity of processed foods is introducing yet more salt to their diet. It has the highest death rate because of salt of any country. Prof Murray said: ""Japan is very interesting because if you go back 30 to 40 years, they like China today had enormous salt intake. ""Salt is still their number one problem, but it has come down dramatically, ""And they have a diet that is higher in many of the things we think are protective for heart disease such as vegetables and fruit."" Soy sauce is high in salt The UK is behind countries like France, Denmark and Belgium. The biggest problems are a lack of whole grains, fruit, vegetables and nuts and seeds. The study estimates 14% of UK deaths are related to diet, with 127 diet-related deaths per 100,000 people a year. Prof Murray said: ""Diet quality matters no matter what weight you are. ""The really big story for people to act on is increase your whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake and reduce salt if you can."" But money is an issue. It is estimated that having your five fruit and veg a day would take up 52% of household income in poorer countries. But Prof Forouhi warns: ""The public can make healthier choices if informed and have the resources, but if what is on the shelves as buy-one-get-one-free is always unhealthy, then that message will fall down. ""Cheaper options that are healthy are badly needed."" Both agreed there needed to be a shift from focusing on nutrients (fat/sugar/salt) and on to which actual foods people should eat.

No verdict on Hillsborough police chief,"David Duckenfield and Graham Mackrell were on trial at Preston Crown Court The jury in the trial of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield has been unable to reach a verdict. Former Ch Supt Duckenfield, now 74, had denied the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans in the 1989 disaster. Lawyers for Mr Duckenfield have said they will oppose an application from prosecutors for a retrial. Ex-Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell was found guilty of a health and safety charge. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has said it will seek a retrial for Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset. But lawyers for the former South Yorkshire Police officer said they would apply for a ""stay of proceedings"" to prevent another trial. Updates and more reaction on this story During the 10-week trial at Preston Crown Court, jurors heard that 96 men, women and children died as a result of a fatal crush on the Leppings Lane terrace on 15 April 1989. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster. The jury deliberated for more than 29 hours but was unable to agree whether Mr Duckenfield was guilty or not guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. This video can not be played Hillsborough families react to no verdict over David Duckenfield CPS legal director Sue Hemming said the trial had been ""incredibly complex"" and she recognised ""that these developments will be difficult for the families affected by the Hillsborough disaster"". Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, thanked the jury for ""the weeks they've taken for their deliberations"". She added: ""We were all hoping we would have some sort of closure today and we haven't."" The jury heard 96 men, women and children died as a result of a fatal crush on the Leppings Lane terrace Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher died in the disaster, said he was ""exceedingly disappointed"" the jury had failed to reach a verdict on the charge against Mr Duckenfield. Speaking after the jury was discharged, Mr Devonside said: ""Most of the families wanted a verdict of one kind or another. ""I, like many people, want a conclusion and Hillsborough to come to an end so we can return, as a family, to some sort of normality. We hope for a retrial."" However, Steve Kelly, whose brother Michael died at Hillsborough, said: ""I can only speak personally [and] I don't want to see another trial. ""We've been here for nearly 11 weeks and I don't think I could go through that again. And a lot of the elderly family members shouldn't either."" In a statement, Liverpool Football Club said it wanted to ""reiterate our support and admiration for the Hillsborough families, survivors and campaigners"". Barry Devonside said ""most of the families wanted a verdict of one kind or another"" The trial heard Mr Duckenfield ordered the opening of exit gates at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at 14:52 BST, eight minutes before kick off, after the area outside the turnstiles became dangerously overcrowded. More than 2,000 fans entered through exit gate C once it was opened and many headed for the tunnel ahead of them, which led to the central pens where the crush happened. Prosecutors alleged Mr Duckenfield had ""ultimate responsibility"" at the ground and should have made ""key lifesaving decisions"" on the day. Mr Duckenfield's defence case lasted just 74 minutes and consisted of read evidence from his deputy on the day - ground commander Bernard Murray. His defence argued the case against Mr Duckenfield was ""breathtakingly unfair"" and said he had ""tried to do the right thing"". The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Mr Mackrell, 69, was convicted of failing to discharge his duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act, by a majority of 10 to two. He was accused of failing to take reasonable care to ensure there were enough turnstiles to prevent large crowds building up. The court heard there were seven turnstiles for the 10,100 Liverpool fans with standing tickets for the match against Nottingham Forest. Mr Mackrell did not give evidence but Jason Beer QC, defending, argued the build-up of fans outside was caused by other factors, including a lack of police cordons and the unusual arrival pattern of supporters. Mr Mackrell is due to be sentenced on 13 May.

"We must leave EU, says Cox","This video can not be played Attorney General Geoffrey Cox: ""Once we are out, we are out"" It is an ""article of faith"" that the UK must leave the EU to honour the referendum result, Geoffrey Cox says. The attorney general told the BBC a customs union was ""not desirable"" but if that was the only way of leaving the EU, he would take it. He suggested the government's only option was to ""seek with Labour some common ground"" for a ""swift exit"". And he suggested that the UK could not be bound into a customs arrangement permanently. It comes as the Brexit secretary says rejection of the PM's deal would mean a ""soft Brexit or no Brexit at all"". Meanwhile, the PM has responded to criticism from her own party over talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn by saying all MPs had a responsibility to deliver Brexit. PM defends Brexit talks with Corbyn What are the Brexit sticking points? Laura's blog: Cox's message is 'it's worth it' In an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cox, who has provided the government and MPs with legal advice on Brexit, said the UK could not be bound into a customs union permanently. ""If we decided, in some considerable years time that we wanted to review our membership of any such customs union if we signed it - and I'm not saying we will - that's a matter for negotiation and discussion. ""There's nothing to stop us removing ourselves from that arrangement, so we can't look at these things as permanent straitjackets upon this country."" Mr Cox said he was ""completely convinced"" the UK had to leave the EU. ""We promised this country that we would do so, we promised it that we would honour the outcome of the referendum,"" he said. ""The referendum said leave and leave we must."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button He said: ""The remorseless logic of numbers [in the House of Commons]... means that the only way, unless the prime minister's deal is to be voted through, is to seek with Labour some common ground, so that we can effect a swift exit."" He said if it was a choice between not leaving and leaving with a customs union, he would ""take leaving every single time"". And Mr Cox warned that if the UK does not drop some of its ""red lines"", it risks never leaving at all.

Sturgeon fears 'bad compromise',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""In the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking,  what will happen over the next few days..... is that a bad compromise will be reached. "" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned against accepting a ""bad compromise"" after holding Brexit talks with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. Political leaders have been meeting in London in a bid to break the logjam over the UK's exit from the EU. The prime minister is to ask the EU for another extension to the Brexit deadline while she attempts to come to an agreement with the Labour leader. Ms Sturgeon urged Mr Corbyn to be ""very wary"" about signing up to a ""bad deal"". Mrs May reached out to Mr Corbyn after failing to win backing for her proposed Brexit plan, which has suffered three defeats in the Commons, and MPs failed to unite around any alternative during a series of ""indicative votes"". Talks between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn on Wednesday afternoon were described as ""constructive"" by both sides. But speaking immediately after her own meeting with the prime minister, Ms Sturgeon said she was ""not much clearer on where she (Mrs May) is prepared to give ground"". Live coverage of the latest Brexit developments PM defends Brexit talks with Corbyn Kuenssberg: May chooses a deal over party unity She added: ""I suppose overall my concern is that in the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking, what will happen over the next few days - if anything - is that a bad compromise will be reached. ""People will probably heave a sigh of relief that some agreement has been reached, but then very quickly realise that it's not in the interests of the UK. ""It will satisfy no one, and of course would be open to being unpicked by a prime minister that is not Theresa May, perhaps somebody like Boris Johnson. ""So I think there's a need to be wary. If I was in Jeremy Corbyn's shoes right now I would be very wary about signing up to anything that may not be able to be delivered, in fact may not be enough in the first place."" Mrs May made a statement at Downing Street on Tuesday offering talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Ms Sturgeon said she had felt Mr Corbyn ""would drive a hard bargain"" after meeting him - but that the prime minister had later given the impression that ""she thinks she's got Jeremy Corbyn closer to a deal"". The SNP leader said the UK should ask for a longer extension to Brexit, and that any compromise deal that is ultimately hammered out should be put back to the public in a new referendum, with remaining in the EU also as an option. The UK's departure from the EU was put back from 29 March to 12 April following a summit of European leaders late in March. If MPs or ministers cannot come up with an exit plan which is accepted by the EU, then the UK will leave without a deal. Mrs May said on Tuesday that she would ask the EU for a further extension, to be kept ""as short as possible"", and arranged talks with Mr Corbyn to agree a new approach. But she insisted her withdrawal agreement - which was voted down last week - would remain part of the deal. Following her meeting with Ms Sturgeon, a Downing Street spokeswoman said Mrs May had ""made clear that this delay and division across the UK cannot continue"". The spokeswoman added: ""She is meeting with the leader of the opposition to find a proposal that can command the support of the House of Commons to allow the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible. ""She added that Brexit is a decisive moment in our history and we must come together to deliver for people in Scotland and the whole of the UK."" A Labour spokesman said: ""We have had constructive exploratory discussions about how to break the Brexit deadlock. ""We have agreed a programme of work between our teams to explore the scope for agreement."" Meanwhile, Holyrood's Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh confirmed that the Scottish Parliament would be recalled from recess if the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit on 12 April.

Carney: No deal risk 'alarmingly high',"The risk of Britain stumbling into a ""disorderly"" no-deal Brexit is now ""alarmingly high"", Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned. He told Sky News that although ""real progress"" had been made preparing for leaving without a deal, it would still mean ""lots of things to worry about"". And it was ""absolute nonsense"" a no deal could be easily managed, he said. BBC economics correspondent Dharshini David said critics will see the remarks as another political intervention. Last August the governor said the risk of the UK leaving without a deal ""felt uncomfortably high"", and his latest comments appear to ratchet up the language. He said that since his remarks last year the situation had not got any better. ""Unfortunately I think it proved accurate. It's alarmingly high now."" Britain's default option is that it leaves the EU on 12 April. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May held talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to find a way out of the current deadlock.But that drew criticism from some Conservative Tory MPs. Mr Carney told Sky News,external: ""We're in a situation where the expressed will of Parliament is for some form of deal, so to put it in the double negative - Parliament is against no deal, the government, as expressed by the prime minister, is against no deal, the European Union is against no deal, and yet it is a possibility, it is the default option. ""So no deal would happen by accident, it would happen suddenly, there would be no transition - it is an accidental disorderly Brexit."" He took aim at the idea promoted by several Brexiteers - and included in the Malthouse Compromise plan - which assumes that Article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would allow free trade to continue with the EU while negotiations are in progress. ""Forget the fiction, it's absolute nonsense. It needs to be called out,"" he said. ""I might point out that they want to become better acquainted with the Secretary of State for Trade [Liam Fox] who in Parliament has made the point that it cannot apply unless both parties agree, and unless you're moving towards a - guess what - a customs union."" Mr Carney insisted that London's financial centre was ready to cope with the impact of a no-deal Brexit. ""There are a lot of things to worry about in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but the financial sector is not one of them,"" he said.

Ex-soldier tells inquest he saw 'murder',"The inquest is examining the deaths in west Belfast in August 1971 A former soldier has told the Ballymurphy inquest that what he saw was ""murder"". C4 had previously told the court that he saw British soldiers with red berets shooting and killing two men close to Springfield Park in August 1971. He believed that the soldiers were from the Parachute Regiment. The inquest is looking into the shooting dead of 10 people in the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast in August 1971. The shootings occurred amid disturbances sparked by the introduction of internment without trial in Northern Ireland. C4 told the court on Tuesday that he was present during the incident where Fr Hugh Mullan and Francis Quinn were shot and killed on waste ground near Springfield Park. Ballymurphy shootings: Who were the victims? C4, originally from England, was in Belfast at the time visiting his wife and family while on pre-discharge leave from the Royal Corps of Signals. Returning to give evidence on Wednesday, he told the coroner: ""What I saw in my mind was murder. Shooting civilians who weren't involved in any terrorist action."" Asked by the coroner why he had come forward in 1971 to speak out about what had happened, he replied: ""People needed their justice."" Earlier, a barrister for the MoD (Ministry of Defence) had resumed questions about the differences in some of C4's several accounts of what happened. In one earlier statement given in 2009, C4 had said he could not see the colour of the berets worn by the soldiers who shot at them from the roofs of Springmartin flats. He now says he is certain he saw red or maroon berets on the two men. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment were based at Henry Taggart Army base Asked why he had said that, he told the court he was not sure of his frame of mind while giving that 2009 statement. There were also some differences in his description of the order in which things happened and exactly who was present. Later, a barrister for the Mullan and Quinn families indicated that other witnesses to the inquest in previous weeks had referred to the presence of a man, with an English accent, a soldier, who was married to a local woman. C4 agreed that this would have been him. He was also questioned about his claim that a captain in the Parachute Regiment came up to him at the inquest in 1972 into the death of Fr Hugh Mullan and called him a traitor. The former soldier told the court that his home had later been visited by three members of the Parachute Regiment who had physically assaulted him. Ten people were killed in the shootings He described making a complaint about the matter to the military authorities. He had earlier said in court that he thought the three soldiers had subsequently been court-martialled, but now said he could not be certain anything had actually happened as a result of his complaint. C4, now 71, agreed with the court that his memory sometimes failed him, but he was doing his best to give ""an honest and truthful account"". He has completed his evidence. Later on Wednesday, a former paratrooper told the inquest how he crawled through a field in darkness and found the bodies of a man and a woman. Witness M282 was a private in B Company, 2 Para and was based at Vere Foster school just off the Springfield Road. M282 said he heard exchanges of gunfire and although he took cover for a time, he had not fired his own weapon. He told the court that after dark, he and another soldier were given the task of discovering if there were any casualties in the Manse field area, opposite the Henry Taggart Hall. M282 said both of them made a hole in the fence in front of the base and crawled through. He said they then crawled over to the waste ground without carrying any weapons with them. The shootings occurred amid disturbances sparked by the introduction of internment without trial in Northern Ireland He said he was afraid of being shot, but searched on one side of the Manse area, discovering the bodies of a woman and a man. Four people died as a result of the shooting in that area: Joan Connolly, Joseph Murphy, Noel Phillips and Daniel Teggart. The former soldier said he knew the woman was dead because the body was cold. He said he didn't discover any weapons or shell cases at the scene. He said the soldier with him had discovered two or three bodies, but that he had not seen what his colleague was doing. M282 said the two men waited while an armoured vehicle came from the base and four soldiers collected casualties from the field, before they went back themselves. He did not see any dead or wounded back at the base, he said. He said that at a later date he discovered some weathered rifle shell cases in the hedge along the waste ground, but cannot be sure of the date when he found them. He said he did not connect the shell cases with the bodies he had found several months earlier. He also said he did not recognise the type of shell cases, but they were not the type that the Army used.

Cash machine stolen in County Monaghan,"The ATM was ripped from the wall of the bank in Castleblayney A cash machine has been ripped from the wall of a bank in County Monaghan. It is understood a jeep, van and stolen digger were used in the theft at Main Street in Castleblayney. Police were contacted at about 03:00 BST. The jeep and digger remained at the scene on Wednesday morning. In the early hours of Monday,a digger was used to rip a cash machine from the wall of a shop in Ahoghill in County Antrim. The scene remained sealed off on Wednesday morning The PSNI said eight ATMs have been stolen in seven separate incidents in Northern Ireland in 2019, along with one attempted theft. Det Ch Insp David Henderson said police were ""actively looking at it being several gangs involved"". GardaÃ­ (police) were called to the scene at about 03:00 local time Castleblayney is a short distance from the Northern Ireland border. Speaking after the raid there, Garda Supt Fergus Treanor said the frequency of ATM thefts was not only a concern for police, but also for the local communities in the border region. He said gardaÃ­ are at the very early stages of the investigation and are working closely with the PSNI and that a number of criminal gangs are involved in the thefts. He said that the digger had been stolen locally. No one was injured in the incident, which follows several such robberies in border counties in the past few months. Last month,two ATMs were taken in separate incidents on the same night in counties Cavan and Tyrone.

Flybe cancels flights amid redundancy talks,"Regional airline Flybe has cancelled dozens of Wednesday morning flights as it enters discussions over potential job losses. The company blamed an industry-wide shortage of pilots for the delays, as well as its own pilots taking holidays. Flights from Belfast City Airport and Birmingham are among those affected. Most of the flights are within the UK. The airline said it would like to ""sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused"". The discussions over jobs are at an early stage and the company will try and avoid job losses by filling internal vacancies with existing staff, including roles at other bases, Flybe's chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener told BBC Radio 5 live. The company is ""engaging with all impacted crew"", she said. Of the delays, she said the company would ""follow all the rules of compensation"" and that ""we are expecting to go back to normal operation as soon as possible"". While the disruption was widespread, it only affected 5% of flights, she insisted. Cardiff Airport boss Deb Barber said: ""We understand Flybe is in the process of consulting with a number of its employees, including its crew at multiple bases across its network, which includes Cardiff. ""Flybe's plan to restructure and reduce its jet operations across many bases is part of the company's long-standing objective to stabilise the business,"" she said. The cuts will affect Doncaster, Norwich and Exeter, as well as Cardiff, as the company seeks to drop expensive jets in favour of cheaper turboprop airliners. The company says it will make the following changes: Exeter- Flybe will fly its last jets from the airport on 26 October. This will not affect turboprop flights or its ""base structure"" it said. Norwich- Jets will also stop flying from this airport at around the same time.  This will not affect services at Norwich operated by Flybe's franchise partner, Eastern Airways, it said. Cardiff and Doncaster- Flybe will also stop flying jets from these two airports.  It will close its servicing operations at the airports, but will offer turboprop flights. Unite the union regional officer Peter Coulson said: ""Unite is seeking to minimise the potential job losses and secure assurances about Flybe's long-term future."" He urged the company to be forthcoming about its plan. ""It is essential that Flybe is fully transparent with its workforce about the exact situation facing the company. The current uncertainty is incredibly unsettling and is in danger of severely damaging morale at the company."" Sue Piercey has cancelled her holiday plans Sue Piercey, who lives in Bradford, told the BBC her flight from Leeds to Belfast today was cancelled. ""We received a curt email at 19:00 last night followed by an even shorter text message,"" she said. ""No other flight options were offered."" Flybe are scheduled to fly three later services from Leeds to Belfast today, and none were offered to Ms Piercey, she said. ""Our holiday is totally off now, and I hope my insurance company can help me,"" she said, describing herself as ""very annoyed today"". Customers also vented their frustration on social media.

Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter Anyone whose flight is cancelled is entitled to choose between a refund paid within seven days, or an alternative flight (or bus) - even with a rival carrier. Unless they have chosen a refund, it is the responsibility of the airline to get anyone with a ticket to their final destination as promptly as possible. In many cases, they should receive refreshments during any wait of two or more hours. Passengers whose flight is cancelled, or who suffer long delays, can apply forextra compensation,externalunder EU rules. As these are mostly short-haul flights, and the cancellations were last-minute, most will be entitled to compensation of â¬250 (Â£213). Anyone who misses a connecting flight should talk to the airline operating that second flight but, according to consumer group Which?, they may have to make a claim for the cost of a new flight from their travel insurance. On Monday, Flybe passengers on a new route were left witha six-hour coach journey when their aircraft was grounded. The 18:40 service from Newquay to Heathrow could not take off on Sunday because of a ""technical issue"". Cornwall Airport Newquay said passengers were offered ""rebooking for another flight or ground transport to London Heathrow"". Flybe was bought early this year in a rescue deal following poor financial results. Connect Airways, a consortium led by Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, paid a total of Â£2.8m for Flybe's assets and operations. The Exeter-based regional airline put itself up for sale last November, following a profit warning the previous month. Virgin, Stobart Air and Cyrus Capital set up Connect Airways in December. Flybe fell into difficulty in 2017, after what was considered a too-aggressive expansion strategy. The company ran up a near-Â£20m loss in the financial year ending 31 March 2017. Passengers were booked onto a brand new route from Newquay to Heathrow but ended up on a coach This January, one employee was moved to send an email accusing the firm's directors of ruining a profitable company. The employee, a senior pilot, addressed the email to Flybe's chief executive, Ms Ourmieres-Widener. ""Congratulations, in two years at Flybe you and your fellow incompetent cohorts have managed to totally destroy a viable airline which was making profits when you took over,"" he wrote. The BBC understands that the airline has suspended the pilot. Flybe told the BBC that ""an individual was suspended on 17 January 2019 in accordance with company policy"".

Brunei to punish gay sex with death,"Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei Brunei is introducing strict new Islamic laws that make anal sex and adultery offences punishable by stoning to death. The new measures, that come into force on Wednesday, also cover a range of other crimes including punishment for theft by amputation. The move has sparked international condemnation. Brunei's gay community has expressed shock and fear at the ""medieval punishments"". ""You wake up and realise that your neighbours, your family or even that nice old lady that sells prawn fritters by the side of the road doesn't think you're human, or is okay with stoning,"" one Bruneian gay man, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. The sultan of the small South-East Asian nation on Wednesday called for ""stronger"" Islamic teachings. ""I want to see Islamic teachings in this country grow stronger,"" Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said in a public address, according to AFP news agency, without mentioning the strict new interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. Brunei: What you need to know Where is gay sex still against the law? What is Sharia? Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Muslims make up about two-thirds of the country's population of 420,000. Brunei has retained the death penalty but has not carried out an execution since 1957. The law mostly applies to Muslims, including children who have reached puberty, though some aspects will apply to non-Muslims. Under the new laws,individuals accused of certain acts will be convicted if they confess or if there were witnesses present.,external Offences such as rape, adultery, sodomy, robbery and insult or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad will carry the maximum penalty of death.,external Lesbian sex carries a different penalty of 40 strokes of the cane and/or a maximum of 10 years in jail The punishment for theft is amputation Those who ""persuade, tell or encourage"" Muslim children under the age of 18 ""to accept the teachings of religions other than Islam"" are liable to a fine or jail Individuals who have not reached puberty but are convicted of certain offences may be instead subjected to whipping. Sultan Hassanal heads the Brunei Investment Agency which owns the Dorchester Collection, an operator of some of the world's top hotels including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. Brunei's ruling royals possess a huge private fortune and its largely ethnic Malay residents enjoy generous state handouts and pay no taxes. ButHollywood actor George Clooney and other celebrities have now called for a boycott of the luxury hotels.TV host Ellen DeGeneres also called for people to ""rise up"", saying ""we need to do something now"".

The hotel operator said it did ""not tolerate any form of discrimination"". ""Dorchester Collection's code emphasises equality, respect and integrity in all areas of our operation, and strongly values people and cultural diversity amongst our guests and employees,"" it said. ""Inclusion and diversity remain core beliefs."" In another development,a honorary degree awarded by the UK's University of Aberdeen to Sultan Hassanal is under review. The country first introduced Sharia law in 2014 despite widespread condemnation, giving it a dual legal system with both Sharia and Common Law. The sultan had said then that the new penal code would come into full force over several years. The first phase, which covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines, was implemented in 2014. Brunei had delayed introducing the final two phases, which cover crimes punishable by amputation and stoning. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who is also the prime minister of Brunei, is among the wealthiest people in the world But on Saturday, the government released a statement on its website sayingthe Sharia penal code would be fully implemented on Wednesday,external. In the days since, there has been international outrage and calls for the country to reverse course. ""These abusive provisions received widespread condemnation when plans were first discussed five years ago,"" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, a Brunei researcher at Amnesty International. ""Brunei's penal code is a deeply flawed piece of legislation containing a range of provisions that violate human rights."" The United Nations echoed the statement, calling the legislation ""cruel, inhuman and degrading"", and saying it marked a ""serious setback"" for human rights protection. Maldives annuls woman's stoning ruling How many countries still have the death penalty? According to rights group Human Rights Without Frontiers,stoning is still a punishment in countries such as Iran, Somalia and Sudan among others,external. There are several theories, but Matthew Woolfe, founder of human rights group The Brunei Project, said it could be linked to Brunei's weakening economy. ""One theory is that it is a way for the government to strengthen its hold on power in the face of a declining economy that could potentially lead to some unrest in future,"" Mr Woolfe told the BBC. ""Connected to this is [Brunei's] interest in attracting more investment from the Muslim world, along with more Islamic touristsâ¦ this could be seen as one way of appealing to this market."" One rights group says the tightening Sharia laws might be a way for the government to strengthen its hold on power Mr Woolfe also added that the government might have hoped to get away with the latest roll-out without anyone realising. ""I think that the government did want to ensure that the international uproar that followed implementation of the first phase in 2014 had well and truly died down before further [implementation], in the hope it would just quietly [do so] without anyone realising,"" he said. ""It wasn't until increasing international attention that it finally came out and confirmed [this]."" The penal code changes were posted on the attorney general's website in December but only came to public attention in late March. There was no public announcement. One 40-year-old gay Bruneian currently seeking asylum in Canada said the impact of the new penal code was already being felt in Brunei. The ex-government employee, who left Brunei last year after being charged with sedition for a Facebook post that was critical of the government, said people were ""afraid"". ""The gay community in Brunei has never been open but when Grindr [a gay dating app] came that helped people meet in secret. But now, what I've heard is that hardly anyone is using Grindr anymore,"" Shahiran S Shahrani Md told the BBC. ""They're afraid that they might talk to a police officer pretending to be gay. It hasn't happened yet but because of the new laws, people are afraid,"" he said. Another male Bruneian, who is not gay but has renounced Islam, said he felt ""fearful and numb"" in the face of the laws being implemented. ""We ordinary citizens are powerless to stop Sharia law from being implemented,"" said the 23-year-old, who did not want to be identified. ""Under Sharia, I would face the death penalty for apostasy."" One gay man was hopeful that the laws might not be enforced widely. ""Honestly, I'm not too scared as the government here often bluffs with the harsh punishments. But it can and will still happen even with it being rare."" It is very unlikely to happen at all, people inside Brunei have told Bill Hayton, associate fellow with the Asia Pacific programme at Chatham House. ""What I'm hearing from people in Brunei is that this is very, very unlikely to ever happen,"" he told BBC Radio Four. For instance, the laws stipulate that there must be four Muslim witnesses to the act of anal sex or adultery for it to be prosecuted, he said. ""The way it is being explained to me is that this is a way for the sultan to look religious but make sure that none of these punishments will actually be carried out,"" Mr Hayton said.

Neglect contributed to shingles drug death,"Eileen McAdie was prescribed an increased dose of a painkiller but was given a drug for blood pressure Neglect was a contributing factor in the death of a woman suffering from shingles who was given the wrong drug by a pharmacy, a coroner has ruled. Eileen McAdie was given blood pressure drug Amlodipine instead of pain relief medication Amitriptyline at The Village Pharmacy in New Ash Green, Kent. The 65-year-old died 11 days later in hospital in September 2016, after falling into a coma. Family lawyer Nick Fairweather said civil proceedings would be launched. The inquest in Maidstone had heard Mrs McAdie's GP Dr Julie Taylor had prescribed an increased daily dose of Amitriptyline to treat the severe pain caused by the shingles on her face and neck, on 19 September. But Dr Taylor said pharmacist Josiah Ghartey-Reindorftold her that the wrong medication had been dispensed. The inquest heard a label for Amitriptyline was stuck on a box of Amlodipine by a member of pharmacy staff Coroner Christopher Sutton-Mattocks said: ""This failure is substantial, not trivial. ""It is a fundamental part of the role of a pharmacist that the correct drugs are dispensed. ""Her death was contributed to by neglect."" Amlodipine is used to treat high blood pressure, while Amitriptyline, which can also be used to treat depression, was prescribed to manage Mrs McAdie's pain. A member of staff at The Village Pharmacy told the inquest staff were rushed off their feet In a statement issued by the family, Mrs McAdie was described as a ""much loved wife, mother, sister and grandmother"". ""To lose Eileen in any circumstances would have been a tragedy for the family.  To have her taken from them in the way that occurred here, through these errors, is unbearable."" The inquest heard Mr Ghartey-Reindorf also failed to circulate a newsletter to staff from the pharmacy owners warning about mixing up prescriptions. He has been referred to the General Pharmaceutical Council and was removed from his post in New Ash Green, demoted, and is undergoing re-training elsewhere.

Looking for Brexitland," March was going to be the decisive month - the days that would transform the UK. I wanted to hear what people had to say and chose four places that each showed a distinct aspect of Brexit. This isn’t an exhaustive or comprehensive tour of the UK - I’ve visited only two of the four constituent nations. This piece doesn't include Wales and Northern Ireland. The distinctive nature of their Brexit debates merits separate analysis. I started in Southampton. For generations, this was where immigrants and visitors alike first set foot on English soil. It is where they first encountered the British, after disembarking from one of the great ocean-going vessels that shaped the history and character of this port city. In the 1930s, the writer and social commentator JB Priestley called Southampton Britain’s “bay window on the wide world”. Southampton Water was one of Britain’s gateways to a trading empire that circled the globe. View of Southampton's Ocean Terminal from the Queen Mary, 1950 And I wanted to start here because it’s where my own working life as a news reporter began. I came here in the mid-80s to learn my trade. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was radically reshaping Britain. Traditional, mass-employment industries were dying. Dole queues had been lengthening. Like many Scots of my generation I headed south looking for a break, in a part of the country where there still seemed to be opportunity. I’d come from a brief spell working in Glasgow, another port city that had thrived as a trading and industrial hub in the heyday of Imperial Britain. Allan Little as a young man The difference astonished me. Much of industrial Glasgow was sinking into dereliction and despair but in Southampton there was money, investment, growth. Southampton was managing the transition from the age of Empire to the age of Europe with a dynamic self-confidence that was unlike anything I had seen. This part of south central England had also embraced the prevailing values of that decade: privatisation, deregulation, enterprise. The patch I worked covered 20 parliamentary constituencies. All of them had a Tory MP. I did story after story on men who’d been laid off as the shipyards and city-centre docks had closed down, but who had used their redundancy money to start their own businesses and employ others. Southampton never ceased to be a global trading hub, but it was now well-placed to benefit from a Europe that was tearing down barriers to trade between its member states. I started in Southampton.

Margaret Thatcher spent the last day of her 1983 re-election campaign here, and across the Solent on the Isle of Wight, precisely because it had come to represent, for her, what free-market reform could deliver: wealth creation freed from the dead hand of the state. Margaret Thatcher, Isle of Wight, 8 June 1983 Southampton people were not rich. But this was a far cry from Glasgow. Like most of England, Southampton voted to leave the EU in 2016. The margin was 54% to 46%, which was about the average for England as a whole. After the referendum, London-based news organisations sent reporters like me north, to the post-industrial heartlands that represented an England that had been - in the parlance of my trade - “left behind” by a globalised economy. But Southampton had not been left behind. Far from it. It had been swept along by the forces of globalisation for three decades. Danny Babey is in his early 40s and runs his own upholstering company. A lot of his work is on the water, refurbishing private yachts. He voted to leave the EU. Danny Babey “Why can’t we make our own rules?” he says as he noses his own yacht out of harbour. We chug past the vast container port that has grown up to the west of the city. “It’s not easy being told what to do by another country.” I took a mental note of this, knowing that I planned to end my journey in Scotland, which voted 62% to remain but will have to leave with the rest of the UK regardless. Danny tells me he’d recently sent 10 workers to do a job in Marseilles. “I suppose I might have to think about sorting visas for that sort of thing now,” he says. “But I hope the transition will be smooth.” “Did you think about that when you voted to leave?” I ask him. “Not really,” he says, “because I wasn’t doing that work then. I suppose that work might go to another company now, one that’s inside the European Union and yes, that would concern me. But I always take the view that something else will turn up.” In the city centre that evening, Tomasz Dyl is in a bar with a dozen friends and colleagues, drinking champagne and slicing birthday cake. It is 11 years to the day since he founded his own marketing company. It now employs 10 people full time and has just opened an office in London’s Oxford Street. Tomasz Dyl Tomasz came to Southampton 15 years ago at the age of 13 without speaking a word of English. His Polish parents took low-paying jobs to give their children a better start, in a wealthier country. Tomasz, a beneficiary of freedom of movement between member states, voted to remain and was sure Southampton would too. Why didn’t it? “At one point, Polish was Southampton’s second language,” he tells me, acknowledging the role that high levels of immigration played in the way many people voted. “The Poles were 10% of the population of the city. Most have done well. They started their own businesses. They’ve brought a lot to this country.” For Tomasz, the immigrant experience has been a happy one. He talks about his adopted city in the first person plural. “We’re a very welcoming city,” he says. “We’re a port city. We’re used to people coming in and going out all the time.” He has almost no personal experience of anti-immigrant sentiment in a city he clearly loves. Pearline Hingston is also an immigrant. Pearline Hingston She came to Britain at the age of 11 from her native Jamaica, where she was born to a family of Indian descent. Her identity is shaped by the Commonwealth, she tells me, and she has been campaigning to leave the European Union for years. She is a UKIP branch secretary. “We have waited long enough. We should leave, even on a no-deal. Britain can trade globally. We can trade globally on WTO terms,” she says. “If the EU doesn’t want to stay friends, if it wants the UK to impose tariffs on its goods, then that’s its choice.” Pearline - who also voted Out in the 1975 referendum to decide if the UK would remain in the EEC as it was then - is convinced Brexit is being sabotaged. Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher during the referendum campaign on Europe, June 1975 “The EU has the upper hand,” she says, “and there have been people here in parliament who have been tripping over to Brussels having private meetings, and they have become anti-British and anti-democratic in their behaviour. They should accept the referendum and not pull the rug from under Mrs May.” For many here, Southampton’s Leave vote was not primarily about immigration. There is a “something will turn up” self-confidence - some might say complacency - about this England that is borne of experience: the experience of 40 years in which, compared with the England I’m headed to next, something usually has turned up. It wasn't just the England of the “left-behinds” thattipped the scalesfor Leave in 2016. There was a numerically significant chunk of Leave votes from a non-metropolitan England that is relatively comfortably off. This is what I take away from Southampton - if you’re a Remainer, it’s too simple to blame the poor or the North. A critical mass of Leave sentiment is in the South.

Danny tells me he’d recently sent 10 workers to do a job in Marseilles. “I suppose I might have to think about sorting visas for that sort of thing now,” he says. “But I hope the transition will be smooth.” “Did you think about that when you voted to leave?” I ask him. “Not really,” he says, “because I wasn’t doing that work then. I suppose that work might go to another company now, one that’s inside the European Union and yes, that would concern me. But I always take the view that something else will turn up.” In the city centre that evening, Tomasz Dyl is in a bar with a dozen friends and colleagues, drinking champagne and slicing birthday cake. It is 11 years to the day since he founded his own marketing company. It now employs 10 people full time and has just opened an office in London’s Oxford Street. Tomasz Dyl Tomasz came to Southampton 15 years ago at the age of 13 without speaking a word of English. His Polish parents took low-paying jobs to give their children a better start, in a wealthier country. Tomasz, a beneficiary of freedom of movement between member states, voted to remain and was sure Southampton would too. Why didn’t it? “At one point, Polish was Southampton’s second language,” he says, acknowledging the role that high levels of immigration played in the way many people voted. “The Poles were 10% of the population of the city. Most have done well. They started their own businesses. They’ve brought a lot to this country.” For Tomasz, the immigrant experience has been a happy one. He talks about his adopted city in the first person plural. “We’re a very welcoming city,” he says. “We’re a port city. We’re used to people coming in and going out all the time.” He has almost no personal experience of anti-immigrant sentiment in a city he clearly loves. Pearline Hingston is also an immigrant. Pearline Hingston She came to Britain at the age of 11, from her native Jamaica, where she was born to a family of Indian descent. Her identity is shaped by the Commonwealth, she tells me, and she has been campaigning to leave the European Union for years. She is a UKIP branch secretary. “We have waited long enough. We should leave, even on a no-deal. Britain can trade globally. We can trade globally on WTO terms,” she says. “If the EU doesn’t want to stay friends, if it wants the UK to impose tariffs on its goods, then that’s its choice.” Pearline - who also voted Out in the 1975 referendum to decide if the UK would remain in the EEC as it was then - is convinced Brexit is being sabotaged. Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher (r) during the referendum campaign on Europe, June 1975 “The EU has the upper hand,” she says, “and there have been people here in parliament who have been tripping over to Brussels having private meetings, and they have become anti-British and anti-democratic in their behaviour. They should accept the referendum and not pull the rug from under Mrs May.” For many here, Southampton’s Leave vote was not primarily about immigration. There is a “something will turn up” self-confidence - some might say complacency - about this England that is borne of experience: the experience of 40 years in which, compared with the England I’m headed to next, something usually has turned up. It wasn't just the England of the “left-behinds” thattipped the scalesfor Leave in 2016. There was a numerically significant chunk of Leave votes from a non-metropolitan England that is relatively comfortably off. This is what I take away from Southampton - if you’re a Remainer, it’s too simple to blame the poor or the North. A critical mass of Leave sentiment is in the South. In Stoke-on-Trent, there’s not much of the confidence I encountered in Southampton. What there is - and you don’t have to spend much time here to get a sense of it - is a fierce civic pride in the character and traditions of the city. Stoke-on-Trent is not much of a magnet for internal migration. Most people who live here are from here. It feels like a place of neighbourliness, of a shared sense of identity. It sits at the heart of a part of England that shares its very name with the industry that is the source of that pride: the Potteries. Pots, pits and steel; these were the three industrial pillars on which Stoke-on-Trent was built. Coal and steel have gone, and the Potteries reduced to a fraction of what they once were. Waste incinerator and the A500, Stoke-on-Trent I took a walk not far from the city centre. Opposite a neat row of brick-built terraced houses, I walked past a derelict industrial plant. I stopped to gaze through rusting chained-up fencing at the soot-black bricks of the distinctive funnel-shaped kiln chimneys and warehouses that once produced tableware for half the world. Stoke-on-Trent, like much of industrial England, is a place that takes pride in the worth and virtue of honest work. But decades of industrial decline and years of “austerity” have had a visible impact here. It has swept away much of the economic activity  that was the source of that pride. The people here voted by nearly 70% to leave - one of the highest margins in the country. “People who live in London, in places of power, don’t know anything about Stoke-on-Trent,” Danny Flynn tells me. “They just make assumptions that it’s not a very nice place, where those rough people live.” Danny Flynn And he performs a little parody of what he sees as the judgmental, liberal middle class: “Oh those uneducated white working-class people - how very dare they vote Brexit?” Danny runs the Stoke YMCA. He provides secure accommodation for vulnerable young adults and provides them with training that helps to turn their lives around and get them into work. He voted Remain - reluctantly he says.  “I can see why people in Stoke would think, ‘Never mind Brussels, London’s got nothing to do with us!’ So I could see why it happened, but I think it was more a general protest vote of not being included in the game called Great Britain.” That sense - that Stoke feels excluded - is everywhere. This is a city that globalisation has left behind. Graham Eagles has a stall at Tunstall market selling pet supplies. At the weekends, he runs dog training courses in a local community hall. He voted Leave. Graham Eagles “Eventually I think the country could be run a lot better, more self sufficient,” he says. “We could rely less on other countries. We could do it ourselves like we used to, a long time ago obviously, but we did. This country has lost its backbone a little bit I think, and that’s what it needs to get back and stand strong.” It is a theme that runs through much of the pro-Leave sentiment I heard expressed in the six towns that constitute this city at the heart of The Potteries: the belief that Britain should recapture some hard-to-define quality that it once had - but has lost. But go further down the age demographic and that yearning for the lost certainties of the past diminishes. Natalie Willatt, who’s 24, left the city to take a degree in photography in Leeds. Despite the broader range of opportunities the great cities of the North have to offer, she came home after graduating out of love for her home city. Across the country,just over 70% of 18 to 24-year-oldswho voted in the referendum backed Remain. Natalie Willatt I ask her whether she could understand why so many people here voted Leave. “I can understand why so many people are unhappy,” she tells me. “Yes, you can’t get a doctor’s appointment but that’s because the NHS is underfunded, not because there’s an immigrant taking your space. “So I believe actually it’s austerity and underfunding of things that are causing these issues that people might blame immigrants for. So I can understand why people are angry, I just think they’re blaming the wrong people for it.” Stoke-on-Trent illustrates one of the paradoxes of the Leave victory - that so many traditional Labour-voting communities, and especially those plunged into hardship by the collapse of industry, should have voted for a policy championed most vociferously by the right-wing of the Conservative Party. One of the consequences of the collapse of the traditional industries was the erosion of the power of the trade unions and the role they played in people’s lives. Trade union officials were a constant presence in those communities - in the workplace, agitating for improvements in working conditions, taking up the cause of workers who believed they’d been unjustly treated at work, in the social clubs and bars where people gathered in their down time. Local Labour activists that had emerged from that movement were known by local people, and often sent to represent them at Westminster. Tony Blair's Labour election victory in 1997 Eighteen years of Conservative government changed that. The trade union movement was stripped of the power it once had. The workplaces that had sustained the Labour movement disappeared. Labour at Westminster rebranded itself. “New Labour” set out to appeal to prosperous Middle England. It had to win back seats in places like Southampton. The party at Westminster came to see “cloth-cap politics” - the politics of class grievance - as a vote loser. The number of genuinely working-class MPs on the Labour benchesgradually diminished. A new generation of clever young men and women with university backgrounds emerged - a caste of professional politicians who had not come from the communities that had been devastated by the loss of their industries. The Labour voices raised in parliament sounded less and less like those of the people they represented. UKIP poster in Stoke-on-Trent, 2017 In this context, UKIP was able to make inroads into territory that had always been loyally Labour. Not far from Graham Eagles’ pet products stall, I find Shirley Ray. She’s been styling hair here for 20 years. Her salon is busy. One woman in the chair is having her roots done ahead of a trip to Australia. Two others, both retired, are waiting patiently. There’s not much disagreement between these women. They voted Leave and they want out. Shirley voted UKIP at the last election and is an admirer of Nigel Farage. Shirley Ray “I don’t feel proud to be British any more,” she says, when I ask her about the ongoing paralysis at Westminster. “I think we’re the laughing stock of the world. I think we’re being seen as a very weak country,” she says. “We’ll put up with anything, just take anything that’s thrown at us. And I think we need to get cracking on making this country great again. To be honest I’ve got no confidence in any of the MPs at all. I just want out.” One of her customers is Patricia Shrigley. “I can’t see us coming out to be honest, because Westminster doesn’t want it. And I think that would be very unfair.” Patricia Shrigley I ask her how she’d feel if Britain ended up staying in the EU. “I wouldn’t vote again,” she says. “That would be me finished. Because it’s supposed to be a democracy, and we’ll just be ignored won’t we?” It chimes, back at the pet supplies stall, with Graham Eagles’ sense of dejected resignation. “People are getting fed up about voting,” he says. “It’s pointless voting because it gets us nowhere. A lot of people will feel the same - what’s the point?” If there was a second referendum, Natalie Willatt would vote - again - to remain. “I believe people voted to leave because they wanted something to change, because they’re sick of how it is,” she says. “And it’s only going to change for the worse. So that’s the bit I’m sad about - that these communities of brilliant people still aren’t going to get anything better. I think that’s ultimately what they wanted out of Brexit, and they’re not going to get it. This is incredibly sad.” That is Danny Flynn’s view, too. “My biggest fear - because the economy will take a kick, even the Brexit people admit that don’t they?  - is that working-class people in cities like Stoke will suffer more than any other people in the country,” he says. “Working-class people will pay again like working-class people have paid for austerity, like working-class people paid for the bankers’ bonuses, to be frank.” Stoke-on-Trent illustrates one of the paradoxes of the Leave victory - that so many traditional Labour-voting communities, and especially those plunged into hardship by the collapse of industry, should have voted for a policy championed most vociferously by the right-wing of the Conservative Party.

But they are where Labour’s single biggest challenge begins. Most Labour members, and most Labour voters, support Remain, and many want the party to back a second referendum. But most Labour MPs sit in seats that voted Leave. To win an election, the party would have to win over Leave-supporting seats. Manchester Brexit has driven a fracture through both the two big Westminster parties. The divide in the House of Commons might still, formally, be between a Conservative government and a Labour-dominated opposition. But in the country, politics has realigned. The divide out here, beyond the Westminster bubble, is between Remainers and Leavers. Both main parties are trying to ride two horses that are pulling in opposite directions. Mrs May has spent much of the past two years negotiating not with the European Union, but with her own party. My next stop was Greater Manchester, where it’s not hard to see that the Labour Party is just as deeply riven. The bus from Stoke-on-Trent to Manchester doesn’t take long. It’s not much more than a hop. But central Manchester feels a world away. Manchester Everywhere you look there is dynamic regeneration. It shines at you in concrete, steel and glass. Here, there is opportunity for an educated workforce. The North West is a Labour stronghold - or, rather, two very distinct Labour strongholds. The first of these is typified perhaps by metropolitan Manchester, which voted 60/40 to remain. Martin Yuille is an articulate and passionate Labour activist, a retired professor of genetics and every inch the educated liberal metropolitan. Martin Yuille He is convinced that there is plenty of evidence which, he says, proves that the “will of the people” as expressed in June 2016 has changed not only across the North West but throughout the country. “There’s one supremely important issue that needs to be addressed now and that is getting a new public vote,” he says. “The referendum campaign will not be led by political parties this time,” he insists. “It’ll be grassroots organisations. That will lead to a different character to the campaign. Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn will be speaking from the sidelines. It’ll be the genuine voice, the voice of the British people, that will come through. We won’t need Project Fear.” But head out of the city of Manchester and you don’t need to go far to find the voice of Labour’s other tribe. In Wigan, which voted 64% to leave, I go to see John Chadwick. He runs a butcher’s shop and delicatessen, with its own abattoir at the back. The restaurant attached was full almost when I arrived, even though it was barely mid-morning. He voted to leave and can’t understand why we are still in the EU. John Chadwick “If we’re coming out, we don’t want to agree nothing,” he says. “Why pay £39bn? We went in with nothing, we should come out with nothing. Like a divorce. Just leave. Finish.” John is 72 and has been working in the family business since he started as an errand boy at the age of 10. He says his business is hampered by EU rules and food regulations that are unnecessary. “I’ve got to have a vet present when I kill my animals. It costs money. We’re small. I only kill a few. But I have to pay the same [vets] bills as the big abattoirs. How are we supposed to compete?” I put Martin Yuille’s point to him: that the country didn’t know what kind of Brexit it voted for in 2016, and now that it knows more, should it vote again to make sure the country knows what it’s getting into? “Oh no, no, no, no,” he says. “We knew what we were getting into. Leave is leave. Nothing else. “Look. We’re the only country in the world that has ‘Great’ in front of its name. What’s to be frightened of? We proved that a few years ago with BSE and foot and mouth. “Europe walked away from us then. They didn’t want us. They wouldn’t buy our beef. So what are we worried about? The farmers carried on. The customers still ate meat. It must work in the other industries as well. Honda and Nissan - if they’re leaving the country, don’t buy their cars. No problem.” Oldham, Greater Manchester Where does this leave the Labour MPs who form the majority in the North West? Ros Birch is a Labour activist in Leave-voting Oldham, one of the towns hit hardest by the decline of industry. Oldham is still dominated by the vast red-brick textile mills that once exported across the globe and made this one of the great industrial centres of the North. But none of the mills spin cotton now. Many have slipped into dereliction.  Crumbling brickwork and broken and boarded-up windows are a sorry reminder of a lost greatness. Ros Birch Ros is probably a minority voice in Oldham. She wants a second referendum, a People’s Vote, and she thinks Labour MPs should risk angering their Leave-voting constituents to try to make that happen. “I would say to them that if you know that it [Brexit] is going to be the worst thing that could happen to some of your constituents who are already struggling with low wages and the impact of Universal Credit, depending on food banks, if you know that their lives are not going to be made any better by leaving the EU, then you’ve got to back Remain,” she says. “And can you understand why many of them feel pulled in two opposing directions?” I ask her. “I can understand it, but on the other hand I think you’ve got to put your country and your constituents ahead of keeping your job, ahead of getting re-elected. Some of them are definitely frightened of losing their seats.” The post-industrial heartlands, traditional fortresses of Labour solidarity, are not, in themselves, the problem for the Labour Party - for most continue to return Labour MPs.

It’s not easy being told what to do by another country.” Scotland voted 62% to 38% to remain, but will leave with the rest of the UK all the same. Not a single one of the country’s 32 local authority areas returned a majority for Leave. Unfurl the results map that shows Leave areas coloured blue and Remain yellow, and the difference is stark. The border between blue and yellow runs precisely the length of the Anglo-Scottish border - yellow to the north, blue to the south. I grew up in Scotland, so crossing that border is always a homecoming for me. When I was a child in the 70s, we lived in a constituency that returned an SNP MP to Westminster. Support for independence was far lower then. Scotland felt very British. When did England and Scotland start to diverge so clearly in the way they vote? And does the divergence represent a divergence in the values that the two nations embrace? My final destination was Motherwell. Motherwell, North Lanarkshire In any other part of the UK except Scotland, Motherwell would probably have voted to leave. Its economy was devastated in the 1990s by the closure of the huge Ravenscraig steelworks. At its height it was one of the largest steel plants in Western Europe. It employed 13,000 people and sustained the whole town. Motherwell has never fully recovered from the decline of steel. It is every bit as “left behind” by globalisation as Stoke-on-Trent. And yet North Lanarkshire, with Motherwell its main town, voted 62% to 38% to remain - about the Scottish average. The 2014 Independence referendum fundamentally changed politics in Scotland. It realigned political allegiances. Glasgow, 2014 In the Scotland I grew up in, aside from a surge in support for the SNP in 1974, when the party returned 11 MPs to Westminster, the defining divide was between Labour and Conservative, just as it was elsewhere in the UK. That Labour-Tory duopoly endured in England. But in Scotland it started to change in the 1980s. In the Thatcher decade, Labour returned stronger and stronger majorities, eventually winning 50 of Scotland’s 72 seats. The Tories dwindled until, in 1997, they were wiped out completely. For the next 20 years, the Scottish Conservatives had only one MP in the House of Commons, or none at all. The Conservative Party began to look more and more like a mainstream party in England alone. But Labour’s socio-economic base - the communities which had grown up around Scotland’s traditional heavy industries - was gradually being eroded. Shipyard at Greenock, circa 1964 One after another the shipyards, the coal fields, the steelworks closed. Industrial decline was dramatic, rapid and painful. It changed the country’s sense of itself. It is easy to see now - though it wasn’t so clear then - that those communities were bedrocks not just of Labour solidarity; they were also pillars of British identity in Scotland. If you were a miner in Midlothian, you were bound into a community of shared interest with miners in Yorkshire and South Wales. You worked for the great pan-British enterprise of coal extraction. The same applied to shipbuilding, and steel and motor manufacturing. And it all, or almost all, went. Go to the Ravenscraig site now and you wouldn’t know there had ever been anything industrial there.

If you were a miner in Midlothian, you were bound into a community of shared interest with miners in Yorkshire and South Wales. You worked for the great pan-British enterprise of coal extraction. The same applied to shipbuilding, and steel and motor manufacturing. And it all, or almost all, went. Go to the Ravenscraig site now and you wouldn’t know there had ever been anything industrial there. It is a vast green emptiness that has only, in the past few years, begun to undergo redevelopment.  There is a new college, an impressive indoor sports centre, and the beginnings of new housing. I met Jim Fraser there, walking his dog Poppy. Jim Fraser Jim trained as an engineer at Ravenscraig in the late 60s and worked there until the plant closed in 1992. He was part of a workforce that had overwhelmingly voted Labour for decades. Jim began to vote SNP in the 1980s. But he was in a minority. It was, for the most part, a lost cause trying to persuade workers who owed secure jobs and good pensions to a state-owned company called British Steel to vote for the break-up of that state. Jim is a member of the SNP and in 2014 campaigned for independence. Two years later he voted Remain. “I mean look at it,” he says, with a sweep of the arm around the empty wasteland of the site. “This used to be buildings. Everything here. Steel-making. The closure changed everything in this area. Yes - it changed the way people vote.” At the 2015 General Election, Labour was almost wiped out in Scotland. After winning every election for nearly half a century the party held on to only one seat - Edinburgh South. The SNP won 56 seats - all but three of Scotland’s total. In North Lanarkshire, a huge Labour majority was overturned by the SNP. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon in Motherwell, 2015 How did Labour’s Fortress Scotland fall so dramatically? The answer lies in the way the 2014 independence referendum changed the question in Scotland. After that long campaign, politics in Scotland no longer revolved principally around the question: “Who do you want to govern?” The question instead is: “What state do you want to be governed in?” For now, the Union still commands a consistent majority (but a narrow one) in theopinion polls. Support for independence has held firm in the mid 40s. But how does Brexit change the equation? Does it make independence more or less likely? Martine Nolan trained as an engineer at Strathclyde University. She works for a fabrication and construction company with a plant outside Motherwell that employs 120 people. In the yard are the components of a large steel bridge her company is building for a railway crossing in Lincolnshire. About half of what the company makes is for customers in England and Wales. She voted to stay in both Unions - the UK in 2014 and the EU two years later. Martine Nolan “People are discussing Brexit as an idea,” she says. “They forget that it’s people’s lives. It’s children with nothing on their plates, families going to bed at night cold because they can’t afford the heating. I saw enough of it after the ‘Craig shut. We’re just starting to recover. I don’t want to see that again. “Why would we want to put further risk and uncertainty into our lives by coming out of the UK? Do you want to see two, three generations of people here with no work? Because that’s what happened here [when Ravenscraig closed].” But you can feel a different mood among younger people. I arranged to meet a local band rehearsing at the Motherwell Business Centre. The Banter Thiefs are four young men who were at school together and who’ve been playing gigs around Scotland and elsewhere in Europe for years. They are all strongly for an independent Scotland - and they all voted Remain. The Banter Thiefs “For me the Brexit vote was about immigration,” Derek the bass player tells me. “Scotland is still a place of low immigration compared to places like London, but I don’t think Scotland scaremongers about immigration in the same way as in other places. We are a welcoming country. Scotland needs immigrants. It’s got an ageing population. We need people to come and work here and study here. We don’t want policies based on fear.” The others nod their agreement. “I think Brexit strengthens the case for independence. Am I more European or more British? Definitely more European.” I ask Derek whether he supported a second referendum, a People’s Vote. His answer is more concerned with the precedent it would set for the next independence referendum than it was with overturning Brexit. “I think supporting a People’s Vote is a mistake for the SNP,” he says. “It could come back to bite them. If we vote for independence in the future and the negotiations go badly then people might say after six months or two years - we need to vote again. And we could lose it then. I think that’s really detrimental.” On a building site earlier that day I had fallen into conversation with a tiler, working on a bathroom in a new house. I mentioned that I was going to see the Banter Thiefs. “Oh yeah,” he says. “Very pro-independence.” Chris Roarty Chris Roarty is a 23-year-old Labour activist. “Brexit has reinforced my belief that we should stay here in the UK. It’s a huge wake-up call on the risk and uncertainty of leaving,” he says Although the SNP campaigned to remain, Chris sees a parallel between its 2014 independence plan, and Brexit. “I think the Leave campaign and the independence campaign, when they were presented with facts on the economy, just said, ‘Oh that’s scaremongering’. But we’re seeing now that negotiations to leave a union can be really difficult. I don’t think we should be risking that again by breaking away from the UK. We can’t go into the unknown. There’s a huge economic risk. We should be opening doors not closing them.” Many in the SNP assumed that Brexit would lead to spike in support for independence. It hasn’t happened; at least not yet. Why not? When you glance at that solid block of Remain yellow on the map of Scotland it’s easy to overlook the fact that a million people in Scotland voted to leave the EU - 38% of those who voted. Of the 45% who voted for independence, as many as one in three supported leaving the EU. Anecdotally, one senior SNP official I spoke to conceded that while many people had moved from No to Yes on independence, there had been movement in the opposite direction too, among people who voted yes in 2014 but don’t want to be taken back into the EU by a future independent Scotland. Scottish independence supporter, Glasgow, March 2019 There’s also been  a revival of Tory fortunes in Scotland. For a generation, the Conservatives had appeared moribund. But after the election of Ruth Davidson as leader, the party repositioned itself. At the 2017 election, Conservatives in Scotland took the decision not to campaign on the same message as their counterparts in England. There wasn’t much talk in Scotland of “strong and stable government with Theresa May”. Instead, Davidson’s party campaigned on opposition to a second independence referendum, which Nicola Sturgeon had said was now inevitable. The Tories therefore offered themselves to the electorate as the party most robustly committed to defending the Union. It worked. Even North Lanarkshire Council, which includes Motherwell, has Tory councillors. Their leader is Meghan Gallacher. I ask her, too, whether she thought Brexit made independence more or less likely. She says it wouldn’t have any effect. Meghan Gallacher “In terms of the independence question, Brexit doesn't change that. In 2014, the people of Scotland voted No, they voted to reject independence,” she says. “In 2016, the UK then collectively voted to leave the European Union. “They are not linked. They are two separate referendums.” This is difficult terrain for the Tories. This is an echo of the 1980s and 90s, when Scotland returned large Labour majorities at election after election, only to wake the next morning to find that the Conservative Prime Minister in Downing Street was installing a team of Tory ministers to govern Scotland from St Andrew’s House in Edinburgh. The Conservative Party throughout this period countered the “no mandate” argument by asserting that as a constituent part of the UK, it was right and just that Scotland should be governed according to the democratically expressed wishes of the UK as a whole. It didn’t cut much ice with the public. Opposition to Westminster’s right to choose Scotland’s government gained popular traction, and by the late 1990s there was overwhelming public support for a devolved Scottish parliament. I asked Meghan Gallacher whether the Conservatives were in danger of walking that path again - in effect telling the Scottish electorate that it was right that their desire to remain in the EU should be disregarded because the UK as a whole had voted to leave. She said she believed Brexit would do no harm to the Union. “I don't believe that people went out and voted solely [in the independence referendum of 2014] on the subject of the European Union. “People went out and rejected independence because they believed in the United Kingdom. They believed in the economic benefits, the social benefits the United Kingdom brings to Scotland.” But the lesson of the 1980s and 90s is clear: if Scotland has to live with decisions that it rejected at the polls, but which the rest of the UK adopted and subsequently imposed in Scotland, there will be a price to pay. Rule nothing out. Brexit has taught us that the electorate either dismiss warnings of economic disruption as scaremongering, or decide that they care less about the economic consequences than they do about national sovereignty. And whether you are for or against Brexit, for or against independence, expect that assertion, the one I first heard on a yacht in Southampton - “It’s not easy being told what to do by another country” - to acquire a new force in Scotland, if in the years of negotiation that lie ahead, the key decisions will be made, and the key deals struck, by a UK government in London. It is a vast green emptiness that has only, in the past few years, begun to undergo redevelopment.  There is a new college, an impressive indoor sports centre, and the beginnings of new housing.

Brexit has divided Britain bitterly. We are going through arguably the most profound re-orientation since World War II. The referendum posed a binary question to which there were multiple answers. Those who fought the Leave campaign quickly divided, after their victory, on what Leave meant. Much of the country feels cheated. Remainers feel cheated because they believe the Leave campaign scraped over the 50% mark by lying about how easy leaving the EU would be,  by insisting that Britain would “hold all the cards” and that the UK could have all the benefits of full membership without any of the responsibilities - having its cake and eating it. And Leavers feel cheated because the result was clear and we still haven’t left. Many believe a “liberal establishment” is sabotaging Brexit, often in secret. There is widespread contempt for MPs and for the institution of parliament. A stab-in-the-back narrative is gaining traction. If Brexit goes wrong, or if it doesn’t happen, there will be a search for scapegoats. The Leave vote was, in many places, an expression of revolt against a perceived powerlessness - of “not being included in the game called Great Britain” as Danny Flynn in Stoke-on-Trent put it to me. How much more powerless will those communities feel if Brexit, in the end, doesn’t happen? “We’re the only country in the world with Great in front of its name,” John Chadwick in Wigan said. “What is there to be frightened of?” We’re also one of the few countries in the world with United in its name. If the last three years have damaged our democracy, they have also raised new and pressing questions about whether the UK will emerge from this process as a single state. For those of us old enough to remember how the 1980s affected the attitude of Scots toward devolution, the next few years look like fertile territory for the independence movement. This trip has been a sobering exercise. Whatever emerges in the years that lie ahead, the UK has some work to do in repairing its democracy, in restoring trust between the institutions of political power and the governed. For the inescapable conclusion is this: almost three years after voting for the most radical change in the country’s destiny, almost nobody is unequivocally happy. And everybody believes they know who’s to blame. Recrimination hangs in the air. Don’t we need to have a serious conversation about how that has happened? Built with Shorthand"
"Carney: No deal risk 'alarmingly high'It is ""absolute nonsense"" a no-deal Brexit could be easily managed, Bank of England governor says.","The risk of Britain stumbling into a ""disorderly"" no-deal Brexit is now ""alarmingly high"", Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned. He told Sky News that although ""real progress"" had been made preparing for leaving without a deal, it would still mean ""lots of things to worry about"". And it was ""absolute nonsense"" a no deal could be easily managed, he said. BBC economics correspondent Dharshini David said critics will see the remarks as another political intervention. Last August the governor said the risk of the UK leaving without a deal ""felt uncomfortably high"", and his latest comments appear to ratchet up the language. He said that since his remarks last year the situation had not got any better. ""Unfortunately I think it proved accurate. It's alarmingly high now."" Britain's default option is that it leaves the EU on 12 April. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May held talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to try to find a way out of the current deadlock.But that drew criticism from some Conservative Tory MPs. Mr Carney told Sky News,external: ""We're in a situation where the expressed will of Parliament is for some form of deal, so to put it in the double negative - Parliament is against no deal, the government, as expressed by the prime minister, is against no deal, the European Union is against no deal, and yet it is a possibility, it is the default option. ""So no deal would happen by accident, it would happen suddenly, there would be no transition - it is an accidental disorderly Brexit."" He took aim at the idea promoted by several Brexiteers - and included in the Malthouse Compromise plan - which assumes that Article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would allow free trade to continue with the EU while negotiations are in progress. ""Forget the fiction, it's absolute nonsense. It needs to be called out,"" he said. ""I might point out that they want to become better acquainted with the Secretary of State for Trade [Liam Fox] who in Parliament has made the point that it cannot apply unless both parties agree, and unless you're moving towards a - guess what - a customs union."" Mr Carney insisted that London's financial centre was ready to cope with the impact of a no-deal Brexit. ""There are a lot of things to worry about in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but the financial sector is not one of them,"" he said.

Biden pledges to respect 'personal space',"This video can not be played Joe Biden addresses allegations against him Joe Biden has pledged to be ""more mindful"" about physical contact with women, hoping to draw a line under a controversy that has clouded his expected White House bid. The former US vice-president posted a video on Twitter saying he will in future respect personal space. Mr Biden stressed he has only ever intended to build a ""human connection"", rather than make anyone uncomfortable. He has not yet announced whether he will join the 2020 Democratic field. Joe Biden stumbles in age of #MeToo Joe Biden, the touchy-feely politician ""Social norms are changing, I understand that, and I've heard what these women are saying,"" Mr Biden, 76, said in a tweet accompanying the video, which looked like it had been recorded on a mobile phone. In the clip, Mr Biden acknowledged being hands-on with constituents throughout his long career in politics. ""It's the way I've always been, it's the way I try to show I care about them and I'm listening,"" he said. But Mr Biden acknowledged his past behaviour may not meet contemporary standards. ""The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset,"" he said. ""I understand it and I'll be much more mindful."" His statement follows accusations against him of unwelcome touching from four women in recent days. Joe Biden denies misconduct allegations Second woman accuses Biden of misconduct Allegations no bar to Biden bid - Pelosi Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state assembly member, last week said that Mr Biden had kissed her on the back of the head at a 2014 campaign event. This week a second woman, Amy Lappos, said Mr Biden had rubbed noses with her at a fundraiser in 2009. On Tuesday, Caitlyn Caruso, a 22-year-old former college student, told the New York Times that at an event three years ago Mr Biden rested his hand on her thigh ""even as she squirmed in her seat to show her discomfort"". Mr Biden is expected to announce a bid for President A 59-year-old writer, DJ Hill, told the newspaper that at a fundraising event in 2012 Mr Biden put his hand on her shoulder and then started dropping it down her back, which made her ""very uncomfortable"". Mr Biden's spokesman said earlier this week that neither the former vice-president nor his staff had had any idea that Ms Flores felt uncomfortable during her interaction with him. The veteran Delaware politician himself issued a statement this week, vowing to ""pay attention"" to Ms Flores, while maintaining he did not remember the incident. Lucy Flores speaking at a 2014 Nevada campaign event with Joe Biden behind her The reaction among Democrats toward Mr Biden has been mixed. White House hopefuls Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar had called upon Mr Biden to answer the accusations. But House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended him, saying the allegations should not disqualify a presidential run. In the wake of the controversy, a pro-Trump political action committee, the Great America, released a video titled ""Creepy Joe Biden"". The video, which uses cable TV footage of Ms Flores, suggests the former vice-president is setting a bad example for US children. President Donald Trump has been taunting Mr Biden, suggesting the accusations were put forward by the Democratic party's left wing. ""He's being taken care of pretty well by the socialists,"" Mr Trump told a National Republican Congressional Committee on Tuesday evening. ""They got to him."" More than a dozen women have previously accused Mr Trump of sexual misconduct. Find out who is already running and who might join them.

'No cap' on Windrush compensation claims,"This video can not be played Glenda Caesar wants compensation for loss of earnings, stress, and lost pension There is ""no limit"" to the amount of money that could be paid out to victims of the Windrush scandal, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid said he hoped the scheme would ""right the wrongs"" of a ""mistake that should never have happened"". Thousands of people were wrongly targeted by the ""hostile environment"" strategy for illegal immigration. Many of those affected were people from Caribbean countries who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971. People from other Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries who arrived in the UK before 1988 were also affected and are eligible to apply for compensation, Mr Javid said in a Commons statement. The estates of people who have died whilst waiting for their status would also be allowed to make a claim, he added. Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Formal apology for Windrush members Windrush row over criminal deportation flight Mr Javid said the ""unacceptable treatment"" experienced by some members of the Windrush generation, which came to public attention in late 2017, was of ""profound regret"". The home secretary said he hoped the compensation scheme goes ""some way"" to delivering justice for those affected. He added there was no cap for the amount of compensation that could be paid out per claim but the ""baseline estimate"" for total payouts was Â£200m. This video can not be played Amanda Kirton: ""It's all of our history"" A Home Office impact assessment estimates that the scheme will cost between Â£49m and Â£587m - taking compensation and operational costs into account. The assessment says there's ""significant uncertainty"" about the costs because it was unclear how many people will apply. Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the announcement was ""short on detail"". ""While we welcome the creation of a compensation scheme, we know that money cannot buy back the years the victims have lost to destitution and anguish - nor can it compensate for the despair they felt at losing jobs, homes, health and a sense of identity and rightful pride in their contribution to the UK"", he said. One of those caught up in the scandal, Glenda Caesar, lost her job as a NHS administrator at a doctors surgery because she no longer had a British passport to prove her identity. She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she ""couldn't work or receive benefits"" and describes getting to a stage where ""I just wanted to take some tablets and sleep"". Asked what she hopes to get from the Home Office scheme, she said: ""Validate my loss of earnings, validate the emotional distress I've had to go through. I'm asking for not millions... but look at what I was earning, my pension - 10 years of my pension I lost as well - validate that."" Willow Sims (left) lost her right to work in the UK, despite having lived in the country since she was four Willow Sims, another person affected,says she is torn, as she ""doesn't care about the money"" and wants to ""not feel like a criminal"" so she can move on. But she says she sees her children struggling, can't pay the rent, and is having to borrow money from friends and family. ""I need to at least recoup what I have lost"", she says. There's no cap on how much overall compensation someone can receive under the scheme but many categories have set payments. For example, a person who was unlawfully deported will get Â£10,000; those detained for over 30 minutes are entitled to Â£500 per hour for the first three hours, followed by lower hourly rates if they're held for longer; and people wrongly made homeless can expect Â£250 per month, up to a maximum of Â£25,000. With so many variables it's not surprising there's wide variation on how much the scheme will cost. Officials in the Home Office say the final amount will range from Â£49m to Â£587m, depending on how many people apply; Sajid Javid says it's likely to be around Â£200m. To give a sense of scale, that will be more than the Â£154m in compensation paid out to 40,000 victims of crime in England, Scotland and Wales last year under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. More information on the scheme can be foundhere,external. Meanwhile, victims of the Windrush scandal claim they have been snubbed from an official reception to launch the compensation scheme. Immigration lawyer Jacqueline McKenzie says she was asked to invite a handful of her clients to a ""Windrush engagement"" event, but only two of the six clients she represented were sent invitations. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK She says it proves ""nothing has been learned"" by the Home Office and that ""this group continues to be treated with contempt"". She said: ""There will be drinks and canapes, and you know the black bourgeoisie, as I call them, the glitterati - they'll all be there."" But Ms McKenzie says the event should have been about ""discussing this seriously with the people who work with Windrush [victims] and people who are affected by the scandal."" She also criticised the government for failures in setting up a hardship fund after the scandal came to light, saying ""hardly anyone"" been granted emergency support by the Home Office to date. Sajid Javid told the House Of Commons that nine people have been awarded money from the hardship fund, which was set up last year to help victims in immediate need  - whilst they waited for the launch of the compensation scheme.

"Brunei to punish gay sex with deathThe move by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's government means gay men could face ""medieval"" stoning.Asia","Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei Brunei is introducing strict new Islamic laws that make anal sex and adultery offences punishable by stoning to death. The new measures, that come into force on Wednesday, also cover a range of other crimes including punishment for theft by amputation. The move has sparked international condemnation. Brunei's gay community has expressed shock and fear at the ""medieval punishments"". ""You wake up and realise that your neighbours, your family or even that nice old lady that sells prawn fritters by the side of the road doesn't think you're human, or is okay with stoning,"" one Bruneian gay man, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. The sultan of the small South-East Asian nation on Wednesday called for ""stronger"" Islamic teachings. ""I want to see Islamic teachings in this country grow stronger,"" Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said in a public address, according to AFP news agency, without mentioning the strict new interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. Brunei: What you need to know Where is gay sex still against the law? What is Sharia? Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Muslims make up about two-thirds of the country's population of 420,000. Brunei has retained the death penalty but has not carried out an execution since 1957. The law mostly applies to Muslims, including children who have reached puberty, though some aspects will apply to non-Muslims. Under the new laws,individuals accused of certain acts will be convicted if they confess or if there were witnesses present.,external Offences such as rape, adultery, sodomy, robbery and insult or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad will carry the maximum penalty of death.,external Lesbian sex carries a different penalty of 40 strokes of the cane and/or a maximum of 10 years in jail The punishment for theft is amputation Those who ""persuade, tell or encourage"" Muslim children under the age of 18 ""to accept the teachings of religions other than Islam"" are liable to a fine or jail Individuals who have not reached puberty but are convicted of certain offences may be instead subjected to whipping. Sultan Hassanal heads the Brunei Investment Agency which owns the Dorchester Collection, an operator of some of the world's top hotels including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. Brunei's ruling royals possess a huge private fortune and its largely ethnic Malay residents enjoy generous state handouts and pay no taxes. ButHollywood actor George Clooney and other celebrities have now called for a boycott of the luxury hotels.TV host Ellen DeGeneres also called for people to ""rise up"", saying ""we need to do something now"".

The hotel operator said it did ""not tolerate any form of discrimination"". ""Dorchester Collection's code emphasises equality, respect and integrity in all areas of our operation, and strongly values people and cultural diversity amongst our guests and employees,"" it said. ""Inclusion and diversity remain core beliefs."" In another development,a honorary degree awarded by the UK's University of Aberdeen to Sultan Hassanal is under review. The country first introduced Sharia law in 2014 despite widespread condemnation, giving it a dual legal system with both Sharia and Common Law. The sultan had said then that the new penal code would come into full force over several years. The first phase, which covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines, was implemented in 2014. Brunei had delayed introducing the final two phases, which cover crimes punishable by amputation and stoning. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who is also the prime minister of Brunei, is among the wealthiest people in the world But on Saturday, the government released a statement on its website sayingthe Sharia penal code would be fully implemented on Wednesday,external. In the days since, there has been international outrage and calls for the country to reverse course. ""These abusive provisions received widespread condemnation when plans were first discussed five years ago,"" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, a Brunei researcher at Amnesty International. ""Brunei's penal code is a deeply flawed piece of legislation containing a range of provisions that violate human rights."" The United Nations echoed the statement, calling the legislation ""cruel, inhuman and degrading"", and saying it marked a ""serious setback"" for human rights protection. Maldives annuls woman's stoning ruling How many countries still have the death penalty? According to rights group Human Rights Without Frontiers,stoning is still a punishment in countries such as Iran, Somalia and Sudan among others,external. There are several theories, but Matthew Woolfe, founder of human rights group The Brunei Project, said it could be linked to Brunei's weakening economy. ""One theory is that it is a way for the government to strengthen its hold on power in the face of a declining economy that could potentially lead to some unrest in future,"" Mr Woolfe told the BBC. ""Connected to this is [Brunei's] interest in attracting more investment from the Muslim world, along with more Islamic touristsâ¦ this could be seen as one way of appealing to this market."" One rights group says the tightening Sharia laws might be a way for the government to strengthen its hold on power Mr Woolfe also added that the government might have hoped to get away with the latest roll-out without anyone realising. ""I think that the government did want to ensure that the international uproar that followed implementation of the first phase in 2014 had well and truly died down before further [implementation], in the hope it would just quietly [do so] without anyone realising,"" he said. ""It wasn't until increasing international attention that it finally came out and confirmed [this]."" The penal code changes were posted on the attorney general's website in December but only came to public attention in late March. There was no public announcement. One 40-year-old gay Bruneian currently seeking asylum in Canada said the impact of the new penal code was already being felt in Brunei. The ex-government employee, who left Brunei last year after being charged with sedition for a Facebook post that was critical of the government, said people were ""afraid"". ""The gay community in Brunei has never been open but when Grindr [a gay dating app] came that helped people meet in secret. But now, what I've heard is that hardly anyone is using Grindr anymore,"" Shahiran S Shahrani Md told the BBC. ""They're afraid that they might talk to a police officer pretending to be gay. It hasn't happened yet but because of the new laws, people are afraid,"" he said. Another male Bruneian, who is not gay but has renounced Islam, said he felt ""fearful and numb"" in the face of the laws being implemented. ""We ordinary citizens are powerless to stop Sharia law from being implemented,"" said the 23-year-old, who did not want to be identified. ""Under Sharia, I would face the death penalty for apostasy."" One gay man was hopeful that the laws might not be enforced widely. ""Honestly, I'm not too scared as the government here often bluffs with the harsh punishments. But it can and will still happen even with it being rare."" It is very unlikely to happen at all, people inside Brunei have told Bill Hayton, associate fellow with the Asia Pacific programme at Chatham House. ""What I'm hearing from people in Brunei is that this is very, very unlikely to ever happen,"" he told BBC Radio Four. For instance, the laws stipulate that there must be four Muslim witnesses to the act of anal sex or adultery for it to be prosecuted, he said. ""The way it is being explained to me is that this is a way for the sultan to look religious but make sure that none of these punishments will actually be carried out,"" Mr Hayton said.

"Former Concorde pilot and wife found deadThe bodies of Tony Meadows and his wife Paula, both in their 80s, were discovered at their home.Berkshire","Tony Meadows and his wife Paula were found dead on Tuesday A former Concorde pilot and his wife have been found dead at their home. The bodies of Tony Meadows and his wife Paula, both in their 80s, were discovered on Tuesday near the west Berkshire village of Bucklebury. Mr Meadows was part of the crew during Concorde's first passenger flight from Heathrow to New York in 1977. Thames Valley Police has launched a murder investigation but is not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Officers were called to the property in Pot Kiln Lane at about 19:35 BST. A forensic tent has been set up on land outside the property. Det Ch Insp Andy Howard said it was a ""tragic incident"" and there was no danger to the public. ""We are aware that Bucklebury is a small community and this will have an impact on its residents [and] as such people will see an increased police presence,"" he added. Police have been investigating at the couple's home near Bucklebury in west Berkshire Mr Meadows previously told the BBC in an interview for Points West that he had flown Concorde for 14 years. He said one of the highlights of his career was flying the Queen to Bahrain in 1979. A family friend said the Meadows had lived alone in their farmhouse for 35 years. She said she had spoken to one of their three ""devastated"" children on Wednesday morning. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ""They can't understand it. They haven't been able to get their minds around it really. ""Paula has dementia so she hadn't been very well for quite a while. ""But Tony always took care of her and looked after her very well, and took her for walks. ""He was a very caring person, very friendly."" Tony Meadows had previously talked about his career as a Concorde captain on BBC Points West Neighbours in nearby Frilsham spoke of their shock over the couple's deaths. One said she saw the ""nice couple"" occasionally at lunches. The woman said Mr Meadows had recently discovered he trained in the RAF with another local resident. ""They knew of each other but Tony arrived with a photograph and said 'I recognised your smile as soon as I saw you' and started talking about how he flew Concorde,"" she said.

PM defends Brexit talks with Corbyn,"Theresa May has responded to criticism from her own MPs over talks with Jeremy Corbyn by saying all MPs have a responsibility to deliver Brexit. The PM said the public ""expect us to reach across this House to find a way through this"". Mr Corbyn said he welcomed the PM's ""willingness to compromise to resolve the Brexit deadlock"". The PM's move to hold talks has angered some Brexiteers, with two ministers resigning over it. Chris Heaton-Harris became the latest to quit on Wednesday afternoon,external, claiming his job at the Department for Exiting the European Union had become ""irrelevant"" if the government is not prepared to leave without a deal. Wales Minister Nigel Adams also resigned his role on Wednesday morning, saying the government was at risk of failing to deliver ""the Brexit people voted for"". The PM met Mr Corbyn before holding talks with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford. Ms Sturgeon - who also met Mr Corbyn earlier - said she had ""good"" and ""open"" conversations with both leaders, and while she believed Mr Corbyn would ""drive a hard bargain"", she was ""still not entirely clear"" where the prime minister was willing to compromise. The SNP leader, who backs a further referendum and wants to remain in the EU, told reporters: ""My concern is that in the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking, what will happen over the next few days... is a bad compromise will be reached."" Kuenssberg: PM chooses a deal over party unity Brexitcast: Theresa's Choice We must leave the EU, says attorney general The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, Plaid Cymru and the Independent Group have also held a joint press conference, calling for any decision made by the leaders to be put to a public vote. From left to right: Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, The Independent Group MP Chuka Umunna, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville-Roberts and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, said: ""People have the opportunity to have another shot at it, [in the Commons], to change their mind. ""Surely if that is how democracy works here, then democracy should go back to the people and people should have their say on whatever model comes forward."" What are the Brexit sticking points? The UK has until 12 April to propose a plan to the EU - which must be accepted by the bloc - or it will leave without a deal on that date. In a statement on Tuesday night, the PM announced she wanted to meet Mr Corbyn to agree a way forward and put the plan to a vote in the Commons before 10 April - when the EU will hold an emergency summit on Brexit. She insisted her withdrawal agreement - which was voted down last week - would remain part of the deal. If there is no agreement between the two leaders, Mrs May said a number of options would be put to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"". In either event, Mrs May said she would ask the EU for a further short extension to hopefully get an agreement passed by Parliament before 22 May, so the UK does not have to take part in European elections. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Brexiteers were quick to express their anger at the prime minister's move. But at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said she wanted to deliver Brexit ""in an orderly way"" and, to do that, ""we have to get an agreement through the House"". And Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay blamed hard Brexiteers in the pro-Leave European Research Group for making the PM move to these talks. This video can not be played ""I'm absolutely appalled"" Mrs May told MPs there were a ""number of areas"" where she agreed with Mr Corbyn in relation to Brexit, including ending free movement. The Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkarsaid the talks were ""timely"", and he hoped Mr Corbyn would ""rise to the occasion"" and ""come up with a compromise plan"" with the prime minister. The PM's negotiated plan includes two sections - the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. The withdrawal agreement sets out how the UK would leave the EU, including the money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period, and citizens' rights - as well as the controversial Irish backstop that aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The political declaration focuses on the future relationship with the bloc and, unlike the withdrawal agreement, is not legally binding. Mrs May said on Tuesday that any plan she agreed with Mr Corbyn ""would have to agree the current withdrawal agreement"", but she was ready to discuss the future relationship, i.e. the political declaration. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay also said that was the element Labour had expressed more concern about. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said there was not much difference between the government's version of Brexit and Labour's version - but there did not seem to be ""an enormous amount of confidence"" a political consensus could be reached from either party. The row comesafter Mrs May had more than seven hours of talks with her cabinet on Tuesday. Laura Kuenssberg said there was ""rage and dispute"" in the cabinet meeting, with ""wildly varying accounts"" of how many people were for and against different versions of Brexit extensions. Labour has previously said it has five demand for supporting a Brexit deal, including protecting workers' rights and national security, and securing the same benefits of being in the single market the UK has currently. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of MPs will attempt to push throughlegislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. If agreed, the bill - presented by Labour MP Yvette Cooper - would require the PM by law to ask for an extension of Article 50. MPs took part in a three-hour debate on a business motion to set out how proceedings would run throughout evening. But a vote on an amendment to the motion, put forward by Labour's Hilary Benn, calling for time on Monday to hold more indicative votes, resulted in a draw - the first time such a result has happened in 39 years. The Speaker John Bercow then used his casting vote to reject the amendment, meaning MPs will not have the indicative votes next week. The overall business motion was passed, but by just one vote - with 312 MPs voting for it, and 311 against. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, Greens and the Independent Group are putting forward an amendment to the bill to again call for a public vote on any outcome to become law. The approximate timings of the day are: 17:30 BSTVoting on the business motion setting out tonight's process 19:00- A second reading vote on the bill 22:00- Committee stage starts (this stage usually starts within a couple of weeks of a bill's second reading) and finally third reading vote Thursday- Bill could be considered by the House of Lords Other key dates coming up include: Wednesday 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek / EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

But there is some fact in it.
For good periods we were very much in the game. They can turn opportunities
into brilliance. I was disappointed
with the first goal â we generally defend well there. Itâs hard to do anything about the
second and third - they were top quality. ""Against the quality theyâve got that [trying to defend and
hope to score your chances] can only be the game plan. If we were good enough
to take the game to them that would be wonderful but weâre not. ""The quality can wear you down. We needed to show more [going forward]. ""Anthony Knockaert had our best chance of the game late on. It wasnât
like we gave up which is important. I canât fault what the players gave."" On the relegation scrap... ""Itâs going to be a battle. There isnât anybody around us not

the FA Cup tie on Saturday [semi-final v Man City]. Very quickly after that itâs about doing enough to stay
in the division."" FT: Tottenham 2-0 Crystal Palace Garth CrooksBBC Sport football expert on BBC Radio 5 live I think there was a little bit of anxiety in the stadium tonight because the fans wanted them to win so badly.

Suddenly for Spurs, the drive into the stadium is different, their family are sat in different parts of the stadium and you could almost treat every game in the run-in as an away fixture.

Adrian Re the empty seats comments (didn't realise every other stadium sold out for every game) - no allowance to be made for the fact we're at Wembley at the weekend and some people might not have been able to afford tonight? Daniel, Manchester FT: Tottenham 2-0 Crystal Palace Garth CrooksBBC Sport football expert on BBC Radio 5 live As the fans leave, the stadium takes on a different sense of beauty. As the atmosphere started to build before kick off, it was very exciting and then there was one moment when 17,000 people to our right started to sing in unison. It was emotional and it was a wonderful occasion and it's important that Spurs won today. They go back to third and they were capable of keeping a clean sheet. There was a bit of anxiety in the final 15 minutes and Spurs will need more confidence when Man City come here in a very different proposition. They got through it and they won quite comfortably in the end. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Former Concorde pilot and wife found deadThe bodies of Tony Meadows and his wife Paula, both in their 80s, were discovered at their home.","Tony Meadows and his wife Paula were found dead on Tuesday A former Concorde pilot and his wife have been found dead at their home. The bodies of Tony Meadows and his wife Paula, both in their 80s, were discovered on Tuesday near the west Berkshire village of Bucklebury. Mr Meadows was part of the crew during Concorde's first passenger flight from Heathrow to New York in 1977. Thames Valley Police has launched a murder investigation but is not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. Officers were called to the property in Pot Kiln Lane at about 19:35 BST. A forensic tent has been set up on land outside the property. Det Ch Insp Andy Howard said it was a ""tragic incident"" and there was no danger to the public. ""We are aware that Bucklebury is a small community and this will have an impact on its residents [and] as such people will see an increased police presence,"" he added. Police have been investigating at the couple's home near Bucklebury in west Berkshire Mr Meadows previously told the BBC in an interview for Points West that he had flown Concorde for 14 years. He said one of the highlights of his career was flying the Queen to Bahrain in 1979. A family friend said the Meadows had lived alone in their farmhouse for 35 years. She said she had spoken to one of their three ""devastated"" children on Wednesday morning. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ""They can't understand it. They haven't been able to get their minds around it really. ""Paula has dementia so she hadn't been very well for quite a while. ""But Tony always took care of her and looked after her very well, and took her for walks. ""He was a very caring person, very friendly."" Tony Meadows had previously talked about his career as a Concorde captain on BBC Points West Neighbours in nearby Frilsham spoke of their shock over the couple's deaths. One said she saw the ""nice couple"" occasionally at lunches. The woman said Mr Meadows had recently discovered he trained in the RAF with another local resident. ""They knew of each other but Tony arrived with a photograph and said 'I recognised your smile as soon as I saw you' and started talking about how he flew Concorde,"" she said.

"Accused Briton 'wrote of joy fighting IS'Aidan James wrote of the ""amazing time"" he had fighting on the ""front line"", a court hears.","Aidan James denies terrorism offences A British man wrote of his joy at fighting against the Islamic State group, describing it as ""the biggest threat since Hitler"", a court heard. Aidan James, 28, of Formby, Merseyside, had no previous military knowledge when he allegedly set out to join the war in 2017 alongside the YPG Kurdish militia. The Old Bailey heard that in diary entries he told how he got ""a kill"" and was ""playing my part in this war and feel good to be a part of history"". Mr James denies terrorism offences. He is accused of receiving training from the PKK before going on to fight with the People's Protection Unit known as the YPG in Syria. On the second day of his trial, the jury was shown Facebook pictures of Mr James posing with YPG insignia wearing military garb. In a December 2017 diary entry, he allegedly wrote: ""The situation with Turkey continues to worsen the war is long from over but I am playing my part in this war and feel good to be a part of history and with the revolutionary force of YPG. ""Daesh is the biggest threat the world has seen since Hitler so anything I can do in these operations is good."" Aidan James posted this image on Facebook in August 2017 In an earlier entry, Mr James allegedly wrote of his group's ""quest to vanquish Daesh from this place"" and how he got ""a kill"" that day. The court heard how a police negotiator was in email contact with him, promising to support him and discuss his return to Liverpool. Mr James wrote of the ""amazing time"" he had fighting on the ""front line numerous times"", killing Islamic State soldiers. The court heard he returned to Liverpool John Lennon airport on 14 February last year. Mr James denies engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and two charges of attending a place used for terrorist training. The trial continues.

"We must leave the EU, says attorney general","This video can not be played Attorney General Geoffrey Cox: ""Once we are out, we are out"" It is an ""article of faith"" that the UK must leave the EU to honour the referendum result, Geoffrey Cox says. The attorney general told the BBC a customs union was ""not desirable"" but if that was the only way of leaving the EU, he would take it. He suggested the government's only option was to ""seek with Labour some common ground"" for a ""swift exit"". And he suggested that the UK could not be bound into a customs arrangement permanently. It comes as the Brexit secretary says rejection of the PM's deal would mean a ""soft Brexit or no Brexit at all"". Meanwhile, the PM has responded to criticism from her own party over talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn by saying all MPs had a responsibility to deliver Brexit. PM defends Brexit talks with Corbyn What are the Brexit sticking points? Laura's blog: Cox's message is 'it's worth it' In an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cox, who has provided the government and MPs with legal advice on Brexit, said the UK could not be bound into a customs union permanently. ""If we decided, in some considerable years time that we wanted to review our membership of any such customs union if we signed it - and I'm not saying we will - that's a matter for negotiation and discussion. ""There's nothing to stop us removing ourselves from that arrangement, so we can't look at these things as permanent straitjackets upon this country."" Mr Cox said he was ""completely convinced"" the UK had to leave the EU. ""We promised this country that we would do so, we promised it that we would honour the outcome of the referendum,"" he said. ""The referendum said leave and leave we must."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button He said: ""The remorseless logic of numbers [in the House of Commons]... means that the only way, unless the prime minister's deal is to be voted through, is to seek with Labour some common ground, so that we can effect a swift exit."" He said if it was a choice between not leaving and leaving with a customs union, he would ""take leaving every single time"". And Mr Cox warned that if the UK does not drop some of its ""red lines"", it risks never leaving at all.

What are Brexit sticking points?,"Cross-party talks between the Conservatives and Labour, aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock, are continuing. Theresa May has said she wants to negotiate a ""joint plan"" with Jeremy Corbyn. If that is agreed, it would then be put to MPs in the hope that a Brexit deal could finally be voted through Parliament. Both leaders have agreed a ""programme of work"" for their negotiating teams to work on. So, what are the main differences likely to be when it comes to Brexit and where might possible compromise be found? Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU - it's one of her so-called red lines. As a member of the European Union, the UK is part of the EU customs union. Its members have an agreement not to carry out checks or put tariffs (extra payments) on goods that move around the area. This can be particularly advantageous for businesses whose goods cross multiple EU borders. But critics of the system say it has several drawbacks. For one, members of the customs union cannot negotiate their own trade deals, on goods, with other countries - such as the United States. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. As recently as 25 March, the prime minister rejected the idea of a customs union, saying it ""does not deliver on [an] independent trade policy"". Labour says it wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, after Brexit. But it also says it wants the UK to ""have a say"" when the EU strikes future trade deals. The level of UK involvement would depend on what Labour means by ""have a say"" but EU law currently prevents a non-EU member from influencing or vetoing its trade negotiations. But Labour says its policy cannot be ruled out until it has had a chance to negotiate this with the EU. Membership of the single market is another area where there are differences. The EU single market requires members to follow the same regulations and standards to keep trade flowing freely. It is based on four freedoms: goods, services, money and people (this last one allows EU citizens to live and work in the UK, and vice versa). When Theresa May first set out her Brexit negotiating objectives, she said failing to leave the single market ""would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all"". That's because the UK would have to continue to pay into the EU budget, follow all the rules, and continue to allow freedom of movement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Labour's policy, on the other hand, is to have ""close alignment with the single market"". But the EU has previously said the UK cannot cherry-pick only the parts of the single market it likes. So, it's unclear what the EU would accept as ""close alignment"", which Labour is calling for. Theresa May has always been firm that Brexit must mean the end to freedom of movement. In her 2017 election manifesto, she set out plans for an immigration system designed to ""reduce and control"" the number of people coming to the UK from the EU - and she hasn't wavered from this pledge. Like the Conservatives, Labour also pledged at the 2017 election to end freedom of movement. So, on the surface, this looks like something on which the two party leaders could agree. What is Labour customs union policy? What are the soft Brexit options? But in January, when it came to voting on the Immigration Bill, which would put an end to freedom of movement, Labour encouraged its MPs to vote against it. A big unknown is whether Labour's policy of ""close alignment"" with the single market might restrict the UK's ability to set its own immigration policy. Its Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer,previously told BBC Newsthe party would be willing to accept some EU workers but with restrictions. ""If somebody is coming to do a job and it needs to be done and it has been advertised locally beforehand with nobody able to do it, then most people would say, 'I accept that,'"" he said. A Labour spokesperson said: ""We support fair rules and the reasonable management of migration."" Theresa May has said she's made it clear in the political declaration - the part of her deal agreed with the EU concerning the future relationship - that the UK agrees to not going backwards in terms of workers' rights. But she has not guaranteed that when the EU introduces a new right or protection for workers, the UK will also adopt it. In Prime Minister's Questions last week, though, Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to use EU standards, including any introduced in the future, as a minimum for the UK to improve on. He accused the prime minister's deal of involving a ""race to the bottom"" on workers' rights - something he said Labour's proposals would prevent.

Neglect contributed to shingles drug deathEileen McAdie died after being given blood-pressure medication instead of pain relief drugs.Kent,"Eileen McAdie was prescribed an increased dose of a painkiller but was given a drug for blood pressure Neglect was a contributing factor in the death of a woman suffering from shingles who was given the wrong drug by a pharmacy, a coroner has ruled. Eileen McAdie was given blood pressure drug Amlodipine instead of pain relief medication Amitriptyline at The Village Pharmacy in New Ash Green, Kent. The 65-year-old died 11 days later in hospital in September 2016, after falling into a coma. Family lawyer Nick Fairweather said civil proceedings would be launched. The inquest in Maidstone had heard Mrs McAdie's GP Dr Julie Taylor had prescribed an increased daily dose of Amitriptyline to treat the severe pain caused by the shingles on her face and neck, on 19 September. But Dr Taylor said pharmacist Josiah Ghartey-Reindorftold her that the wrong medication had been dispensed. The inquest heard a label for Amitriptyline was stuck on a box of Amlodipine by a member of pharmacy staff Coroner Christopher Sutton-Mattocks said: ""This failure is substantial, not trivial. ""It is a fundamental part of the role of a pharmacist that the correct drugs are dispensed. ""Her death was contributed to by neglect."" Amlodipine is used to treat high blood pressure, while Amitriptyline, which can also be used to treat depression, was prescribed to manage Mrs McAdie's pain. A member of staff at The Village Pharmacy told the inquest staff were rushed off their feet In a statement issued by the family, Mrs McAdie was described as a ""much loved wife, mother, sister and grandmother"". ""To lose Eileen in any circumstances would have been a tragedy for the family.  To have her taken from them in the way that occurred here, through these errors, is unbearable."" The inquest heard Mr Ghartey-Reindorf also failed to circulate a newsletter to staff from the pharmacy owners warning about mixing up prescriptions. He has been referred to the General Pharmaceutical Council and was removed from his post in New Ash Green, demoted, and is undergoing re-training elsewhere.

"Scarface killer jailed for fifth murderMane Driza left Stefan Bledar Mone with 120 injuries following a ""brutal"" attack at his flat.London","Mane Driza was also known as Tony Montana, after Al Pacino's Scarface character A serial killer who used the nickname of Al Pacino's character in Scarface has been jailed for a fifth murder. Mane Driza - also known as Tony Montana -killed Stefan Bledar Moneat their flat in north London in June 1999. Father-to-be Mr Mone was left with 120 injuries following the ""brutal"" attack. Driza, 41, then went on a three-year killing spree across Europe. He was sentenced to 20 years in jail at the Old Bailey on Wednesday. The court heard he had already been found guilty of four fatal shootings and an attempted murder in Albania and Italy as well as making threats to kill. Judge Sarah Munro QC sentenced Driza to life with a minimum term of 20 years. He will not begin serving his British sentence until 2026, when his sentence in Italy comes to an end. ""This is a very unusual, if not unique case,"" Ms Munro said. Driza (r) with Stefan Bledar Mone Driza, a stonemason, was furious when his flatmate took his wedding ring and gave it to his partner, the court heard. He then used a pick axe handle, a lock knife and a cheese knife to beat and stab Mr Mone at their Wembley home. Man known as Tony Montana 'murdered friend' Scarface killer guilty of murder News and updates from across London The victim's pregnant girlfriend, Zoe Blay, found the body the next day and was only able to identify him by a distinctive belt buckle. In 2001, in Albania, Driza was convicted in his absence of two charges of ""premeditated murder in complicity of citizens"", along with his father. In June 2002, he was convicted in Sicily of conspiracy to murder Maskaj Artan and Blushaj Albert, and the attempted murder of Maskaj Lefter.

What are the Brexit sticking points?,"Cross-party talks between the Conservatives and Labour, aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock, are continuing. Theresa May has said she wants to negotiate a ""joint plan"" with Jeremy Corbyn. If that is agreed, it would then be put to MPs in the hope that a Brexit deal could finally be voted through Parliament. Both leaders have agreed a ""programme of work"" for their negotiating teams to work on. So, what are the main differences likely to be when it comes to Brexit and where might possible compromise be found? Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU - it's one of her so-called red lines. As a member of the European Union, the UK is part of the EU customs union. Its members have an agreement not to carry out checks or put tariffs (extra payments) on goods that move around the area. This can be particularly advantageous for businesses whose goods cross multiple EU borders. But critics of the system say it has several drawbacks. For one, members of the customs union cannot negotiate their own trade deals, on goods, with other countries - such as the United States. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. As recently as 25 March, the prime minister rejected the idea of a customs union, saying it ""does not deliver on [an] independent trade policy"". Labour says it wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, after Brexit. But it also says it wants the UK to ""have a say"" when the EU strikes future trade deals. The level of UK involvement would depend on what Labour means by ""have a say"" but EU law currently prevents a non-EU member from influencing or vetoing its trade negotiations. But Labour says its policy cannot be ruled out until it has had a chance to negotiate this with the EU. Membership of the single market is another area where there are differences. The EU single market requires members to follow the same regulations and standards to keep trade flowing freely. It is based on four freedoms: goods, services, money and people (this last one allows EU citizens to live and work in the UK, and vice versa). When Theresa May first set out her Brexit negotiating objectives, she said failing to leave the single market ""would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all"". That's because the UK would have to continue to pay into the EU budget, follow all the rules, and continue to allow freedom of movement. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Labour's policy, on the other hand, is to have ""close alignment with the single market"". But the EU has previously said the UK cannot cherry-pick only the parts of the single market it likes. So, it's unclear what the EU would accept as ""close alignment"", which Labour is calling for. Theresa May has always been firm that Brexit must mean the end to freedom of movement. In her 2017 election manifesto, she set out plans for an immigration system designed to ""reduce and control"" the number of people coming to the UK from the EU - and she hasn't wavered from this pledge. Like the Conservatives, Labour also pledged at the 2017 election to end freedom of movement. So, on the surface, this looks like something on which the two party leaders could agree. What is Labour customs union policy? What are the soft Brexit options? But in January, when it came to voting on the Immigration Bill, which would put an end to freedom of movement, Labour encouraged its MPs to vote against it. A big unknown is whether Labour's policy of ""close alignment"" with the single market might restrict the UK's ability to set its own immigration policy. Its Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer,previously told BBC Newsthe party would be willing to accept some EU workers but with restrictions. ""If somebody is coming to do a job and it needs to be done and it has been advertised locally beforehand with nobody able to do it, then most people would say, 'I accept that,'"" he said. A Labour spokesperson said: ""We support fair rules and the reasonable management of migration."" Theresa May has said she's made it clear in the political declaration - the part of her deal agreed with the EU concerning the future relationship - that the UK agrees to not going backwards in terms of workers' rights. But she has not guaranteed that when the EU introduces a new right or protection for workers, the UK will also adopt it. In Prime Minister's Questions last week, though, Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to use EU standards, including any introduced in the future, as a minimum for the UK to improve on. He accused the prime minister's deal of involving a ""race to the bottom"" on workers' rights - something he said Labour's proposals would prevent.

Mum's 'moving' note on toddler's adoption,"The unnamed woman said she felt ""incredibly sad"" about the situation A mother with mental health issues has written an ""incredibly moving"" account of why she accepts her toddler daughter should be adopted. Judge Sarah Lynch said she hoped one day the girl - who social workers feared could not be kept safe with her mother - would read the words. The mother wrote to the court in Leeds: ""I will always love her, she is my daughter but I am doing this for her."" Judge Lynch said she could not imagine the pain the woman had suffered. Details of the case have emerged in a ruling published by the judge following a private family court hearing. More stories across West Yorkshire here The mother told the court: ""One minute I could care for her and then the next minute I would not be able to. ""I do not feel that this would be good for [her]. ""I feel incredibly sad about the situation but I know [she] is going to go to a family who will love her and give her what I cannot give her at the moment."" No further details about the child - including her precise age - have been allowed to be released by the judge. Social services bosses had asked the judge to make decisions about the girl's future. Social workers said she would not be safe in the care of her mother, who they described as having long-term mental health difficulties. No other family members were able to care for the girl and social workers thought adoption was the best option. Judge Lynch said the woman had realised she was not well enough to be the ""mum she needed to be"" and had made an ""extremely brave decision"". The woman told the judge in her statement she hoped her daughter ""gets placed with a really good family who will love her how I love her and will bring her up right and protect her"". ""I hope she gets all the attention in the world from her new family,"" she added. Judge Lynch said the girl had already gone into temporary foster care pending long-term decisions about her future. The woman had been allowed to visit her daughter but had said the visits were too difficult for her to deal with. She told the judge: ""I have not had contact for some time now, not because I do not love [her], but because it is simply too hard for me to go and leave her again."" She added: ""I am really sorry that it has come to this position but I know I am doing the right thing and I just want her to know that I love her and always will."" Judge Lynch described the woman's words as ""incredibly moving"". ""I cannot imagine how painful this has all been for her,"" she added.

Windrush compensation could reach Â£200m,"This video can not be played Glenda Caesar wants compensation for loss of earnings, stress, and lost pension There is ""no limit"" to the amount of money that could be paid out to victims of the Windrush scandal, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid said he hoped the scheme would ""right the wrongs"" of a ""mistake that should never have happened"". Thousands of people were wrongly targeted by the ""hostile environment"" strategy for illegal immigration. Many of those affected were people from Caribbean countries who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971. People from other Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries who arrived in the UK before 1988 were also affected and are eligible to apply for compensation, Mr Javid said in a Commons statement. The estates of people who have died whilst waiting for their status would also be allowed to make a claim, he added. Windrush: Who exactly was on board? Formal apology for Windrush members Windrush row over criminal deportation flight Mr Javid said the ""unacceptable treatment"" experienced by some members of the Windrush generation, which came to public attention in late 2017, was of ""profound regret"". The home secretary said he hoped the compensation scheme goes ""some way"" to delivering justice for those affected. He added there was no cap for the amount of compensation that could be paid out per claim but the ""baseline estimate"" for total payouts was Â£200m. This video can not be played Amanda Kirton: ""It's all of our history"" A Home Office impact assessment estimates that the scheme will cost between Â£49m and Â£587m - taking compensation and operational costs into account. The assessment says there's ""significant uncertainty"" about the costs because it was unclear how many people will apply. Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the announcement was ""short on detail"". ""While we welcome the creation of a compensation scheme, we know that money cannot buy back the years the victims have lost to destitution and anguish - nor can it compensate for the despair they felt at losing jobs, homes, health and a sense of identity and rightful pride in their contribution to the UK"", he said. One of those caught up in the scandal, Glenda Caesar, lost her job as a NHS administrator at a doctors surgery because she no longer had a British passport to prove her identity. She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she ""couldn't work or receive benefits"" and describes getting to a stage where ""I just wanted to take some tablets and sleep"". Asked what she hopes to get from the Home Office scheme, she said: ""Validate my loss of earnings, validate the emotional distress I've had to go through. I'm asking for not millions... but look at what I was earning, my pension - 10 years of my pension I lost as well - validate that."" Willow Sims (left) lost her right to work in the UK, despite having lived in the country since she was four Willow Sims, another person affected,says she is torn, as she ""doesn't care about the money"" and wants to ""not feel like a criminal"" so she can move on. But she says she sees her children struggling, can't pay the rent, and is having to borrow money from friends and family. ""I need to at least recoup what I have lost"", she says. There's no cap on how much overall compensation someone can receive under the scheme but many categories have set payments. For example, a person who was unlawfully deported will get Â£10,000; those detained for over 30 minutes are entitled to Â£500 per hour for the first three hours, followed by lower hourly rates if they're held for longer; and people wrongly made homeless can expect Â£250 per month, up to a maximum of Â£25,000. With so many variables it's not surprising there's wide variation on how much the scheme will cost. Officials in the Home Office say the final amount will range from Â£49m to Â£587m, depending on how many people apply; Sajid Javid says it's likely to be around Â£200m. To give a sense of scale, that will be more than the Â£154m in compensation paid out to 40,000 victims of crime in England, Scotland and Wales last year under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. More information on the scheme can be foundhere,external. Meanwhile, victims of the Windrush scandal claim they have been snubbed from an official reception to launch the compensation scheme. Immigration lawyer Jacqueline McKenzie says she was asked to invite a handful of her clients to a ""Windrush engagement"" event, but only two of the six clients she represented were sent invitations. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK She says it proves ""nothing has been learned"" by the Home Office and that ""this group continues to be treated with contempt"". She said: ""There will be drinks and canapes, and you know the black bourgeoisie, as I call them, the glitterati - they'll all be there."" But Ms McKenzie says the event should have been about ""discussing this seriously with the people who work with Windrush [victims] and people who are affected by the scandal."" She also criticised the government for failures in setting up a hardship fund after the scandal came to light, saying ""hardly anyone"" been granted emergency support by the Home Office to date. Sajid Javid told the House Of Commons that nine people have been awarded money from the hardship fund, which was set up last year to help victims in immediate need  - whilst they waited for the launch of the compensation scheme.

"Ex-soldier tells inquest he saw 'murder'A former soldier tells the Ballymurphy inquest that what he saw in August 1971 was ""murder"".Northern Ireland","The inquest is examining the deaths in west Belfast in August 1971 A former soldier has told the Ballymurphy inquest that what he saw was ""murder"". C4 had previously told the court that he saw British soldiers with red berets shooting and killing two men close to Springfield Park in August 1971. He believed that the soldiers were from the Parachute Regiment. The inquest is looking into the shooting dead of 10 people in the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast in August 1971. The shootings occurred amid disturbances sparked by the introduction of internment without trial in Northern Ireland. C4 told the court on Tuesday that he was present during the incident where Fr Hugh Mullan and Francis Quinn were shot and killed on waste ground near Springfield Park. Ballymurphy shootings: Who were the victims? C4, originally from England, was in Belfast at the time visiting his wife and family while on pre-discharge leave from the Royal Corps of Signals. Returning to give evidence on Wednesday, he told the coroner: ""What I saw in my mind was murder. Shooting civilians who weren't involved in any terrorist action."" Asked by the coroner why he had come forward in 1971 to speak out about what had happened, he replied: ""People needed their justice."" Earlier, a barrister for the MoD (Ministry of Defence) had resumed questions about the differences in some of C4's several accounts of what happened. In one earlier statement given in 2009, C4 had said he could not see the colour of the berets worn by the soldiers who shot at them from the roofs of Springmartin flats. He now says he is certain he saw red or maroon berets on the two men. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment were based at Henry Taggart Army base Asked why he had said that, he told the court he was not sure of his frame of mind while giving that 2009 statement. There were also some differences in his description of the order in which things happened and exactly who was present. Later, a barrister for the Mullan and Quinn families indicated that other witnesses to the inquest in previous weeks had referred to the presence of a man, with an English accent, a soldier, who was married to a local woman. C4 agreed that this would have been him. He was also questioned about his claim that a captain in the Parachute Regiment came up to him at the inquest in 1972 into the death of Fr Hugh Mullan and called him a traitor. The former soldier told the court that his home had later been visited by three members of the Parachute Regiment who had physically assaulted him. Ten people were killed in the shootings He described making a complaint about the matter to the military authorities. He had earlier said in court that he thought the three soldiers had subsequently been court-martialled, but now said he could not be certain anything had actually happened as a result of his complaint. C4, now 71, agreed with the court that his memory sometimes failed him, but he was doing his best to give ""an honest and truthful account"". He has completed his evidence. Later on Wednesday, a former paratrooper told the inquest how he crawled through a field in darkness and found the bodies of a man and a woman. Witness M282 was a private in B Company, 2 Para and was based at Vere Foster school just off the Springfield Road. M282 said he heard exchanges of gunfire and although he took cover for a time, he had not fired his own weapon. He told the court that after dark, he and another soldier were given the task of discovering if there were any casualties in the Manse field area, opposite the Henry Taggart Hall. M282 said both of them made a hole in the fence in front of the base and crawled through. He said they then crawled over to the waste ground without carrying any weapons with them. The shootings occurred amid disturbances sparked by the introduction of internment without trial in Northern Ireland He said he was afraid of being shot, but searched on one side of the Manse area, discovering the bodies of a woman and a man. Four people died as a result of the shooting in that area: Joan Connolly, Joseph Murphy, Noel Phillips and Daniel Teggart. The former soldier said he knew the woman was dead because the body was cold. He said he didn't discover any weapons or shell cases at the scene. He said the soldier with him had discovered two or three bodies, but that he had not seen what his colleague was doing. M282 said the two men waited while an armoured vehicle came from the base and four soldiers collected casualties from the field, before they went back themselves. He did not see any dead or wounded back at the base, he said. He said that at a later date he discovered some weathered rifle shell cases in the hedge along the waste ground, but cannot be sure of the date when he found them. He said he did not connect the shell cases with the bodies he had found several months earlier. He also said he did not recognise the type of shell cases, but they were not the type that the Army used.

PayPal to reject essay-writing firmsThe payment services firm acts on warnings about university essays being sold online.Family & Education,"Payments company PayPal is going to withdraw services from essay-writing firms selling to university students. Last month, Education Secretary Damian Hinds called on PayPal to stop processing payments for such firms, in a bid to beat academic cheating. Mr Hinds had said it was ""unethical for these companies to profit from this dishonest business"". PayPal is to begin contacting firms which use its payment system to sell academic essays online. ""PayPal is working with businesses associated with essay-writing services to ensure our platform is not used to facilitate deceptive and fraudulent practices in education,"" said a spokesman for the payment firm. ""PayPal will continue to diligently review and take appropriate action on accounts found to facilitate cheating that undermines academic integrity."" From Wednesday, the payment company is to begin contacting essay-writing firms, giving them notice that they should ""move their business elsewhere"". But this will not be an ""overnight ban"" - as there will be debates over which services are helping students to cheat and which are offering legitimate tutoring assistance. PayPal urged to block essay-writing firms YouTube deletes cheating videos Essay cheat companies face university ban How do you stop online students from cheating? The man who helps students to cheat This is a business that operates across national borders - so PayPal says there will need to be an international response. University leaders have warned repeatedly about the risk of so-called ""essay mills"" being used by students to cheat. The move by PayPal was welcomed by the higher education watchdog, the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), which hadwritten to the company in November,external, calling on them ""to close down the payment facilities for the essay-writing companies that encourage students to cheat"".. ""This decision is a huge step forwards in the battle to close down these unscrupulous operators,"" said the QAA's head of policy and public affairs, Gareth Crossman. ""Essay companies rely heavily on payment platforms like PayPal to process students' orders. Removing this facility will significantly hamper their operation. ""Essay companies remain a huge threat to the academic integrity of UK higher education,"" said Mr Crossman. The education secretary had said the QAA identified 17,000 academic offences in 2016 - but it was impossible to know how many cases had gone undetected. ""Sadly there have always been some people who opt for the easy way, and the internet has seen a black market in essay-writing services spring up,"" said Mr Hinds. Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: ""Cheating should be tackled and the problem should not be allowed to fester any longer. ""Legislation is needed to outlaw this abominable practice, but this is a valuable first step.""

"Looking for BrexitlandSpecial correspondent Allan Little takes to the road - travelling from Southampton, through Stoke-on-Trent and Manchester, to Motherwell in central Scotland."," March was going to be the decisive month - the days that would transform the UK. I wanted to hear what people had to say and chose four places that each showed a distinct aspect of Brexit. This isn’t an exhaustive or comprehensive tour of the UK - I’ve visited only two of the four constituent nations. This piece doesn't include Wales and Northern Ireland. The distinctive nature of their Brexit debates merits separate analysis. I started in Southampton. For generations, this was where immigrants and visitors alike first set foot on English soil. It is where they first encountered the British, after disembarking from one of the great ocean-going vessels that shaped the history and character of this port city. In the 1930s, the writer and social commentator JB Priestley called Southampton Britain’s “bay window on the wide world”. Southampton Water was one of Britain’s gateways to a trading empire that circled the globe. View of Southampton's Ocean Terminal from the Queen Mary, 1950 And I wanted to start here because it’s where my own working life as a news reporter began. I came here in the mid-80s to learn my trade. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was radically reshaping Britain. Traditional, mass-employment industries were dying. Dole queues had been lengthening. Like many Scots of my generation I headed south looking for a break, in a part of the country where there still seemed to be opportunity. I’d come from a brief spell working in Glasgow, another port city that had thrived as a trading and industrial hub in the heyday of Imperial Britain. Allan Little as a young man The difference astonished me. Much of industrial Glasgow was sinking into dereliction and despair but in Southampton there was money, investment, growth. Southampton was managing the transition from the age of Empire to the age of Europe with a dynamic self-confidence that was unlike anything I had seen. This part of south central England had also embraced the prevailing values of that decade: privatisation, deregulation, enterprise. The patch I worked covered 20 parliamentary constituencies. All of them had a Tory MP. I did story after story on men who’d been laid off as the shipyards and city-centre docks had closed down, but who had used their redundancy money to start their own businesses and employ others. Southampton never ceased to be a global trading hub, but it was now well-placed to benefit from a Europe that was tearing down barriers to trade between its member states. I started in Southampton.

Margaret Thatcher spent the last day of her 1983 re-election campaign here, and across the Solent on the Isle of Wight, precisely because it had come to represent, for her, what free-market reform could deliver: wealth creation freed from the dead hand of the state. Margaret Thatcher, Isle of Wight, 8 June 1983 Southampton people were not rich. But this was a far cry from Glasgow. Like most of England, Southampton voted to leave the EU in 2016. The margin was 54% to 46%, which was about the average for England as a whole. After the referendum, London-based news organisations sent reporters like me north, to the post-industrial heartlands that represented an England that had been - in the parlance of my trade - “left behind” by a globalised economy. But Southampton had not been left behind. Far from it. It had been swept along by the forces of globalisation for three decades. Danny Babey is in his early 40s and runs his own upholstering company. A lot of his work is on the water, refurbishing private yachts. He voted to leave the EU. Danny Babey “Why can’t we make our own rules?” he says as he noses his own yacht out of harbour. We chug past the vast container port that has grown up to the west of the city. “It’s not easy being told what to do by another country.” I took a mental note of this, knowing that I planned to end my journey in Scotland, which voted 62% to remain but will have to leave with the rest of the UK regardless. Danny tells me he’d recently sent 10 workers to do a job in Marseilles. “I suppose I might have to think about sorting visas for that sort of thing now,” he says. “But I hope the transition will be smooth.” “Did you think about that when you voted to leave?” I ask him. “Not really,” he says, “because I wasn’t doing that work then. I suppose that work might go to another company now, one that’s inside the European Union and yes, that would concern me. But I always take the view that something else will turn up.” In the city centre that evening, Tomasz Dyl is in a bar with a dozen friends and colleagues, drinking champagne and slicing birthday cake. It is 11 years to the day since he founded his own marketing company. It now employs 10 people full time and has just opened an office in London’s Oxford Street. Tomasz Dyl Tomasz came to Southampton 15 years ago at the age of 13 without speaking a word of English. His Polish parents took low-paying jobs to give their children a better start, in a wealthier country. Tomasz, a beneficiary of freedom of movement between member states, voted to remain and was sure Southampton would too. Why didn’t it? “At one point, Polish was Southampton’s second language,” he tells me, acknowledging the role that high levels of immigration played in the way many people voted. “The Poles were 10% of the population of the city. Most have done well. They started their own businesses. They’ve brought a lot to this country.” For Tomasz, the immigrant experience has been a happy one. He talks about his adopted city in the first person plural. “We’re a very welcoming city,” he says. “We’re a port city. We’re used to people coming in and going out all the time.” He has almost no personal experience of anti-immigrant sentiment in a city he clearly loves. Pearline Hingston is also an immigrant. Pearline Hingston She came to Britain at the age of 11 from her native Jamaica, where she was born to a family of Indian descent. Her identity is shaped by the Commonwealth, she tells me, and she has been campaigning to leave the European Union for years. She is a UKIP branch secretary. “We have waited long enough. We should leave, even on a no-deal. Britain can trade globally. We can trade globally on WTO terms,” she says. “If the EU doesn’t want to stay friends, if it wants the UK to impose tariffs on its goods, then that’s its choice.” Pearline - who also voted Out in the 1975 referendum to decide if the UK would remain in the EEC as it was then - is convinced Brexit is being sabotaged. Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher during the referendum campaign on Europe, June 1975 “The EU has the upper hand,” she says, “and there have been people here in parliament who have been tripping over to Brussels having private meetings, and they have become anti-British and anti-democratic in their behaviour. They should accept the referendum and not pull the rug from under Mrs May.” For many here, Southampton’s Leave vote was not primarily about immigration. There is a “something will turn up” self-confidence - some might say complacency - about this England that is borne of experience: the experience of 40 years in which, compared with the England I’m headed to next, something usually has turned up. It wasn't just the England of the “left-behinds” thattipped the scalesfor Leave in 2016. There was a numerically significant chunk of Leave votes from a non-metropolitan England that is relatively comfortably off. This is what I take away from Southampton - if you’re a Remainer, it’s too simple to blame the poor or the North. A critical mass of Leave sentiment is in the South.

This is what I take away from Southampton - if you’re a Remainer, it’s too simple to blame the poor or the North. A critical mass of Leave sentiment is in the South. In Stoke-on-Trent, there’s not much of the confidence I encountered in Southampton. What there is - and you don’t have to spend much time here to get a sense of it - is a fierce civic pride in the character and traditions of the city. Stoke-on-Trent is not much of a magnet for internal migration. Most people who live here are from here. It feels like a place of neighbourliness, of a shared sense of identity. It sits at the heart of a part of England that shares its very name with the industry that is the source of that pride: the Potteries. Pots, pits and steel; these were the three industrial pillars on which Stoke-on-Trent was built. Coal and steel have gone, and the Potteries reduced to a fraction of what they once were. Waste incinerator and the A500, Stoke-on-Trent I took a walk not far from the city centre. Opposite a neat row of brick-built terraced houses, I walked past a derelict industrial plant. I stopped to gaze through rusting chained-up fencing at the soot-black bricks of the distinctive funnel-shaped kiln chimneys and warehouses that once produced tableware for half the world. Stoke-on-Trent, like much of industrial England, is a place that takes pride in the worth and virtue of honest work. But decades of industrial decline and years of “austerity” have had a visible impact here. It has swept away much of the economic activity  that was the source of that pride. The people here voted by nearly 70% to leave - one of the highest margins in the country. “People who live in London, in places of power, don’t know anything about Stoke-on-Trent,” Danny Flynn tells me. “They just make assumptions that it’s not a very nice place, where those rough people live.” Danny Flynn And he performs a little parody of what he sees as the judgmental, liberal middle class: “Oh those uneducated white working-class people - how very dare they vote Brexit?” Danny runs the Stoke YMCA. He provides secure accommodation for vulnerable young adults and provides them with training that helps to turn their lives around and get them into work. He voted Remain - reluctantly he says.  “I can see why people in Stoke would think, ‘Never mind Brussels, London’s got nothing to do with us!’ So I could see why it happened, but I think it was more a general protest vote of not being included in the game called Great Britain.” That sense - that Stoke feels excluded - is everywhere. This is a city that globalisation has left behind. Graham Eagles has a stall at Tunstall market selling pet supplies. At the weekends, he runs dog training courses in a local community hall. He voted Leave. Graham Eagles “Eventually I think the country could be run a lot better, more self sufficient,” he says. “We could rely less on other countries. We could do it ourselves like we used to, a long time ago obviously, but we did. This country has lost its backbone a little bit I think, and that’s what it needs to get back and stand strong.” It is a theme that runs through much of the pro-Leave sentiment I heard expressed in the six towns that constitute this city at the heart of The Potteries: the belief that Britain should recapture some hard-to-define quality that it once had - but has lost. But go further down the age demographic and that yearning for the lost certainties of the past diminishes. Natalie Willatt, who’s 24, left the city to take a degree in photography in Leeds. Despite the broader range of opportunities the great cities of the North have to offer, she came home after graduating out of love for her home city. Across the country,just over 70% of 18 to 24-year-oldswho voted in the referendum backed Remain. Natalie Willatt I ask her whether she could understand why so many people here voted Leave. “I can understand why so many people are unhappy,” she tells me. “Yes, you can’t get a doctor’s appointment but that’s because the NHS is underfunded, not because there’s an immigrant taking your space. “So I believe actually it’s austerity and underfunding of things that are causing these issues that people might blame immigrants for. So I can understand why people are angry, I just think they’re blaming the wrong people for it.” Stoke-on-Trent illustrates one of the paradoxes of the Leave victory - that so many traditional Labour-voting communities, and especially those plunged into hardship by the collapse of industry, should have voted for a policy championed most vociferously by the right-wing of the Conservative Party. One of the consequences of the collapse of the traditional industries was the erosion of the power of the trade unions and the role they played in people’s lives. Trade union officials were a constant presence in those communities - in the workplace, agitating for improvements in working conditions, taking up the cause of workers who believed they’d been unjustly treated at work, in the social clubs and bars where people gathered in their down time. Local Labour activists that had emerged from that movement were known by local people, and often sent to represent them at Westminster. Tony Blair's Labour election victory in 1997 Eighteen years of Conservative government changed that. The trade union movement was stripped of the power it once had. The workplaces that had sustained the Labour movement disappeared. Labour at Westminster rebranded itself. “New Labour” set out to appeal to prosperous Middle England. It had to win back seats in places like Southampton. The party at Westminster came to see “cloth-cap politics” - the politics of class grievance - as a vote loser. The number of genuinely working-class MPs on the Labour benchesgradually diminished. A new generation of clever young men and women with university backgrounds emerged - a caste of professional politicians who had not come from the communities that had been devastated by the loss of their industries. The Labour voices raised in parliament sounded less and less like those of the people they represented. UKIP poster in Stoke-on-Trent, 2017 In this context, UKIP was able to make inroads into territory that had always been loyally Labour. Not far from Graham Eagles’ pet products stall, I find Shirley Ray. She’s been styling hair here for 20 years. Her salon is busy. One woman in the chair is having her roots done ahead of a trip to Australia. Two others, both retired, are waiting patiently. There’s not much disagreement between these women. They voted Leave and they want out. Shirley voted UKIP at the last election and is an admirer of Nigel Farage. Shirley Ray “I don’t feel proud to be British any more,” she says, when I ask her about the ongoing paralysis at Westminster. “I think we’re the laughing stock of the world. I think we’re being seen as a very weak country,” she says. “We’ll put up with anything, just take anything that’s thrown at us. And I think we need to get cracking on making this country great again. To be honest I’ve got no confidence in any of the MPs at all. I just want out.” One of her customers is Patricia Shrigley. “I can’t see us coming out to be honest, because Westminster doesn’t want it. And I think that would be very unfair.” Patricia Shrigley I ask her how she’d feel if Britain ended up staying in the EU. “I wouldn’t vote again,” she says. “That would be me finished. Because it’s supposed to be a democracy, and we’ll just be ignored won’t we?” It chimes, back at the pet supplies stall, with Graham Eagles’ sense of dejected resignation. “People are getting fed up about voting,” he says. “It’s pointless voting because it gets us nowhere. A lot of people will feel the same - what’s the point?” If there was a second referendum, Natalie Willatt would vote - again - to remain. “I believe people voted to leave because they wanted something to change, because they’re sick of how it is,” she says. “And it’s only going to change for the worse. So that’s the bit I’m sad about - that these communities of brilliant people still aren’t going to get anything better. I think that’s ultimately what they wanted out of Brexit, and they’re not going to get it. This is incredibly sad.” That is Danny Flynn’s view, too. “My biggest fear - because the economy will take a kick, even the Brexit people admit that don’t they?  - is that working-class people in cities like Stoke will suffer more than any other people in the country,” he says. “Working-class people will pay again like working-class people have paid for austerity, like working-class people paid for the bankers’ bonuses, to be frank.” Stoke-on-Trent illustrates one of the paradoxes of the Leave victory - that so many traditional Labour-voting communities, and especially those plunged into hardship by the collapse of industry, should have voted for a policy championed most vociferously by the right-wing of the Conservative Party.

This is incredibly sad.” That is Danny Flynn’s view, too. “My biggest fear - because the economy will take a kick, even the Brexit people admit that don’t they?  - is that working-class people in cities like Stoke will suffer more than any other people in the country,” he says. “Working-class people will pay again like working-class people have paid for austerity, like working-class people paid for the bankers’ bonuses, to be frank.” The post-industrial heartlands, traditional fortresses of Labour solidarity, are not in themselves the problem for the Labour Party - as most continue to return Labour MPs. But they are where Labour’s single biggest challenge begins. Most Labour members, and most Labour voters, support Remain, and many want the party to back a second referendum. But most Labour MPs sit in seats that voted Leave. To win an election, the party would have to win over Leave-supporting seats. Manchester Brexit has driven a fracture through both the two big Westminster parties. The divide in the House of Commons might still, formally, be between a Conservative government and a Labour-dominated opposition. But in the country, politics has realigned. The divide out here, beyond the Westminster bubble, is between Remainers and Leavers. Both main parties are trying to ride two horses that are pulling in opposite directions. Mrs May has spent much of the past two years negotiating not with the European Union, but with her own party. My next stop was Greater Manchester, where it’s not hard to see that the Labour Party is just as deeply riven. The bus from Stoke-on-Trent to Manchester doesn’t take long. It’s not much more than a hop. But central Manchester feels a world away. Manchester Everywhere you look there is dynamic regeneration. It shines at you in concrete, steel and glass. Here, there is opportunity for an educated workforce. The North West is a Labour stronghold - or, rather, two very distinct Labour strongholds. The first of these is typified perhaps by metropolitan Manchester, which voted 60/40 to remain.

That will lead to a different character to the campaign. Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn will be speaking from the sidelines. It’ll be the genuine voice, the voice of the British people, that will come through. We won’t need Project Fear.” But head out of the city of Manchester and you don’t need to go far to find the voice of Labour’s other tribe. In Wigan, which voted 64% to leave, I go to see John Chadwick. He runs a butcher’s shop and delicatessen, with its own abattoir at the back. The restaurant attached was full almost when I arrived, even though it was barely mid-morning. He voted to leave and can’t understand why we are still in the EU. John Chadwick “If we’re coming out, we don’t want to agree nothing,” he says. “Why pay £39bn? We went in with nothing, we should come out with nothing. Like a divorce. Just leave. Finish.” John is 72 and has been working in the family business since he started as an errand boy at the age of 10. He says his business is hampered by EU rules and food regulations that are unnecessary. “I’ve got to have a vet present when I kill my animals. It costs money. We’re small. I only kill a few. But I have to pay the same [vets] bills as the big abattoirs. How are we supposed to compete?” I put Martin Yuille’s point to him: that the country didn’t know what kind of Brexit it voted for in 2016, and now that it knows more, should it vote again to make sure the country knows what it’s getting into? “Oh no, no, no, no,” he says. “We knew what we were getting into. Leave is leave. Nothing else. “Look. We’re the only country in the world that has ‘Great’ in front of its name. What’s to be frightened of? We proved that a few years ago with BSE and foot and mouth. “Europe walked away from us then. They didn’t want us. They wouldn’t buy our beef. So what are we worried about? The farmers carried on. The customers still ate meat. It must work in the other industries as well. Honda and Nissan - if they’re leaving the country, don’t buy their cars. No problem.” Oldham, Greater Manchester Where does this leave the Labour MPs who form the majority in the North West? Ros Birch is a Labour activist in Leave-voting Oldham, one of the towns hit hardest by the decline of industry. Oldham is still dominated by the vast red-brick textile mills that once exported across the globe and made this one of the great industrial centres of the North. But none of the mills spin cotton now. Many have slipped into dereliction.  Crumbling brickwork and broken and boarded-up windows are a sorry reminder of a lost greatness. Ros Birch Ros is probably a minority voice in Oldham. She wants a second referendum, a People’s Vote, and she thinks Labour MPs should risk angering their Leave-voting constituents to try to make that happen. “I would say to them that if you know that it [Brexit] is going to be the worst thing that could happen to some of your constituents who are already struggling with low wages and the impact of Universal Credit, depending on food banks, if you know that their lives are not going to be made any better by leaving the EU, then you’ve got to back Remain,” she says. “And can you understand why many of them feel pulled in two opposing directions?” I ask her. “I can understand it, but on the other hand I think you’ve got to put your country and your constituents ahead of keeping your job, ahead of getting re-elected. Some of them are definitely frightened of losing their seats.” The post-industrial heartlands, traditional fortresses of Labour solidarity, are not, in themselves, the problem for the Labour Party - for most continue to return Labour MPs.

It’s not easy being told what to do by another country.” Scotland voted 62% to 38% to remain, but will leave with the rest of the UK all the same. Not a single one of the country’s 32 local authority areas returned a majority for Leave. Unfurl the results map that shows Leave areas coloured blue and Remain yellow, and the difference is stark. The border between blue and yellow runs precisely the length of the Anglo-Scottish border - yellow to the north, blue to the south. I grew up in Scotland, so crossing that border is always a homecoming for me. When I was a child in the 70s, we lived in a constituency that returned an SNP MP to Westminster. Support for independence was far lower then. Scotland felt very British. When did England and Scotland start to diverge so clearly in the way they vote? And does the divergence represent a divergence in the values that the two nations embrace? My final destination was Motherwell. Motherwell, North Lanarkshire In any other part of the UK except Scotland, Motherwell would probably have voted to leave. Its economy was devastated in the 1990s by the closure of the huge Ravenscraig steelworks. At its height it was one of the largest steel plants in Western Europe. It employed 13,000 people and sustained the whole town. Motherwell has never fully recovered from the decline of steel. It is every bit as “left behind” by globalisation as Stoke-on-Trent. And yet North Lanarkshire, with Motherwell its main town, voted 62% to 38% to remain - about the Scottish average. The 2014 Independence referendum fundamentally changed politics in Scotland. It realigned political allegiances. Glasgow, 2014 In the Scotland I grew up in, aside from a surge in support for the SNP in 1974, when the party returned 11 MPs to Westminster, the defining divide was between Labour and Conservative, just as it was elsewhere in the UK. That Labour-Tory duopoly endured in England. But in Scotland it started to change in the 1980s. In the Thatcher decade, Labour returned stronger and stronger majorities, eventually winning 50 of Scotland’s 72 seats. The Tories dwindled until, in 1997, they were wiped out completely. For the next 20 years, the Scottish Conservatives had only one MP in the House of Commons, or none at all. The Conservative Party began to look more and more like a mainstream party in England alone. But Labour’s socio-economic base - the communities which had grown up around Scotland’s traditional heavy industries - was gradually being eroded. Shipyard at Greenock, circa 1964 One after another the shipyards, the coal fields, the steelworks closed. Industrial decline was dramatic, rapid and painful. It changed the country’s sense of itself. It is easy to see now - though it wasn’t so clear then - that those communities were bedrocks not just of Labour solidarity; they were also pillars of British identity in Scotland. If you were a miner in Midlothian, you were bound into a community of shared interest with miners in Yorkshire and South Wales. You worked for the great pan-British enterprise of coal extraction. The same applied to shipbuilding, and steel and motor manufacturing. And it all, or almost all, went. Go to the Ravenscraig site now and you wouldn’t know there had ever been anything industrial there.

Go to the Ravenscraig site now and you wouldn’t know there had ever been anything industrial there. It is a vast green emptiness that has only, in the past few years, begun to undergo redevelopment.  There is a new college, an impressive indoor sports centre, and the beginnings of new housing. I met Jim Fraser there, walking his dog Poppy. Jim Fraser Jim trained as an engineer at Ravenscraig in the late 60s and worked there until the plant closed in 1992. He was part of a workforce that had overwhelmingly voted Labour for decades. Jim began to vote SNP in the 1980s. But he was in a minority. It was, for the most part, a lost cause trying to persuade workers who owed secure jobs and good pensions to a state-owned company called British Steel to vote for the break-up of that state. Jim is a member of the SNP and in 2014 campaigned for independence. Two years later he voted Remain. “I mean look at it,” he says, with a sweep of the arm around the empty wasteland of the site. “This used to be buildings. Everything here. Steel-making. The closure changed everything in this area. Yes - it changed the way people vote.” At the 2015 General Election, Labour was almost wiped out in Scotland. After winning every election for nearly half a century the party held on to only one seat - Edinburgh South. The SNP won 56 seats - all but three of Scotland’s total. In North Lanarkshire, a huge Labour majority was overturned by the SNP. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon in Motherwell, 2015 How did Labour’s Fortress Scotland fall so dramatically? The answer lies in the way the 2014 independence referendum changed the question in Scotland. After that long campaign, politics in Scotland no longer revolved principally around the question: “Who do you want to govern?” The question instead is: “What state do you want to be governed in?” For now, the Union still commands a consistent majority (but a narrow one) in theopinion polls. Support for independence has held firm in the mid 40s. But how does Brexit change the equation? Does it make independence more or less likely? Martine Nolan trained as an engineer at Strathclyde University. She works for a fabrication and construction company with a plant outside Motherwell that employs 120 people. In the yard are the components of a large steel bridge her company is building for a railway crossing in Lincolnshire. About half of what the company makes is for customers in England and Wales. She voted to stay in both Unions - the UK in 2014 and the EU two years later. Martine Nolan “People are discussing Brexit as an idea,” she says. “They forget that it’s people’s lives. It’s children with nothing on their plates, families going to bed at night cold because they can’t afford the heating. I saw enough of it after the ‘Craig shut. We’re just starting to recover. I don’t want to see that again. “Why would we want to put further risk and uncertainty into our lives by coming out of the UK? Do you want to see two, three generations of people here with no work? Because that’s what happened here [when Ravenscraig closed].” But you can feel a different mood among younger people. I arranged to meet a local band rehearsing at the Motherwell Business Centre. The Banter Thiefs are four young men who were at school together and who’ve been playing gigs around Scotland and elsewhere in Europe for years. They are all strongly for an independent Scotland - and they all voted Remain. The Banter Thiefs “For me the Brexit vote was about immigration,” Derek the bass player tells me. “Scotland is still a place of low immigration compared to places like London, but I don’t think Scotland scaremongers about immigration in the same way as in other places. We are a welcoming country. Scotland needs immigrants. It’s got an ageing population. We need people to come and work here and study here. We don’t want policies based on fear.” The others nod their agreement. “I think Brexit strengthens the case for independence. Am I more European or more British? Definitely more European.” I ask Derek whether he supported a second referendum, a People’s Vote. His answer is more concerned with the precedent it would set for the next independence referendum than it was with overturning Brexit. “I think supporting a People’s Vote is a mistake for the SNP,” he says. “It could come back to bite them. If we vote for independence in the future and the negotiations go badly then people might say after six months or two years - we need to vote again. And we could lose it then. I think that’s really detrimental.” On a building site earlier that day I had fallen into conversation with a tiler, working on a bathroom in a new house. I mentioned that I was going to see the Banter Thiefs. “Oh yeah,” he says. “Very pro-independence.” Chris Roarty Chris Roarty is a 23-year-old Labour activist. “Brexit has reinforced my belief that we should stay here in the UK. It’s a huge wake-up call on the risk and uncertainty of leaving,” he says Although the SNP campaigned to remain, Chris sees a parallel between its 2014 independence plan, and Brexit. “I think the Leave campaign and the independence campaign, when they were presented with facts on the economy, just said, ‘Oh that’s scaremongering’. But we’re seeing now that negotiations to leave a union can be really difficult. I don’t think we should be risking that again by breaking away from the UK. We can’t go into the unknown. There’s a huge economic risk. We should be opening doors not closing them.” Many in the SNP assumed that Brexit would lead to spike in support for independence. It hasn’t happened; at least not yet. Why not? When you glance at that solid block of Remain yellow on the map of Scotland it’s easy to overlook the fact that a million people in Scotland voted to leave the EU - 38% of those who voted. Of the 45% who voted for independence, as many as one in three supported leaving the EU. Anecdotally, one senior SNP official I spoke to conceded that while many people had moved from No to Yes on independence, there had been movement in the opposite direction too, among people who voted yes in 2014 but don’t want to be taken back into the EU by a future independent Scotland. Scottish independence supporter, Glasgow, March 2019 There’s also been  a revival of Tory fortunes in Scotland. For a generation, the Conservatives had appeared moribund. But after the election of Ruth Davidson as leader, the party repositioned itself. At the 2017 election, Conservatives in Scotland took the decision not to campaign on the same message as their counterparts in England. There wasn’t much talk in Scotland of “strong and stable government with Theresa May”. Instead, Davidson’s party campaigned on opposition to a second independence referendum, which Nicola Sturgeon had said was now inevitable. The Tories therefore offered themselves to the electorate as the party most robustly committed to defending the Union. It worked. Even North Lanarkshire Council, which includes Motherwell, has Tory councillors. Their leader is Meghan Gallacher. I ask her, too, whether she thought Brexit made independence more or less likely. She says it wouldn’t have any effect. Meghan Gallacher “In terms of the independence question, Brexit doesn't change that. In 2014, the people of Scotland voted No, they voted to reject independence,” she says. “In 2016, the UK then collectively voted to leave the European Union. “They are not linked. They are two separate referendums.” This is difficult terrain for the Tories. This is an echo of the 1980s and 90s, when Scotland returned large Labour majorities at election after election, only to wake the next morning to find that the Conservative Prime Minister in Downing Street was installing a team of Tory ministers to govern Scotland from St Andrew’s House in Edinburgh. The Conservative Party throughout this period countered the “no mandate” argument by asserting that as a constituent part of the UK, it was right and just that Scotland should be governed according to the democratically expressed wishes of the UK as a whole. It didn’t cut much ice with the public. Opposition to Westminster’s right to choose Scotland’s government gained popular traction, and by the late 1990s there was overwhelming public support for a devolved Scottish parliament. I asked Meghan Gallacher whether the Conservatives were in danger of walking that path again - in effect telling the Scottish electorate that it was right that their desire to remain in the EU should be disregarded because the UK as a whole had voted to leave. She said she believed Brexit would do no harm to the Union. “I don't believe that people went out and voted solely [in the independence referendum of 2014] on the subject of the European Union. “People went out and rejected independence because they believed in the United Kingdom. They believed in the economic benefits, the social benefits the United Kingdom brings to Scotland.” But the lesson of the 1980s and 90s is clear: if Scotland has to live with decisions that it rejected at the polls, but which the rest of the UK adopted and subsequently imposed in Scotland, there will be a price to pay. Rule nothing out. Brexit has taught us that the electorate either dismiss warnings of economic disruption as scaremongering, or decide that they care less about the economic consequences than they do about national sovereignty. And whether you are for or against Brexit, for or against independence, expect that assertion, the one I first heard on a yacht in Southampton - “It’s not easy being told what to do by another country” - to acquire a new force in Scotland, if in the years of negotiation that lie ahead, the key decisions will be made, and the key deals struck, by a UK government in London. It is a vast green emptiness that has only, in the past few years, begun to undergo redevelopment.  There is a new college, an impressive indoor sports centre, and the beginnings of new housing.

There’s also been  a revival of Tory fortunes in Scotland. For a generation, the Conservatives had appeared moribund. But after the election of Ruth Davidson as leader, the party repositioned itself. At the 2017 election, Conservatives in Scotland took the decision not to campaign on the same message as their counterparts in England. There wasn’t much talk in Scotland of “strong and stable government with Theresa May”. Instead, Davidson’s party campaigned on opposition to a second independence referendum, which Nicola Sturgeon had said was now inevitable. The Tories therefore offered themselves to the electorate as the party most robustly committed to defending the Union. It worked. Even North Lanarkshire Council, which includes Motherwell, has Tory councillors. Their leader is Meghan Gallacher. I ask her, too, whether she thought Brexit made independence more or less likely. She says it wouldn’t have any effect. Meghan Gallacher “In terms of the independence question, Brexit doesn't change that. In 2014, the people of Scotland voted No, they voted to reject independence,” she says. “In 2016, the UK then collectively voted to leave the European Union. “They are not linked. They are two separate referendums.” This is difficult terrain for the Tories. This is an echo of the 1980s and 90s, when Scotland returned large Labour majorities at election after election, only to wake the next morning to find that the Conservative Prime Minister in Downing Street was installing a team of Tory ministers to govern Scotland from St Andrew’s House in Edinburgh. The Conservative Party throughout this period countered the “no mandate” argument by asserting that as a constituent part of the UK, it was right and just that Scotland should be governed according to the democratically expressed wishes of the UK as a whole. It didn’t cut much ice with the public. Opposition to Westminster’s right to choose Scotland’s government gained popular traction and by the late 1990s there was overwhelming public support for a devolved Scottish parliament. I asked Meghan Gallacher whether the Conservatives were in danger of walking that path again - in effect telling the Scottish electorate that it was right that their desire to remain in the EU should be disregarded because the UK as a whole had voted to leave. She said she believed Brexit would do no harm to the Union. “I don't believe that people went out and voted solely [in the independence referendum of 2014] on the subject of the European Union. “People went out and rejected independence because they believed in the United Kingdom. They believed in the economic benefits, the social benefits the United Kingdom brings to Scotland.” But the lesson of the 1980s and 90s is clear: if Scotland has to live with decisions that it rejected at the polls, but which the rest of the UK adopted and subsequently imposed in Scotland, there will be a price to pay. Rule nothing out. Brexit has taught us that the electorate either dismiss warnings of economic disruption as scaremongering, or decide that they care less about the economic consequences than they do about national sovereignty. And whether you are for or against Brexit, for or against independence, expect that assertion, the one I first heard on a yacht in Southampton - “It’s not easy being told what to do by another country” - to acquire a new force in Scotland, if in the years of negotiation that lie ahead, the key decisions will be made, and the key deals struck, by a UK government in London. Brexit has divided Britain bitterly. We are going through arguably the most profound re-orientation since World War II. The referendum posed a binary question to which there were multiple answers. Those who fought the Leave campaign quickly divided, after their victory, on what Leave meant. Much of the country feels cheated. Remainers feel cheated because they believe the Leave campaign scraped over the 50% mark by lying about how easy leaving the EU would be,  by insisting that Britain would “hold all the cards” and that the UK could have all the benefits of full membership without any of the responsibilities - having its cake and eating it. And Leavers feel cheated because the result was clear and we still haven’t left. Many believe a “liberal establishment” is sabotaging Brexit, often in secret. There is widespread contempt for MPs and for the institution of parliament. A stab-in-the-back narrative is gaining traction. If Brexit goes wrong, or if it doesn’t happen, there will be a search for scapegoats. The Leave vote was, in many places, an expression of revolt against a perceived powerlessness - of “not being included in the game called Great Britain” as Danny Flynn in Stoke-on-Trent put it to me. How much more powerless will those communities feel if Brexit, in the end, doesn’t happen? “We’re the only country in the world with Great in front of its name,” John Chadwick in Wigan said. “What is there to be frightened of?” We’re also one of the few countries in the world with United in its name. If the last three years have damaged our democracy, they have also raised new and pressing questions about whether the UK will emerge from this process as a single state. For those of us old enough to remember how the 1980s affected the attitude of Scots toward devolution, the next few years look like fertile territory for the independence movement. This trip has been a sobering exercise. Whatever emerges in the years that lie ahead, the UK has some work to do in repairing its democracy, in restoring trust between the institutions of political power and the governed. For the inescapable conclusion is this: almost three years after voting for the most radical change in the country’s destiny, almost nobody is unequivocally happy. And everybody believes they know who’s to blame. Recrimination hangs in the air. Don’t we need to have a serious conversation about how that has happened? Built with Shorthand"
France falls foul of its own fake news law,"Twitter has taken a ""hard-line stance"", French officials say A social media campaign from the French government has been blocked by Twitter - because of the government's own anti-fake-news law. Since December, France requires online political campaigns to declare who paid for them, and how much was spent. But now Twitter has rejected a government voter registration campaign. The company could not find a solution to obey the letter of the new law, officials said â and opted to avoid the potential problem altogether. The #OuiJeVote (Yes, I Vote) campaign encouraged voters to register for the European elections ahead of the deadline. It was operated by the French government information service, which had planned to pay for sponsored tweets, according to news agency AFP.

PayPal to reject essay-writing firms,"Payments company PayPal is going to withdraw services from essay-writing firms selling to university students. Last month, Education Secretary Damian Hinds called on PayPal to stop processing payments for such firms, in a bid to beat academic cheating. Mr Hinds had said it was ""unethical for these companies to profit from this dishonest business"". PayPal is to begin contacting firms which use its payment system to sell academic essays online. ""PayPal is working with businesses associated with essay-writing services to ensure our platform is not used to facilitate deceptive and fraudulent practices in education,"" said a spokesman for the payment firm. ""PayPal will continue to diligently review and take appropriate action on accounts found to facilitate cheating that undermines academic integrity."" From Wednesday, the payment company is to begin contacting essay-writing firms, giving them notice that they should ""move their business elsewhere"". But this will not be an ""overnight ban"" - as there will be debates over which services are helping students to cheat and which are offering legitimate tutoring assistance. PayPal urged to block essay-writing firms YouTube deletes cheating videos Essay cheat companies face university ban How do you stop online students from cheating? The man who helps students to cheat This is a business that operates across national borders - so PayPal says there will need to be an international response. University leaders have warned repeatedly about the risk of so-called ""essay mills"" being used by students to cheat. The move by PayPal was welcomed by the higher education watchdog, the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), which hadwritten to the company in November,external, calling on them ""to close down the payment facilities for the essay-writing companies that encourage students to cheat"".. ""This decision is a huge step forwards in the battle to close down these unscrupulous operators,"" said the QAA's head of policy and public affairs, Gareth Crossman. ""Essay companies rely heavily on payment platforms like PayPal to process students' orders. Removing this facility will significantly hamper their operation. ""Essay companies remain a huge threat to the academic integrity of UK higher education,"" said Mr Crossman. The education secretary had said the QAA identified 17,000 academic offences in 2016 - but it was impossible to know how many cases had gone undetected. ""Sadly there have always been some people who opt for the easy way, and the internet has seen a black market in essay-writing services spring up,"" said Mr Hinds. Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: ""Cheating should be tackled and the problem should not be allowed to fester any longer.

Pub bombings victims 'unlawfully killed',"The bombs killed 21 and injured 220 at the two pubs in November 1974 The coroner at the inquests into the deaths of 21 people in the Birmingham pub bombings has instructed the jury to return a verdict of unlawful killing. Sir Peter Thornton QC has begun summing up at the end of six weeks of evidence about explosions at two city centre pubs on 21 November 1974. He directed the jury to answer ""Yes"" to the question whether the 21 people were unlawfully killed. ""This was murder in ordinary language and murder in law,"" he said. The bombs killed 21 and injured 220 at the Mulberry Bush in the base of the city's Rotunda and the Tavern in the Town in nearby New Street. Coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC gave the jury eight questions to answer The coroner listed eight questions about the bombings which the jury had to answer, including the adequacy of warnings telephoned to a local newspaper, whether the authorities had forewarnings of the attacks and whether the IRA was responsible. He added: ""Consider the nature of the planting and priming of the bombs, the location of the bombs in crowded pubs. When you take this all into account there is only one answer. ""This was murder and you can be sure of it."" The Birmingham pub bombings killed these 21 people in November 1974 The jury was also advised to ""set aside their feelings"" in reaching their verdicts. ""You have heard a great deal of moving and distressing evidence which as fellow human beings we are touched by,"" Sir Peter said. ""Whatever your feelings you must put them to one side.

Scarface killer jailed for fifth murder,"Mane Driza was also known as Tony Montana, after Al Pacino's Scarface character A serial killer who used the nickname of Al Pacino's character in Scarface has been jailed for a fifth murder. Mane Driza - also known as Tony Montana -killed Stefan Bledar Moneat their flat in north London in June 1999. Father-to-be Mr Mone was left with 120 injuries following the ""brutal"" attack. Driza, 41, then went on a three-year killing spree across Europe. He was sentenced to 20 years in jail at the Old Bailey on Wednesday. The court heard he had already been found guilty of four fatal shootings and an attempted murder in Albania and Italy as well as making threats to kill. Judge Sarah Munro QC sentenced Driza to life with a minimum term of 20 years. He will not begin serving his British sentence until 2026, when his sentence in Italy comes to an end. ""This is a very unusual, if not unique case,"" Ms Munro said. Driza (r) with Stefan Bledar Mone Driza, a stonemason, was furious when his flatmate took his wedding ring and gave it to his partner, the court heard. He then used a pick axe handle, a lock knife and a cheese knife to beat and stab Mr Mone at their Wembley home. Man known as Tony Montana 'murdered friend' Scarface killer guilty of murder News and updates from across London The victim's pregnant girlfriend, Zoe Blay, found the body the next day and was only able to identify him by a distinctive belt buckle.

Payday lender's collapse to hit borrowers,"Hundreds of thousands of people who were mis-sold payday loans will receive a fraction of the compensation they are entitled to after a lender collapsed. WageDay Advance had given loans to about 800,000 people but went into administration earlier this year. In a case that mirrors the demise of Wonga, the company folded after being hit by a wave of compensation claims for mis-sold loans. Customers are now receiving emails to explain how much they owe or are owed. However, now the company is in administration, those who have paid off loans but are entitled to compensation have become unsecured creditors. They can only expect a fraction of the full compensation payout. Michael Ingram no longer owes money to WageDay Advance, but has borrowed from the company on several occasions in the past. Once one loan had been paid off, he took another - often bigger - one. His largest loans were for about Â£700. The 32-year-old full-time dad submitted a complaint in November that he had been mis-sold loans. He was contacted by the company to say it would not be able to process that complaint within the eight weeks stipulated by regulators. He was still waiting when the company went into administration. ""My complaint has not been resolved. I want some closure. I am optimistic, but I am not holding my breath,"" he said. WageDay Advance and Juo Loans were the brand names of CURO Transatlantic Limited, which went into administration in February. It had been one of the middle-ranking payday lenders operating in the UK, with most customers applying for loans online or through their smartphones from WageDay. In 2017, it won an industry award when it was named the best short-term loan provider. But many loans had been mis-sold to people who could not afford to pay them back, had loans rolled over, or had multiple loans with other providers. Thousands of these customers complained, many via claims management companies. The company built a claims calculator, which has estimated that current and former customers could be entitled to up to Â£223m in compensation, including interest. An estimated 330,000 people are expected still to have eligible claims for compensation. Successful claims made last year had an average payout of Â£850. The firm collapsed as it was unable to cope with the cost of dealing with these complaints and the potential payouts. Now administrators from KPMG are using that calculator to determine how much individual customers still owe, after compensation is subtracted. Calculations are also being made to work out compensation entitlement for each former borrower who has already paid off their loans. Claims firms 'will disappear at worst time' Wonga: Fourfold rise in compensation claimant estimate These individuals are now receiving emails, and accompanying text messages, outlining their entitlement, or new balance if they are still paying back loans. The emails carry the logo of the administrators, KPMG, and WageDay Advance and Juo Loans. However, recipients must reply to claim the compensation that has been calculated. The number of claims will determine how much is eventually paid out, but it will only be a fraction of the full amount. Anyone with outstanding loans will still have to pay off the balance after compensation has been subtracted, although fees and interest have been permanently frozen. Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said the total compensation bill reflected the ""huge amount of interest many desperate people ended up paying"". ""Payday loans are supposed to be short term borrowing. But too often Wageday Advance customers were caught in the payday loan trap for months and even years, only able to repay a loan if they borrowed again soon after,"" she said. ""Wageday Advance were a medium-size payday lender. It would be interesting to know if the other lenders have worked out how much they should be paying in refunds to customers given unaffordable loans."" About 60,000 loans - almost entirely recent loans without any compensation entitlement - were sold off to Shelby Finance Limited, and will continue as normal. Customers can check if they are one of those transferred on theWageDay website,external. Fears over the level of personal debt built up by individuals continues to concern charities. In its annual report, published on Wednesday, debt charity StepChange said there had been a ""small, but worrying"" rise in the number of people seeking help who had payday, or high-cost and short-term, loans. Some 26% of new female clients and 35% of new male clients, aged under 25, had this kind of debt, a much higher level than older age groups. Overall, the charity said it had seen a consistent rise in single parents seeking help, Some 85% of them were women. In 2018, 23% of those who took debt advice were single parents, up from 21.5% in 2017 and from 18% since 2014. Single parents account for only 6% of the UK population. ""While debt can strike at any age, on average our clients are getting younger. It is important that policymakers work to help turn the tide and prevent debt becoming an inevitable rite of passage for young adults,"" said Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange.

PM to meet Corbyn for Brexit talks,"Theresa May has responded to criticism from her own MPs over talks with Jeremy Corbyn by saying all MPs have a responsibility to deliver Brexit. The PM said the public ""expect us to reach across this House to find a way through this"". Mr Corbyn said he welcomed the PM's ""willingness to compromise to resolve the Brexit deadlock"". The PM's move to hold talks has angered some Brexiteers, with two ministers resigning over it. Chris Heaton-Harris became the latest to quit on Wednesday afternoon,external, claiming his job at the Department for Exiting the European Union had become ""irrelevant"" if the government is not prepared to leave without a deal. Wales Minister Nigel Adams also resigned his role on Wednesday morning, saying the government was at risk of failing to deliver ""the Brexit people voted for"". The PM met Mr Corbyn before holding talks with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford. Ms Sturgeon - who also met Mr Corbyn earlier - said she had ""good"" and ""open"" conversations with both leaders, and while she believed Mr Corbyn would ""drive a hard bargain"", she was ""still not entirely clear"" where the prime minister was willing to compromise. The SNP leader, who backs a further referendum and wants to remain in the EU, told reporters: ""My concern is that in the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking, what will happen over the next few days... is a bad compromise will be reached."" Kuenssberg: PM chooses a deal over party unity Brexitcast: Theresa's Choice We must leave the EU, says attorney general The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, Plaid Cymru and the Independent Group have also held a joint press conference, calling for any decision made by the leaders to be put to a public vote. From left to right: Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, The Independent Group MP Chuka Umunna, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville-Roberts and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, said: ""People have the opportunity to have another shot at it, [in the Commons], to change their mind. ""Surely if that is how democracy works here, then democracy should go back to the people and people should have their say on whatever model comes forward."" What are the Brexit sticking points? The UK has until 12 April to propose a plan to the EU - which must be accepted by the bloc - or it will leave without a deal on that date. In a statement on Tuesday night, the PM announced she wanted to meet Mr Corbyn to agree a way forward and put the plan to a vote in the Commons before 10 April - when the EU will hold an emergency summit on Brexit. She insisted her withdrawal agreement - which was voted down last week - would remain part of the deal. If there is no agreement between the two leaders, Mrs May said a number of options would be put to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"". In either event, Mrs May said she would ask the EU for a further short extension to hopefully get an agreement passed by Parliament before 22 May, so the UK does not have to take part in European elections.

But at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said she wanted to deliver Brexit ""in an orderly way"" and, to do that, ""we have to get an agreement through the House"". And Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay blamed hard Brexiteers in the pro-Leave European Research Group for making the PM move to these talks. This video can not be played ""I'm absolutely appalled"" Mrs May told MPs there were a ""number of areas"" where she agreed with Mr Corbyn in relation to Brexit, including ending free movement. The Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkarsaid the talks were ""timely"", and he hoped Mr Corbyn would ""rise to the occasion"" and ""come up with a compromise plan"" with the prime minister. The PM's negotiated plan includes two sections - the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. The withdrawal agreement sets out how the UK would leave the EU, including the money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period, and citizens' rights - as well as the controversial Irish backstop that aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The political declaration focuses on the future relationship with the bloc and, unlike the withdrawal agreement, is not legally binding. Mrs May said on Tuesday that any plan she agreed with Mr Corbyn ""would have to agree the current withdrawal agreement"", but she was ready to discuss the future relationship, i.e. the political declaration. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay also said that was the element Labour had expressed more concern about. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said there was not much difference between the government's version of Brexit and Labour's version - but there did not seem to be ""an enormous amount of confidence"" a political consensus could be reached from either party. The row comesafter Mrs May had more than seven hours of talks with her cabinet on Tuesday. Laura Kuenssberg said there was ""rage and dispute"" in the cabinet meeting, with ""wildly varying accounts"" of how many people were for and against different versions of Brexit extensions. Labour has previously said it has five demand for supporting a Brexit deal, including protecting workers' rights and national security, and securing the same benefits of being in the single market the UK has currently. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of MPs will attempt to push throughlegislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. If agreed, the bill - presented by Labour MP Yvette Cooper - would require the PM by law to ask for an extension of Article 50. MPs took part in a three-hour debate on a business motion to set out how proceedings would run throughout evening. But a vote on an amendment to the motion, put forward by Labour's Hilary Benn, calling for time on Monday to hold more indicative votes, resulted in a draw - the first time such a result has happened in 39 years. The Speaker John Bercow then used his casting vote to reject the amendment, meaning MPs will not have the indicative votes next week. The overall business motion was passed, but by just one vote - with 312 MPs voting for it, and 311 against. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, Greens and the Independent Group are putting forward an amendment to the bill to again call for a public vote on any outcome to become law. The approximate timings of the day are: 17:30 BSTVoting on the business motion setting out tonight's process 19:00- A second reading vote on the bill 22:00- Committee stage starts (this stage usually starts within a couple of weeks of a bill's second reading) and finally third reading vote Thursday- Bill could be considered by the House of Lords Other key dates coming up include: Wednesday 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek / EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

No verdict on Hillsborough police chiefJurors in the manslaughter trial of match commander David Duckenfield are unable to reach a verdict.,"David Duckenfield and Graham Mackrell were on trial at Preston Crown Court The jury in the trial of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield has been unable to reach a verdict. Former Ch Supt Duckenfield, now 74, had denied the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans in the 1989 disaster. Lawyers for Mr Duckenfield have said they will oppose an application from prosecutors for a retrial. Ex-Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell was found guilty of a health and safety charge. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has said it will seek a retrial for Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset. But lawyers for the former South Yorkshire Police officer said they would apply for a ""stay of proceedings"" to prevent another trial. Updates and more reaction on this story During the 10-week trial at Preston Crown Court, jurors heard that 96 men, women and children died as a result of a fatal crush on the Leppings Lane terrace on 15 April 1989. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster. The jury deliberated for more than 29 hours but was unable to agree whether Mr Duckenfield was guilty or not guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. This video can not be played Hillsborough families react to no verdict over David Duckenfield CPS legal director Sue Hemming said the trial had been ""incredibly complex"" and she recognised ""that these developments will be difficult for the families affected by the Hillsborough disaster"".

She added: ""We were all hoping we would have some sort of closure today and we haven't."" The jury heard 96 men, women and children died as a result of a fatal crush on the Leppings Lane terrace Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher died in the disaster, said he was ""exceedingly disappointed"" the jury had failed to reach a verdict on the charge against Mr Duckenfield. Speaking after the jury was discharged, Mr Devonside said: ""Most of the families wanted a verdict of one kind or another. ""I, like many people, want a conclusion and Hillsborough to come to an end so we can return, as a family, to some sort of normality. We hope for a retrial."" However, Steve Kelly, whose brother Michael died at Hillsborough, said: ""I can only speak personally [and] I don't want to see another trial. ""We've been here for nearly 11 weeks and I don't think I could go through that again. And a lot of the elderly family members shouldn't either."" In a statement, Liverpool Football Club said it wanted to ""reiterate our support and admiration for the Hillsborough families, survivors and campaigners"". Barry Devonside said ""most of the families wanted a verdict of one kind or another"" The trial heard Mr Duckenfield ordered the opening of exit gates at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at 14:52 BST, eight minutes before kick off, after the area outside the turnstiles became dangerously overcrowded. More than 2,000 fans entered through exit gate C once it was opened and many headed for the tunnel ahead of them, which led to the central pens where the crush happened. Prosecutors alleged Mr Duckenfield had ""ultimate responsibility"" at the ground and should have made ""key lifesaving decisions"" on the day. Mr Duckenfield's defence case lasted just 74 minutes and consisted of read evidence from his deputy on the day - ground commander Bernard Murray. His defence argued the case against Mr Duckenfield was ""breathtakingly unfair"" and said he had ""tried to do the right thing"". The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Mr Mackrell, 69, was convicted of failing to discharge his duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act, by a majority of 10 to two. He was accused of failing to take reasonable care to ensure there were enough turnstiles to prevent large crowds building up. The court heard there were seven turnstiles for the 10,100 Liverpool fans with standing tickets for the match against Nottingham Forest. Mr Mackrell did not give evidence but Jason Beer QC, defending, argued the build-up of fans outside was caused by other factors, including a lack of police cordons and the unusual arrival pattern of supporters.

British activist found dead in Peru,"Paul McAuley ran a youth hostel in the Amazon city of Iquitos A British environmental activist and Catholic missionary has been found dead at a hostel in Peru. The body of Paul McAuley, 71, was discovered by students on Tuesday in the Amazon city of Iquitos. Local media reported that his body had been burned. The activist, who was born in Portsmouth, had lived in the country for more than 20 years, working with indigenous people and campaigning on environmental issues. An investigation has been launched and officials are questioning six people who lived at the youth hostel which was run by Mr McAuley. He was also a lay member of the De La Salle Christian Brothers, a Catholic religious teaching order, and was awarded an MBE for setting up a school in a poor community of the capital, Lima. Mr McAuley came to international attention in 2010 when the Peruvian government ordered his expulsion.He was accused of inciting unrest among indigenous people for protesting against environmental destruction. It led hundreds of people to demonstrate in support of him and and he eventually won the right to stay after a lengthy court battle. The battle for Peru's jungle,external Peru's Amazon: Where roads change lives The jungle village hooked on their phones Environmental groups were quick to pay tribute to Mr McAuley. ""It has been a privilege to meet and work with Brother Paul,"" Julia Urrunaga, who works for the Environmental Investigation Agency in Peru, said in a tweet. Mr McAuley said he was trying to teach Peruvians in the Amazon about their rights Mr McAuley first travelled to the Peruvian Amazon in 2000 to support indigenous activists. In 2010, he told the BBC that he hoped to teach Peruvians about their environmental and human rights. ""Education is often accused of inciting people to understand their rights, to be capable or organising themselves to ensure their human rights,"" he said. ""If that's a crime, then yes I'm guilty,"" he added. ""As a member of a Catholic order, my life's been dedicated to human and Christian education.""

"" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned against accepting a ""bad compromise"" after holding Brexit talks with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. Political leaders have been meeting in London in a bid to break the logjam over the UK's exit from the EU.

The SNP leader said the UK should ask for a longer extension to Brexit, and that any compromise deal that is ultimately hammered out should be put back to the public in a new referendum, with remaining in the EU also as an option. The UK's departure from the EU was put back from 29 March to 12 April following a summit of European leaders late in March.

Brunei punishes gay sex with death,"Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei Brunei is introducing strict new Islamic laws that make anal sex and adultery offences punishable by stoning to death. The new measures, that come into force on Wednesday, also cover a range of other crimes including punishment for theft by amputation. The move has sparked international condemnation. Brunei's gay community has expressed shock and fear at the ""medieval punishments"". ""You wake up and realise that your neighbours, your family or even that nice old lady that sells prawn fritters by the side of the road doesn't think you're human, or is okay with stoning,"" one Bruneian gay man, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. The sultan of the small South-East Asian nation on Wednesday called for ""stronger"" Islamic teachings. ""I want to see Islamic teachings in this country grow stronger,"" Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said in a public address, according to AFP news agency, without mentioning the strict new interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. Brunei: What you need to know Where is gay sex still against the law? What is Sharia? Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Muslims make up about two-thirds of the country's population of 420,000. Brunei has retained the death penalty but has not carried out an execution since 1957. The law mostly applies to Muslims, including children who have reached puberty, though some aspects will apply to non-Muslims. Under the new laws,individuals accused of certain acts will be convicted if they confess or if there were witnesses present.,external Offences such as rape, adultery, sodomy, robbery and insult or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad will carry the maximum penalty of death.,external Lesbian sex carries a different penalty of 40 strokes of the cane and/or a maximum of 10 years in jail The punishment for theft is amputation Those who ""persuade, tell or encourage"" Muslim children under the age of 18 ""to accept the teachings of religions other than Islam"" are liable to a fine or jail Individuals who have not reached puberty but are convicted of certain offences may be instead subjected to whipping. Sultan Hassanal heads the Brunei Investment Agency which owns the Dorchester Collection, an operator of some of the world's top hotels including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. Brunei's ruling royals possess a huge private fortune and its largely ethnic Malay residents enjoy generous state handouts and pay no taxes. ButHollywood actor George Clooney and other celebrities have now called for a boycott of the luxury hotels.TV host Ellen DeGeneres also called for people to ""rise up"", saying ""we need to do something now"".

The hotel operator said it did ""not tolerate any form of discrimination"". ""Dorchester Collection's code emphasises equality, respect and integrity in all areas of our operation, and strongly values people and cultural diversity amongst our guests and employees,"" it said. ""Inclusion and diversity remain core beliefs."" In another development,a honorary degree awarded by the UK's University of Aberdeen to Sultan Hassanal is under review. The country first introduced Sharia law in 2014 despite widespread condemnation, giving it a dual legal system with both Sharia and Common Law. The sultan had said then that the new penal code would come into full force over several years. The first phase, which covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines, was implemented in 2014. Brunei had delayed introducing the final two phases, which cover crimes punishable by amputation and stoning. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who is also the prime minister of Brunei, is among the wealthiest people in the world But on Saturday, the government released a statement on its website sayingthe Sharia penal code would be fully implemented on Wednesday,external. In the days since, there has been international outrage and calls for the country to reverse course. ""These abusive provisions received widespread condemnation when plans were first discussed five years ago,"" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, a Brunei researcher at Amnesty International. ""Brunei's penal code is a deeply flawed piece of legislation containing a range of provisions that violate human rights."" The United Nations echoed the statement, calling the legislation ""cruel, inhuman and degrading"", and saying it marked a ""serious setback"" for human rights protection. Maldives annuls woman's stoning ruling How many countries still have the death penalty? According to rights group Human Rights Without Frontiers,stoning is still a punishment in countries such as Iran, Somalia and Sudan among others,external. There are several theories, but Matthew Woolfe, founder of human rights group The Brunei Project, said it could be linked to Brunei's weakening economy. ""One theory is that it is a way for the government to strengthen its hold on power in the face of a declining economy that could potentially lead to some unrest in future,"" Mr Woolfe told the BBC. ""Connected to this is [Brunei's] interest in attracting more investment from the Muslim world, along with more Islamic touristsâ¦ this could be seen as one way of appealing to this market."" One rights group says the tightening Sharia laws might be a way for the government to strengthen its hold on power Mr Woolfe also added that the government might have hoped to get away with the latest roll-out without anyone realising. ""I think that the government did want to ensure that the international uproar that followed implementation of the first phase in 2014 had well and truly died down before further [implementation], in the hope it would just quietly [do so] without anyone realising,"" he said. ""It wasn't until increasing international attention that it finally came out and confirmed [this]."" The penal code changes were posted on the attorney general's website in December but only came to public attention in late March. There was no public announcement. One 40-year-old gay Bruneian currently seeking asylum in Canada said the impact of the new penal code was already being felt in Brunei. The ex-government employee, who left Brunei last year after being charged with sedition for a Facebook post that was critical of the government, said people were ""afraid"". ""The gay community in Brunei has never been open but when Grindr [a gay dating app] came that helped people meet in secret. But now, what I've heard is that hardly anyone is using Grindr anymore,"" Shahiran S Shahrani Md told the BBC. ""They're afraid that they might talk to a police officer pretending to be gay. It hasn't happened yet but because of the new laws, people are afraid,"" he said. Another male Bruneian, who is not gay but has renounced Islam, said he felt ""fearful and numb"" in the face of the laws being implemented. ""We ordinary citizens are powerless to stop Sharia law from being implemented,"" said the 23-year-old, who did not want to be identified. ""Under Sharia, I would face the death penalty for apostasy."" One gay man was hopeful that the laws might not be enforced widely. ""Honestly, I'm not too scared as the government here often bluffs with the harsh punishments. But it can and will still happen even with it being rare."" It is very unlikely to happen at all, people inside Brunei have told Bill Hayton, associate fellow with the Asia Pacific programme at Chatham House. ""What I'm hearing from people in Brunei is that this is very, very unlikely to ever happen,"" he told BBC Radio Four. For instance, the laws stipulate that there must be four Muslim witnesses to the act of anal sex or adultery for it to be prosecuted, he said. ""The way it is being explained to me is that this is a way for the sultan to look religious but make sure that none of these punishments will actually be carried out,"" Mr Hayton said.

Army probing 'Corbyn target practice' film,"This video can not be played Four soldiers appear to fire shots in a video posted on social media A video showing soldiers firing at a Jeremy Corbyn poster for target practice demonstrated a serious error of judgment, an Army chief has said. Brigadier Nick Perry said the Army was taking the matter ""extremely seriously"" and would fully investigate. ""The video shows totally unacceptable behaviour that falls far below the behaviour that we expect,"" he said. Labour leader Mr Corbyn said he was ""shocked"" by the clip; his party said it had confidence in the investigation. Mr Corbyn added: ""I hope the Ministry of Defence will conduct an inquiry into it and find out what was going on and who did that."" The short clip shows four paratroopers in uniform firing down the range before the camera pans to the target, a large portrait of the Labour leader. Brig Perry, commander of 16 Air Assault Brigade, said there were currently 400 soldiers from his brigade working with Nato and Afghan partners in Afghanistan, where the footage is thought to have been filmed. He said they were doing an ""outstanding job in theatre"" but this incident would be fully investigated. He stressed the Army was, and always would be, an apolitical organisation. The prime minister's official spokesperson said Theresa May was aware of the video but had not watched it, and had called it ""clearly unacceptable"". Defence secretary Gavin Williamson said he commends ""the prompt and clear leadership shown by the Army in investigating this troubling video"". Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, a former lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the video was ""disgraceful"". Rory Stewart, Conservative minister for prisons, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire that it was ""completely wrong"" and the soldiers' behaviour was ""outrageous"". ""They should not be political - they are there to defend the country and the Queen,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And Angela Rayner, Labour's shadow education secretary, said she hoped the investigation would be conducted ""thoroughly and the conclusions made public"".

Flybe cancels flights amid redundancy talksFlights from Belfast City Airport and from Birmingham are among the dozens of flights affected.Business,"Regional airline Flybe has cancelled dozens of Wednesday morning flights as it enters discussions over potential job losses. The company blamed an industry-wide shortage of pilots for the delays, as well as its own pilots taking holidays. Flights from Belfast City Airport and Birmingham are among those affected. Most of the flights are within the UK. The airline said it would like to ""sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused"". The discussions over jobs are at an early stage and the company will try and avoid job losses by filling internal vacancies with existing staff, including roles at other bases, Flybe's chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener told BBC Radio 5 live. The company is ""engaging with all impacted crew"", she said. Of the delays, she said the company would ""follow all the rules of compensation"" and that ""we are expecting to go back to normal operation as soon as possible"". While the disruption was widespread, it only affected 5% of flights, she insisted. Cardiff Airport boss Deb Barber said: ""We understand Flybe is in the process of consulting with a number of its employees, including its crew at multiple bases across its network, which includes Cardiff. ""Flybe's plan to restructure and reduce its jet operations across many bases is part of the company's long-standing objective to stabilise the business,"" she said. The cuts will affect Doncaster, Norwich and Exeter, as well as Cardiff, as the company seeks to drop expensive jets in favour of cheaper turboprop airliners. The company says it will make the following changes: Exeter- Flybe will fly its last jets from the airport on 26 October. This will not affect turboprop flights or its ""base structure"" it said. Norwich- Jets will also stop flying from this airport at around the same time.  This will not affect services at Norwich operated by Flybe's franchise partner, Eastern Airways, it said. Cardiff and Doncaster- Flybe will also stop flying jets from these two airports.  It will close its servicing operations at the airports, but will offer turboprop flights. Unite the union regional officer Peter Coulson said: ""Unite is seeking to minimise the potential job losses and secure assurances about Flybe's long-term future."" He urged the company to be forthcoming about its plan. ""It is essential that Flybe is fully transparent with its workforce about the exact situation facing the company. The current uncertainty is incredibly unsettling and is in danger of severely damaging morale at the company."" Sue Piercey has cancelled her holiday plans Sue Piercey, who lives in Bradford, told the BBC her flight from Leeds to Belfast today was cancelled. ""We received a curt email at 19:00 last night followed by an even shorter text message,"" she said. ""No other flight options were offered."" Flybe are scheduled to fly three later services from Leeds to Belfast today, and none were offered to Ms Piercey, she said. ""Our holiday is totally off now, and I hope my insurance company can help me,"" she said, describing herself as ""very annoyed today"". Customers also vented their frustration on social media.

Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter Anyone whose flight is cancelled is entitled to choose between a refund paid within seven days, or an alternative flight (or bus) - even with a rival carrier. Unless they have chosen a refund, it is the responsibility of the airline to get anyone with a ticket to their final destination as promptly as possible. In many cases, they should receive refreshments during any wait of two or more hours. Passengers whose flight is cancelled, or who suffer long delays, can apply forextra compensation,externalunder EU rules. As these are mostly short-haul flights, and the cancellations were last-minute, most will be entitled to compensation of â¬250 (Â£213). Anyone who misses a connecting flight should talk to the airline operating that second flight but, according to consumer group Which?, they may have to make a claim for the cost of a new flight from their travel insurance. On Monday, Flybe passengers on a new route were left witha six-hour coach journey when their aircraft was grounded. The 18:40 service from Newquay to Heathrow could not take off on Sunday because of a ""technical issue"". Cornwall Airport Newquay said passengers were offered ""rebooking for another flight or ground transport to London Heathrow"". Flybe was bought early this year in a rescue deal following poor financial results. Connect Airways, a consortium led by Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, paid a total of Â£2.8m for Flybe's assets and operations. The Exeter-based regional airline put itself up for sale last November, following a profit warning the previous month. Virgin, Stobart Air and Cyrus Capital set up Connect Airways in December. Flybe fell into difficulty in 2017, after what was considered a too-aggressive expansion strategy. The company ran up a near-Â£20m loss in the financial year ending 31 March 2017. Passengers were booked onto a brand new route from Newquay to Heathrow but ended up on a coach This January, one employee was moved to send an email accusing the firm's directors of ruining a profitable company. The employee, a senior pilot, addressed the email to Flybe's chief executive, Ms Ourmieres-Widener. ""Congratulations, in two years at Flybe you and your fellow incompetent cohorts have managed to totally destroy a viable airline which was making profits when you took over,"" he wrote. The BBC understands that the airline has suspended the pilot. Flybe told the BBC that ""an individual was suspended on 17 January 2019 in accordance with company policy"".

"Boots warns of possible store closuresThe parent company of the pharmacy chain plans ""decisive steps"" to reduce costs.","The US owner of pharmacy chain Boots has warned of possible store closures in the UK as it tries to cut costs. Walgreens Boots Alliance said it would take ""decisive steps"" to reduce costs as part of a company-wide ""significant restructuring"". The move comes afterthe chain said,externalit had suffered its ""most difficult quarter"" since the firm's formation, with UK like-for-like sales down 2.3%. The chain has 2,485 stores across the UK, employing about 56,000 staff. The firm said a store portfolio review was under way across the global business. But Boots in the UK said there were no plans for major reductions, adding that it had managed to maintain its market share in the most recent quarter. ""We currently do not have a major programme envisaged, but as you'd expect, we always review underperforming stores and seek out opportunities for consolidation,"" it said. Chief executive Stefano Pessina said market challenges had ""accelerated"" in the three months to the end of February, but that it had failed to respond rapidly enough ""resulting in a disappointing quarter"". ""We are going to be more aggressive in our response to these rapidly shifting trends,"" he added. Actions announced include ""optimising its store footprint"" and increasing its planned annual cost savings from $1bn to $1.5bn. The cost cuts followBoots' announcement in Februarythat 350 jobs were at risk in its Nottingham head office, amid plans to reduce costs by 20%. Overall earnings for the firm's second quarter were down 14.3% compared to the same period last year. The company said it was now expecting profit to be flat for the full year, down from its earlier guidance of 7% to 12% growth. Maureen Hinton, global retail research director at market research firm GlobalData, said Boots in the UK was struggling to compete with beauty brands such as Charlotte Tilbury, Chanel and Dior which had developed their own stores which offered ""a more indulgent and luxury experience"". ""Boots is quite a commodity place, people go for practicalities such as health and toiletries, but it's not really exploiting trends in beauty. The stores are also looking a bit tired,"" she added. Boots is one of a string of well-known names suffering in a tough High Street environment. Last year, Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin all went bust and disappeared altogether. Other household names - Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look - were forced into restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of stores. Music chain HMV recently fell into administration before being bought. The increasing popularity of online shopping, higher business rates, rising labour costs and the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote - which has increased the cost of imported goods - have been blamed for contributing to retailers' woes. Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed in 2014 after Walgreens bought the 55% stake in UK and Switzerland-based Boots Alliance that it did not already own.

Clooney urges Brunei hotels boycott,"George Clooney said the new laws amounted to ""human rights violations"" Hollywood actor George Clooney is calling for a boycott of nine luxury hotels with links to Brunei, after the country said gay sex and adultery would soon be punishable by death. From 3 April, homosexuals could face being whipped or stoned in the tiny South East Asian state. In 2014, Brunei became the first East Asian country to adopt Islamic Sharia law despite widespread condemnation. Mr Clooney said the new laws amounted to ""human rights violations"". ""In the onslaught of news where we see the world backsliding into authoritarianism this stands alone,"" the actor wrote in a column for the entertainment website Deadline. ""Brunei is a Monarchy and certainly any boycott would have little effect on changing these laws"", he said. ""But are we really going to help pay for these human rights violations?"" Brunei introduces tough Islamic penal code Brunei: What you need to know He said Dorchester Collection hotels in the US, UK, France and Italy, which are owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, should be avoided by those who oppose the measures. Brunei, on the island of Borneo, is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and has grown rich on oil and gas exports. The Sultan owns the Brunei Investment Agency, which counts some of the world's top hotels in its portfolio, including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. ""I've stayed at many of them,"" Mr Clooney wrote, ""because I hadn't done my homework and didn't know who owned them. The Dorchester in London is among the nine hotels Mr Clooney has said should be boycotted ""Every single time we stay at or take meetings at or dine at any of these nine hotels we are putting money directly into the pockets of men who choose to stone and whip to death their own citizens,"" he added. Other public figures have also announced they are boycotting the Dorchester Collection. Filmmaker Dustin Lance Black wrote on Twitter: ""If you continue to stay at or frequent the Beverley Hills Hotel, you are guilty of financially supporting these murderers."" BBC world affairs editor John Simpson also confirmed that he wouldn't be visiting hotels owned by the group. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brunei honour reviewed over gay stoning law,"Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah received the honorary degree in 1995 An honorary degree awarded by the University of Aberdeen to the Sultan of Brunei is under review as his country makes gay sex an offence punishable by stoning to death. The strict new Islamic laws that come into force on Wednesday also cover a range of other crimes including punishment for theft by amputation. It has sparked international condemnation. The university said Hassanal Bolkiah's 1995 honour was under urgent review. Brunei punishes gay sex with death Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Brunei's gay community has expressed shock and fear at the ""medieval punishments"". The university told The Times,externalthe issue would be urgently raised with its degrees committee. It said in a statement: ""The University of Aberdeen is inclusive and open to all. ""In light of this new information, this matter will be raised as a matter of urgency with the University's Honorary Degrees Committee."" Honorary degrees were awarded by the university to a number of international dignitaries in 1995. The University of Aberdeen previously operated an exchange programme with its counterpart in Brunei and the Sultan had encouraged links between Brunei and Aberdeen, as well as taking interest in research in geology and petroleum engineering because of the importance to the oil industry. University of Aberdeen rector Maggie Chapman, co-convenor of the Scottish Green Party, told BBC Scotland of the review: ""I think absolutely it's the right approach. ""Honorary degrees are given in recognition of great achievement, of great work, but we cannot as an institution say that those are not affected by broader concerns. ""The recent changes to the law in Brunei against people who identify as different sexualities is just completely unacceptable. ""We really, really have to take a stand on this, and stand in solidarity."" Aberdeen University LGBTQ+ Forum said in a statement: ""We would like to express how horrified we were to learn of the news of the implementation of these laws in Brunei. ""We believe that the university should make steps to reconsider the Sultan's honorary degree."" The Aberdeen University Students' Association (Ausa) said: ""Implementing this law is completely out of line with the principles and values of Aberdeen University Students' Association and the University of Aberdeen. ""Such discrimination and violence has no place in modern society and the University of Aberdeen must urgently review any links they have with this individual.""

What is Sharia?,"This video can not be played Watch the key moments from the Taliban's news conference The Taliban say they will rule Afghanistan according to Sharia, or Islamic law. The militant Islamist group have taken control after the departure of US and allied forces from the country. In the first press briefing after taking power, a Taliban spokesman said issues such as the media and women's rights would be respected ""within the framework of Islamic law"", but the group has not yet provided any details of what that will mean in practice. The Taliban have been known for their strict interpretation of Sharia, including punishments such as public executions of convicted murderers and adulterers. Who are the Taliban? Taliban: Women to have rights within Islamic law Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women Sharia is Islam's legal system. It is derived from the Quran, Islam's holy book, as well as the Sunnah and Hadith - the deeds and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. Where an answer cannot be derived directly from these, religious scholars may give rulings as guidance on a particular topic or question. In Arabic, Sharia literally means ""the clear, well-trodden path to water"". Sharia acts as a code for living that all Muslims should adhere to, including prayers, fasting and donations to the poor. It aims to help Muslims understand how they should lead every aspect of their lives according to God's wishes. LISTEN: Islamic law and its origins: In Our Time, BBC Radio 4 Sharia law decrees that men and women should dress modestly, although countries vary in how they interpret this Sharia can inform every aspect of daily life for a Muslim. For example, a Muslim wondering what to do if their colleagues invite them to the pub after work may turn to a Sharia scholar for advice to ensure they act within the legal framework of their religion. Other areas of daily life where Muslims may turn to Sharia for guidance include family law, finance and business. The city that wants mannequin heads removed Like any legal system, Sharia is complex and its practice is entirely reliant on the quality and training of experts. Islamic jurists issue guidance and rulings. Guidance that is considered a formal legal ruling is called a fatwa. Judge Nenney Shushaidah is one of Malaysia's first female Sharia high court judges There are five different schools of Islamic law. There are four Sunni schools: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanafi, and one Shia school, Jaafari. The five schools differ in how literally they interpret the texts from which Sharia law is derived. Interpretation of Islamic law is also nuanced according to local culture and customs, which means Sharia may look quite different in different places. The woman who decides if men can take a second wife Islamic scholars says Sharia is mainly a code of ethical conduct and about worship and charity but a part of it deals with crime. Sharia law divides offences into two general categories: ""hadd"" offences, which are serious crimes with set penalties, and ""tazir"" crimes, where the punishment is left to the discretion of the judge. Hadd offences include theft, which under the strictest interpretations of Sharia, can be punishable by amputating the offender's hand. An Indonesian woman is publicly caned in Aceh province after being caught with her boyfriend There are many safeguards and a high burden of proof in the application of hadd penalties. But experts say that often doesn't happen in practice. Some countries where Islamic law is applied adopt or enforce such punishments for hadd offences, and surveys have suggested attitudes of Muslims to harsh penalties for such offences vary widely.

'Unacceptable' accountability on Crossrail,"Crossrail - to be known as the Elizabeth Line - has received three financial bailouts, increasing seen the cost of the route from Â£14.8bn to Â£17.6bn. There has been an ""unacceptable"" lack of accountability over the delays to Crossrail, a report has said. Crossrail, Europe's biggest infrastructure project, had been due to open in December 2018, but will not now open fully until 2020 at the earliest. Three emergency cash injections have seen the cost of the route rise from Â£14.8bn to Â£17.6bn. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it ""absolutely rejects"" claims there was insufficient oversight. Both the DfT and Transport for London (TfL) are joint sponsors of the project, which is run through an ""arms-length"" body, Crossrail Ltd. A report by the Commons' Public Accounts Committee found an ""unacceptably laissez-faire"" attitude to project costs from the overlapping organisations. The DfT and Crossrail Ltd ""are unable to fully explain how the programme has been allowed to unravel,"" the report found. All three bodies were ""unwilling to pinpoint responsibility to a single individual or entity"", the committee said. The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December Four months before the line was due in December 2018a delay was announcedto allow more time for testing. A ""fixation on a delivery deadline of December 2018"" led to warning signs being missed or ignored when the programme was in trouble, the report said. TfL estimates it will miss out on at least Â£20m in revenue due to the delay. Elizabeth Line trains are already operating between Shenfield and Liverpool Street, and between Paddington and Hayes & Harlington. When fully open, the project will help ease London's chronic congestion. Â£1.4bn bailout as Crossrail launch delayed Crossrail to miss December opening date News and updates from across London Trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes and described the 10-year project as ""hugely complex"". An estimated 200 million passengers will use the new underground line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Analysis Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent The fall from grace for Crossrail continues. This report raises more questions than answers about the beleaguered project and its delay. Again there are questions about governance structures - who was in charge of what bits? - and a lack of oversight and clarity. The Dft gets particular criticism. Londoners will also be annoyed there is still no opening date in sight - the latest news we have is that none of the stations are yet finished - and the testing of trains has hit technical problems. Even opening in 2020 looks unlikely. It's a real, real mess. Committee chair Meg Hillier said: ""Passengers were led to believe they would be able use new Crossrail services through central London from the end of last year. ""It is unacceptable that Parliament and the public still do not know the root causes of the failures that beset this project. ""Accountability in the use of public money is of fundamental importance."" The Public Accounts Committee has asked for the DfT to publish an accurate governance structure for the project and ""set out clearly what consequences there have been for well-rewarded officials whose costly failures are paid for by taxpayers"". Elizabeth Line trains are already operating between Shenfield and Liverpool Street A DfT spokesperson said: ""The department consistently challenged the leadership of Crossrail Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TfL, on the delivery of this project."" ""As soon as the company admitted delay, the Department and TfL acted swiftly to identify lessons, change the leadership of the Crossrail Ltd board, and strengthen governance and oversight. "" Recently installed replacement Crossrail chief executive Mark Wild said: ""We take the views of the Public Accounts Committee very seriously and will be reviewing their recommendations carefully. ""The Elizabeth line will be completed as quickly as possible and brought into service for passengers. ""The team is working extremely hard to establish a new approach through the development of an earliest opening programme for the railway and we will be providing more details later this month."" Maps show delayed Crossrail line open Â£350m loan for London Crossrail delay Crossrail to miss December opening date London 'to bear cost' of Crossrail delay Government Crossrail 2 support 'outrageous' Concerns over Crossrail as project nears completion Crossrail stations delayed until 2019 Department for Transport Transport for London Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Rail services face disruption as train managers strike Sunset Boulevard Los Angeles: Celebrities who have lost homes in LA fires from Top Gun to Gossip Girl star Man charged with attempted murder after student stabbed outside Shooters Hill College London handbag snatch killer who smiled as he ran over woman dies in prison Teenager charged with attempted murder after Woolwich college stabbing Woman found guilty at Kingston Crown Court after abandoning puppies in caravan Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

Woman wins libel case over 'strangle' post,"Nicola Stocker made the comments in an online exchange with her ex-husband's new partner A woman has won a libel battle against her ex-husband over comments she made on Facebook about him trying to strangle her. Nicola Stocker, 51, made the remarks about Ronald Stocker in an online exchange with his new partner in 2012. Mr Stocker previously won his case at London's High Court after it was ruled people reading Mrs Stocker's post would have thought he tried to kill her. But the ruling has now been overturned by the Supreme Court. A panel of five justices said the High Court judge, Mr Justice Mitting, made a legal error by using the dictionary definition of ""strangle"" when he ruled Mrs Stocker's comment meant her ex-husband ""tried to kill"" her. The court heard Ronald Stocker left red marks on Nicola Stocker's neck which were visible two hours after the incident Giving their ruling, Lord Kerr said: ""In consequence, he failed to conduct a realistic exploration of how the ordinary reader of the post would have understood it. ""In view of the judge's error of law, his decision as to the meaning of the Facebook post cannot stand."" Lord Kerr said the ""ordinary reader"" would have understood the comments to mean Mr Stocker, 68, grasped the neck of his ex-wife and not that he tried to kill her. Mr Stocker said he was ""disappointed"" with the judgement after previous courts -  the High Court and the Court of Appeal - had found in his favour. Clive Coleman, BBC legal affairs correspondent Although judges in the lower courts have pointed up the importance of ""context"" in libel actions based on social media posts, this is the first time the Supreme Court has ruled on the manner in which people write and read them. Such posts are not to be treated in the same way as a carefully considered newspaper article. Lord Kerr said: ""It is wrong to engage in elaborate analysis of a tweet; it is likewise unwise to parse (analyse) a Facebook posting for its theoretically or logically deducible meaning. ""The imperative is to ascertain how a typical (i.e. an ordinary reasonable) reader would interpret the message."" The effect of the ruling is that the meaning of words on social media should not be ""pushed up"" to benefit those claiming to have been in libelled, and judges should give more leeway to defendants who post in haste for those who read somewhat fleetingly. The comments were made by Mrs Stocker, who is from Longwick, Buckinghamshire, in an exchange with her ex-husband's new partner Deborah Bligh. During the 2016 High Court trial it was said the post was visible to 110 of Ms Bligh's Facebook friends. Ruling in favour of Mrs Stocker on Wednesday, Lord Kerr said: ""It is beyond dispute that Mr Stocker grasped his wife by the throat so tightly as to leave red marks on her neck visible to police officers two hours after the attack on her took place. ""It is not disputed that he breached a non-molestation order. Nor has it been asserted that he did not utter threats to Mrs Stocker. ""Many would consider these to be sufficient to establish that he was a dangerous and disreputable man."" Mrs Stocker described the legal battle with her ex-husband as ""five years of hell"" and said she was ""delighted"" and ""hugely relieved"" by the result. Her solicitor David Price QC said it takes a ""unique person"" with a lot of courage to fight a case for that length of time. Mr Stocker, from Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire, has been ordered to pay all legal costs.

Tata steel plant could be sold in merger,"A merger between Tata and Thyssenkrupp was agreed in June Tata Steel could sell one of its Welsh plants in order to get approval for a proposed merger with German steelmaker Thyssenkrupp, BBC Wales understands. The Trostre steel plant in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, could be sold as part of an EU investigation into the deal. The European Commission is investigating the proposal over concerns it could lead to less choice for customers. Tata said a ""comprehensive package of proposed solutions"" had been submitted. Llanelli AM Lee Waters and unions Community and Unite have all raised concerns. Â£50m fresh start for Tata steel plant Steel merger 'very good news' for jobs The Trostre plant employs 650 people and produces steel packaging for Tata Steel. Although it is unlikely the merger will be called off, the European Union is concerned the combined companies could control too large a share of the European steel packaging market, meaning plants like Trostre could be sold. Tata's workforce in England and Wales stood at 8,385 in January - more than three quarters at its Welsh plants Lee Waters, AM for Llanelli, said: ""It is sickening that it comes to us again to have to offer up the sacrifice. We are pawns in a global chess game here. ""The other worry for this is that Tata in Wales and the UK is an ecosystem. ""Trostre is a major customer for Port Talbot. They all feed off each other; Shotton, Port Talbot, Trostre. They are all linked up so removing one bit is going to have a knock on effect for the other bit,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Walesprogramme. ""This is clearly very significant."" This video can not be played Trostre makes tin plate for use in cans for products including baked beans and soup Plaid Cymru AM for Mid and West Wales Helen Mary Jones said the Welsh Government seemed to be ""sitting on its hands"". ""We have raised concerns about this with the Welsh Government in the past precisely because this merger could lead to downgrading in Wales,"" she said. ""I have tabled a question to the economy minister on this today and I expect him to take swift action to protect the thousands of workers in Llanelli who are facing uncertainty."" Steelworkers union Community said if the reports were accurate, the proposal was ""extremely concerning"". Andrew Bragoli, senior union official, started work at the plant straight from school more than 40 years ago. He said the development came as a surprise - and after a year in which 100 new starters had been taken on, bringing a younger workforce. ""It's the town, it's a major employer, it's not just the 650 working there, it's the contractors and the money spent in shops and the area - it would be drastic, I can't imagine if something happened to Trostre,"" he told BBC Wales. Tony Brady from Unite said they were very concerned the joint venture would become a partnership in name only, with Thyssenkrupp as the dominant partner. ""Decisions over future investment would be made in Germany, and will very likely benefit continental plants at the expense of its UK operations,"" he said. The Trostre steelworks employs 650 people Tata Steel said it had submitted a ""comprehensive package of proposed solutions"", with Thyssenkrupp, to the European Commission as part of the process to get clearance for the joint venture. ""We continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with the European Commission and believe our proposals address their concerns, and still very much support the industrial logic of the joint venture,"" said a spokesman. ""We're committed to working closely with all relevant regulators and remain confident of the benefits of the joint venture to all our stakeholders."" The joint venture between Tata and Thyssenkrupp could give them over 50% of the steel packaging market in Europe. The European Commission was always unlikely to find that acceptable given the impact it could have on competition and price. So the prospect of Trostre being sold was always a possibility as part of the price of Tata and Thyssenkrupp's merger getting the go ahead. This is not a done deal. The proposal will now be consulted on. Trostre is seen as a very viable and profitable part of the business so it should hopefully be able to find a buyer.

MoD criticised over submarine disposal,"HMS Resolution pictured in about 1970 The Ministry of Defence has been criticised over its failure to dispose of 20 obsolete nuclear submarines. Nine of the vessels still contain nuclear fuel, according to the government spending watchdog, theNational Audit Office,external(NAO). Failing to get rid of them risked the UK's reputation as a responsible nuclear power, the chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee said. The MoD said it would dispose of them ""as soon as practically possible"". Living next to a nuclear submarine graveyard Nearly 800 nuclear safety events at bases Safety alerts stop nuclear sub dock work According to the NAO, the department has not dismantled any of the submarines it has decommissioned since 1980. In that time, the government has spent an estimated Â£500m storing the retired vessels in Rosyth, Fife, and Devonport, Devon. The estimated cost of fully disposing of a submarine is Â£96m, the NAO said. Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said the MoD must ""get a grip"" of the ""spiralling"" costs to the taxpayer. ""For more than 20 years the MoD has been promising to dismantle its out-of-service nuclear submarines and told my committee last year that it would now address this dismal lack of progress,"" she said. ""The disposal programmes have been beset by lengthy delays and spiralling costs, with taxpayers footing the bill."" By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent This report is a sober reminder of the expensive legacy costs of operating nuclear powered submarines, and not just building them. The MoD currently plans to spend about Â£40bn on four new nuclear powered submarines - the new Dreadnought class - to carry Britain's Trident nuclear weapons. But it still hasn't safely disposed of the four Resolution class submarines that were designed in the 1960s and that once carried the old Polaris nuclear missiles. The National Audit Office report is also a reminder of the added costs of delaying difficult decisions. Since 1980 the MoD has spent Â£500m just to store and maintain its obsolete submarines while it works out how to safely dismantle them. The MoD's future liability for maintaining and disposing of the 20 decommissioned submarines, along with the 10 now in service submarines is Â£7.5bn. And that is likely to rise, only adding to the pressures on a department that's already struggling to live within its means. The report is the latest in a string of warnings to the MoD over its finances, withthe PAC in February calling the MoD a ""repeat offender"" when it came to ""poor financial planning"". The nuclear vessels being stored include the first submarines used to carry the UK's nuclear deterrent: the HMS Revenge, HMS Renown, HMS Repulse and HMS Resolution. Attack submarine HMS Conqueror, which sank the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands War, is also in storage. HMS Conqueror, another of the obsolete submarines No submarines have been defueled since 2004, when regulators said waste-disposal facilities did not meet the required standard. The process is not set to begin again for another four years. Communities living near the UK's nuclear submarine storage sites have been critical of the MoD for years. Although defence chiefs insist the subs are safe, some experts have warned of potential radiation leaks. Christelle Gilbert, who lived on a housing estate near the Devonport dockyard,told the BBC in 2014it was ""disgusting"" that it was taking so long to get rid of the vessels. ""It's just too long for the submarines to be sitting there as a potential threat to the city. It's a lack of responsibility on the government's part not to get them moved,"" she said. ""I have a son and I don't want his future jeopardised by it."" The MoD said in a statement: ""The disposal of nuclear submarines is a complex and challenging undertaking. ""We remain committed to the safe, secure and cost-effective defueling and dismantling of all decommissioned nuclear submarines as soon as practically possible.""

Boots warns of possible store closures,"The US owner of pharmacy chain Boots has warned of possible store closures in the UK as it tries to cut costs. Walgreens Boots Alliance said it would take ""decisive steps"" to reduce costs as part of a company-wide ""significant restructuring"". The move comes afterthe chain said,externalit had suffered its ""most difficult quarter"" since the firm's formation, with UK like-for-like sales down 2.3%. The chain has 2,485 stores across the UK, employing about 56,000 staff. The firm said a store portfolio review was under way across the global business. But Boots in the UK said there were no plans for major reductions, adding that it had managed to maintain its market share in the most recent quarter. ""We currently do not have a major programme envisaged, but as you'd expect, we always review underperforming stores and seek out opportunities for consolidation,"" it said. Chief executive Stefano Pessina said market challenges had ""accelerated"" in the three months to the end of February, but that it had failed to respond rapidly enough ""resulting in a disappointing quarter"". ""We are going to be more aggressive in our response to these rapidly shifting trends,"" he added. Actions announced include ""optimising its store footprint"" and increasing its planned annual cost savings from $1bn to $1.5bn. The cost cuts followBoots' announcement in Februarythat 350 jobs were at risk in its Nottingham head office, amid plans to reduce costs by 20%. Overall earnings for the firm's second quarter were down 14.3% compared to the same period last year. The company said it was now expecting profit to be flat for the full year, down from its earlier guidance of 7% to 12% growth. Maureen Hinton, global retail research director at market research firm GlobalData, said Boots in the UK was struggling to compete with beauty brands such as Charlotte Tilbury, Chanel and Dior which had developed their own stores which offered ""a more indulgent and luxury experience"". ""Boots is quite a commodity place, people go for practicalities such as health and toiletries, but it's not really exploiting trends in beauty. The stores are also looking a bit tired,"" she added. Boots is one of a string of well-known names suffering in a tough High Street environment. Last year, Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin all went bust and disappeared altogether. Other household names - Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look - were forced into restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of stores. Music chain HMV recently fell into administration before being bought. The increasing popularity of online shopping, higher business rates, rising labour costs and the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote - which has increased the cost of imported goods - have been blamed for contributing to retailers' woes. Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed in 2014 after Walgreens bought the 55% stake in UK and Switzerland-based Boots Alliance that it did not already own.

Fire engulfs 230-year-old church building,"The building is thought to be the oldest church in the city. Firefighters are tackling a huge blaze at one of the oldest church buildings in Blackburn. It started just before 05:30 BST in The Bureau Centre for the Arts, in the former Church of St John the Evangelist, which opened in 1789. The Grade II-listed building is thought to be the oldest church in the town. The Dean of Blackburn Cathedral, the Very Reverend Peter Howell-Jones, tweeted: ""Very sad to see.......just praying now one was hurt."" Blackburn with Darwen Council, which owns the building, said it would work with the Bureau's directors to discuss its future. Watch manager Chris Archer said the cause of the fire was not suspicious. Kerris Casey-St Pierre, one of the centre's directors, said: ""It's a massive shock - a massive loss. We are devastated."" Fire crews are trying to save artefacts David Coggins, who fought to prevent its demolition in the 1980s, added: ""This building is such an important part of the town's architectural history. It's an absolute tragedy. ""If it was in London it would be a national treasure. It's not the Glasgow School Of Art so I cannot see it being rebuilt."" The building, which is believed to have been modelled on the Chiesa di San Marcuola in Venice, was deconsecrated by the Church of England in 1975 and was handed over to the local council. There was a long-running debate about its future and from the 1990s to 2014 several community groups used the building including the Citizens Advice Bureau. For the last five years it has been run as an arts centre by a Community Interest Company with six volunteer directors.

Sturgeon seeks urgent Brexit talks with MayNicola Sturgeon may travel to London to speak to Theresa May amid continuing Brexit uncertainty.Scotland politicsComments,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""In the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking,  what will happen over the next few days..... is that a bad compromise will be reached. "" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned against accepting a ""bad compromise"" after holding Brexit talks with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. Political leaders have been meeting in London in a bid to break the logjam over the UK's exit from the EU. The prime minister is to ask the EU for another extension to the Brexit deadline while she attempts to come to an agreement with the Labour leader. Ms Sturgeon urged Mr Corbyn to be ""very wary"" about signing up to a ""bad deal"". Mrs May reached out to Mr Corbyn after failing to win backing for her proposed Brexit plan, which has suffered three defeats in the Commons, and MPs failed to unite around any alternative during a series of ""indicative votes"". Talks between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn on Wednesday afternoon were described as ""constructive"" by both sides. But speaking immediately after her own meeting with the prime minister, Ms Sturgeon said she was ""not much clearer on where she (Mrs May) is prepared to give ground"". Live coverage of the latest Brexit developments PM defends Brexit talks with Corbyn Kuenssberg: May chooses a deal over party unity She added: ""I suppose overall my concern is that in the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking, what will happen over the next few days - if anything - is that a bad compromise will be reached. ""People will probably heave a sigh of relief that some agreement has been reached, but then very quickly realise that it's not in the interests of the UK. ""It will satisfy no one, and of course would be open to being unpicked by a prime minister that is not Theresa May, perhaps somebody like Boris Johnson. ""So I think there's a need to be wary. If I was in Jeremy Corbyn's shoes right now I would be very wary about signing up to anything that may not be able to be delivered, in fact may not be enough in the first place."" Mrs May made a statement at Downing Street on Tuesday offering talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Ms Sturgeon said she had felt Mr Corbyn ""would drive a hard bargain"" after meeting him - but that the prime minister had later given the impression that ""she thinks she's got Jeremy Corbyn closer to a deal"". The SNP leader said the UK should ask for a longer extension to Brexit, and that any compromise deal that is ultimately hammered out should be put back to the public in a new referendum, with remaining in the EU also as an option. The UK's departure from the EU was put back from 29 March to 12 April following a summit of European leaders late in March. If MPs or ministers cannot come up with an exit plan which is accepted by the EU, then the UK will leave without a deal. Mrs May said on Tuesday that she would ask the EU for a further extension, to be kept ""as short as possible"", and arranged talks with Mr Corbyn to agree a new approach. But she insisted her withdrawal agreement - which was voted down last week - would remain part of the deal. Following her meeting with Ms Sturgeon, a Downing Street spokeswoman said Mrs May had ""made clear that this delay and division across the UK cannot continue"". The spokeswoman added: ""She is meeting with the leader of the opposition to find a proposal that can command the support of the House of Commons to allow the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible. ""She added that Brexit is a decisive moment in our history and we must come together to deliver for people in Scotland and the whole of the UK."" A Labour spokesman said: ""We have had constructive exploratory discussions about how to break the Brexit deadlock. ""We have agreed a programme of work between our teams to explore the scope for agreement."" Meanwhile, Holyrood's Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh confirmed that the Scottish Parliament would be recalled from recess if the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit on 12 April.

Flybe cancels dozens of flights,"Regional airline Flybe has cancelled dozens of Wednesday morning flights as it enters discussions over potential job losses. The company blamed an industry-wide shortage of pilots for the delays, as well as its own pilots taking holidays. Flights from Belfast City Airport and Birmingham are among those affected. Most of the flights are within the UK. The airline said it would like to ""sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused"". The discussions over jobs are at an early stage and the company will try and avoid job losses by filling internal vacancies with existing staff, including roles at other bases, Flybe's chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener told BBC Radio 5 live. The company is ""engaging with all impacted crew"", she said. Of the delays, she said the company would ""follow all the rules of compensation"" and that ""we are expecting to go back to normal operation as soon as possible"". While the disruption was widespread, it only affected 5% of flights, she insisted. Cardiff Airport boss Deb Barber said: ""We understand Flybe is in the process of consulting with a number of its employees, including its crew at multiple bases across its network, which includes Cardiff. ""Flybe's plan to restructure and reduce its jet operations across many bases is part of the company's long-standing objective to stabilise the business,"" she said. The cuts will affect Doncaster, Norwich and Exeter, as well as Cardiff, as the company seeks to drop expensive jets in favour of cheaper turboprop airliners. The company says it will make the following changes: Exeter- Flybe will fly its last jets from the airport on 26 October. This will not affect turboprop flights or its ""base structure"" it said. Norwich- Jets will also stop flying from this airport at around the same time.  This will not affect services at Norwich operated by Flybe's franchise partner, Eastern Airways, it said. Cardiff and Doncaster- Flybe will also stop flying jets from these two airports.  It will close its servicing operations at the airports, but will offer turboprop flights. Unite the union regional officer Peter Coulson said: ""Unite is seeking to minimise the potential job losses and secure assurances about Flybe's long-term future."" He urged the company to be forthcoming about its plan. ""It is essential that Flybe is fully transparent with its workforce about the exact situation facing the company. The current uncertainty is incredibly unsettling and is in danger of severely damaging morale at the company."" Sue Piercey has cancelled her holiday plans Sue Piercey, who lives in Bradford, told the BBC her flight from Leeds to Belfast today was cancelled. ""We received a curt email at 19:00 last night followed by an even shorter text message,"" she said. ""No other flight options were offered."" Flybe are scheduled to fly three later services from Leeds to Belfast today, and none were offered to Ms Piercey, she said. ""Our holiday is totally off now, and I hope my insurance company can help me,"" she said, describing herself as ""very annoyed today"". Customers also vented their frustration on social media.

Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter Anyone whose flight is cancelled is entitled to choose between a refund paid within seven days, or an alternative flight (or bus) - even with a rival carrier. Unless they have chosen a refund, it is the responsibility of the airline to get anyone with a ticket to their final destination as promptly as possible. In many cases, they should receive refreshments during any wait of two or more hours. Passengers whose flight is cancelled, or who suffer long delays, can apply forextra compensation,externalunder EU rules. As these are mostly short-haul flights, and the cancellations were last-minute, most will be entitled to compensation of â¬250 (Â£213). Anyone who misses a connecting flight should talk to the airline operating that second flight but, according to consumer group Which?, they may have to make a claim for the cost of a new flight from their travel insurance. On Monday, Flybe passengers on a new route were left witha six-hour coach journey when their aircraft was grounded. The 18:40 service from Newquay to Heathrow could not take off on Sunday because of a ""technical issue"". Cornwall Airport Newquay said passengers were offered ""rebooking for another flight or ground transport to London Heathrow"". Flybe was bought early this year in a rescue deal following poor financial results. Connect Airways, a consortium led by Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, paid a total of Â£2.8m for Flybe's assets and operations. The Exeter-based regional airline put itself up for sale last November, following a profit warning the previous month. Virgin, Stobart Air and Cyrus Capital set up Connect Airways in December. Flybe fell into difficulty in 2017, after what was considered a too-aggressive expansion strategy. The company ran up a near-Â£20m loss in the financial year ending 31 March 2017. Passengers were booked onto a brand new route from Newquay to Heathrow but ended up on a coach This January, one employee was moved to send an email accusing the firm's directors of ruining a profitable company. The employee, a senior pilot, addressed the email to Flybe's chief executive, Ms Ourmieres-Widener. ""Congratulations, in two years at Flybe you and your fellow incompetent cohorts have managed to totally destroy a viable airline which was making profits when you took over,"" he wrote. The BBC understands that the airline has suspended the pilot. Flybe told the BBC that ""an individual was suspended on 17 January 2019 in accordance with company policy"".

Abuse survivor wants end to corroboration,"Suzy Angus felt ""defeated"" after trying to seek justice A woman who says she was sexually abused as a child has told the BBC she felt ""defeated"" after trying to seek justice. Suzy Angus is part of the Speak Out Survivors group campaigning to scrap the need for corroboration in Scots law. Corroboration means two separate sources of evidence are needed for a case to go to trial. The campaigners will meet MSPs at Holyrood later. They are also due to raise the issue in a meeting with Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf. Ms Angustold BBC Scotland's The Ninethat she had tried to take her case to court, but it was dropped because of the need for corroboration, which is a unique feature of Scots law. What is corroboration? She said she was raped for the first time when she was 13-years-old. Over the next two years, she said she was raped and sexually abused multiple times by a group of six men. She said that having to recount ""incredibly detailed information"" that she had ""buried for over 40 years"" has left her on medication for PTSD and anxiety. Investigating the case and trying to bring it to court was a long and complicated process. She said: ""Because there were several people involved, it took about 18 months, probably, for everybody to be investigated. After one man was arrested, she felt hopeful of a prosecution: ""I was getting quite interested in the fact that maybe finally there will be a prosecution, and they said 'Sorry, no corroboration, that's the end of the line'. ""I was standing in my office at work on the phone and that was it, and I just felt like collapsing."" Now, she is campaigning, along with other survivors of sexual abuse, for corroboration to be dropped. In 2014 SNP ministers had proposed abolishing the need for corroboration, although this was dropped in 2015 after a review by former high court judge Lord Bonomy recommended it should be retained in some circumstances. Plan to end corroboration dropped Judge to review corroboration reform Top judges warn over corroboration Ms Angus said she appreciated why the standard of evidence should remain high: ""I understand that you do have to protect people. ""I'm not for changing the law just so people will be falsely convicted, of course not, the law has to protect everybody and everyone deserves a defence. ""However, it's the quality and sometimes the quantity of evidence."" In her case, however, she thinks that had there been no requirement for corroboration there would have been enough evidence for a prosecution. ""In my case it was patterns of behaviour over several people that would have taken someone to court and you know it's jut left me feeling kind of defeated, to be honest."" Brian McConnachie QC says he has never been convinced by the arguments for scrapping corroboration Brian McConnachie QC said that the merits of corroboration had already been debated and a decision had already been made for it to be continued. He said: ""I know that some people consider that corroboration is something which we ought to abandon or abolish, and as often as not the argument is given that it should be abolished because nobody else has it. ""I've never been convinced by that argument. ""We went through a process where it was discussed at significant and considerable length, and at the end of that process the decision was taken that it should go no further."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""There was no parliamentary or legal consensus for the removal of the corroboration requirement. ""We asked Lord Bonomy to conduct a review into what additional safeguards may be required if the corroboration rule was removed. ""The review recommended research into jury reasoning and decision-making should be undertaken so that any changes to the jury system are made on a fully informed basis."" She added: ""Any future consideration of corroboration reform needs to await the findings of the jury research, which we expect to be complete by Autumn 2019. ""Since the review reported, we have taken forward a wide range of measures to improve how the justice system deals with allegations of sexual offending and to improve support for victims. ""The justice secretary and lord advocate co-chair a new victims' taskforce to improve the provision of advice and information for victims of crime and their families and the Scottish government also legislated to introduce statutory jury directions in certain sexual offence cases.""

Brunei profile,"The tiny state of Brunei has one of the world's highest standards of living thanks to its bountiful oil and gas reserves. Members of the royal family, led by the head of state Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, possess huge private fortunes. Bruneians pay no income tax. The Sultan regularly allocates land lots and housing to deserving residents under various government schemes. A British protectorate since 1888, Brunei was the only Malay state in 1963 which chose to remain so, rather than join the federation that became Malaysia. Full independence came relatively late in 1984. In 2014 Brunei became the first East Asian country to adopt strict Islamic Sharia law which allows punishment such as stoning for adultery and amputation for theft. In 2019, it fully implemented a law prescribing death by stoning for adultery and gay sex in certain circumstances. In the wake of international condemnation, the Sultan said that a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty would be applied as it had been for more than two decades in common law cases.

He was crowned in August 1968 following the abdication of his father, Sir Haji Omar Ali Saifuddin. Upon Brunei's independence in 1984, he appointed himself prime minister and in 1991, introduced an ideology called Malay Muslim Monarchy, which presented the monarch as the defender of the faith. He is one of the world's richest individuals and in a country where the standard of living is high, appears to enjoy genuine popularity amongst his subjects. More recently however, he has faced criticism over the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in the country. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah taking part in the Asean-China Summit in October 2021 by video conference Brunei's media are neither diverse nor free. The private press is either owned or controlled by the royal family. Broadcasting is dominated by state radio and TV. Media workers exercise self-censorship when covering politics and religion.

The scene remained sealed off on Wednesday morning The PSNI said eight ATMs have been stolen in seven separate incidents in Northern Ireland in 2019, along with one attempted theft. Det Ch Insp David Henderson said police were ""actively looking at it being several gangs involved"". GardaÃ­ (police) were called to the scene at about 03:00 local time Castleblayney is a short distance from the Northern Ireland border. Speaking after the raid there, Garda Supt Fergus Treanor said the frequency of ATM thefts was not only a concern for police, but also for the local communities in the border region. He said gardaÃ­ are at the very early stages of the investigation and are working closely with the PSNI and that a number of criminal gangs are involved in the thefts. He said that the digger had been stolen locally. No one was injured in the incident, which follows several such robberies in border counties in the past few months. Last month,two ATMs were taken in separate incidents on the same night in counties Cavan and Tyrone.

"Fire engulfs 230-year-old church buildingDozens of firefighters are at the building in Blackburn, which is now The Bureau Centre for the Arts.","The building is thought to be the oldest church in the city. Firefighters are tackling a huge blaze at one of the oldest church buildings in Blackburn. It started just before 05:30 BST in The Bureau Centre for the Arts, in the former Church of St John the Evangelist, which opened in 1789. The Grade II-listed building is thought to be the oldest church in the town. The Dean of Blackburn Cathedral, the Very Reverend Peter Howell-Jones, tweeted: ""Very sad to see.......just praying now one was hurt."" Blackburn with Darwen Council, which owns the building, said it would work with the Bureau's directors to discuss its future. Watch manager Chris Archer said the cause of the fire was not suspicious. Kerris Casey-St Pierre, one of the centre's directors, said: ""It's a massive shock - a massive loss. We are devastated."" Fire crews are trying to save artefacts David Coggins, who fought to prevent its demolition in the 1980s, added: ""This building is such an important part of the town's architectural history. It's an absolute tragedy. ""If it was in London it would be a national treasure. It's not the Glasgow School Of Art so I cannot see it being rebuilt."" The building, which is believed to have been modelled on the Chiesa di San Marcuola in Venice, was deconsecrated by the Church of England in 1975 and was handed over to the local council. There was a long-running debate about its future and from the 1990s to 2014 several community groups used the building including the Citizens Advice Bureau. For the last five years it has been run as an arts centre by a Community Interest Company with six volunteer directors.

'Ban painful headlocks in child prisons',"Ministers are under growing pressure to ban the painful headlocks, wrist and arm twists that can be used to control children's behaviour in youth prisons. The national inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) recently concluded ""pain compliance"" measures were child abuse and should be outlawed. And the Equalities and Human Rights Commission ruled last week that such methods should not be used on children. The government said restraint was used only as a last resort. But children's charities, who have long campaigned for change, say these recommendations ending its use should be adopted straight away. The Ministry of Justice commissioned Charlie Taylor, chairman of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, to carry out a review of restraint. This came after a children's rights group, Article 39, lodged an application at the High Court for a judicial review of the practice. That action has been stayed pending the outcome of the report. But solicitors acting for the charity have written to the government urging it to put the recommendations into practice. They say there is no justification for spending public money on a continued review when the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse examined the use of restraint as part of its investigation into children in custodial institutions. It found pain compliance techniques were used on children in custody during 119 incidents in Youth Offending Institutions in the year to 2017. The Ministry of Justice said there were 181 incidents in which pain-inducing restraint techniques were used on children last year. The techniques, designed for the prison riot squad, aim to force an individual to comply by use of pain. They involve pressure being applied to limb joints or certain pressure points. The longer the target takes to comply, the more pain they are likely to endure. The most popular physical restraint method is the inverted wrist hold. It was used 3,692 times, according to official data. Officials deny this technique causes pain, but a review by the Prisons Inspectorate suggests that it does. The IICSA report said: ""The chair and panel consider that the use of pain compliance techniques should be seen as a form of child abuse, and that it is likely to contribute to a culture of violence, which may increase the risk of child sexual abuse. ""The chair and panel recommend that the Ministry of Justice prohibits the use of pain compliance techniques by withdrawing all policy permitting its use, and setting out that this practice is prohibited by way of regulation."" It added that the use of such techniques ""normalises pain for staff and children"" and ""prevents staff from building trusting relationships and inhibits a child from reporting sexual abuse"". Article 39 director Carolyne Willow said: ""Mandating adults in positions of authority to deliberately hurt children, and running training courses that show exactly how to inflict severe pain, is institutionalised child abuse. There is no other way to describe it. ""These techniques should have been completely withdrawn after the terrible death of Adam Rickwood."" Adam Rickwood took his own life in a youth custody centreafter he was restrained using a now banned restraint technique. A coroner ruled the use of force contributed to his death. Ms Willow continued: ""It's taken 15 years to get to this point where the country's largest ever public inquiry into child abuse has recommended legal prohibition. ""The urgency comes in the inquiry describing pain compliant techniques as a form of child abuse. ""How can ministers not act quickly to protect vulnerable children after that?"" Head of policy at the NSPCC Almudena Lara backed Iicsa's calls for pain compliance techniques to be banned. ""Such outdated practices, including an inverted wrist hold and thumb flexion, are likely to contribute to a culture of violence which may increase the risk of abuse, including child sexual abuse. ""For far too long, children have been subjected to this inhumane treatment and it must be stopped once and for all."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Staff are trained to resolve conflict verbally and our policy is clear that restraint should only ever be used as a last resort where there is a risk of harm to the young person or others and no alternative intervention is possible. ""In addition, we have commissioned Charlie Taylor to independently review our policy on the use of pain-inducing techniques and he is due to complete his review this summer.""

Senator censured for 'appalling' NZ remarks,"Fraser Anning was condemned by the Senate for his comments about the Christchurch attacks The Australian Senate has formally censured a politician who sparked outrage by blaming the New Zealand mosque attacks on Muslim migration. Senator Fraser Anning, a far-right independent, made his comments on the day of the shootings in Christchurch which killed 50 people last month. On Wednesday, politicians from across the political spectrum condemned his ""inflammatory and divisive"" remarks. Mr Anning said the censure was ""an attack on free speech"". The reprimand, the fifth to be passed by the Senate in the past decade, stated that Mr Anning's remarks last month did not reflect the views of the parliament or the Australian people. He had said: ""The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program that allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place."" His comments were ""shameful"" and ""appalling"", other politicians told the Senate. The censure read that Mr Anning had sought to ""attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion"". Attack victims honoured in Christchurch The lives lost and the world they revealed Australia soul-searches after Christchurch Though it carries no practical punishment, the censure is seen as an official condemnation.Politicians cannot be expelled from the parliament,externalunless they are dual citizens, bankrupt, hold other offices, or have been convicted of an offence, constitutional law experts say. More than 1.4 million people have signed an online petition demanding Mr Anning's resignation Only one senator, Cory Bernardi, voted against the motion on Wednesday. Three others including Mr Anning abstained. Mr Anning entered parliament in 2017 as a replacement for a disqualified senator, despite receiving just 19 votes in the 2016 election. Last year he also drew condemnation for using the words ""final solution""- a term invoked during the Holocaust - while calling for race-based immigration restrictions. More than 1.4 million people signed a petition demanding Mr Anning's resignation in the days following his comments on 15 March. At the time, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called his remarks ""a disgrace"". In one highly publicised incident, a teenage protester squashed an egg on the senator's head during a press briefing. Mr Anning has repeatedly defended his comments. He left the Senate on Wednesday before the motion was passed. Government Senate leader Mathias Cormann said Mr Anning's comments were ""sadly made worse given [his] position in this parliament"". Labor Senator Penny Wong said there was ""a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech"", adding: ""While those injured were being treated, this senator sought to further fan the flames of division.""

Sturgeon seeks urgent Brexit talks with PM,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""In the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking,  what will happen over the next few days..... is that a bad compromise will be reached. "" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned against accepting a ""bad compromise"" after holding Brexit talks with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. Political leaders have been meeting in London in a bid to break the logjam over the UK's exit from the EU. The prime minister is to ask the EU for another extension to the Brexit deadline while she attempts to come to an agreement with the Labour leader. Ms Sturgeon urged Mr Corbyn to be ""very wary"" about signing up to a ""bad deal"". Mrs May reached out to Mr Corbyn after failing to win backing for her proposed Brexit plan, which has suffered three defeats in the Commons, and MPs failed to unite around any alternative during a series of ""indicative votes"". Talks between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn on Wednesday afternoon were described as ""constructive"" by both sides. But speaking immediately after her own meeting with the prime minister, Ms Sturgeon said she was ""not much clearer on where she (Mrs May) is prepared to give ground"". Live coverage of the latest Brexit developments PM defends Brexit talks with Corbyn Kuenssberg: May chooses a deal over party unity She added: ""I suppose overall my concern is that in the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking, what will happen over the next few days - if anything - is that a bad compromise will be reached. ""People will probably heave a sigh of relief that some agreement has been reached, but then very quickly realise that it's not in the interests of the UK. ""It will satisfy no one, and of course would be open to being unpicked by a prime minister that is not Theresa May, perhaps somebody like Boris Johnson. ""So I think there's a need to be wary. If I was in Jeremy Corbyn's shoes right now I would be very wary about signing up to anything that may not be able to be delivered, in fact may not be enough in the first place."" Mrs May made a statement at Downing Street on Tuesday offering talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Ms Sturgeon said she had felt Mr Corbyn ""would drive a hard bargain"" after meeting him - but that the prime minister had later given the impression that ""she thinks she's got Jeremy Corbyn closer to a deal"". The SNP leader said the UK should ask for a longer extension to Brexit, and that any compromise deal that is ultimately hammered out should be put back to the public in a new referendum, with remaining in the EU also as an option. The UK's departure from the EU was put back from 29 March to 12 April following a summit of European leaders late in March. If MPs or ministers cannot come up with an exit plan which is accepted by the EU, then the UK will leave without a deal. Mrs May said on Tuesday that she would ask the EU for a further extension, to be kept ""as short as possible"", and arranged talks with Mr Corbyn to agree a new approach. But she insisted her withdrawal agreement - which was voted down last week - would remain part of the deal. Following her meeting with Ms Sturgeon, a Downing Street spokeswoman said Mrs May had ""made clear that this delay and division across the UK cannot continue"". The spokeswoman added: ""She is meeting with the leader of the opposition to find a proposal that can command the support of the House of Commons to allow the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible. ""She added that Brexit is a decisive moment in our history and we must come together to deliver for people in Scotland and the whole of the UK."" A Labour spokesman said: ""We have had constructive exploratory discussions about how to break the Brexit deadlock. ""We have agreed a programme of work between our teams to explore the scope for agreement."" Meanwhile, Holyrood's Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh confirmed that the Scottish Parliament would be recalled from recess if the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit on 12 April.

PM expected to meet Corbyn for Brexit talks,"Theresa May has responded to criticism from her own MPs over talks with Jeremy Corbyn by saying all MPs have a responsibility to deliver Brexit. The PM said the public ""expect us to reach across this House to find a way through this"". Mr Corbyn said he welcomed the PM's ""willingness to compromise to resolve the Brexit deadlock"". The PM's move to hold talks has angered some Brexiteers, with two ministers resigning over it. Chris Heaton-Harris became the latest to quit on Wednesday afternoon,external, claiming his job at the Department for Exiting the European Union had become ""irrelevant"" if the government is not prepared to leave without a deal. Wales Minister Nigel Adams also resigned his role on Wednesday morning, saying the government was at risk of failing to deliver ""the Brexit people voted for"". The PM met Mr Corbyn before holding talks with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford. Ms Sturgeon - who also met Mr Corbyn earlier - said she had ""good"" and ""open"" conversations with both leaders, and while she believed Mr Corbyn would ""drive a hard bargain"", she was ""still not entirely clear"" where the prime minister was willing to compromise. The SNP leader, who backs a further referendum and wants to remain in the EU, told reporters: ""My concern is that in the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking, what will happen over the next few days... is a bad compromise will be reached."" Kuenssberg: PM chooses a deal over party unity Brexitcast: Theresa's Choice We must leave the EU, says attorney general The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, Plaid Cymru and the Independent Group have also held a joint press conference, calling for any decision made by the leaders to be put to a public vote. From left to right: Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, The Independent Group MP Chuka Umunna, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville-Roberts and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, said: ""People have the opportunity to have another shot at it, [in the Commons], to change their mind. ""Surely if that is how democracy works here, then democracy should go back to the people and people should have their say on whatever model comes forward."" What are the Brexit sticking points? The UK has until 12 April to propose a plan to the EU - which must be accepted by the bloc - or it will leave without a deal on that date. In a statement on Tuesday night, the PM announced she wanted to meet Mr Corbyn to agree a way forward and put the plan to a vote in the Commons before 10 April - when the EU will hold an emergency summit on Brexit. She insisted her withdrawal agreement - which was voted down last week - would remain part of the deal. If there is no agreement between the two leaders, Mrs May said a number of options would be put to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"". In either event, Mrs May said she would ask the EU for a further short extension to hopefully get an agreement passed by Parliament before 22 May, so the UK does not have to take part in European elections. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Brexiteers were quick to express their anger at the prime minister's move. But at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said she wanted to deliver Brexit ""in an orderly way"" and, to do that, ""we have to get an agreement through the House"". And Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay blamed hard Brexiteers in the pro-Leave European Research Group for making the PM move to these talks. This video can not be played ""I'm absolutely appalled"" Mrs May told MPs there were a ""number of areas"" where she agreed with Mr Corbyn in relation to Brexit, including ending free movement. The Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkarsaid the talks were ""timely"", and he hoped Mr Corbyn would ""rise to the occasion"" and ""come up with a compromise plan"" with the prime minister. The PM's negotiated plan includes two sections - the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. The withdrawal agreement sets out how the UK would leave the EU, including the money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period, and citizens' rights - as well as the controversial Irish backstop that aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The political declaration focuses on the future relationship with the bloc and, unlike the withdrawal agreement, is not legally binding. Mrs May said on Tuesday that any plan she agreed with Mr Corbyn ""would have to agree the current withdrawal agreement"", but she was ready to discuss the future relationship, i.e. the political declaration. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay also said that was the element Labour had expressed more concern about. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said there was not much difference between the government's version of Brexit and Labour's version - but there did not seem to be ""an enormous amount of confidence"" a political consensus could be reached from either party. The row comesafter Mrs May had more than seven hours of talks with her cabinet on Tuesday. Laura Kuenssberg said there was ""rage and dispute"" in the cabinet meeting, with ""wildly varying accounts"" of how many people were for and against different versions of Brexit extensions. Labour has previously said it has five demand for supporting a Brexit deal, including protecting workers' rights and national security, and securing the same benefits of being in the single market the UK has currently. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of MPs will attempt to push throughlegislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. If agreed, the bill - presented by Labour MP Yvette Cooper - would require the PM by law to ask for an extension of Article 50. MPs took part in a three-hour debate on a business motion to set out how proceedings would run throughout evening. But a vote on an amendment to the motion, put forward by Labour's Hilary Benn, calling for time on Monday to hold more indicative votes, resulted in a draw - the first time such a result has happened in 39 years. The Speaker John Bercow then used his casting vote to reject the amendment, meaning MPs will not have the indicative votes next week. The overall business motion was passed, but by just one vote - with 312 MPs voting for it, and 311 against. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, Greens and the Independent Group are putting forward an amendment to the bill to again call for a public vote on any outcome to become law. The approximate timings of the day are: 17:30 BSTVoting on the business motion setting out tonight's process 19:00- A second reading vote on the bill 22:00- Committee stage starts (this stage usually starts within a couple of weeks of a bill's second reading) and finally third reading vote Thursday- Bill could be considered by the House of Lords Other key dates coming up include: Wednesday 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek / EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

'Unbelievable' failings in hospital death,"This video can not be played 'Eating disorders are not glamorous,' said campaigner who died The parents of a woman who took her own life at a mental health hospital say failings in her care were ""unbelievable"". Claire Greaves, 25, from Pontypool, was a patient at Cygnet Hospital, Coventry. An inquest jury found care failings contributed to her death in February 2018 and reached an open conclusion. Cygnet said it had learned lessons from the investigation, while Aneurin Bevan health board is reviewing placements for people with complex needs. Claire was a mental health campaigner and writer who had suffered with anorexia and a personality disorder from an early age. In May 2017, she was moved from Abergavenny's Nevill Hall Hospital to Cygnet. ""I wish I could just go home, I don't want to be over 100 miles away from home for such a long time,"" she tweeted at the time. Claire was moved more than 100 miles from her home in Pontypool to a hospital in Coventry Her parents Colin and Debbie Greaves said they were told it was the only available hospital that could manage both of Claire's conditions and were ""reasonably positive"". But they soon had concerns about staffing levels and a lack of access to therapies. Claire was placed in ""seclusion and long-term segregation"" and her parents were told they could not contact her for several weeks. ""She told us that she had no furniture in the room, that her mattress was brought in at night for her to sleep on and then taken back out,"" Mr Greaves said after a phone call in January 2018. ""She also mentioned that there had been poor support for her hygiene whilst she was in there."" Evan Jones's death at County Hospital an 'injustice' Health board's apology over patient's 'premature' death They were trying to get her moved to a hospital nearer home when she died. An inquest jury reached an ""open"" conclusion, and did not decide it was suicide. Claire had been assessed as being at high risk of self-harm or suicide between 17:00 and 18:00 each day. But she was able to obtain a piece of fabric left on the floor outside her room and used it to kill herself alone in her room. The inquest jury found: Long-term segregation and seclusion contributed to a decline in Claire's mental state Staffing levels ""probably caused or contributed"" to her death There was a failure to increase observations despite Claire making numerous self-harm attempts in the days prior to her death Had there been ""sufficient staff"" then Claire's care plan could have been followed and the risk period of 17:00 to 18:00 ""would have been covered"" There was a failure in allowing Claire to be alone in her room prior to her death, contrary to her care plan. Mr Greaves said he felt ""numb"" when he heard the conclusions, adding: ""It seems unbelievable that can happen, they can miss ward rounds, that they can make changes without doing the proper risk assessments, that they cannot follow care plans. ""The failings were quite shocking."" He said he believed the move would help his daughter but the fact it did not meant he now felt guilt as well as loss. Debbie and Colin Greaves called the hospital's failings ""shocking"" The Care Quality Commission (CQC) had already raised concerns about Cygnet before Claire's death. It found recruitment and retention of staff was difficult with a high turnover which led to a shortfall in training and supervision levels. This lack of consistency led to some patients feeling unsafe on the wards, the CQC said. Another CQC inspection published five months after Claire's death found staffing was still a problem, with 61% of employees not comfortable with their daily workload. In its own investigation into Claire's death, Cygnet concluded the ""root cause"" was Claire's ability to ""access material from another service user at a point when this was not seen by staff and was then able to ligate with it"". The report also stated days before Claire's death there was a reduction in her ""observation levels"", with the reason ""unclear"". Her parents said they have not received an apology, or any communication from Cygnet, since the inquest. The company said: ""We were deeply saddened by Claire's death in February 2018 and we continue to extend our sincere sympathies to her family. ""Cygnet co-operated fully with the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Claire and we noted the recommendations made during the inquest.

Call to protect birds from netting,"Wildlife experts are calling for stricter controls on nets installed over trees and hedgerows amid growing public concern about their use. People are reporting sightings on social media, while an e-petition has collected more than 190,000 signatures. Developers have said the nets, which are designed to stop birds nesting, are ""standard practice"" on greenery that might be damaged by building work. But the RSPB says they should only be used in exceptional circumstances. The wildlife charity has joined forces with the body that represents trained ecologists to call for new safeguards. Why are nets appearing over trees and hedges? Tesco backtracks on swallow nets Netting trees 'endangers wildlife' ""Netting is an overly simplistic approach that has become more prominent recently,"" says the RSPB and The Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management in a statement. ""There is an understandable negative reaction from both the public and from professional ecologists to the real and potential harm that it may cause to wildlife."" Swallow chicks in the Cotswolds - many birds are returning in spring to nest The use of netting can often be avoided with advice from a trained ecologist, they say. If there is no other option, it should be used only after planning permission has been granted. And the netting should be used in a way that will not trap wildlife and checked three times a day, they added. While it is an offence to destroy an active nest, there are currently no laws to prevent the installation of nets. According to Jeff Knott from the RSPB, the use of netting on hedges and trees seems to have ""exploded"" this year. ""It seems to be popping up all over the place and that's been a real concern,"" he said. ""The public interest in this issue has been absolutely huge."" Hedges and trees shrouded with netting are ""a visual representation of how we are increasingly painting nature into a smaller, smaller box and how we are forcing it to fit in with our plans,"" he added. Campaigns on social media have led to nets being removed. Last week, residents in Berkshire, including nature writer Nicola Chester, used Twitter to report birds being trapped in a net on hedgerows in Theale. Allow Twitter content?

West Berkshire Council later said it would remove the netting. Meanwhile, a petition has been set up to try to make the practice illegal, arguing that developers and other interested parties are circumventing laws protecting birds, whose numbers are in sharp decline. And a crowdsourced map that allows people to post where they have seen the nets recorded sightings in Scotland, England and Wales, from Cornwall up to Glasgow. A crowdsourced map circulating on Twitter The representative body of the homebuilding industry, the Home Builders Federation, has said installing this type of netting was not a new thing and it was not aware of any increase in netting. It said the industry was committed to protecting birds and providing an overall increase in the number of trees. Each year about 2,000 reports are made about wild birds trapped in or behind many different types of netting, with bird-deterrent netting a major cause, said the RSPCA. ""Planning policy guidance recommends that any development that would affect wildlife should be done at the correct time of year, so we want to see developers delaying works until after the nesting seasons rather than using nets,"" it said. ""If nets are used it should be for the shortest time possible, regularly checked and kept in a good state of repair to prevent animals becoming trapped."" Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"'Unbelievable' failings in hospital deathClaire Greaves, who had anorexia and personality disorder, killed herself in a psychiatric unit.Wales","This video can not be played 'Eating disorders are not glamorous,' said campaigner who died The parents of a woman who took her own life at a mental health hospital say failings in her care were ""unbelievable"". Claire Greaves, 25, from Pontypool, was a patient at Cygnet Hospital, Coventry. An inquest jury found care failings contributed to her death in February 2018 and reached an open conclusion. Cygnet said it had learned lessons from the investigation, while Aneurin Bevan health board is reviewing placements for people with complex needs. Claire was a mental health campaigner and writer who had suffered with anorexia and a personality disorder from an early age. In May 2017, she was moved from Abergavenny's Nevill Hall Hospital to Cygnet. ""I wish I could just go home, I don't want to be over 100 miles away from home for such a long time,"" she tweeted at the time. Claire was moved more than 100 miles from her home in Pontypool to a hospital in Coventry Her parents Colin and Debbie Greaves said they were told it was the only available hospital that could manage both of Claire's conditions and were ""reasonably positive"". But they soon had concerns about staffing levels and a lack of access to therapies. Claire was placed in ""seclusion and long-term segregation"" and her parents were told they could not contact her for several weeks. ""She told us that she had no furniture in the room, that her mattress was brought in at night for her to sleep on and then taken back out,"" Mr Greaves said after a phone call in January 2018. ""She also mentioned that there had been poor support for her hygiene whilst she was in there."" Evan Jones's death at County Hospital an 'injustice' Health board's apology over patient's 'premature' death They were trying to get her moved to a hospital nearer home when she died. An inquest jury reached an ""open"" conclusion, and did not decide it was suicide. Claire had been assessed as being at high risk of self-harm or suicide between 17:00 and 18:00 each day. But she was able to obtain a piece of fabric left on the floor outside her room and used it to kill herself alone in her room. The inquest jury found: Long-term segregation and seclusion contributed to a decline in Claire's mental state Staffing levels ""probably caused or contributed"" to her death There was a failure to increase observations despite Claire making numerous self-harm attempts in the days prior to her death Had there been ""sufficient staff"" then Claire's care plan could have been followed and the risk period of 17:00 to 18:00 ""would have been covered"" There was a failure in allowing Claire to be alone in her room prior to her death, contrary to her care plan. Mr Greaves said he felt ""numb"" when he heard the conclusions, adding: ""It seems unbelievable that can happen, they can miss ward rounds, that they can make changes without doing the proper risk assessments, that they cannot follow care plans. ""The failings were quite shocking."" He said he believed the move would help his daughter but the fact it did not meant he now felt guilt as well as loss. Debbie and Colin Greaves called the hospital's failings ""shocking"" The Care Quality Commission (CQC) had already raised concerns about Cygnet before Claire's death. It found recruitment and retention of staff was difficult with a high turnover which led to a shortfall in training and supervision levels. This lack of consistency led to some patients feeling unsafe on the wards, the CQC said. Another CQC inspection published five months after Claire's death found staffing was still a problem, with 61% of employees not comfortable with their daily workload. In its own investigation into Claire's death, Cygnet concluded the ""root cause"" was Claire's ability to ""access material from another service user at a point when this was not seen by staff and was then able to ligate with it"". The report also stated days before Claire's death there was a reduction in her ""observation levels"", with the reason ""unclear"". Her parents said they have not received an apology, or any communication from Cygnet, since the inquest. The company said: ""We were deeply saddened by Claire's death in February 2018 and we continue to extend our sincere sympathies to her family. ""Cygnet co-operated fully with the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Claire and we noted the recommendations made during the inquest. ""We have already implemented a number of measures to address the key learnings from this and we will ensure that we comply fully with all of the recommendations made."" A spokesman for Aneurin Bevan University Health Board also offered condolences to the family. ""We have undertaken a full review of the board's role in commissioning Ms Greaves' placement at Cygnet Hospital and are currently implementing a number of recommendations to review placements for individuals with complex needs,"" he added.

'Ban painful headlocks in child prisons'Pressure is mounting on the government to end the use of painful restraints to control children's behaviour in youth custody.Family & Education,"Ministers are under growing pressure to ban the painful headlocks, wrist and arm twists that can be used to control children's behaviour in youth prisons. The national inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) recently concluded ""pain compliance"" measures were child abuse and should be outlawed. And the Equalities and Human Rights Commission ruled last week that such methods should not be used on children. The government said restraint was used only as a last resort. But children's charities, who have long campaigned for change, say these recommendations ending its use should be adopted straight away. The Ministry of Justice commissioned Charlie Taylor, chairman of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, to carry out a review of restraint. This came after a children's rights group, Article 39, lodged an application at the High Court for a judicial review of the practice. That action has been stayed pending the outcome of the report. But solicitors acting for the charity have written to the government urging it to put the recommendations into practice. They say there is no justification for spending public money on a continued review when the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse examined the use of restraint as part of its investigation into children in custodial institutions. It found pain compliance techniques were used on children in custody during 119 incidents in Youth Offending Institutions in the year to 2017. The Ministry of Justice said there were 181 incidents in which pain-inducing restraint techniques were used on children last year. The techniques, designed for the prison riot squad, aim to force an individual to comply by use of pain. They involve pressure being applied to limb joints or certain pressure points. The longer the target takes to comply, the more pain they are likely to endure. The most popular physical restraint method is the inverted wrist hold. It was used 3,692 times, according to official data. Officials deny this technique causes pain, but a review by the Prisons Inspectorate suggests that it does. The IICSA report said: ""The chair and panel consider that the use of pain compliance techniques should be seen as a form of child abuse, and that it is likely to contribute to a culture of violence, which may increase the risk of child sexual abuse. ""The chair and panel recommend that the Ministry of Justice prohibits the use of pain compliance techniques by withdrawing all policy permitting its use, and setting out that this practice is prohibited by way of regulation."" It added that the use of such techniques ""normalises pain for staff and children"" and ""prevents staff from building trusting relationships and inhibits a child from reporting sexual abuse"". Article 39 director Carolyne Willow said: ""Mandating adults in positions of authority to deliberately hurt children, and running training courses that show exactly how to inflict severe pain, is institutionalised child abuse. There is no other way to describe it. ""These techniques should have been completely withdrawn after the terrible death of Adam Rickwood."" Adam Rickwood took his own life in a youth custody centreafter he was restrained using a now banned restraint technique. A coroner ruled the use of force contributed to his death. Ms Willow continued: ""It's taken 15 years to get to this point where the country's largest ever public inquiry into child abuse has recommended legal prohibition. ""The urgency comes in the inquiry describing pain compliant techniques as a form of child abuse. ""How can ministers not act quickly to protect vulnerable children after that?"" Head of policy at the NSPCC Almudena Lara backed Iicsa's calls for pain compliance techniques to be banned. ""Such outdated practices, including an inverted wrist hold and thumb flexion, are likely to contribute to a culture of violence which may increase the risk of abuse, including child sexual abuse. ""For far too long, children have been subjected to this inhumane treatment and it must be stopped once and for all."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Staff are trained to resolve conflict verbally and our policy is clear that restraint should only ever be used as a last resort where there is a risk of harm to the young person or others and no alternative intervention is possible. ""In addition, we have commissioned Charlie Taylor to independently review our policy on the use of pain-inducing techniques and he is due to complete his review this summer.""

Sturgeon seeks urgent Brexit talks with PMNicola Sturgeon may travel to London to speak to Theresa May amid continuing Brexit uncertainty.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""In the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking,  what will happen over the next few days..... is that a bad compromise will be reached. "" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned against accepting a ""bad compromise"" after holding Brexit talks with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. Political leaders have been meeting in London in a bid to break the logjam over the UK's exit from the EU. The prime minister is to ask the EU for another extension to the Brexit deadline while she attempts to come to an agreement with the Labour leader. Ms Sturgeon urged Mr Corbyn to be ""very wary"" about signing up to a ""bad deal"". Mrs May reached out to Mr Corbyn after failing to win backing for her proposed Brexit plan, which has suffered three defeats in the Commons, and MPs failed to unite around any alternative during a series of ""indicative votes"". Talks between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn on Wednesday afternoon were described as ""constructive"" by both sides. But speaking immediately after her own meeting with the prime minister, Ms Sturgeon said she was ""not much clearer on where she (Mrs May) is prepared to give ground"". Live coverage of the latest Brexit developments PM defends Brexit talks with Corbyn Kuenssberg: May chooses a deal over party unity She added: ""I suppose overall my concern is that in the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking, what will happen over the next few days - if anything - is that a bad compromise will be reached. ""People will probably heave a sigh of relief that some agreement has been reached, but then very quickly realise that it's not in the interests of the UK. ""It will satisfy no one, and of course would be open to being unpicked by a prime minister that is not Theresa May, perhaps somebody like Boris Johnson. ""So I think there's a need to be wary. If I was in Jeremy Corbyn's shoes right now I would be very wary about signing up to anything that may not be able to be delivered, in fact may not be enough in the first place."" Mrs May made a statement at Downing Street on Tuesday offering talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Ms Sturgeon said she had felt Mr Corbyn ""would drive a hard bargain"" after meeting him - but that the prime minister had later given the impression that ""she thinks she's got Jeremy Corbyn closer to a deal"". The SNP leader said the UK should ask for a longer extension to Brexit, and that any compromise deal that is ultimately hammered out should be put back to the public in a new referendum, with remaining in the EU also as an option. The UK's departure from the EU was put back from 29 March to 12 April following a summit of European leaders late in March. If MPs or ministers cannot come up with an exit plan which is accepted by the EU, then the UK will leave without a deal. Mrs May said on Tuesday that she would ask the EU for a further extension, to be kept ""as short as possible"", and arranged talks with Mr Corbyn to agree a new approach. But she insisted her withdrawal agreement - which was voted down last week - would remain part of the deal. Following her meeting with Ms Sturgeon, a Downing Street spokeswoman said Mrs May had ""made clear that this delay and division across the UK cannot continue"". The spokeswoman added: ""She is meeting with the leader of the opposition to find a proposal that can command the support of the House of Commons to allow the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible. ""She added that Brexit is a decisive moment in our history and we must come together to deliver for people in Scotland and the whole of the UK."" A Labour spokesman said: ""We have had constructive exploratory discussions about how to break the Brexit deadlock. ""We have agreed a programme of work between our teams to explore the scope for agreement."" Meanwhile, Holyrood's Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh confirmed that the Scottish Parliament would be recalled from recess if the UK is heading for a no-deal Brexit on 12 April.

PM asks Corbyn to help break Brexit deadlock,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I'm offering to sit down with the leader of the opposition"" Theresa May will ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline to ""break the logjam"" in Parliament. The PM says she wants to meet Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a plan on the future relationship with the EU. But she insisted her withdrawal agreement -which was voted down last week- would remain part of the deal. Mr Corbyn said he was ""very happy"" to meet Mrs May, and would ensure plans for a customs union and protection of workers' rights were on the table. The cross-party talks offer has angered Tory Brexiteers, with Boris Johnson accusing ministers of ""entrusting the final handling of Brexit to Labour"". The former foreign secretary said Brexit was ""becoming soft to the point of disintegration"" and he could never agree with staying in a customs union. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Brexit process 'disintegrating' BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it probably means the prime minister is likely to adopt a closer relationship with the EU - a softer Brexit - than she had agreed so far. The UK has until 12 April to propose a plan to the EU - which must be accepted by them - or it will leave without a deal. Mrs May agreed a deal with the EU in November 2018, but it has been voted down twice in Parliament by huge margins, and a separate deal just on the withdrawal agreement section lost by 58 votes on Friday. MPs have alsotwice held indicative votes to try to find a consensus, but none of the proposals won a majority. Theresa May's statement in full Kuenssberg: PM chooses a deal over party unity Brexitcast: Theresa's Choice MPs push to prevent no-deal Brexit in law The UK was supposed to leave the EU on 29 March, but Mrs May agreed a short extension after realising Parliament would not agree a deal by the deadline. In a statement in Downing Street, Mrs May said she wanted any further extension to be ""as short as possible"" - before 22 May so the UK does not have to take part in European elections. She said she wanted to agree a new plan with Mr Corbyn and put it to a vote in the Commons before 10 April - when the EU will hold an emergency summit on Brexit. If she and Mr Corbyn do not agree a single way forward, she proposed putting a number of options to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"". But the EU would still have to agree to any extension. Sturgeon: May 'kicking can' over Brexit Brexit deadlock: The Commons in numbers The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler warned their demands ""haven't changed at all"", and they are preparing ""pretty strict conditions"" for any further delay. ""Even though Theresa May says she doesn't want to, EU leaders will ask her to prepare the UK to take part in European Parliamentary elections by the end of May because they don't believe she will be able to get her Brexit house in order before then,"" she said. Mr Corbyn said he saw the content of the prime minister's speech only when it went out on TV, but he recognised Mrs May had ""made a move"" and that he had a ""responsibility"" to engage in the talks. Asked by the BBC if he was willing to compromise on his own red lines, he said: ""I have been meeting MPs from all parties from the last couple of weeks. Yes, there is some common ground [and] there are some areas it is difficult to agree on. ""But there is far more that unites people on both sides about the kind of society we can be than divides them. ""We will discuss [this] with the prime minister. I don't want to set any limits one way or the other."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I recognise that she has made a move... I recognise my responsibility"" Earlier, Mrs May met her cabinet for more than seven hours. Laura Kuenssberg said there were differing accounts of the level of support for any extension within the cabinet - from four ministers voicing opposition to it to as many as 14 being against it. Pressed on this, Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC none of the Brexiteers in cabinet were ""happy at the situation we find ourselves in"" and they would have preferred for Mrs May's withdrawal agreement to be passed by Parliament last week. But he said there had not been a vote on the issue in the meeting, and there was a ""critical consensus"" about any extension being as short as possible. The Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, said: ""We are trying to find a way to deliver on the referendum to make sure that we leave the European Union with a good deal that enables all of those who voted to leave the EU to be satisfied, but also that protects jobs and our security. ""We continue to do that and that's what cabinet today was all about"". Andrea Leadsom said cabinet was ""trying to find a way to deliver on the referendum"". Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was ""not usually successful for governments to get their business passed on opposition votes when their own party is against it"". The chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group added he ""doubts the wisdom"" of the decision, saying: ""To allow the Labour party to run Brexit, to decide you'd rather be supported by a Marxist than by your own party, is unwise."" This video can not be played Rees-Mogg: PM 'unwise' to allow Labour to run Brexit policy Mrs May said she understood some people would prefer to leave without a deal, and she believed the UK ""could make a success of no-deal in the long term"". But she added that leaving with a deal was ""the best solution"". ""This is a difficult time for everyone,"" she said. ""Passions are running high on all sides of the argument, but we can and must find the compromises that will deliver what the British people voted for. ""This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands and it requires national unity to deliver the national interest."" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid it was another case of the PM ""kicking the can"", while Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable questioned the point of cross-party talks. Allow Twitter content?

Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons Brexit committee, said the PM's announcement was ""good news"" but she must show she was genuinely open to new ideas. But Brexit-supporting Labour MP Kate Hoey said ""whatever compromise"" Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn came up with, many MPs would simply not vote for the withdrawal agreement. The Democratic Unionist Party - who give Mrs May a majority in Parliament but have repeatedly voted against her deal - said the move came as ""little surprise"" after the PM's ""lamentable handling of the negotiations"". The DUP said: ""It remains to be seen if sub-contracting out the future of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn, someone whom the Conservatives have demonised for four years, will end happily.""

Embattled Trudeau expels 'whistleblowers'The two Liberal women had cried foul over the PM's alleged role in the SNC-Lavalin affair.US & Canada,"Jody Wilson-Raybould (L) and Jane Philpott (R) Canada's prime minister has kicked two MPs from his party's caucus after they accused him of meddling in a criminal case involving an influential company. Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott had already resigned from PM Justin Trudeau's cabinet citing their concerns over the SNC-Lavalin affair. Now they have been expelled from Mr Trudeau's Liberal Party, months before a general election. The SNC-Lavalin controversy has cast a shadow over Mr Trudeau's leadership. Andrew Scheer, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, said on Tuesday that the prime minister had betrayed justice by removing two corruption whistleblowers. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trudeau repeatedly spoke about the breakdown of trust between Ms Wilson-Raybould and Ms Philpott and members of his staff. ""The trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,"" Mr Trudeau told the media shortly after informing his caucus. ""If they can't honestly say they have confidence in this teamâ¦ then they cannot be part of this team."" Ms Philpott has been vocal about her concerns with the government, and gave an interview in a national magazine last month in which she said ""there's much more to the story that needs to be told"". Mr Trudeau said his decision was sparked by the revelation that Ms Wilson-Raybould had secretly recorded a conversation she had with Canada's former top bureaucrat, which she released publicly on Friday. Ms Wilson-Raybould said the tapes backed up her claim that government officials inappropriately pressured her to shield SNC-Lavalin from prosecution. The Canadian firm is accused of bribing officials in Libya to win contracts under Muammar Gaddafi's regime. SNC-Lavalin has openly lobbied for an agreement that would allow it to avoid prosecution and instead face alternative penalties or measures, such as a fine. Ms Wilson-Raybould said members of Mr Trudeau's inner circle pressured her to cut a deal, and when she did not, she was removed from her position as justice minister. Trudeau crisis grows as minister resigns Ex-minister increases pressure on Trudeau Mr Trudeau has repeatedly denied that there was any wrongdoing by him or his officials. The political controversy, which has been dragging on for weeks, has caused Mr Trudeau's popularity to drop sharply in opinion polls a few months before a general election. He said he is expelling the women from the caucus to put an end to infighting, which he had vowed to stop when he was elected in 2014. Secret tape increases pressure on Trudeau Five quotes that sum up the Trudeau crisis ""Civil wars within parties is damaging because it signals to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than about them,"" he said on Tuesday. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has struggled to contain the political crisis Both women had said they still want to run again under the Liberal banner in the next general election, and expressed dismay they will no longer be a part of the party.

Ms Philpott said she will remain an independent MP until her term is up. She reiterated her belief that the government put inappropriate pressure on Ms Wilson-Raybould, and criticised the government for attacking Ms Wilson-Raybould's credibility. ""This isn't about a lack of loyalty,""  she wrote in a statement Tuesday evening. ""On the contrary, I recommended that the government acknowledge what happened in order to move forward. This was an expression of loyalty, not disloyalty."" Ms Wilson-Raybould said she had ""no regrets"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Identical twins must both pay maintenanceThe Brazilian brothers had refused to admit who the father of the baby was, a judge says.Latin America & Caribbean","DNA tests concluded that either man could be the father A judge in Brazil has ordered identical twin brothers to pay maintenance to a child whose paternity could not be established. The men refused to say which one of them had fathered the child, assuming they would then be able to escape having to pay. A DNA test proved inconclusive because of their identical twin status. The judge said the two men were taking away from the young girl the right to know who her biological father was. Each man will have to pay 230 reais; ($60; Â£45) a month, or 30% of the minimum salary in Brazil, as maintenance. This means the girl will get twice as much as other children from the same economic background in Brazil. Judge Filipe LuÃ­s Peruca, in the central state of GoiÃ¡s, also ruled that the names of both men would be on the girl's birth certificate. The twins' names have not been disclosed for legal reasons. They were referred to in court as Fernando and FabrÃ­cio. ""One of them is acting in bad faith in order to hide the fact that he is the father. Such vile behaviour cannot be tolerated by the law,"" wrote the judge in the town of Cachoeira Alta. The judge said the twins had used their resemblance to impersonate each other and date as many women as possible, and then defend themselves from allegations they were cheating on girlfriends.

Brunei to punish gay sex with death by stoning,"Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei Brunei is introducing strict new Islamic laws that make anal sex and adultery offences punishable by stoning to death. The new measures, that come into force on Wednesday, also cover a range of other crimes including punishment for theft by amputation. The move has sparked international condemnation. Brunei's gay community has expressed shock and fear at the ""medieval punishments"". ""You wake up and realise that your neighbours, your family or even that nice old lady that sells prawn fritters by the side of the road doesn't think you're human, or is okay with stoning,"" one Bruneian gay man, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. The sultan of the small South-East Asian nation on Wednesday called for ""stronger"" Islamic teachings. ""I want to see Islamic teachings in this country grow stronger,"" Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said in a public address, according to AFP news agency, without mentioning the strict new interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law. Brunei: What you need to know Where is gay sex still against the law? What is Sharia? Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Muslims make up about two-thirds of the country's population of 420,000. Brunei has retained the death penalty but has not carried out an execution since 1957. The law mostly applies to Muslims, including children who have reached puberty, though some aspects will apply to non-Muslims. Under the new laws,individuals accused of certain acts will be convicted if they confess or if there were witnesses present.,external Offences such as rape, adultery, sodomy, robbery and insult or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad will carry the maximum penalty of death.,external Lesbian sex carries a different penalty of 40 strokes of the cane and/or a maximum of 10 years in jail The punishment for theft is amputation Those who ""persuade, tell or encourage"" Muslim children under the age of 18 ""to accept the teachings of religions other than Islam"" are liable to a fine or jail Individuals who have not reached puberty but are convicted of certain offences may be instead subjected to whipping. Sultan Hassanal heads the Brunei Investment Agency which owns the Dorchester Collection, an operator of some of the world's top hotels including the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. Brunei's ruling royals possess a huge private fortune and its largely ethnic Malay residents enjoy generous state handouts and pay no taxes. ButHollywood actor George Clooney and other celebrities have now called for a boycott of the luxury hotels.TV host Ellen DeGeneres also called for people to ""rise up"", saying ""we need to do something now"".

The hotel operator said it did ""not tolerate any form of discrimination"".

""Inclusion and diversity remain core beliefs."" In another development,a honorary degree awarded by the UK's University of Aberdeen to Sultan Hassanal is under review. The country first introduced Sharia law in 2014 despite widespread condemnation, giving it a dual legal system with both Sharia and Common Law. The sultan had said then that the new penal code would come into full force over several years. The first phase, which covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines, was implemented in 2014. Brunei had delayed introducing the final two phases, which cover crimes punishable by amputation and stoning. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, who is also the prime minister of Brunei, is among the wealthiest people in the world But on Saturday, the government released a statement on its website sayingthe Sharia penal code would be fully implemented on Wednesday,external. In the days since, there has been international outrage and calls for the country to reverse course. ""These abusive provisions received widespread condemnation when plans were first discussed five years ago,"" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, a Brunei researcher at Amnesty International. ""Brunei's penal code is a deeply flawed piece of legislation containing a range of provisions that violate human rights."" The United Nations echoed the statement, calling the legislation ""cruel, inhuman and degrading"", and saying it marked a ""serious setback"" for human rights protection. Maldives annuls woman's stoning ruling How many countries still have the death penalty? According to rights group Human Rights Without Frontiers,stoning is still a punishment in countries such as Iran, Somalia and Sudan among others,external. There are several theories, but Matthew Woolfe, founder of human rights group The Brunei Project, said it could be linked to Brunei's weakening economy. ""One theory is that it is a way for the government to strengthen its hold on power in the face of a declining economy that could potentially lead to some unrest in future,"" Mr Woolfe told the BBC. ""Connected to this is [Brunei's] interest in attracting more investment from the Muslim world, along with more Islamic touristsâ¦ this could be seen as one way of appealing to this market."" One rights group says the tightening Sharia laws might be a way for the government to strengthen its hold on power Mr Woolfe also added that the government might have hoped to get away with the latest roll-out without anyone realising. ""I think that the government did want to ensure that the international uproar that followed implementation of the first phase in 2014 had well and truly died down before further [implementation], in the hope it would just quietly [do so] without anyone realising,"" he said. ""It wasn't until increasing international attention that it finally came out and confirmed [this]."" The penal code changes were posted on the attorney general's website in December but only came to public attention in late March. There was no public announcement. One 40-year-old gay Bruneian currently seeking asylum in Canada said the impact of the new penal code was already being felt in Brunei. The ex-government employee, who left Brunei last year after being charged with sedition for a Facebook post that was critical of the government, said people were ""afraid"". ""The gay community in Brunei has never been open but when Grindr [a gay dating app] came that helped people meet in secret. But now, what I've heard is that hardly anyone is using Grindr anymore,"" Shahiran S Shahrani Md told the BBC. ""They're afraid that they might talk to a police officer pretending to be gay. It hasn't happened yet but because of the new laws, people are afraid,"" he said. Another male Bruneian, who is not gay but has renounced Islam, said he felt ""fearful and numb"" in the face of the laws being implemented. ""We ordinary citizens are powerless to stop Sharia law from being implemented,"" said the 23-year-old, who did not want to be identified. ""Under Sharia, I would face the death penalty for apostasy."" One gay man was hopeful that the laws might not be enforced widely. ""Honestly, I'm not too scared as the government here often bluffs with the harsh punishments. But it can and will still happen even with it being rare."" It is very unlikely to happen at all, people inside Brunei have told Bill Hayton, associate fellow with the Asia Pacific programme at Chatham House. ""What I'm hearing from people in Brunei is that this is very, very unlikely to ever happen,"" he told BBC Radio Four. For instance, the laws stipulate that there must be four Muslim witnesses to the act of anal sex or adultery for it to be prosecuted, he said. ""The way it is being explained to me is that this is a way for the sultan to look religious but make sure that none of these punishments will actually be carried out,"" Mr Hayton said.

"Call to protect birds from nettingWildlife experts want more controls on nets over hedges and trees, amid growing public concern.Science & Environment","Wildlife experts are calling for stricter controls on nets installed over trees and hedgerows amid growing public concern about their use. People are reporting sightings on social media, while an e-petition has collected more than 190,000 signatures. Developers have said the nets, which are designed to stop birds nesting, are ""standard practice"" on greenery that might be damaged by building work. But the RSPB says they should only be used in exceptional circumstances. The wildlife charity has joined forces with the body that represents trained ecologists to call for new safeguards. Why are nets appearing over trees and hedges? Tesco backtracks on swallow nets Netting trees 'endangers wildlife' ""Netting is an overly simplistic approach that has become more prominent recently,"" says the RSPB and The Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management in a statement. ""There is an understandable negative reaction from both the public and from professional ecologists to the real and potential harm that it may cause to wildlife."" Swallow chicks in the Cotswolds - many birds are returning in spring to nest The use of netting can often be avoided with advice from a trained ecologist, they say. If there is no other option, it should be used only after planning permission has been granted. And the netting should be used in a way that will not trap wildlife and checked three times a day, they added. While it is an offence to destroy an active nest, there are currently no laws to prevent the installation of nets. According to Jeff Knott from the RSPB, the use of netting on hedges and trees seems to have ""exploded"" this year. ""It seems to be popping up all over the place and that's been a real concern,"" he said. ""The public interest in this issue has been absolutely huge."" Hedges and trees shrouded with netting are ""a visual representation of how we are increasingly painting nature into a smaller, smaller box and how we are forcing it to fit in with our plans,"" he added. Campaigns on social media have led to nets being removed. Last week, residents in Berkshire, including nature writer Nicola Chester, used Twitter to report birds being trapped in a net on hedgerows in Theale. Allow Twitter content?

And a crowdsourced map that allows people to post where they have seen the nets recorded sightings in Scotland, England and Wales, from Cornwall up to Glasgow. A crowdsourced map circulating on Twitter The representative body of the homebuilding industry, the Home Builders Federation, has said installing this type of netting was not a new thing and it was not aware of any increase in netting. It said the industry was committed to protecting birds and providing an overall increase in the number of trees. Each year about 2,000 reports are made about wild birds trapped in or behind many different types of netting, with bird-deterrent netting a major cause, said the RSPCA. ""Planning policy guidance recommends that any development that would affect wildlife should be done at the correct time of year, so we want to see developers delaying works until after the nesting seasons rather than using nets,"" it said. ""If nets are used it should be for the shortest time possible, regularly checked and kept in a good state of repair to prevent animals becoming trapped."" Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"Ex-Tory MP hits out at 'cowardly' cabinetNick Boles says no-one around Theresa May has ""earned the right"" to succeed her as prime minister.","This video can not be played Nick Boles: Theresa May is 'splitting the country' Former Conservative MP Nick Boles has accused the cabinet of being ""cowardly and selfish"" for failing to challenge Theresa May's approach to Brexit. Mr Boles, who quit the parliamentary party on Monday, said the PM had ""misunderstood and mismanaged"" the whole process of leaving the EU. And he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg no-one in the cabinet ""had earned the right"" to succeed her. The Tory Party ""did not really exist any more"", he also suggested. Mr Boles was part of a cross-party group of MPs co-ordinating efforts to find a compromise in Parliament around a Brexit proposal that would retain access to the single market. After his Common Market 2.0 plan was rejected by MPs for the second time on Monday, he accused his party of ""failing to compromise"". He said he could no longer represent them in the Commons and would sit as an independent. This video can not be played Nick Boles: ""I have failed, chiefly, because my party refuses to compromise"" Mr Boles, the MP for Grantham and Stamford, told the BBC his former party was gripped by a combination of ""cowardice and dogma"". He said the prime minister had been totally preoccupied with the wishes of her party and had never attempted to ""construct or understand what a deal would look like to bring the country together"". Senior ministers had shown a ""collective failure to lead and unite"" and had ""all put their interests first"". ""There are fine people in cabinet but this is the worst cabinet in recorded history,"" he said. ""None has earned the right to lead the country after Brexit."" He suggested Brexit would be the equivalent of a ""meteor strike"" on the British political system and none of the major parties would be immune from the repercussions. But he also admitted that MPs who wanted closer economic links with the EU had failed to coalesce early enough around an alternative to the PM's deal and had ""missed the boat"". The MP quit his local constituency party last month amid a campaign by some party members to deselect him as their candidate for the next election.

Payday lender's collapse to hit borrowersHundreds of thousands of customers will now receive smaller compensation payouts for mis-sold loans.Business,"Hundreds of thousands of people who were mis-sold payday loans will receive a fraction of the compensation they are entitled to after a lender collapsed. WageDay Advance had given loans to about 800,000 people but went into administration earlier this year. In a case that mirrors the demise of Wonga, the company folded after being hit by a wave of compensation claims for mis-sold loans. Customers are now receiving emails to explain how much they owe or are owed. However, now the company is in administration, those who have paid off loans but are entitled to compensation have become unsecured creditors. They can only expect a fraction of the full compensation payout. Michael Ingram no longer owes money to WageDay Advance, but has borrowed from the company on several occasions in the past. Once one loan had been paid off, he took another - often bigger - one. His largest loans were for about Â£700. The 32-year-old full-time dad submitted a complaint in November that he had been mis-sold loans. He was contacted by the company to say it would not be able to process that complaint within the eight weeks stipulated by regulators. He was still waiting when the company went into administration. ""My complaint has not been resolved. I want some closure. I am optimistic, but I am not holding my breath,"" he said. WageDay Advance and Juo Loans were the brand names of CURO Transatlantic Limited, which went into administration in February. It had been one of the middle-ranking payday lenders operating in the UK, with most customers applying for loans online or through their smartphones from WageDay. In 2017, it won an industry award when it was named the best short-term loan provider. But many loans had been mis-sold to people who could not afford to pay them back, had loans rolled over, or had multiple loans with other providers. Thousands of these customers complained, many via claims management companies. The company built a claims calculator, which has estimated that current and former customers could be entitled to up to Â£223m in compensation, including interest. An estimated 330,000 people are expected still to have eligible claims for compensation. Successful claims made last year had an average payout of Â£850. The firm collapsed as it was unable to cope with the cost of dealing with these complaints and the potential payouts. Now administrators from KPMG are using that calculator to determine how much individual customers still owe, after compensation is subtracted. Calculations are also being made to work out compensation entitlement for each former borrower who has already paid off their loans. Claims firms 'will disappear at worst time' Wonga: Fourfold rise in compensation claimant estimate These individuals are now receiving emails, and accompanying text messages, outlining their entitlement, or new balance if they are still paying back loans. The emails carry the logo of the administrators, KPMG, and WageDay Advance and Juo Loans. However, recipients must reply to claim the compensation that has been calculated. The number of claims will determine how much is eventually paid out, but it will only be a fraction of the full amount. Anyone with outstanding loans will still have to pay off the balance after compensation has been subtracted, although fees and interest have been permanently frozen. Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said the total compensation bill reflected the ""huge amount of interest many desperate people ended up paying"". ""Payday loans are supposed to be short term borrowing. But too often Wageday Advance customers were caught in the payday loan trap for months and even years, only able to repay a loan if they borrowed again soon after,"" she said. ""Wageday Advance were a medium-size payday lender. It would be interesting to know if the other lenders have worked out how much they should be paying in refunds to customers given unaffordable loans."" About 60,000 loans - almost entirely recent loans without any compensation entitlement - were sold off to Shelby Finance Limited, and will continue as normal. Customers can check if they are one of those transferred on theWageDay website,external. Fears over the level of personal debt built up by individuals continues to concern charities. In its annual report, published on Wednesday, debt charity StepChange said there had been a ""small, but worrying"" rise in the number of people seeking help who had payday, or high-cost and short-term, loans. Some 26% of new female clients and 35% of new male clients, aged under 25, had this kind of debt, a much higher level than older age groups. Overall, the charity said it had seen a consistent rise in single parents seeking help, Some 85% of them were women. In 2018, 23% of those who took debt advice were single parents, up from 21.5% in 2017 and from 18% since 2014. Single parents account for only 6% of the UK population. ""While debt can strike at any age, on average our clients are getting younger. It is important that policymakers work to help turn the tide and prevent debt becoming an inevitable rite of passage for young adults,"" said Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange.

Grandmother gives birth to own grandchild,"Baby Uma Louise with her parents, Matthew Eledge and Elliot Dougherty and her grandmother, Cecil Eledge A 61-year-old Nebraskan woman has told of her joy after giving birth to her own grandchild, acting as the surrogate for her son and his husband. Cecile Eledge carried the daughter of her son Matthew Eledge and his husband Elliot Dougherty to term, giving birth to baby Uma Louise last week. Mrs Eledge said she made the offer when her son and Mr Dougherty first said they wanted to start a family. ""Of course, they all laughed,"" Mrs Eledge told the BBC. Mrs Eledge, who was 59 at the time, said her suggestion remained a sort of joke among family at first, not a realistic path forward. ""It just seemed like a really beautiful sentiment on her part,"" Mr Dougherty said. ""She's such a selfless woman."" But when Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty, who live in Omaha close to Mrs Eledge and her husband, began exploring options to have a baby they were told by a fertility doctor that it could be a viable option. Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty on the day of their daughter's birth Mrs Eledge was brought in for an interview and a series of tests, all of which gave a green light to the surrogacy. ""I'm very health conscious,"" she said. ""There was no reason whatsoever to doubt that I could carry the baby."" With Mr Eledge providing the sperm, Mr Dougherty's sister Lea served as the egg donor. Q&A: Surrogate babies Cecile Eledge and her granddaughter, Uma Mr Dougherty, who works as a hairdresser, said that while straight couples may consider IVF the last resort, for them it was their ""only hope"" for a biological child. ""We always knew we had to be unique and think outside the box with this,"" Mr Eledge, a public school teacher, added. Women over 34 refused IVF treatment Why I chose to go it alone with IVF UK law 'outdated' says surrogate mother Lea Yribe, Mr Dougherty's sister and Uma's egg donor, Mr Dougherty, Ms Eledge and Mr Eledge Mrs Eledge said the pregnancy was smooth throughout, the regular symptoms simply ""elevated a little bit"" compared to her previous pregnancies with her three children. In fact, the most obvious sign of her age came less than a week after Mrs Eledge was implanted with the embryo, when Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty bought her a home pregnancy test to see if the transfer had been successful. ""We were told not to, but the boys couldn't wait,"" Mrs Eledge said, laughing. She looked at the test and was devastated to see the results were negative. But when Mr Eledge came over later that day to comfort her, he saw something she hadn't: a second pink line on the test, confirming a pregnancy. ""That was really a joyous moment,"" Mrs Eledge said, accompanied by jokes about her failing eyesight. ""She can't see anything, but she'll be able to deliver,"" Mrs Eledge recalls Mr Eledge and Mr Dougherty saying. Parents Elliot Dougherty and Matthew Eledge meet their daughter Uma Mrs Eledge said the response to her pregnancy has been mostly positive, accompanied by a slight ""shock factor,"" particularly for her two other children, Mr Eledge's siblings. ""When everyone got the full picture it was nothing but support,"" she said. But the pregnancy exposed some persistent markers of discrimination against LGBT families in Nebraska. Though gay marriage has been legal in the state since thelandmark Supreme Court decisionin 2015, Nebraska has no state laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. Up until 2017, the state maintained adecades-old ban,externalon gay and lesbian foster parents. Mrs Eledge said she fought, unsuccessfully, with her insurance company over health expenses that would have been covered if she was giving birth to her own child. And due to a law designating the person who delivers the baby as mother, Uma's birth certificate lists Mrs Eledge alongside her son, and excludes Mr Dougherty. ""This is just one small, micro example of the things that create road blocks for us,"" Mr Eledge said. Mr Eledge made headlines four years ago when he wasdismissed from his job,externalat Skutt Catholic High School after he informed school administrators that he and Mr Dougherty planned to get married. Baby Uma with parents Elliot Dougherty and Matthew Eledge Mr Eledge's treatment sparked outrage in his community, prompting parents and former and current students to create an online petition calling for an ""end to employment discrimination against Mr Eledge and future faculty"". Thepetition,external, now closed, garnered 102,995 supporters. Typically a private family, Mrs Eledge says they chose to share their story to counter these examples of ""hate"" towards LGBT individuals and families, and convey ""that there's always hope out there"". ""I'm learning not to take it personally,"" said Mr Eledge of the negative responses to him and his family. ""At the end of the day, we have a family, we have friends, we have a huge community that supports us."" The Eledge and Dougherty family on the day of Uma's birth And week after Uma's birth, Mrs Eledge says that she and her granddaughter are doing well. ""This little girl is surrounded by so much support, she's going to grow up in a loving family,"" Mrs Eledge said. ""This was how it was meant to be.""

Identical twins must both pay maintenance,"DNA tests concluded that either man could be the father A judge in Brazil has ordered identical twin brothers to pay maintenance to a child whose paternity could not be established. The men refused to say which one of them had fathered the child, assuming they would then be able to escape having to pay. A DNA test proved inconclusive because of their identical twin status. The judge said the two men were taking away from the young girl the right to know who her biological father was. Each man will have to pay 230 reais; ($60; Â£45) a month, or 30% of the minimum salary in Brazil, as maintenance. This means the girl will get twice as much as other children from the same economic background in Brazil. Judge Filipe LuÃ­s Peruca, in the central state of GoiÃ¡s, also ruled that the names of both men would be on the girl's birth certificate. The twins' names have not been disclosed for legal reasons. They were referred to in court as Fernando and FabrÃ­cio. ""One of them is acting in bad faith in order to hide the fact that he is the father. Such vile behaviour cannot be tolerated by the law,"" wrote the judge in the town of Cachoeira Alta. The judge said the twins had used their resemblance to impersonate each other and date as many women as possible, and then defend themselves from allegations they were cheating on girlfriends.

Algeria's President Bouteflika resigns,"This video can not be played Algerians celebrate Bouteflika quitting Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has resigned after weeks of massive street protests. Mr Bouteflika, who has been in power for 20 years, had already dropped plans to seek a fifth term as opposition to his rule grew. The powerful Algerian army had called for the 82-year-old to be declared incapable of carrying out his duties. Protesters have vowed to continue piling on pressure until the entire government is ousted. The BBC's Mohamed Arezki Himeur in Algiers says there were huge celebrations in the city, with people shouting, waving the national flag and honking their car horns all night. He says the protesters do not only want Mr Bouteflika to go, but the whole system, in particular the government which was only appointed last weekend. ""This is just a little victory - the biggest is still to come,"" one protester said. Mr Bouteflika, who has been ill since he suffered a stroke six years ago, has avoided public events ever since. However, he made a rare appearance on state TV to relinquish power hours after military chief Lt Gen Ahmed Gaed Salah called on him to leave office immediately. Who could succeed Algeria's ailing president? The president who doesn't speak State TV broadcast President Bouteflika handing in his resignation letter to the Constitutional Council's President Tayeb Belaiz One man, Selmaoui Seddik, told Reuters: ""God willing, we will have a 100% democratic transition, this is very important. We need to remove the whole previous regime and that is the hardest thing."" However, one protest leader, Mustapha Bouchachi, said before the announcement that any decision by Mr Bouteflika to quit would still change nothing and that the protests would continue. People sang as they celebrated in Algiers Many Algerians took their children to mark a historic occasion News of the resignation came in a statement carried on state news agency APS. ""The president of the republic, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has officially notified the president of the constitutional council of his decision to end his mandate as president of the republic,"" it said. State TV then reported that this would be with immediate effect. According to the constitution, the Senate speaker should take over as interim head of state until fresh elections are held. Pressure had been building since February, when the first demonstrations were sparked by Mr Bouteflika's announcement that he would be standing for a fifth term. Tens of thousands protested across the country on 1 March. Mr Bouteflika's promise not to serve out a fifth term if re-elected, along with a change of prime minister, failed to quell the discontent. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has led Algeria since 1999 Leaders of the protests also rejected Mr Bouteflika's offer this week that he would go by the end of his current term - 28 April - as not quick enough. It seems the powerful military agreed. Its chief, Lt Gen Ahmed Gaed Salah, said earlier on Tuesday: ""There is no more room to waste time."" The demonstrations have also called for the whole political system, in which the military plays a significant role, to be overhauled. Many of the protesters are young and say they want a new system of government. There were accusations that Mr Bouteflika was being used as a front by ""le pouvoir"" - a group of businessmen, politicians and military officials - to retain their power. Mr Bensalah (l), who is expected to take over as caretaker president, has been representing the ailing leader at public events Elections originally scheduled for 18 April were postponed and the governing National Liberation Front (FLN) vowed to organise a national conference on reforms. The FLN has ruled Algeria since the country won independence from France in 1962 after seven years of conflict. Mr Bouteflika, who came to power in 1999, strengthened his grip after a bloody civil war against Islamist insurgents which left 150,000 dead. The chairman of the upper house of parliament, Abdelkader Bensalah, is expected to become caretaker president for three months until elections. Mr Bensalah has been in post since 2002 and has represented Mr Bouteflika at official visits and events. He also shares a similar background with the president, growing up in neighbouring Morocco before returning to fight in the liberation war. He is a veteran of Algeria's war of independence who served as foreign minister for more than a decade before becoming president in 1999. His primary task was to rebuild the country, and its economy - but first, he needed to end Algeria's brutal civil war sparked by the military's refusal to recognise the election victory of the Islamic Salvation Front in the early 1990s. Despite guaranteeing stability in the oil-rich nation, his government has been accused of widespread corruption and state repression. The man who once said he would not accept being ""three-quarters a president""  spent his last years in a wheelchair after a stroke in 2013, rarely appearing in public, and fuelling fierce debate over who was really in charge, the BBC's North Africa correspondent, Rana Jawad, says. Revolutionaries praise him for welcoming Che Guevara to Algeria, and giving a young Nelson Mandela his first military training.

Payday lender's collapse to hit borrowersHundreds of thousands of customers will now receive smaller compensation payouts for mis-sold loans.,"Hundreds of thousands of people who were mis-sold payday loans will receive a fraction of the compensation they are entitled to after a lender collapsed. WageDay Advance had given loans to about 800,000 people but went into administration earlier this year. In a case that mirrors the demise of Wonga, the company folded after being hit by a wave of compensation claims for mis-sold loans. Customers are now receiving emails to explain how much they owe or are owed. However, now the company is in administration, those who have paid off loans but are entitled to compensation have become unsecured creditors. They can only expect a fraction of the full compensation payout. Michael Ingram no longer owes money to WageDay Advance, but has borrowed from the company on several occasions in the past. Once one loan had been paid off, he took another - often bigger - one. His largest loans were for about Â£700. The 32-year-old full-time dad submitted a complaint in November that he had been mis-sold loans. He was contacted by the company to say it would not be able to process that complaint within the eight weeks stipulated by regulators. He was still waiting when the company went into administration. ""My complaint has not been resolved. I want some closure. I am optimistic, but I am not holding my breath,"" he said. WageDay Advance and Juo Loans were the brand names of CURO Transatlantic Limited, which went into administration in February. It had been one of the middle-ranking payday lenders operating in the UK, with most customers applying for loans online or through their smartphones from WageDay. In 2017, it won an industry award when it was named the best short-term loan provider. But many loans had been mis-sold to people who could not afford to pay them back, had loans rolled over, or had multiple loans with other providers. Thousands of these customers complained, many via claims management companies. The company built a claims calculator, which has estimated that current and former customers could be entitled to up to Â£223m in compensation, including interest. An estimated 330,000 people are expected still to have eligible claims for compensation. Successful claims made last year had an average payout of Â£850. The firm collapsed as it was unable to cope with the cost of dealing with these complaints and the potential payouts. Now administrators from KPMG are using that calculator to determine how much individual customers still owe, after compensation is subtracted. Calculations are also being made to work out compensation entitlement for each former borrower who has already paid off their loans. Claims firms 'will disappear at worst time' Wonga: Fourfold rise in compensation claimant estimate These individuals are now receiving emails, and accompanying text messages, outlining their entitlement, or new balance if they are still paying back loans. The emails carry the logo of the administrators, KPMG, and WageDay Advance and Juo Loans. However, recipients must reply to claim the compensation that has been calculated. The number of claims will determine how much is eventually paid out, but it will only be a fraction of the full amount. Anyone with outstanding loans will still have to pay off the balance after compensation has been subtracted, although fees and interest have been permanently frozen. Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes theDebt Camel blog,external, said the total compensation bill reflected the ""huge amount of interest many desperate people ended up paying"". ""Payday loans are supposed to be short term borrowing. But too often Wageday Advance customers were caught in the payday loan trap for months and even years, only able to repay a loan if they borrowed again soon after,"" she said. ""Wageday Advance were a medium-size payday lender. It would be interesting to know if the other lenders have worked out how much they should be paying in refunds to customers given unaffordable loans."" About 60,000 loans - almost entirely recent loans without any compensation entitlement - were sold off to Shelby Finance Limited, and will continue as normal. Customers can check if they are one of those transferred on theWageDay website,external. Fears over the level of personal debt built up by individuals continues to concern charities. In its annual report, published on Wednesday, debt charity StepChange said there had been a ""small, but worrying"" rise in the number of people seeking help who had payday, or high-cost and short-term, loans. Some 26% of new female clients and 35% of new male clients, aged under 25, had this kind of debt, a much higher level than older age groups. Overall, the charity said it had seen a consistent rise in single parents seeking help, Some 85% of them were women. In 2018, 23% of those who took debt advice were single parents, up from 21.5% in 2017 and from 18% since 2014. Single parents account for only 6% of the UK population. ""While debt can strike at any age, on average our clients are getting younger. It is important that policymakers work to help turn the tide and prevent debt becoming an inevitable rite of passage for young adults,"" said Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange.

"Woman staged fall to claim paymentFarida Ashraf tripped over a crate placed by accomplices and tried to claim Â£3,000 for injuries.Leeds & West Yorkshire","Two women were seen on CCTV moving a crate of orange juice cartons, with Farida Ashraf later tripping over it A woman who staged a fall over a crate in a Bradford store in order to make a bogus injury claim has been given a suspended prison sentence for fraud. Farida Ashraf, 41, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was seen on CCTV tripping over the crate in 2013 after two accomplices had placed it on the floor. She said she had suffered multiple injuries, but a civil court ruled the claim was ""fundamentally dishonest"". The case against her at Bradford Crown Court was brought by the insurers. It is thought to be the first private prosecution of its kind. The judge suspended her 21-month jail term for two years. Latest news and updates from Yorkshire Ashraf, of Staincliffe Crescent, was seen tripping over orange juice cartons at the Al-Halal premises on Woodhead Road and waited for eight or nine months before submitting an injury claim for about Â£3,000, the court heard. Nicholas Lumley QC, prosecuting, said she had hoped the CCTV would have been erased by then, but a suspicious member of staff had kept hold of the footage. One of the two accomplices, who have never been identified, was seen taking a photograph of the crate on the floor shortly before Ashraf fell. Ashraf claimed to have suffered injuries to her shoulder, shin, calf and hip, but a judge dismissed the claim in 2016 after an inquiry by insurance company Aviva. Aviva pursued a private prosecution, resulting in Ashraf admitting a fraud charge in March, Mr Lumley said. ""It is, we think, the first private prosecution arising out of a public liability insurance claim,"" he said. Sentencing Ashraf, Judge David Hatton QC said: ""You no doubt anticipated that the insurance company of the supermarket would pay up with little or no questions. Happily they did not."" After considering documentation about Ashraf's health difficulties and her caring role for her mother, sister and daughter, the judge suspended the jail term and gave her a six-month curfew order.
