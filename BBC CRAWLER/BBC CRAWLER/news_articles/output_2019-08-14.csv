"'UK must accept US food standards in trade deal'Fears over practices like chlorine-washing chicken are unfounded, says the head of America's farm lobby.Business","Zippy Duvall has been a farmer for 34 years The UK must accept US food standards as part of any future trade deal with Washington, the head of America's farming lobby has said. Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said US farmers were keen to trade with their British ""friends"". But he said fears over practices such as washing chicken in chlorine and using genetically modified (GM) crops were not ""science-based"". The US has said the UK will be""first in line"" for a trade deal after Brexit. But some fear the UK will have to compromise on standards currently enshrined in EU law in order to secure a deal with Washington. This video can not be played How would a no-deal Brexit affect your chicken dinner? Mr Duvall, himself a poultry farmer in Georgia, said he wanted to have ""a conversation"" about US food standards given the concerns in the UK. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Bolton How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? One of the most controversial practices is washing chicken with chlorine to kill germs, which is banned in the EU. This is not because the wash itself is harmful but over fears that treating meat with chlorine at the end allows poorer hygiene elsewhere in the production process. ""You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,"" Mr Duvall told the BBC's Today programme. ""So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away. ""If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that,"" he added. In London this week, Donald Trump's national security advisor John Bolton suggested that the US could strike trade deals with the UK after Brexit on a ""sector-by -sector basis"" to speed up the process. But asked whether he could envisage a trade deal with the UK that did not include agriculture, Mr Duvall said it would be seen as a betrayal by US farmers. ""To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that's where a big part of our population lives."" John Bolton said the UK would be ""first in line"" for a trade deal after Brexit. He also dismissed concerns that a deal would expose British farmers to harmful competition from much larger US farms with lower production costs. Mr Duvall said the British public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to. ""A lot of our farmers don't understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don't want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it's grown at."" Separately, Mr Duvall said that President Donald Trump's trade war with China had created the ""perfect storm"" for US farmers, who were already suffering after a series of natural disasters devastated crops in some areas. Since 2018, the US and China have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods and Beijing has specifically targeted US agricultural products such as soya beans. It has led to a sharp drop in US farm exports to China and forced the Trump administration to pay subsidies to support American farmers. . However, Mr Duvall told the BBC that despite this, US farmers still supported Mr Trump's approach to China and viewed the ""short term pain"" as worth it. ""Historically, even though agriculture and trade have been growing all around the world it hasn't kept up to the pace that it should have as the middle class have been rising up, especially in Asia, and we think that we ought to have the opportunity to have a bigger piece of that market,"" he said. ""[US farmers] all will tell you that... they still support the president in his efforts to come up with fair trade for the farmers here in America.""

'No chance of US deal' if Brexit hits Irish accord,"This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi: The woman Republicans love to hate A US-UK trade deal will not get through Congress if Brexit undermines the Good Friday Agreement, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives has said. Democrat Nancy Pelosi, whose party controls the House, said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to endanger the Irish peace deal. Her comments came after the US national security adviser said the UK would be ""first in line"" for a trade deal. John Bolton spoke after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Bolton Who is John Bolton? The reimposition of frontier controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without mutual agreement on 31 October - a so-called ""hard Brexit"" - is seen as a threat to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of bloodshed in Northern Ireland. ""Whatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday Agreement, including the seamless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland,"" Ms Pelosi said in a statement on Wednesday. Mr Bolton said on Tuesday that the Trump administration supported a no-deal Brexit, and added Washington would propose an accelerated series of trade deals in the event of one. He said these could be done on a ""sector-by-sector"" basis, with an agreement on manufacturing made first. A trade deal for financial services and agriculture would not be the first to be agreed, he added. What trade deals has the UK done so far? Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? Asked whether his proposed plan would follow World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, Mr Bolton said ""our trade negotiators seem to think it is"". He said there would be enthusiastic bipartisan support in Congress for speedy ratification at each stage. Mr Johnson said there were ""all sorts"" of opportunities for UK business in the US, particularly service companies, but the negotiations will be a ""tough old haggle"". However, critics warn that the UK will have to give in to some US demands in return for any trade agreement. The EU currently bans chlorine-washed chicken products on welfare grounds Former UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who served under a Labour government, described Mr Bolton as ""dangerously bellicose"". He suggested the UK would have to agree to some US demands, for example allowing imports of US chlorine-washed chicken. ""This is a highly transactional administrationâ¦ you don't get something for nothing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Lewis Lukens, a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in London and former acting US ambassador, said Mr Bolton was aligned to President Trump's ""America first agenda"" and would be making ""strong demands"" on the UK to back the US position on issues like China, Iran and Chinese tech giant Huawei. Mr Johnson is expected to have his first face-to-face meeting as prime minister with Mr Trump later this month at the G7 summit in France.

US share markets tumble as recession fears grow,"Global stock markets fell around the world as concerns about the US-China trade war and the global economy prompted investors to dump shares. The three main US stock markets closed 3% lower overnight, European stocks fell across the board, while Asian stock markets opened lower. Weak data from Germany and China on Wednesday helped fuel a rush for safe assets like bonds and gold. Bond market moves pointed to possible recessions in major economies. The US central bank also came under renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump for not doing enough to support the world's largest economy. There are concerns that renewed attacks by Mr Trump on the Federal Reserve could erode investor confidence on its ability to make independent decisions. Analyst Oliver Pursche, from financial services company Bruderman, said the global picture was precarious. ""What's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening with Brexit and the trade war, it's all a mess,"" the chief market strategist said. ""Every central bank around the world is trying to prop up economies and every politician around the world is trying to destroy economies."" Are markets signalling that a recession is due? German economy slips back into negative growth News that Germany's GDP contracted in the second quarter, and that China's industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low, had already spooked markets in Europe. The FTSE 100 closed more than 1% lower, while in Germany and France the markets finished more than 2% lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped some 2% in early trading on Thursday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened 1.4% lower. Both later regained some ground.Disruptions related to pro-democracy protests have also weighed on the stock marketin Hong Kong. Another worry was that bond markets are flashing recession warnings. The yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds inverted for the first time since June 2007. This means investor appetite for safety is such that they are willing to get lower returns for holding bonds for a longer period. Usually investors demand higher returns for holding bonds for longer due to the risks involved with parking your money away for a long time. Historically, such bond movements have been a reliable indicator of possible recessions, and preceded the last global downturn more than 10 years ago. The UK bond yield curve also inverted for the first time since 2008, while the yield gap between 10-year and 2-year German government bonds was at its tightest since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the CBOE volatility index - the so-called fear index - jumped higher, and spot gold prices rose. On Wednesday, Mr Trump again attempted to deflect the market turmoil onto the US Federal Reserve and its interest rate policy, calling Fed chief Jerome Powell ""clueless"". In raising interest rates four times last year ""the Federal Reserve acted far too quickly, and now is very, very late"" in cutting borrowing costs, the president tweeted. ""Too bad, so much to gain on the upside!"" Recent presidents have avoided commenting on Fed policy, in a sign of respect for the bank's independence. Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The recession signal from the bond market will only heap pressure on the Federal Reserve to give the president what he wants - more rate cuts. Wall Street certainly thinks it's inevitable, pricing in a cut in September. Last month, America's central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008. That failed to impress Donald Trump who berated Fed Chair Jay Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough. And as the havoc on the financial markets was unfolding, President Trump was back on twitter defending his administration's tariff war with China and attacking the Fed, calling the chairman clueless. But if Mr Trump gets what he wants, it may come at a steep price. The Fed's recent rate cut didn't buoy the markets like it used to. So it's not clear that more rate cuts will blunt the damage from his ongoing trade war with China which is creating uncertainty and raising costs for businesses and consumers. Earlier on Wednesday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network the central bank should cut rates by half a percentage point ""as soon as possible"", an action he claimed would lead to stock markets soaring. Despite the US delaying the 1 September imposition of tariffs on some Chinese imports into the US, it has done little to ease concerns. ""The challenge is that Trump's trade policy has proven so erratic that you cannot relieve the sense of uncertainty,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. As of September last year, the US central bank had a relatively rosy outlook for the economy, expecting that the stimulus from the Trump administration's massive $1.5tn tax cut package and spending in 2018 would sustain growth and justify steadily higher interest rates. Mr Trump wants to make the economy a central part of his case for his 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview scheduled to air on Fox Business Network on Friday, former Fed chief Janet Yellen said she felt the US economy remained ""strong enough"" to avoid a downturn, but ""the odds have clearly risen and they are higher than I'm frankly comfortable with"".

Sala and plane pilot 'exposed to carbon monoxide',"This video can not be played Emiliano Sala signed for Cardiff City two days before the crash Footballer Emiliano Sala was exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide prior to a fatal plane crash in the English Channel, a report has revealed. Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, crashed on 21 January while travelling from Nantes in France to Cardiff. Toxicology tests on Sala's body showed CO levels in his blood were so great it could have caused a seizure, unconsciousness or a heart attack. The Sala family said there should be a detailed examination of the plane. Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, has still not been found. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said,externalSala's blood had a COHb (carboxyhaemoglobin - which forms in red blood cells upon contact with carbon monoxide) level of 58%. At this level, symptoms would include include seizure, unconsciousness and heart attack. It added: ""A COHb level of more than 50% in an otherwise healthy person is generally considered to be potentially fatal."" It is likely Mr Ibbotson would also have been exposed to carbon monoxide. Sala's dad dies three months after son Plane body identified as footballer Sala Emiliano Sala - born in Argentina, made in France Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson went missing on 21 January Piston engine aircraft such as the Piper Malibu involved in the crash produce high levels of carbon monoxide. The gas is normally conveyed away from the aircraft through the exhaust system, but poor sealing or leaks into the heating and ventilation system can enable it to enter the cabin. Several devices are available to alert pilots over the presence of carbon monoxide - they are not mandatory but can ""alert pilots or passengers to a potentially deadly threat"". Retired pilot and aviation safety commentator Terry Tozer said the finding was ""a surprise"", adding: ""It shows you can never tell what the root cause of an accident is until the investigators have dug into the nitty gritty. ""How and why did the carbon monoxide get in? Presumably through the exhaust systemâ¦ the fumes get into the ventilation system."" Mr Tozer said he had never encountered anything similar before and would not expect carbon monoxide poisoning to be a big risk on such an aircraft. He added: ""It's not like a car where you can open the windows. It can creep up on you, and that could be a slow process. ""It's odourless so you wouldn't necessarily know you were being fed these fumes unless you had a detection system - but that isn't mandatory for this type of aircraft."" Mr Tozer agreed with the Sala family that salvaging the wreckage and examining it would be the only way to find how the leak occurred. ""Aviation accidents usually come about when a number of factors accumulate. ""So, we start with the pilot and his lack of qualifications, then circumstances that delay the flight to night time, possibly feeling pressure the pilot then takes off when he shouldn't and finds weather that he is struggling with and the final straw is that his ability is impaired by poisoning from a leak in the exhaust and he loses control."" Striker Sala signed for Cardiff just two days before the plane crash AAIB investigators are working with aircraft manufacturers in the USA  - where the Piper Malibu was registered - to look at how carbon monoxide could have entered the cabin. ""Operational, technical and human factors"" will be considered. Geraint Herbert, the AAIB's lead inspector for this investigation, said: ""Symptoms at low exposure levels [to carbon monoxide] can be drowsiness and dizziness, but as the exposure level increases, it can lead to unconsciousness and death. ""The investigation continues to look into a wide range of areas in relation to this accident, but in particular we are looking at the potential ways in which carbon monoxide can enter the cabin in this type of aircraft."" Wednesday's bulletin was the second to be released following the crash, but the investigation is not expected to report its full findings until early 2020. Cardiff City said it was ""concerned"" by the report, adding: ""We continue to believe that those who were instrumental in arranging its [the plane's] usage are held to account for this tragedy."" In an interview in February, football agent Willie McKay, who commissioned the flight,told the BBC he and his family paid for it. He was not involved, he said, in selecting the plane or the pilot and it was not a cost-share arrangement. The plane disappeared from radar near Guernsey on its way to Cardiff from Nantes Daniel Machover of Hickman & Rose solicitors, who represents Sala's family, said: ""The family believe that a detailed technical examination of the plane is necessary. ""The family and the public need to know how the carbon monoxide was able to enter the cabin. Future air safety rests on knowing as much as possible on this issue."" Mr Ibbotson's wife Nora also said recovering the plane could help find answers. She told Sky News it had never occurred to her that carbon monoxide could potentially have played a part. She called it ""a massive shock"", adding: ""You can't smell it. You can't see it. It's lethal, they wouldn't have known. So it's nothing to do with the flying or anything like that, it's down to the aircraft."" The AAIB responded to calls for the plane to be retrieved by saying it filmed substantial video evidence at the scene after the aircraft was found in February. ""It was not possible at the time to recover the wreckage,"" it said. ""We have carefully considered the feasibility and merits of returning to attempt to recover the wreckage. In this case, we consider that it will not add significantly to the investigation and we will identify the correct safety issues through other means."" The statement said after a ""violent impact with the sea"", the wreckage may not even give definitive answers and the reasons for not retrieving the plane had been explained in detail to both the Sala and  Ibbotson families. By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News Carbon monoxide is an invisible killer with no smell, colour or taste. It is deadly because the gas starves the body of vital oxygen. Your red blood cells contain haemoglobin - its job is to pick up oxygen from the lungs and transport it around the body. The problem is haemoglobin prefers carbon monoxide and binds to the gas incredibly tightly - the more carbon monoxide the body is exposed to, the less oxygen it can carry. This has consequences throughout the body, but highly active tissues in the heart and brain are affected first. Carbon monoxide poisoning affects balance, vision and eventually consciousness. High doses are outright deadly. The NHS says 30% carboxyhaemoglobin is a ""severe exposure"" - Sala's carboxyhaemoglobin level was 58%. The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu The plane carrying the Argentine striker - Cardiff City's Â£15m record signing - lost contact with radar near Guernsey. Sala signed for Cardiff on 19 January - just two days before the crash - and had returned to Nantes to say goodbye to his former teammates. An official search was called off on 24 Januaryafter Guernsey's harbour master said the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". But an online appeal started by Sala's agent raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for a private search, led by marine scientist and oceanographer David Mearns. Sala's bodywas recovered from the wreckageof the Piper Malibu N264DB on 7 February and subsequently repatriated to Argentina. Mr Ibbotson has still not been found, but it has since been discoveredhe was not qualified to fly at night. While Sala never played for Cardiff City, fans left hundreds of tributes to him outside the team's stadium after his death Details released about Mr Ibbotson on Wednesday showed he had about 3,500 hours of flying experience - of which 30 were flying similar types of aircraft. He had flown for about 20 hours in the 90 days before the crash, and seven hours in the previous 28 days. Since Sala's death, Nantes and Cardiff City have been involved in a dispute over the transfer fee after the Welsh clubclaimed the deal was not legally binding.

Johnson: Brexit opponents 'collaborating' with EU,"Boris Johnson has accused MPs ""who think they can block Brexit"" of a ""terrible collaboration"" with the EU. The prime minister said the EU had become less willing to compromise on a new deal with the UK because of the opposition to leaving in Parliament. He said this increased the likelihood of the UK being ""forced to leave with a no-deal"" in October. But some MPs said his claim they were collaborating with the EU was a ""wicked lie"" and a ""big deflection exercise"". The EU has said the agreement struck by Theresa May is the only deal possible. Speaking during a Facebook event hosted at Downing Street, Mr Johnson said he wanted to leave with a deal but ""we need our European friends to compromise"". ""There's a terrible kind of collaboration as it were, going on between people who think they can block Brexit in Parliament and our European friends,"" he added. ""The more they think there's a chance that Brexit can be blocked in Parliament, the more adamant they are in sticking to their position."" Hammond: PM's demands 'wreck' new Brexit deal Ministers expect no-deal challenge next month Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? His comments come after former Chancellor Philip Hammond said the PM's negotiating stanceincreased the chance of a no-dealbefore the latest Brexit deadline of 31 October. Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a no-deal exit would be ""just as much a betrayal of the referendum result as not leaving at all"". A No 10 source accused Mr Hammond of undermining the UK's negotiating stance, and said he ""did everything he could"" to block preparations for leaving whilst he was in office. The former chancellor rejected this suggestion in atweet,external, saying he wanted to deliver Brexit ""and voted to do so three times"". Labour MP Mary Creagh said Mr Johnson's accusation that MPs were collaborating with the European Union was a ""wicked lie"". ""MPs trying to stop his catastrophic no-deal Brexit are true patriots,"" shetweeted,external. Liberal Democrat MPChuka Umunna said,externalMr Johnson's claim was a ""big deflection exercise to divert attention from the damage his Brexit policy is already doing"". He said: ""This is fatuous nonsense from a prime minister flailing about trying to find people to blame for the almighty mess he and his Vote Leave government has created."" Boris Johnson didn't name Philip Hammond when he said there was ""collaboration"" between MPs trying to block Brexit and the EU - a stark and controversial word to use. The prime minister says EU leaders need to believe Parliament cannot thwart a no-deal Brexit, and only then will they bend. No 10 knows Mr Hammond is not the only senior Tory resolved to try to stop a no-deal departure if that is what Boris Johnson plumps for. Other ex-cabinet ministers intend to join the ranks of Tory backbenchers and opposition MPs determined to act. But with only 22 parliamentary sitting days until the UK is set to leave and with no obvious single mechanism for MPs to stop a no deal at the end of October, it might be very hard for a cross-party alliance to park tribal loyalty, mobilise and block No 10 before the Brexit clock expires. Mr Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU with a deal, but the UK must leave ""do or die"" by the end of October. He wants the EU to ditch theIrish border backstop planfrom the deal negotiated by Mrs May, which was rejected three times by Parliament. But the EU has continued to insist the policy - intended to guarantee there will not be a hard Irish border after Brexit - must remain and cannot be changed. Many of those who voted against the deal had concerns over the backstop, which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Mr Hammond said the prime minister's demand for the backstop to be entirely removed from the deal meant a no-deal was inevitable on the current deadline. He said that agreeing to changes now would ""fragment"" the EU, adding: ""they are not going to take that risk"". ""Pivoting to say the backstop has to go in its entirety - a huge chunk of the withdrawal agreement just scrapped - is effectively a wrecking tactic,"" he told Today. This video can not be played The ex-chancellor says removing the Irish border 'backstop' is a ""wrecking tactic"" On Thursday Downing Street said it expects a group of MPs to try to block a no-deal Brexit by attempting to pass legislation when Parliament returns next month. A No 10 source said they expected the challenge to come in the second week of September, when MPs are are due to debate a report on Northern Ireland. The source assumes the EU will wait until after that date before engaging in further negotiations.

How no-deal could affect you,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external. The process could take up to four months. Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,the government has warned that it may become more expensive.,external Full government travel advice,external How will it affect my holidays to Europe? While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU. The government has announced a further Â£434m of funding and other measures, including: extra warehouse space for medicines securing additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone building buffer stocks booking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment making changes to regulatory requirements strengthening processes to deal with shortages However, the National Audit Office has said there are still""significant"" gapsin the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes. Government advice on medicine supply,external Should NHS patients be worried? About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries. The UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now. In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"". The government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing Â£138m. It advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevantcountry advice pages.,external Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country. However, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority. Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries. These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights. Full government advice for UK nationals living in the EU,external How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Drivers UK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK. There are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum. Statisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline. If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has atool to find out what you need to do and when.,external Government advice on applying for settled and pre-settled status,external Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has warned thatthe UK will deport EU citizensafter Brexit if they do not apply for the right to remain in time. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure. As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal. But bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder. Will the value of your home change in 2019? Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The government has also announced Â£344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations. Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal?

UK universities say they would expecta similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.,external The government and the EU have agreed thatpeople who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them,external. This is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK. The government has also issued a ""guarantee"" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun.

A-level grade boundaries leak ahead of results day,"Details of A-level grade boundaries for all papers set by two exam boards have been leaked on social media a day before the results are published. The documents reveal that A-level maths candidates needed little more than half marks to get a grade A in papers set by both Pearson/Edexcel and OCR. Exam boards send marking schemes to schools in confidence ahead of the results to help them prepare students. They said confidentiality was usually respected. A-level students are due to get their results on Thursday. The leaked Edexcel documents,first reported in the Daily Telegraph,external, show A-level maths candidates needed 55% to get the A grade, while candidates with the OCR board needed 54%. Edexcel's biology students needed 56% (167 marks out of 300) for an A, while OCR's candidates needed 59% (158 out of 270). In physics, candidates needed 59% (176 out of 300) for a grade A with Edexcel, while with OCR, this was 76% (204 out of 270). In English literature, candidates with the OCR board needed 89% for an A grade - significantly higher than those with Edexcel, who needed 69% (208 marks out of 300) to get A. This summer is the first time that grades for new-specification A-level maths are being awarded to the vast majority of students. The exam was reported by students to be very challenging, but the exam board had said before the leak emerged that it was clear the paper was of an appropriate standard. Exam boards set grade boundaries once all the results are in. They take into account the predicted achievement levels of the cohort taking the exam and the difficulty of the paper, in an attempt to keep standards the same from year to year. Responding to the leak, a spokesman for Pearson said: ""Our systems are working as they should and the information was shared today via a password-protected, secure website. ""Boards do ask schools not to share this widely to avoid unnecessary stress for students awaiting their results. ""Schools are trusted to treat the info confidentially on behalf of their students - and the vast majority do."" Investigation after A-level paper leaked 'I cried in the car on the way home' A spokesman for Cambridge Assessment, which owns the OCR board, said: ""We provide schools and colleges with results information, including grade boundaries, the day before results day on a special site which is accessible to exams officers. ""Grade boundaries are then released by schools to their students on results day and we publish them on our website. ""We do it this way to minimise the chance of students feeling anxious if they see grade boundaries without their results â which can lead some to jump to the wrong conclusion."" General secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders Geoff Barton said: ""We are extremely disappointed if grade boundaries have been leaked ahead of results day."" But he said was a pointless exercise because the purpose of grade boundaries was to account for differences in the difficulty of papers so that students were not disadvantaged from one year to the next. ""We would urge students against losing sleep over grade boundaries and to wait for their results tomorrow.""

Chicken takeaway boxes warn of knife crime danger,"Chicken boxes featuring warnings about the dangers of carrying a knife have been sent to takeaways in England and Wales as part of a government campaign. More than 321,000 boxes will replace standard packaging at outlets including Chicken Cottage, Dixy Chicken and Morley's, the Home Office said. Real life stories of young people who chose positive activities over carrying a weapon are printed inside the boxes. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the plan was ""crude"" and ""offensive"". However, Home Secretary Priti Patel defended the campaign, accusing Ms Abbott of ""playing politics with knife crime"". The key facts about rising knife crime 'Thousands' of 14-year-olds carry knives Printed inside the special boxes, part of the Home Office's #knifefree campaign, are first-hand accounts of young people who have opted to pursue pastimes such as boxing or music instead of carrying a knife. Both independent and branch-owned chicken shops will carry the new boxes, and many will also house digital screens highlighting the campaign. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse says they ""will bring home to thousands of young people the tragic consequences of carrying a knife and challenge the idea that it makes you safer"". But the government has been accused of racial stereotyping. David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Is this some kind of joke?! Why have you chosen chicken shops? What's next, #KnifeFree watermelons?"" Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent with the Metropolitan Police, said: ""This initiative seeks to target chicken shops because the assumption is that's where young black people go. ""There's a racial element to it - it stereotypes people, it's patronising and I can understand why people see it as racist."" Ms Abbotttweeted,external: ""Instead of investing in a public health approach to violent crime, the Home Office have opted for yet another crude, offensive and probably expensive campaign. ""They would do better to invest in our communities not demonise them."" Courtney Barrett, who runs his own knife amnesty in east London told BBC News the scheme was a ""step in the right direction"" but stressed that it should not just involve chicken shops. ""The public need to be made aware not all knife crime is carried out by young people, black people and gangs,"" the founder of Binning Knives Saves Lives said. Recent figuresshowed most perpetrators of knife crime were over the age of 18. The special boxes feature real life stories of young people Meanwhile, Patsy McKie, who founded Mothers Against Violence in Manchester after her son was shot dead, said sharing stories in this way was not enough to discourage young people from carrying knives. ""Just putting it on a box isn't going to stop it,"" she said. ""Someone who is carrying a knife to feel safe isn't going to put it down."" Ms McKie added: ""You often have to go through an experience to change your views."" Peter Grigg, director of external affairs at the Children's Society, is urging more government investment ""in education for young people about knife crime"" as well as in ""early intervention and prevention"". On Twitter Jeffrey Boakye described it as a ""mess"" and said there was a ""national crisis in the perception of black kids in urban areas"". Allow Twitter content?

A-level grade boundaries leak ahead of results dayTwo exam boards' A-level maths candidates had to score just 55% to get an A in this year's paper.Family & Education,"Details of A-level grade boundaries for all papers set by two exam boards have been leaked on social media a day before the results are published. The documents reveal that A-level maths candidates needed little more than half marks to get a grade A in papers set by both Pearson/Edexcel and OCR. Exam boards send marking schemes to schools in confidence ahead of the results to help them prepare students. They said confidentiality was usually respected. A-level students are due to get their results on Thursday. The leaked Edexcel documents,first reported in the Daily Telegraph,external, show A-level maths candidates needed 55% to get the A grade, while candidates with the OCR board needed 54%. Edexcel's biology students needed 56% (167 marks out of 300) for an A, while OCR's candidates needed 59% (158 out of 270). In physics, candidates needed 59% (176 out of 300) for a grade A with Edexcel, while with OCR, this was 76% (204 out of 270). In English literature, candidates with the OCR board needed 89% for an A grade - significantly higher than those with Edexcel, who needed 69% (208 marks out of 300) to get A. This summer is the first time that grades for new-specification A-level maths are being awarded to the vast majority of students. The exam was reported by students to be very challenging, but the exam board had said before the leak emerged that it was clear the paper was of an appropriate standard. Exam boards set grade boundaries once all the results are in. They take into account the predicted achievement levels of the cohort taking the exam and the difficulty of the paper, in an attempt to keep standards the same from year to year. Responding to the leak, a spokesman for Pearson said: ""Our systems are working as they should and the information was shared today via a password-protected, secure website. ""Boards do ask schools not to share this widely to avoid unnecessary stress for students awaiting their results. ""Schools are trusted to treat the info confidentially on behalf of their students - and the vast majority do."" Investigation after A-level paper leaked 'I cried in the car on the way home' A spokesman for Cambridge Assessment, which owns the OCR board, said: ""We provide schools and colleges with results information, including grade boundaries, the day before results day on a special site which is accessible to exams officers. ""Grade boundaries are then released by schools to their students on results day and we publish them on our website. ""We do it this way to minimise the chance of students feeling anxious if they see grade boundaries without their results â which can lead some to jump to the wrong conclusion."" General secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders Geoff Barton said: ""We are extremely disappointed if grade boundaries have been leaked ahead of results day."" But he said was a pointless exercise because the purpose of grade boundaries was to account for differences in the difficulty of papers so that students were not disadvantaged from one year to the next. ""We would urge students against losing sleep over grade boundaries and to wait for their results tomorrow.""

"'No chance of US deal' if Brexit hits Irish accordCongress will block a UK trade deal if Brexit harms the Good Friday Agreement, key US Democrat says.US & Canada","This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi: The woman Republicans love to hate A US-UK trade deal will not get through Congress if Brexit undermines the Good Friday Agreement, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives has said. Democrat Nancy Pelosi, whose party controls the House, said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to endanger the Irish peace deal. Her comments came after the US national security adviser said the UK would be ""first in line"" for a trade deal. John Bolton spoke after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Bolton Who is John Bolton? The reimposition of frontier controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without mutual agreement on 31 October - a so-called ""hard Brexit"" - is seen as a threat to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of bloodshed in Northern Ireland. ""Whatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday Agreement, including the seamless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland,"" Ms Pelosi said in a statement on Wednesday. Mr Bolton said on Tuesday that the Trump administration supported a no-deal Brexit, and added Washington would propose an accelerated series of trade deals in the event of one. He said these could be done on a ""sector-by-sector"" basis, with an agreement on manufacturing made first. A trade deal for financial services and agriculture would not be the first to be agreed, he added. What trade deals has the UK done so far? Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? Asked whether his proposed plan would follow World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, Mr Bolton said ""our trade negotiators seem to think it is"". He said there would be enthusiastic bipartisan support in Congress for speedy ratification at each stage. Mr Johnson said there were ""all sorts"" of opportunities for UK business in the US, particularly service companies, but the negotiations will be a ""tough old haggle"". However, critics warn that the UK will have to give in to some US demands in return for any trade agreement. The EU currently bans chlorine-washed chicken products on welfare grounds Former UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who served under a Labour government, described Mr Bolton as ""dangerously bellicose"". He suggested the UK would have to agree to some US demands, for example allowing imports of US chlorine-washed chicken. ""This is a highly transactional administrationâ¦ you don't get something for nothing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Lewis Lukens, a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in London and former acting US ambassador, said Mr Bolton was aligned to President Trump's ""America first agenda"" and would be making ""strong demands"" on the UK to back the US position on issues like China, Iran and Chinese tech giant Huawei. Mr Johnson is expected to have his first face-to-face meeting as prime minister with Mr Trump later this month at the G7 summit in France.

"US share markets tumble as recession fears growWall Street slides 3% on trade war fears, as president Trump calls US central bank chief ""clueless"".Business","Global stock markets fell around the world as concerns about the US-China trade war and the global economy prompted investors to dump shares. The three main US stock markets closed 3% lower overnight, European stocks fell across the board, while Asian stock markets opened lower. Weak data from Germany and China on Wednesday helped fuel a rush for safe assets like bonds and gold. Bond market moves pointed to possible recessions in major economies. The US central bank also came under renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump for not doing enough to support the world's largest economy. There are concerns that renewed attacks by Mr Trump on the Federal Reserve could erode investor confidence on its ability to make independent decisions. Analyst Oliver Pursche, from financial services company Bruderman, said the global picture was precarious. ""What's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening with Brexit and the trade war, it's all a mess,"" the chief market strategist said. ""Every central bank around the world is trying to prop up economies and every politician around the world is trying to destroy economies."" Are markets signalling that a recession is due? German economy slips back into negative growth News that Germany's GDP contracted in the second quarter, and that China's industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low, had already spooked markets in Europe. The FTSE 100 closed more than 1% lower, while in Germany and France the markets finished more than 2% lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped some 2% in early trading on Thursday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened 1.4% lower. Both later regained some ground.Disruptions related to pro-democracy protests have also weighed on the stock marketin Hong Kong. Another worry was that bond markets are flashing recession warnings. The yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds inverted for the first time since June 2007. This means investor appetite for safety is such that they are willing to get lower returns for holding bonds for a longer period. Usually investors demand higher returns for holding bonds for longer due to the risks involved with parking your money away for a long time. Historically, such bond movements have been a reliable indicator of possible recessions, and preceded the last global downturn more than 10 years ago. The UK bond yield curve also inverted for the first time since 2008, while the yield gap between 10-year and 2-year German government bonds was at its tightest since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the CBOE volatility index - the so-called fear index - jumped higher, and spot gold prices rose. On Wednesday, Mr Trump again attempted to deflect the market turmoil onto the US Federal Reserve and its interest rate policy, calling Fed chief Jerome Powell ""clueless"". In raising interest rates four times last year ""the Federal Reserve acted far too quickly, and now is very, very late"" in cutting borrowing costs, the president tweeted. ""Too bad, so much to gain on the upside!"" Recent presidents have avoided commenting on Fed policy, in a sign of respect for the bank's independence. Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The recession signal from the bond market will only heap pressure on the Federal Reserve to give the president what he wants - more rate cuts. Wall Street certainly thinks it's inevitable, pricing in a cut in September. Last month, America's central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008. That failed to impress Donald Trump who berated Fed Chair Jay Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough. And as the havoc on the financial markets was unfolding, President Trump was back on twitter defending his administration's tariff war with China and attacking the Fed, calling the chairman clueless. But if Mr Trump gets what he wants, it may come at a steep price. The Fed's recent rate cut didn't buoy the markets like it used to. So it's not clear that more rate cuts will blunt the damage from his ongoing trade war with China which is creating uncertainty and raising costs for businesses and consumers. Earlier on Wednesday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network the central bank should cut rates by half a percentage point ""as soon as possible"", an action he claimed would lead to stock markets soaring. Despite the US delaying the 1 September imposition of tariffs on some Chinese imports into the US, it has done little to ease concerns. ""The challenge is that Trump's trade policy has proven so erratic that you cannot relieve the sense of uncertainty,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. As of September last year, the US central bank had a relatively rosy outlook for the economy, expecting that the stimulus from the Trump administration's massive $1.5tn tax cut package and spending in 2018 would sustain growth and justify steadily higher interest rates. Mr Trump wants to make the economy a central part of his case for his 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview scheduled to air on Fox Business Network on Friday, former Fed chief Janet Yellen said she felt the US economy remained ""strong enough"" to avoid a downturn, but ""the odds have clearly risen and they are higher than I'm frankly comfortable with"".

Chicken takeaway boxes warn of knife crime dangerMinisters want to dissuade young people from carrying weapons but critics say the plan is offensive.UK,"Chicken boxes featuring warnings about the dangers of carrying a knife have been sent to takeaways in England and Wales as part of a government campaign. More than 321,000 boxes will replace standard packaging at outlets including Chicken Cottage, Dixy Chicken and Morley's, the Home Office said. Real life stories of young people who chose positive activities over carrying a weapon are printed inside the boxes. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the plan was ""crude"" and ""offensive"". However, Home Secretary Priti Patel defended the campaign, accusing Ms Abbott of ""playing politics with knife crime"". The key facts about rising knife crime 'Thousands' of 14-year-olds carry knives Printed inside the special boxes, part of the Home Office's #knifefree campaign, are first-hand accounts of young people who have opted to pursue pastimes such as boxing or music instead of carrying a knife. Both independent and branch-owned chicken shops will carry the new boxes, and many will also house digital screens highlighting the campaign. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse says they ""will bring home to thousands of young people the tragic consequences of carrying a knife and challenge the idea that it makes you safer"". But the government has been accused of racial stereotyping. David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Is this some kind of joke?! Why have you chosen chicken shops? What's next, #KnifeFree watermelons?"" Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent with the Metropolitan Police, said: ""This initiative seeks to target chicken shops because the assumption is that's where young black people go. ""There's a racial element to it - it stereotypes people, it's patronising and I can understand why people see it as racist."" Ms Abbotttweeted,external: ""Instead of investing in a public health approach to violent crime, the Home Office have opted for yet another crude, offensive and probably expensive campaign. ""They would do better to invest in our communities not demonise them."" Courtney Barrett, who runs his own knife amnesty in east London told BBC News the scheme was a ""step in the right direction"" but stressed that it should not just involve chicken shops. ""The public need to be made aware not all knife crime is carried out by young people, black people and gangs,"" the founder of Binning Knives Saves Lives said. Recent figuresshowed most perpetrators of knife crime were over the age of 18. The special boxes feature real life stories of young people Meanwhile, Patsy McKie, who founded Mothers Against Violence in Manchester after her son was shot dead, said sharing stories in this way was not enough to discourage young people from carrying knives. ""Just putting it on a box isn't going to stop it,"" she said. ""Someone who is carrying a knife to feel safe isn't going to put it down."" Ms McKie added: ""You often have to go through an experience to change your views."" Peter Grigg, director of external affairs at the Children's Society, is urging more government investment ""in education for young people about knife crime"" as well as in ""early intervention and prevention"". On Twitter Jeffrey Boakye described it as a ""mess"" and said there was a ""national crisis in the perception of black kids in urban areas"". Allow Twitter content?

Are markets signalling that a recession is due?,"Financial markets have flashed a warning sign about the economic outlook for the UK and the US. It is known in the jargon as an ""inverted yield curve"". It means that it is cheaper for those countries' governments to borrow for 10 years than for two. It is an unusual development and it often comes before a recession or at least a significant slowdown in economic growth. Wall Street shares plunged on Wednesday, as investors' concerns about a potential recession were stoked by the news. The main US stock market indexes fell between 2.3% and 2.6%. Meanwhile in Europe London's FTSE 100 slipped 1.4%, Germany's Dax lost 2.2% and the French Cac 40 fell by 2.1%. German economy slips back into negative growth This warning sign is coming from the bond market, the place where governments and companies go to borrow money by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make certain payments in the future, usually a large one when the bond ""matures"" and smaller ones in the interim, typically every six months. How much investors pay for the bond determines the yield they will get - the higher the price, the lower the yield. One factor affecting the yield that investors want is how long they have to wait for the big final payment. Usually, a longer wait means they expect a higher yield. It compensates them for tying their money up for longer, when there is more risk that unexpected inflation could erode the value of their returns. What is unusual is that the yield on UK government bonds (gilts, as they are known) with two years to maturity went above the yield on the 10-year equivalent. The same thing happened in the US. It is seen as a sign that investors want the assured returns from holding a longer-term bond and are worried about the shorter-term outlook for the economy. Is the inverted yield curve reliable? According toeconomists at the US Federal Reserve,external: ""Periods with an inverted yield curve are reliably followed by economic slowdowns and almost always by a recession."" The time between the inversion and the onset of a recession is, however, not uniform. That said, there is something about the current situation that didn't apply to earlier episodes: quantitative easing, the policy pursued by many central banks after the financial crisis (and before, in the case of Japan) of buying financial assets, mainly government bonds. That had the effect of raising bond prices - which, remember is equivalent to reducing the yield from them. So QE may well be making a contribution to the yield curve inversion that is taking place now. The yield curve inversion does not tell us anything about what might be the specific reasons for any impending recession. This time, there are several possible candidates out there. The global trade conflict is a factor for many economies. Concerns held by many (though by no means all) businesses and investors about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit are a UK-specific issue that may be contributing. The UK has just recorded one quarter of declining economic activity, so the idea of an imminent recession is not at all fanciful, although the figures have been influenced by stockpiling ahead of planned Brexit dates and the subsequent rundown of those stocks. In the US, it would take a significant further slowdown to produce a recession. Germany has also registered a quarter of declining activity, according to new figures, so a recession could be under way there too. The yield curve for the German government is not inverted. But there is something else about government bonds there that is a clearly sign of a weak economic outlook: the fact that yields are below zero. In effect, investors pay the government to lend to it. That reflects the ultra-low interest rate policy of the European Central Bank, but it is also a sign of a weak economic outlook.

Share markets panic as recession fears grow,"Global stock markets fell around the world as concerns about the US-China trade war and the global economy prompted investors to dump shares. The three main US stock markets closed 3% lower overnight, European stocks fell across the board, while Asian stock markets opened lower. Weak data from Germany and China on Wednesday helped fuel a rush for safe assets like bonds and gold. Bond market moves pointed to possible recessions in major economies. The US central bank also came under renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump for not doing enough to support the world's largest economy. There are concerns that renewed attacks by Mr Trump on the Federal Reserve could erode investor confidence on its ability to make independent decisions. Analyst Oliver Pursche, from financial services company Bruderman, said the global picture was precarious. ""What's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening with Brexit and the trade war, it's all a mess,"" the chief market strategist said. ""Every central bank around the world is trying to prop up economies and every politician around the world is trying to destroy economies."" Are markets signalling that a recession is due? German economy slips back into negative growth News that Germany's GDP contracted in the second quarter, and that China's industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low, had already spooked markets in Europe. The FTSE 100 closed more than 1% lower, while in Germany and France the markets finished more than 2% lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped some 2% in early trading on Thursday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened 1.4% lower. Both later regained some ground.Disruptions related to pro-democracy protests have also weighed on the stock marketin Hong Kong. Another worry was that bond markets are flashing recession warnings. The yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds inverted for the first time since June 2007. This means investor appetite for safety is such that they are willing to get lower returns for holding bonds for a longer period. Usually investors demand higher returns for holding bonds for longer due to the risks involved with parking your money away for a long time. Historically, such bond movements have been a reliable indicator of possible recessions, and preceded the last global downturn more than 10 years ago. The UK bond yield curve also inverted for the first time since 2008, while the yield gap between 10-year and 2-year German government bonds was at its tightest since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the CBOE volatility index - the so-called fear index - jumped higher, and spot gold prices rose. On Wednesday, Mr Trump again attempted to deflect the market turmoil onto the US Federal Reserve and its interest rate policy, calling Fed chief Jerome Powell ""clueless"". In raising interest rates four times last year ""the Federal Reserve acted far too quickly, and now is very, very late"" in cutting borrowing costs, the president tweeted. ""Too bad, so much to gain on the upside!"" Recent presidents have avoided commenting on Fed policy, in a sign of respect for the bank's independence. Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The recession signal from the bond market will only heap pressure on the Federal Reserve to give the president what he wants - more rate cuts. Wall Street certainly thinks it's inevitable, pricing in a cut in September. Last month, America's central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008. That failed to impress Donald Trump who berated Fed Chair Jay Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough. And as the havoc on the financial markets was unfolding, President Trump was back on twitter defending his administration's tariff war with China and attacking the Fed, calling the chairman clueless. But if Mr Trump gets what he wants, it may come at a steep price. The Fed's recent rate cut didn't buoy the markets like it used to. So it's not clear that more rate cuts will blunt the damage from his ongoing trade war with China which is creating uncertainty and raising costs for businesses and consumers. Earlier on Wednesday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network the central bank should cut rates by half a percentage point ""as soon as possible"", an action he claimed would lead to stock markets soaring. Despite the US delaying the 1 September imposition of tariffs on some Chinese imports into the US, it has done little to ease concerns. ""The challenge is that Trump's trade policy has proven so erratic that you cannot relieve the sense of uncertainty,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. As of September last year, the US central bank had a relatively rosy outlook for the economy, expecting that the stimulus from the Trump administration's massive $1.5tn tax cut package and spending in 2018 would sustain growth and justify steadily higher interest rates. Mr Trump wants to make the economy a central part of his case for his 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview scheduled to air on Fox Business Network on Friday, former Fed chief Janet Yellen said she felt the US economy remained ""strong enough"" to avoid a downturn, but ""the odds have clearly risen and they are higher than I'm frankly comfortable with"".

"Hospital 'didn't listen' to stillbirth concernsKara Jones, who lost her baby son, says hospital staff ignored her pleas for an early delivery.Wales","This video can not be played ""He's gone... we've lost him"" A mother who lost her baby while giving birth said she was let down after staff at the hospital ""just didn't listen"". Arthur Wyn Jones died at Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen in March 2017. His mother Kara Jones, 27, said she had been pleading for an early delivery because she knew something was wrong. A report by Hywel Dda health board said ""numerous missed opportunities to acknowledge the complexity of the pregnancy"" were likely to have contributed to his death. The young couple have now received financial compensation and hope to move on. Living in Tre'r Ddol, Ceredigion, Ms Jones received her care during pregnancy at Bronglais Hospital in Abersytwyth. Coroners 'could investigate stillbirths' 'We'll never know if our son had a chance' 'I'm there to give them their memories' But because of her diabetes, she and her partner Sam Penfold, 29, had to make regular visits to Glangwili Hospital, which has a specialist care unit. It was there they began to ask questions about her care. ""We didn't have a clue. No clue what was going to happen. Every day, we were going back, they were saying 'we're not sure about this, we're not sure',"" she said. In the internal report by Hywel Dda University Health Board, seen byNewyddion9, a catalogue of failings are listed that likely contributed to Arthur's death. Kara Jones and Sam Penfold are now parents to Ralffi and Dyfi Among these are numerous failures to act on abnormal scan findings, and a failure to expedite delivery.Â Ms Jones said: ""I remember having a dream when I was under the general [anaesthetic]. Sam and Arthur were sitting round a table. Arthur was saying 'stay with dad'. Then Sam was saying 'stay with me'. And then I had to choose what I wanted to do, if I wanted to die and go with him or stay with Sam. ""I remember Arthur saying 'you'll see me again anyway, I know you'll see me again so stay with Dad for now'. ""So that's what I did and I woke, and I asked Sam 'is he ok' - and Sam said 'no he's gone'. ""It's just the hardest thing - waking up. You're pregnant for nine months, and then you're not pregnant. And that's it - it's gone."" The couple had specific concerns regarding the behaviour of the consultant who was on call during that weekend, and following a formal complaint to the General Medical Council (GMC), Alan Treharne received a formal warning. B 'People sharing stories is the biggest comfort' MP's tears over stillborn daughter Bereavement suite for parents who have lost a baby ""This guy was the only consultant on call. And he came in, all the nurses were saying something was wrong. I really wanted him to help my little baby,"" Ms Jones said. ""It's obvious his intentions were to be a good person or he wouldn't have wanted to be a doctor, so why couldn't he help my baby?"" Ms Jones and Mr Penfold have had two children, Ralffi and Dyfi, since Arthur's death A GMC investigation came to the conclusion that Mr Treharne's management of Ms Jones fell seriously below the standard expected of a reasonably competent consultant in obstetrics. No restrictions were placed on his practice. Newyddion9 has contacted the solicitors representing Mr Treharne who did not provide any further comment. Mandy Rayani, director of nursing, quality and patient experience at Hywel Dda health board, said she offered the board's ""sincere condolences and apologies for the distress experienced"" by Ms Jones and her family. ""A thorough investigation was undertaken by the health board as well as the GMC. This resulted in a number of recommendations to change procedures and clinical pathways,"" she said. ""Additional learning and training for the whole multidisciplinary team has taken place across the health board area. We wish to provide assurance that all of these recommendations have been implemented."" The couple tell their children about Arthur Since then Kara has given birth to two children. Ralffi is 21 months, and Dyfi was born in April. ""It makes you realise how lucky you are to have babies when you lose one. But the two little ones, they're amazing,"" she said. But Ms Jones and Mr Penfold are still unable to fully handle life. Suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Ms Jones suffers constant nightmares and Mr Penfold accepts that his personality has completely changed. ""I'm not the same person. I did well at university, I was head boy, and played for Wales schoolboys' football team,"" he said. ""But now, I'm not comfortable around many people. I'm not sociable. I can't imagine going to work. ""It's not healthy at all."" Looking to the future, the couple are in the process of setting up a trust in Arthur's name. The aim is to give children sporting opportunities, and the long term dream is to open a facility in Portugal. With Ralffi and Dyfi keeping them busy, they're moving forwards, but the family will always carry Arthur Wyn in their hearts. ""We tell Ralffi that he's now a big and a little brother. And I don't want to hide that from him, because if we hadn't lost Arthur, we may not have had Ralffi and Dyfi. ""Things have worked out how they are, and maybe that's how it was meant to be.""

US rapper ASAP Rocky, real name Rakim Mayers, has been found guilty of assault during a Stockholm fight and given a two-year suspended sentence. The 30-year-old has also been ordered to pay damages to the victim. ASAP Rocky spent nearly a month in custody after the assault, which happened at the end of June, before being released ahead of the verdict. He's posted on Instagram saying he's ""disappointed"" with the verdict and thanking fans for their support. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""The assault has not been of such a serious nature that a prison sentence must be chosen,"" the court said in a statement. ""The defendants are therefore sentenced to conditional sentences."" A suspended sentence means that as long as ASAP Rocky and the two other men found guilty commit no further crimes during a two-year probation period, they will avoid prison. ASAP Rocky thanked the court after being released from prison earlier this month ASAP Rocky and his co-defendants claimed they had been acting in self-defence against two men who had been following their group.

How the ASAP Rocky assault case unfolded The court said the victim of the assault, a 19-year-old refugee, was awarded damages for what the court described as the violation of his integrity and for pain and suffering. The judgement ruled that there was not enough evidence to say that bottles had been used during the assault - a key part of the evidence presented during the three-day trial which took place at the beginning of August. ""The court has recognised that Rocky and his party were followed and harassed, that no bottle was used, that Rocky didn't act in a joined attack with the others and that Rocky didn't inflict any wounds on the victim and that is a win,"" ASAP Rocky's lawyer Slobodan Jovicic told the BBC.

"'No chance of US deal' if Brexit hits Irish accordCongress will block a UK trade deal if Brexit harms the Good Friday Agreement, key US Democrat says.","This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi: The woman Republicans love to hate A US-UK trade deal will not get through Congress if Brexit undermines the Good Friday Agreement, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives has said. Democrat Nancy Pelosi, whose party controls the House, said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to endanger the Irish peace deal. Her comments came after the US national security adviser said the UK would be ""first in line"" for a trade deal. John Bolton spoke after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson in London. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Bolton Who is John Bolton? The reimposition of frontier controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without mutual agreement on 31 October - a so-called ""hard Brexit"" - is seen as a threat to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of bloodshed in Northern Ireland. ""Whatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday Agreement, including the seamless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland,"" Ms Pelosi said in a statement on Wednesday. Mr Bolton said on Tuesday that the Trump administration supported a no-deal Brexit, and added Washington would propose an accelerated series of trade deals in the event of one. He said these could be done on a ""sector-by-sector"" basis, with an agreement on manufacturing made first. A trade deal for financial services and agriculture would not be the first to be agreed, he added. What trade deals has the UK done so far? Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? Asked whether his proposed plan would follow World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, Mr Bolton said ""our trade negotiators seem to think it is"". He said there would be enthusiastic bipartisan support in Congress for speedy ratification at each stage. Mr Johnson said there were ""all sorts"" of opportunities for UK business in the US, particularly service companies, but the negotiations will be a ""tough old haggle"". However, critics warn that the UK will have to give in to some US demands in return for any trade agreement. The EU currently bans chlorine-washed chicken products on welfare grounds Former UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who served under a Labour government, described Mr Bolton as ""dangerously bellicose"". He suggested the UK would have to agree to some US demands, for example allowing imports of US chlorine-washed chicken. ""This is a highly transactional administrationâ¦ you don't get something for nothing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Lewis Lukens, a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in London and former acting US ambassador, said Mr Bolton was aligned to President Trump's ""America first agenda"" and would be making ""strong demands"" on the UK to back the US position on issues like China, Iran and Chinese tech giant Huawei. Mr Johnson is expected to have his first face-to-face meeting as prime minister with Mr Trump later this month at the G7 summit in France.

"Radiation 16 times normal after blast, Russia says","The Nyonoksa test range dates back to Soviet times - the hoarding stands near a naval barracks Radiation levels near the site of a deadly rocket explosion in Russia's far north spiked 16 times above normal, Russia's weather service has said. Rosgidrometmeasured radiation levels in the port city of Severodvinsk,externalafter the blast. Even at the higher levels, the radiation would have posed little damage to humans, nuclear experts say. Five scientists were killed and three injured in the accident on Thursdayat a military facility in the White Sea. A nuclear-powered engine was being tested near the village of Nyonoksa, to the west of Severodvinsk, Russia's state nuclear agency Rosatom said. Readings for gamma radiation at six testing stations in Severodvinsk, a city of 180,000 people, ranged from 4 to 16 times the normal rate of 0.11 microsieverts per hour, Rosgidromet said. A reading of 1.78 microsieverts per hour was detected at one station, well above normal but below dangerous levels.

This video can not be played Russia's military is testing a nuclear-powered cruise missile, called Burevestnik The weather service's findings contradict initial reports form Severodvinsk officials. Authorities in Severodvinsk, 47km (29 miles) east of Nyonoksa, said that radiation levels shortly after the blast were higher than normal for about 40 minutes but returned to normal. In contrast, Rosgidromet said the spike lasted for two-and-a-half hours. A checkpoint of a military garrison near the village of Nyonoksa in Arkhangelsk region The explosion sparked panic among locals,with some rushing to buy medical iodine, which can limit the effects of radiation. Pharmacies' stocks of iodine were reported to be running out in the cities of Arkhangelsk and Severodvinsk. On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to elaborate on the details of the test, only telling reporters ""accidents, unfortunately, happen"". He said, however, that Russia's nuclear engineering sector ""significantly outstrips the level that other countries have managed to reach for the moment"". There were conflicting reports about the possible evacuation of residents of Nyonoksa on Tuesday. Some locals told Russian media they were asked to leave their homes on Wednesday ahead of planned military exercises. Severodvinsk officials, quoted by the Interfax news agency, appeared to confirm the evacuation order in a later statement. However, other Russian officials were quick to dismiss reports of an evacuation, with regional governor Igor Orlov calling them ""complete nonsense"". Later on Tuesday, Interfax quoted the local government of Severodvinsk as saying the military had cancelled plans to conduct work on the testing grounds in Nyonoksa. Initially the defence ministry said the explosion on 8 August had involved a liquid-fuel rocket engine, and gave the death toll as two, without specifying who the victims were. Later, Rosatom said the test had involved a ""radio-isotope propellant source"" and had taken place on an offshore platform. The engineers had completed testing, but suddenly a fire broke out and the engine exploded, throwing the men into the sea, Rosatom said. The explosion sparked speculation that the accident involved a nuclear-powered cruise missile known as the ""Burevestnik"" or ""Skyfall"".

Cauliflower crisis as extreme weather kills crops,"Britain is experiencing a cauliflower shortage after extreme weather killed off much of this year's crops. Heavy rainfall in June destroyed crops in Lincolnshire, and alternative European supplies wilted in last month's heatwave. Cauliflower prices have soared and some farmers have suffered financial losses after the destruction of their crops. The shortages were described as ""very concerning"" by a spokesman for the Brassica Growers Association. Other brassica - including cabbage, broccoli and Brussels sprouts - are also in short supply. ""Crops can withstand a reasonable amount of variation in weather but the conditions in June were too much and as a result crops have suffered, and this is leading to a shortage of supply,"" the British Growers Association (BGA) said. UK heatwave: Lettuce shortage 'imminent' Vegetable rationing hits UK supermarkets Food firms want laws relaxed in event of no-deal 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Most of the UK's cauliflowers are grown in Lincolnshire, which experienced record amounts of rainfall and flooding in June that destroyed this year's crop. It has forced some suppliers to buy their cauliflowers from other countries - and the scarcity of them has caused prices to rise. Some have advised customers - including restaurants and hotels - to take cauliflowers off their menus until stocks recover. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade body UK Hospitality, said: ""If restaurants are unable to get their hands on cauliflower, that is obviously going to cause a nuisance. ""Thankfully, most should be fairly adept at substituting cauliflower for other items on their menus, so, hopefully, customers should not be unduly disappointed."" Steve Short, the managing director of Accent Fresh, a Norfolk-based fresh produce supplier, said: ""We rely quite heavily on Lincolnshire for our brassica, and we get some from Cambridgeshire, Kent, Evesham [in Worcestershire], and Cornwall. ""We have had to import them from Holland during the shortages. The growers have lost a lot of crop, so the market is very short and the price has gone up. ""We've been paying between Â£1.50 and Â£2.00 per head of cauliflower, it would normally be about 50 or 60 pence each."" Once regarded as a bland, boiled side dish, the cauliflower has risen in popularity as a substitute for everything from pizza crusts to gnocchi. Broccoli's paler cousin has become a firm fixture on upmarket restaurant menus - think Yotam Ottolenghi's cumin-roasted cauliflower with tahini, zhoug and barberries or Heston Bluementhal's roasted cauliflower with smoked brown butter, red wine and truffle. It is also beloved by celebrity chefs like Deliciously Ella, whose plant-based recipes include everything from creamy cauliflower and lentil dahl, to a cauliflower crust pizza and a mushroom, cauliflower and squash risotto.

Mr Short said the firm, which supplies about 300 hotels, restaurants, schools, universities and catering establishments across East Anglia, has advised customers to use other well-supplied vegetables, such as carrots and Swede, during the shortages. The poor quality of some of the limited amount of British brassica has seen the firm give out credits to some of its customers, Mr Short said. Martin Tate, commercial director of brassica growers Lincolnshire Field Products, estimated the farm has suffered about Â£1m in lost revenues after heavy rainfall decimated his cauliflower and broccoli crops. He said: ""We effectively had three months of rain in the space of three days, so anything that was planted up until that point in time [including the cauliflowers and broccoli] was either washed out of the ground, or sat for several weeks in flooded fields."" Brussels sprouts and red and white cabbage were also planted before the rains, but it is the cauliflowers and broccoli that have been worst hit in July and August. He said the Brussels sprouts and the cabbages will be affected for the autumn and the winter, but it is too early to estimate the scale of the losses. The farm's cauliflowers are now ""suffering to a fairly huge degree"", with just 20% of the crop able to be harvested, and with a percentage of what is being harvested not being of suitable quality to cover our orders. ""We have lost up to 80% of our production for the last two to three weeks and the next three weeks, so a large chunk of our season we're suffering not only crop losses  but financial losses as well. Incomes are down and it's going to take a lot of recovering."" Lincolnshire Field Products supplies most of the UK's major retailers, and food companies that supply to pubs and restaurants. Mr Tate expects the broccoli and cauliflower shortages to recover between the end of the month and the beginning of September. Waitrose, Asda, and Morrisons have a range of cauliflower heads currently available for sale on their websites. Both Tesco and Sainsbury's currently only have organic cauliflower heads for sale on their websites. They are priced at Â£2 each - Â£1 more expensive than their standard cauliflowers. The British Retail Consortium said: ""This is yet another example of how retailers are having to manage the effects of climate change, which has created a greater variability in the weather and resulted a slightly poorer harvest in the UK.""

A-level grade boundaries leak ahead of results dayLeaked documents show A-level maths candidates had to score just 55% to get an A in this year's paper.Family & Education,"Details of A-level grade boundaries for all papers set by two exam boards have been leaked on social media a day before the results are published. The documents reveal that A-level maths candidates needed little more than half marks to get a grade A in papers set by both Pearson/Edexcel and OCR. Exam boards send marking schemes to schools in confidence ahead of the results to help them prepare students. They said confidentiality was usually respected. A-level students are due to get their results on Thursday. The leaked Edexcel documents,first reported in the Daily Telegraph,external, show A-level maths candidates needed 55% to get the A grade, while candidates with the OCR board needed 54%. Edexcel's biology students needed 56% (167 marks out of 300) for an A, while OCR's candidates needed 59% (158 out of 270). In physics, candidates needed 59% (176 out of 300) for a grade A with Edexcel, while with OCR, this was 76% (204 out of 270). In English literature, candidates with the OCR board needed 89% for an A grade - significantly higher than those with Edexcel, who needed 69% (208 marks out of 300) to get A. This summer is the first time that grades for new-specification A-level maths are being awarded to the vast majority of students. The exam was reported by students to be very challenging, but the exam board had said before the leak emerged that it was clear the paper was of an appropriate standard. Exam boards set grade boundaries once all the results are in. They take into account the predicted achievement levels of the cohort taking the exam and the difficulty of the paper, in an attempt to keep standards the same from year to year. Responding to the leak, a spokesman for Pearson said: ""Our systems are working as they should and the information was shared today via a password-protected, secure website. ""Boards do ask schools not to share this widely to avoid unnecessary stress for students awaiting their results. ""Schools are trusted to treat the info confidentially on behalf of their students - and the vast majority do."" Investigation after A-level paper leaked 'I cried in the car on the way home' A spokesman for Cambridge Assessment, which owns the OCR board, said: ""We provide schools and colleges with results information, including grade boundaries, the day before results day on a special site which is accessible to exams officers. ""Grade boundaries are then released by schools to their students on results day and we publish them on our website. ""We do it this way to minimise the chance of students feeling anxious if they see grade boundaries without their results â which can lead some to jump to the wrong conclusion."" General secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders Geoff Barton said: ""We are extremely disappointed if grade boundaries have been leaked ahead of results day."" But he said was a pointless exercise because the purpose of grade boundaries was to account for differences in the difficulty of papers so that students were not disadvantaged from one year to the next. ""We would urge students against losing sleep over grade boundaries and to wait for their results tomorrow.""

Are the markets signalling that a recession is due?,"Financial markets have flashed a warning sign about the economic outlook for the UK and the US. It is known in the jargon as an ""inverted yield curve"". It means that it is cheaper for those countries' governments to borrow for 10 years than for two. It is an unusual development and it often comes before a recession or at least a significant slowdown in economic growth. Wall Street shares plunged on Wednesday, as investors' concerns about a potential recession were stoked by the news. The main US stock market indexes fell between 2.3% and 2.6%. Meanwhile in Europe London's FTSE 100 slipped 1.4%, Germany's Dax lost 2.2% and the French Cac 40 fell by 2.1%. German economy slips back into negative growth This warning sign is coming from the bond market, the place where governments and companies go to borrow money by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make certain payments in the future, usually a large one when the bond ""matures"" and smaller ones in the interim, typically every six months. How much investors pay for the bond determines the yield they will get - the higher the price, the lower the yield. One factor affecting the yield that investors want is how long they have to wait for the big final payment. Usually, a longer wait means they expect a higher yield. It compensates them for tying their money up for longer, when there is more risk that unexpected inflation could erode the value of their returns. What is unusual is that the yield on UK government bonds (gilts, as they are known) with two years to maturity went above the yield on the 10-year equivalent. The same thing happened in the US. It is seen as a sign that investors want the assured returns from holding a longer-term bond and are worried about the shorter-term outlook for the economy. Is the inverted yield curve reliable? According toeconomists at the US Federal Reserve,external: ""Periods with an inverted yield curve are reliably followed by economic slowdowns and almost always by a recession."" The time between the inversion and the onset of a recession is, however, not uniform. That said, there is something about the current situation that didn't apply to earlier episodes: quantitative easing, the policy pursued by many central banks after the financial crisis (and before, in the case of Japan) of buying financial assets, mainly government bonds. That had the effect of raising bond prices - which, remember is equivalent to reducing the yield from them. So QE may well be making a contribution to the yield curve inversion that is taking place now. The yield curve inversion does not tell us anything about what might be the specific reasons for any impending recession. This time, there are several possible candidates out there. The global trade conflict is a factor for many economies. Concerns held by many (though by no means all) businesses and investors about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit are a UK-specific issue that may be contributing. The UK has just recorded one quarter of declining economic activity, so the idea of an imminent recession is not at all fanciful, although the figures have been influenced by stockpiling ahead of planned Brexit dates and the subsequent rundown of those stocks. In the US, it would take a significant further slowdown to produce a recession. Germany has also registered a quarter of declining activity, according to new figures, so a recession could be under way there too. The yield curve for the German government is not inverted. But there is something else about government bonds there that is a clearly sign of a weak economic outlook: the fact that yields are below zero. In effect, investors pay the government to lend to it. That reflects the ultra-low interest rate policy of the European Central Bank, but it is also a sign of a weak economic outlook.

Drowned girl's mum claims police force is racist,"Shukri Abdi died on 27 June The mother of a 12-year-old girl who drowned has claimed institutional racism within the police means the family may never know how she died. Shukri Abdi drowned in the River Irwell in Bury, in Greater Manchester, on 27 June. The family claim officers failed to carry out a full investigation and treated them differently because of their ethnic background. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) previously said the death was a ""tragic incident"" and it did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances. It has now told the BBC it is ""still investigating on behalf of the coroner"". Shukri's mother, Zam Zam Ture, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that when she reported her daughter missing on the day of her death, police initially failed to act. Approximately 10 hours later, she said, she was informed that her daughter had been found dead, but described police as ""not sympathetic"". She said they spoke to her ""harshly"" and were ""trying to convince [her] that her daughter had been swimming"", which the family say was unlikely as Shukri could not swim, had been wearing full Islamic dress and it would have been ""out of character"" for her to attempt to do so. Zam Zam Ture says police spoke to her ""harshly"" when informing her of her daughter's death The family's lawyer Attiq Malik said ""within hours"" of Shukri's death, GMP had published a press release saying there were no suspicious circumstances. He said this had left insufficient time to check all evidence trails and discount other possibilities. ""The family's firm position is they have only been treated in that way because of their race, and had it been a different racial background more sensitivity would have been given, more investigation would have been done,"" he said. Institutional racism, he claimed, meant officers had acted in such a way without ""even realising it"". Their claims are now being investigated by the police watchdog, the IOPC. The IOPC said: ""We treat complaints of this nature with the utmost seriousness, and I know GMP share the view that the IOPC has a responsibility to examine the actions of the force after Shukri was reported missing - not least for public confidence."" Shukri drowned in the River Irwell Ms Ture said her daughter had been unhappy at school prior to her death. She said she had personally reported instances of bullying to Broad Oak Sports College in Bury ""many times"". The school produced a report for the family, but Mr Malik said it ""essentially just said that they were not aware of any bullying"". He said the school failed to interview Shukri's mother for the report, despite promises, which he suggested showed they did not ""fully investigate"". Drowning case probed by police watchdog Bullying 'not part' of girl's drowning death Warning after girl, 12, drowns in river In a statement, head teacher Paul Greenhalgh said the school was ""deeply saddened to receive news of Shukri's tragic death"". ""We are currently working with Shukri's family in respect of any concerns which have been raised about the school [and] will be reviewing all policies and procedures at the school,"" he added. ""In particular, we will focus on the school's anti-bullying policy and procedures and other policies relating to the welfare of children.""

Sala and pilot 'exposed to carbon monoxide in crash',"This video can not be played Emiliano Sala signed for Cardiff City two days before the crash Footballer Emiliano Sala was exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide prior to a fatal plane crash in the English Channel, a report has revealed. Sala, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, crashed on 21 January while travelling from Nantes in France to Cardiff. Toxicology tests on Sala's body showed CO levels in his blood were so great it could have caused a seizure, unconsciousness or a heart attack. The Sala family said there should be a detailed examination of the plane. Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, has still not been found. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said,externalSala's blood had a COHb (carboxyhaemoglobin - which forms in red blood cells upon contact with carbon monoxide) level of 58%. At this level, symptoms would include include seizure, unconsciousness and heart attack. It added: ""A COHb level of more than 50% in an otherwise healthy person is generally considered to be potentially fatal."" It is likely Mr Ibbotson would also have been exposed to carbon monoxide. Sala's dad dies three months after son Plane body identified as footballer Sala Emiliano Sala - born in Argentina, made in France Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson went missing on 21 January Piston engine aircraft such as the Piper Malibu involved in the crash produce high levels of carbon monoxide. The gas is normally conveyed away from the aircraft through the exhaust system, but poor sealing or leaks into the heating and ventilation system can enable it to enter the cabin. Several devices are available to alert pilots over the presence of carbon monoxide - they are not mandatory but can ""alert pilots or passengers to a potentially deadly threat"". Retired pilot and aviation safety commentator Terry Tozer said the finding was ""a surprise"", adding: ""It shows you can never tell what the root cause of an accident is until the investigators have dug into the nitty gritty. ""How and why did the carbon monoxide get in? Presumably through the exhaust systemâ¦ the fumes get into the ventilation system."" Mr Tozer said he had never encountered anything similar before and would not expect carbon monoxide poisoning to be a big risk on such an aircraft. He added: ""It's not like a car where you can open the windows. It can creep up on you, and that could be a slow process. ""It's odourless so you wouldn't necessarily know you were being fed these fumes unless you had a detection system - but that isn't mandatory for this type of aircraft."" Mr Tozer agreed with the Sala family that salvaging the wreckage and examining it would be the only way to find how the leak occurred. ""Aviation accidents usually come about when a number of factors accumulate. ""So, we start with the pilot and his lack of qualifications, then circumstances that delay the flight to night time, possibly feeling pressure the pilot then takes off when he shouldn't and finds weather that he is struggling with and the final straw is that his ability is impaired by poisoning from a leak in the exhaust and he loses control."" Striker Sala signed for Cardiff just two days before the plane crash AAIB investigators are working with aircraft manufacturers in the USA  - where the Piper Malibu was registered - to look at how carbon monoxide could have entered the cabin. ""Operational, technical and human factors"" will be considered. Geraint Herbert, the AAIB's lead inspector for this investigation, said: ""Symptoms at low exposure levels [to carbon monoxide] can be drowsiness and dizziness, but as the exposure level increases, it can lead to unconsciousness and death. ""The investigation continues to look into a wide range of areas in relation to this accident, but in particular we are looking at the potential ways in which carbon monoxide can enter the cabin in this type of aircraft."" Wednesday's bulletin was the second to be released following the crash, but the investigation is not expected to report its full findings until early 2020. Cardiff City said it was ""concerned"" by the report, adding: ""We continue to believe that those who were instrumental in arranging its [the plane's] usage are held to account for this tragedy."" In an interview in February, football agent Willie McKay, who commissioned the flight,told the BBC he and his family paid for it. He was not involved, he said, in selecting the plane or the pilot and it was not a cost-share arrangement. The plane disappeared from radar near Guernsey on its way to Cardiff from Nantes Daniel Machover of Hickman & Rose solicitors, who represents Sala's family, said: ""The family believe that a detailed technical examination of the plane is necessary. ""The family and the public need to know how the carbon monoxide was able to enter the cabin. Future air safety rests on knowing as much as possible on this issue."" Mr Ibbotson's wife Nora also said recovering the plane could help find answers. She told Sky News it had never occurred to her that carbon monoxide could potentially have played a part. She called it ""a massive shock"", adding: ""You can't smell it. You can't see it. It's lethal, they wouldn't have known. So it's nothing to do with the flying or anything like that, it's down to the aircraft."" The AAIB responded to calls for the plane to be retrieved by saying it filmed substantial video evidence at the scene after the aircraft was found in February. ""It was not possible at the time to recover the wreckage,"" it said. ""We have carefully considered the feasibility and merits of returning to attempt to recover the wreckage. In this case, we consider that it will not add significantly to the investigation and we will identify the correct safety issues through other means."" The statement said after a ""violent impact with the sea"", the wreckage may not even give definitive answers and the reasons for not retrieving the plane had been explained in detail to both the Sala and  Ibbotson families. By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News Carbon monoxide is an invisible killer with no smell, colour or taste. It is deadly because the gas starves the body of vital oxygen. Your red blood cells contain haemoglobin - its job is to pick up oxygen from the lungs and transport it around the body. The problem is haemoglobin prefers carbon monoxide and binds to the gas incredibly tightly - the more carbon monoxide the body is exposed to, the less oxygen it can carry. This has consequences throughout the body, but highly active tissues in the heart and brain are affected first. Carbon monoxide poisoning affects balance, vision and eventually consciousness. High doses are outright deadly. The NHS says 30% carboxyhaemoglobin is a ""severe exposure"" - Sala's carboxyhaemoglobin level was 58%. The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu The plane carrying the Argentine striker - Cardiff City's Â£15m record signing - lost contact with radar near Guernsey. Sala signed for Cardiff on 19 January - just two days before the crash - and had returned to Nantes to say goodbye to his former teammates. An official search was called off on 24 Januaryafter Guernsey's harbour master said the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". But an online appeal started by Sala's agent raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for a private search, led by marine scientist and oceanographer David Mearns. Sala's bodywas recovered from the wreckageof the Piper Malibu N264DB on 7 February and subsequently repatriated to Argentina. Mr Ibbotson has still not been found, but it has since been discoveredhe was not qualified to fly at night. While Sala never played for Cardiff City, fans left hundreds of tributes to him outside the team's stadium after his death Details released about Mr Ibbotson on Wednesday showed he had about 3,500 hours of flying experience - of which 30 were flying similar types of aircraft. He had flown for about 20 hours in the 90 days before the crash, and seven hours in the previous 28 days. Since Sala's death, Nantes and Cardiff City have been involved in a dispute over the transfer fee after the Welsh clubclaimed the deal was not legally binding. Sala's family and friends claimed he was""abandoned like a dog""before his death. His father Horacio died in April, three months after his son, after suffering a heart attack at home in Progreso, Argentina.

Hammond: PM's demands 'wreck' new Brexit deal,"This video can not be played The ex-chancellor says removing the Irish border 'backstop' is a ""wrecking tactic"" Former Chancellor Philip Hammond has accused the PM of trying to wreck the chance of a new Brexit deal, by making demands the EU could never accept. In a Times article,,externalMr Hammond said a no-deal Brexit would be ""a betrayal"" of the 2016 referendum result. He told the BBC he was ""confident"" that Parliament ""has the means"" to express its opposition to a no-deal exit. A No 10 source said the UK would leave on 31 October despite Mr Hammond's ""best efforts to the contrary"". The source added that Mr Hammond, as chancellor, ""did everything he could"" to block preparations for leaving and had ""undermined negotiations"". The former chancellor rejected this suggestion in a tweet, saying he wanted to deliver Brexit ""and voted to do so three times"". Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU with a deal, but the UK must leave ""do or die"" by the latest Brexit deadline of 31 October. He wants the EU to ditch theIrish border backstop planfrom the deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May, which was rejected three times by Parliament. This video can not be played Last week Boris Johnson said the EU should show 'common sense' on Brexit But the EU has continued to insist that deal, including the backstop arrangements, is the only agreement possible. Many of those who voted against the deal had concerns over the backstop, which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Who are Boris Johnson's key advisers? Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hammond said a no-deal exit would be ""just as much a betrayal of the referendum result as not leaving at all"". He said that Mr Johnson's demand for the backstop to be entirely removed from the deal meant a no-deal was inevitable on the current 31 October deadline. He said that agreeing to changes now would ""fragment"" the EU, adding: ""they are not going to take that risk"". ""Pivoting to say the backstop has to go in its entirety - a huge chunk of the withdrawal agreement just scrapped - is effectively a wrecking tactic,"" he said. He also told Today that he was ""very confident"" MPs would be able to pass legislation to express their opposition to a no-deal exit. However he said he did not favour the tactic of replacing the PM with a national unity government designed to prevent no deal, saying: ""I don't think that's the answer"". In his Times article, Mr Hammond said ""the unelected people who pull the strings of this government know that this is a demand the EU cannot, and will not, accede to."" BBC political correspondent Tom Barton said that remark was an apparent aim at the prime minister's closest adviser, Dominic Cummings - the former Vote Leave campaign director. It was a ""travesty of the truth"", Mr Hammond wrote, to pretend that Leave voters backed a no-deal Brexit in the 2016 referendum. But Leave-supporting former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, also speaking on the Today programme, said he was ""astounded"" by Mr Hammond's remarks. ""Talk about hubris. This man did nothing to prepare us for leaving with no deal,"" he said. ""The fact we are now doing that means we have a much better chance to get some kind of agreement from them because they now know we're going to leave with no deal and he's undermining that."" Mr Hammond's comments come as Downing Street said it expected a group of MPs to try to block a no-deal Brexit by attempting to pass legislation when Parliament returns next month. The Daily Telegraph reports,externalthat Commons Speaker John Bercow told an audience at the Edinburgh Fringe festival that he ""strongly"" believes the House of Commons ""must have its way"". He said he would ""fight with every breath in my body"" any attempt by the prime minister to suspend Parliament to force through a no-deal against MPs' wishes. Amber Rudd says the government shouldn't work against MPs by suspending Parliament On Tuesday, Work and Pensions SecretaryAmber Rudd urged Mr Johnson not to force througha suspension. She told the BBC: ""I remain a great admirer of Parliament and of parliamentary sovereignty and I will continue to argue for the executive of the government that I'm part of to work with Parliament, not against them."" Meanwhile, 20 other senior Tory MPs have written to the prime minister to say his demand to scrap the Irish backstop ""set the bar so high that there is no realistic probability of a deal being done"". The MPs said they were ""alarmed by the 'Red Lines' you have drawn which, on the face of it appear to eliminate the chance of reaching agreement with the EU"". The group also demands that Mr Johnson declares he is firmly committed to leaving the EU with a deal and is ready to compromise to get one - pointing out those were assurances he gave during the leadership campaign ""both publicly and privately"". Seven other former cabinet ministers have signed the letter, including David Lidington, David Gauke, Rory Stewart and Greg Clark, all of whom resigned before Mr Johnson took office.

Rudd: Don't ignore Parliament,"The Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has told the BBC that unemployment ""could go up"" if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal. She also said the prime minister and cabinet should remember parliament could not be ignored in a push towards what she said was a ""far inferior"" no-deal Brexit. The cabinet minister said she was delighted withTuesday's record employment figures, which showed wages rising faster than prices for nearly a year and a half. But after her apparent U-turn on no deal ahead of rejoining the cabinet under Boris Johnson, Ms Rudd cautioned against both ignoring the Commons and setting an election date to avoid a parliamentary say on no deal. Reminded that she had previously said shutting down parliament would be a ridiculous thing to do, Ms Rudd said she remained ""a great admirer of parliament and of parliamentary sovereignty"". ""I will continue to argue for the executive of the government that I'm part of to work with parliament, not against them,"" she said. Asked if she could back a situation where an election was held on purpose so that parliament did not have its say on no deal, she said there had been a lot of speculation. ""I will play my part in cabinet and privately with the prime minister and with ministers in arguing strongly for respecting parliamentary sovereignty. ""And you know, I'm a member of parliament. The prime minister and all cabinet members are members of parliament. We need to remember where our authority comes from."" Ms Rudd was speaking to the BBC in her first full interview after rejoining the cabinet, on a visit to female engineers working on the Thames Tideway infrastructure project. She said she was ""jealous"" of ""every single pound"" of the Â£2bn of new money earmarked towards no-deal Brexit preparations and wanted to see more money going towards universal credit and ending the benefits freeze. Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a no-deal scenario that showed Â£9bn extra in welfare spending and a 400,000 reduction in employment. Ms Rudd said she did not accept the specific numbers, and said the government was focused on putting in place measures to mitigate any job losses. ""Government is certainly aware that if we do have a no-deal exit, there will be adverse consequences. [Unemployment] could go up, yes. And I would much prefer to see us get a deal"". Asked why her cabinet colleagues were gung ho for an outcome that could hit workers' jobs, she replied: ""I don't think people are gung ho - certainly not the people I sit with in cabinet. We know that no deal is a far inferior prospect than a deal"".

Turkish army pension fund set to buy British SteelAtaer is to be named the preferred bidder for the Scunthorpe works by the Official Receiver.Business,"The Official Receiver is to announce this week that an investment arm of Turkey's armed forces pension fund is the preferred bidder for British Steel. Ataer Holding would then be given several weeks to try to buy British Steel - the owner of the Scunthorpe works - out of insolvency. British Steel was put into compulsory liquidation in May, when the Official Receiver was appointed. Ataer owns nearly 50% of Erdemir, Turkey's biggest steel producer. It is the investment vehicle of the Turkish Armed Forces Assistance Fund (known as Oyak), the pension fund for the country's armed forces. Some 5,000 jobs were put at risk - and 20,000 in the supply chain - when talks broke down in May between the government and British Steel's owner, Greybull. British Steel has about 5,000 employees. There are 3,000 at Scunthorpe, with another 800 on Teesside and in north-eastern England. British Steel: 'We fear for our town's future' The company was transferred to the Official Receiver because British Steel, its shareholders and the government were not able to, or would not, support the business. TheFinancial Times reported,externalthat Oyak is chaired by Mehmet Tas, a former army general, and its annual general meeting in May was attended by Turkey's defence minister and the head of the country's armed forces.Â It already has interests in cement, agriculture, mining and energy, as well as a joint venture with French carmaker Renault and revenues of $9.8bn (Â£8.1bn) last year. The paper said Ataer, established by Oyak in 2005, plans to embark on a spate of global steel acquisitions and considers buying British Steel a ""bold"" first step that would be a signal of intent. Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said the union was meeting with the administrator on Thursday and that reports of a buyer were speculation. ""Unite understands from previous scheduled meetings that there are three serious bidders who are interested in buying British Steel as a going concern. ""With regards to the potential bid from the Turkish military pension fund. While we welcome it as a serious proposition, Unite will be watching this closely and speaking with our Turkish sister unions given Turkey's record of repression alongside reported opposition to independent trade union organisation in its Turkish steel plants."" Prof Barbara Shollock, head of engineering at King's College London, told Radio 5 live's Wake Up to Money that linking the Scunthorpe steelmaker with one in Turkey may make commercial sense. ""The British steel industry is highly regarded, the products that they make are high value and high quality...

Turkish army pension fund set to buy British Steel,"The Official Receiver is to announce this week that an investment arm of Turkey's armed forces pension fund is the preferred bidder for British Steel. Ataer Holding would then be given several weeks to try to buy British Steel - the owner of the Scunthorpe works - out of insolvency. British Steel was put into compulsory liquidation in May, when the Official Receiver was appointed. Ataer owns nearly 50% of Erdemir, Turkey's biggest steel producer. It is the investment vehicle of the Turkish Armed Forces Assistance Fund (known as Oyak), the pension fund for the country's armed forces. Some 5,000 jobs were put at risk - and 20,000 in the supply chain - when talks broke down in May between the government and British Steel's owner, Greybull. British Steel has about 5,000 employees. There are 3,000 at Scunthorpe, with another 800 on Teesside and in north-eastern England. British Steel: 'We fear for our town's future' The company was transferred to the Official Receiver because British Steel, its shareholders and the government were not able to, or would not, support the business. TheFinancial Times reported,externalthat Oyak is chaired by Mehmet Tas, a former army general, and its annual general meeting in May was attended by Turkey's defence minister and the head of the country's armed forces.Â It already has interests in cement, agriculture, mining and energy, as well as a joint venture with French carmaker Renault and revenues of $9.8bn (Â£8.1bn) last year. The paper said Ataer, established by Oyak in 2005, plans to embark on a spate of global steel acquisitions and considers buying British Steel a ""bold"" first step that would be a signal of intent. Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said the union was meeting with the administrator on Thursday and that reports of a buyer were speculation. ""Unite understands from previous scheduled meetings that there are three serious bidders who are interested in buying British Steel as a going concern. ""With regards to the potential bid from the Turkish military pension fund. While we welcome it as a serious proposition, Unite will be watching this closely and speaking with our Turkish sister unions given Turkey's record of repression alongside reported opposition to independent trade union organisation in its Turkish steel plants."" Prof Barbara Shollock, head of engineering at King's College London, told Radio 5 live's Wake Up to Money that linking the Scunthorpe steelmaker with one in Turkey may make commercial sense. ""The British steel industry is highly regarded, the products that they make are high value and high quality... Perhaps joining in with a stronger European presence [the Turkish fund] might feel that they are consolidating their market and broadening their opportunities."" She said it was a ""challenging situation"". ""[Steel] is what we call a foundation industry and that means that it is one of the core producers of materials that feed into other manufacturing and key things like rail, automotive, construction even, so it is very important that we have strong foundations.""

Rail fares set to rise again by up to 2.8%,"Rail users in the UK will be hit by a further rise in ticket prices which will come into effect next year. The increase will be based on the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation measure for July of 2.8%. The figure is likely to lead to an increase of more than Â£100 in the annual cost of getting to work for many commuters. Passenger groups urged a change in the way ticket prices are calculated, as RPI is no longer a national statistic. The cost of most train fares are set by train companies themselves, but about 40% of fares in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated so that they are only allowed to rise by an amount pegged to the RPI rate of inflation in July the previous year. These regulated fares include annual season tickets. The government's preferred measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), increased to 2.1%. What is the UK's inflation rate? New 50% off 16-17 railcard on sale next week The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) has repeatedly said that CPI, the most widely watched and used measure of inflation, should be used instead of RPI. Last month this was 2% and it is typically lower than the RPI rate of inflation. CBT chief executive Darren Shirley said the expected ticket price rises were ""exorbitant"". ""The government should commit now to January's fares rise being linked to CPI,"" he added. The difference between the two is stark. For every Â£100 paid on a season ticket, using RPI over CPI has increased prices by about Â£6 since RPI was abandoned by the National Audit Office as a national statistic in 2013. ""The only benefactors of using the retail price index (RPI) to calculate the cost of rail fares are the train companies,"" said Kevin Brown, savings specialist at Scottish Friendly, an investment firm. ""Passengers are therefore having to fork out more money to travel despite regularly having to deal with over-crowded and unpredictable services. The general outlook for consumers is already difficult and this will feel like another kick in the teeth for many hard-working families who are facing the prospect of a second recession in 10 years. A monthly season ticket from Widnes to Liverpool, currently costing Â£129.80 will cost Â£133.43, an increase of Â£3.63. A monthly pass from Reading to London will go from Â£442.00 to Â£454.38, up Â£12.38. A season ticket from Bath Spa to Bristol Temple Meads today costs Â£162.10 a month. From January it will be Â£166.64, up Â£4.54. Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said:  ""It's tempting to suggest fares should never rise. However, the truth is that if we stop investing in our railway, then we will never see it improved."" Rail firm offers free trips to university open day Reality Check: Where does your train fare go? FirstGroup replaces Virgin to run West Coast route The TUC, a federation of unions, renewed its call for the railway to be renationalised, arguing it would lead to lower ticket prices. ""We're already paying the highest ticket prices in Europe to travel on overcrowded and understaffed trains. ""The number one priority should be running a world-class railway service, not subsidising private train companies,"" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. Rachael, a commuter in Watford, Hertfordshire, told the BBC: ""I've seen the rail fares increasing again this year, and for me it's just becoming impossible to justify, and I'm worried I'll be priced out of working in London within a few years if this keeps happening. ""The cost of my train ticket, and the dreadful service is causing me such grief, and I'm only travelling from Watford junction to Euston. It costs me Â£3,680 on an annual ticket. ""Something needs to change. Please."" The bitter irony for rail passengers is that the quality of service in Britain is all too often undeserving of the price. After a cataclysmic year on parts of the network last year, punctuality was generally on the up this year before the hot, and then wet and windy, weather caused significant disruption this summer. The promise (via an ongoing Government-commissioned rail review) is that our train companies of the future will only make money if they run trains on time. In principle that sounds good for passengers but we still don't know how it will work in practice and when such a system will actually arrive at a station near you. The wider financial dilemma for Government is that our rail network is in large parts ageing and in need of a refit. Infrastructure upgrade work costing the taxpayer billions is ongoing or planned. Government sources point out that a relatively small proportion of public transport journeys are made by train (roughly 17%). Therefore, they argue, a rise in ticket prices, however painful for passengers, is a necessary evil to meet the rising costs linked to running the railways. At the start of this year, train fares went up by an average of 3.1% in England and Wales and 2.8% in Scotland. The rise in England and Wales - the highest since January 2013 - meant the price of some annual season tickets rose by more than Â£100. In Scotland, peak-time season tickets and anytime day tickets became 3.2% more expensive, while the capped increase of off-peak fares was 2.2%. Rail passengers have had to endure more delays on the network this year. Last week was particularly bad, with thousands of people affected by a signal failure,which led to the suspension of all services out of London Euston,on Thursday. And thentrains were also affected in Friday's power cut,with many stranded across the network Delays also happened during July's heatwave,while in January,London Overground commuters were given a month's free travelafter delays to the delivery of new electric trains.

Unheard George Michael song to feature in movie,"Emilia Clarke will star in Last Christmas, which is inspired by George Michael's music An unreleased, six-minute song from the late George Michael will feature in a new movie loosely based on his music. Last Christmas, released later this year, is set to star Emilia Clarke, Henry Golding and Emma Thompson. Its director Paul Feig told BBC News: ""[George Michael] was putting together his new album when he passed. ""And one of our tracks is one of those songs, and it's just an absolutely amazing song that I'm so excited the world is going to get to hear now."" George Michael was found dead on Christmas Dayin 2016 at his home in Goring, Oxfordshire. Last Christmas focuses on a young aspiring singer (played by Clarke), whose hero is George Michael. Feig explains the singer's music ""sort of travels with her as she goes through her life"" in the storyline. Speaking about the new track, he continued: ""It's a very celebratory song, I would dare say. And we were able to play the entire song, which is almost six minutes long, in the film. ""Because when you get a song that has never been heard, you don't want to just use, like, 15 seconds of it. The song starts at the end of the film, and then goes into the credits."" Emilia Clarke is best known for starring in fantasy series Game of Thrones Last Christmas is set to be released next July (just kidding, it's out in November) and stars Henry Golding and Michelle Yeoh, both of whom also appeared together in Crazy Rich Asians. Thefirst trailer for the film premiered,externalon Wednesday morning. Until now, the exact format of Last Christmas has been unclear, with fans wondering whether Michael's music would be just used as the soundtrack, or whether songs would actually be sung by the characters. ""It's not a musical, but George's music affects the story,"" Feig clarifies. ""There are a couple of sections where the actors are actually interacting with the music and other sections where George's music is driving, or underscoring the story. So it's a nice mix of being neither a jukebox movie nor straight up musical."" It is far from the first film to be based on the back catalogue of a particular band or artist. Mamma Mia and its sequel were huge box office smashes, while Bohemian Rhapsody took home four Oscars earlier this year. Paul Feig has also directed Bridesmaids and the all-female Ghostbusters reboot Movie trailers nowadays can be instantly dissected and dismissed by Twitter, the immediacy of which means a film can suffer an instant backlash long before it's even hit cinemas. The Cats trailer was a victim of this recently, with fans complaining about the appearance of some of the characters. And Feig's own Ghostbusters rebootbecame YouTube's most disliked movie trailerafter a concerted campaign by fans of the original to vote it down. Does the critical world of social media make directors like Feig more nervous about trailer premieres now? ""I mean, you get nervous for everything that comes out, you get nervous when the poster comes out, when the trailer comes out, when the movie comes out. But that's why we have taken our time to get this out, because we wanted to get it right. ""But I'm at the point now, where, where I'm just excited to get it out there because we spent so long kind of wringing our hands and going, 'is this right? Try this, try that'. Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding also stars in Last Christmas ""So now we throw it to the internet and see what they say. Everybody kind of likes to take their shots at people in showbiz, but I would like to say that our intentions are completely pure. We're never like, 'alright, let's see what these suckers will go for'. It's like, 'Oh, we love this. We can't wait to share this with you', we're really proud of it.'""

Drugs firm to pay NHS Â£8m after competition probeAspen will make the payment after a competition probe into a life-saving treatment for thousands of patients.,"Drugs firm Aspen is to pay Â£8m to the NHS after an investigation into the supply of a life-saving drug to thousands of patients. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the firm offered to make the payment following an investigation. The CMA said it suspects competition law was broken after Aspen paid two rivals to stay out of the market. This left Aspen as the only UK supplier of fludrocortisone and able to set prices without competition, it added. Aspen may also have to pay an additional Â£2.1m fine if the CMA formally decides the company broke the law. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's chief executive, said it was ""unacceptable for the NHS - and the taxpayers who fund it - to have to pay millions of pounds more than they should for this life-saving drug"". The prescription-only fludrocortisone is mainly used to treat Addison's Disease, a rare deficiency of the adrenal glands. This is the first time a CMA investigation will secure a payment such as this for the NHS. In addition, Aspen will ensure that there are at least two fludrocortisone suppliers in the UK. Shares in the firm dropped nearly 7% after the announcement. Aspen saidin a statement to investors,externalthat commitments it made, including the Â£8m payment to the NHS, did not ""constitute an admission of any wrongdoing by Aspen"" under EU law. However, it said it had admitted liability ""for entering into an agreement to acquire a potential competitor in fludrocortisone with the consequence that the conclusion of this agreement resulted in anti-competitive behaviour"". It added that the CMA would impose a penalty ""which shall not exceed Â£2,101,954"". Nationwide customers refunded Â£6m in charges Colluding drug firms 'cost NHS millions' Drugs firms 'conspired to fix prices' in US LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Racism in football: FA 'has to modernise',"This video can not be played FA 'has to modernise' to tackle racism in football The FA ""has to modernise itself"" to be ""fit for purpose for the 21st century,"" says the chairman of its inclusion advisory board. Paul Elliott says the organisation was ""reactive"" in the past when it came to dealing with racism complaints, but will now be ""proactive"". ""It can get better,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""We are improving - it's important to recognise it."" He adds there's ""a genuine focus"" to tackle racism at grassroots level too. Paul Elliott is chair of the inclusion advisory board of the FA Listen to a Newsbeat special: Football's Racism Fight on BBC Sounds now. The number of racist incidents reported to anti-discrimination charity Kick It Outrosefrom 192 to 274 last season. The FA's beencriticisedin the past for the way it's handled racism allegations at the grassroots level of the game. But Paul Elliott says the organisation is ""taking greater responsibility"" and trying to make the reporting process easier. ""I feel there's a genuine focus within the organisation, and investment, to make that process far more smoother, far more effective, and far more efficient. ""From the reporting protocols right the way through the whole process - the time it takes, the evidence. And also support for the victims too."" Paul Elliott says the organisation wants to use Wembley Stadium as a ""gold standard"" in the game. ""So we're talking about more effective, efficient stewarding, greater visibility for the police, signage,"" he says. He also says the FA can use facial recognition to help identify perpetrators in the stadium. ""You're sending a message to spectators by saying 'hey, we have got an attitude of zero tolerance'."" Raheem Sterling has become the unofficial poster boy for speaking out against racism in football Radio 1 Newsbeat spoke to current and former players from up and down the football pyramid about their experiences with racism in the game. Peterborough Utd striker Ivan Toney, who sometimes gets racist abuse online, says punishments to perpetrators need to be stronger. Amateur players in Leicestershire were unhappy with the way racism complaints were handled by the FA at grassroots levels. And Eni Aluko, who the FA apologised to for racially discriminatory comments made by then England Women boss Mark Sampson, says racism should be treated in the same way as corruption in football. Didier Drogba: ""Force them to like you"" But there are two legends of the Premier League who have ideas too. Didier Drogba, who scored over 150 goals for Chelsea, tells Newsbeat: ""I experienced it, but it's not everyone in the stadium. ""You take 60,000 people out of millions and for sure you're going to see a lot of differences. ""Really I believe, the best way to fight it is to be good, is to be the greatest, to be the best - so to force them to like you."" Rio Ferdinand: ""It begins in society"" Six-time Premier League winner Rio Ferdinand believes more education around the subject will lead to a gradual change. ""If the education is there from a young age for people to be educated the right way, I believe that in time problems will become less and less,"" he says. ""A lot of the problems are from a society. It begins in society, outside of football."" Some grassroots players and coaches say they don't bother reporting the incidents any more because they don't think anything will be done. ""It's come to a stage where we know that regardless of how many complaints that we log to the FA of situations that have occurred, nothing's actually being done. It's just been let slide,"" says Faizaldo, who plays for Community Football Academy (CFA) in Leicestershire. ""Actions are louder than words, now... unfortunately, we haven't seen any actions in place at this present moment in time."" ""There are isolated instances where it [racism] does happen,"" says Amir, who coaches children as part of CFA. ""But then the action on that - from what we've seen - hasn't been as good as we would anticipate it to be."" Another CFA coach at grassroots level, Asif, says that he doesn't have faith in the system. ""Stop it at the top, and we'll slowly stop it at the bottom. That's the way I see it,"" he says. Ivan Toney: ""It does frustrate me"" Higher up in the football pyramid, the English Football League sawfour incidentsof alleged racist abuse in its opening weekend. While Premier League players get a lot of publicity when they speak out about racism, players in other leagues don't get the same sort of coverage. ""It's not the greatest, it's horrible. It does frustrate me,"" says Peterborough United striker Ivan Toney, about the racist abuse he's got online in the past. In one incident in May after he scored the winner against Portsmouth, he got sent monkey and banana emojis online. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The punishment needs to be a lot harder,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""Missing a few games - is that really strong enough? I don't think so."" He would prefer to see lifetime bans, ""and people seeing that and thinking 'right, that's going to happen if I do that, so I can't be doing that.'"" He adds that these incidents are sometimes discussed among his teammates. ""Obviously the squad are thinking, 'what's this for, what's going on here, are you alright?'"" In astatement,,externalPortsmouth apologised to him and said: ""There is no place in football - or indeed society - for racism and it will not be tolerated at Portsmouth Football Club."" The case was also reported to the police and an investigation is ongoing. Eni Aluko: ""Racism in sport is a bigger conversation than just the individual"" ""This needs to be as big as financial fair play, or other things on the agenda like corruption in sport,"" Juventus forward Eni Aluko tells Newsbeat. ""It fundamentally brings into disrepute the integrity of the sport, which is what we all love and do."" Aluko, who has 102 caps for the Lionesses but hasn't played international football since 2016, was involved in a high-profile racism case with the FA in 2017. The FA apologisedto her and teammate Drew Spence for racially discriminatory comments made by then-England boss Mark Sampson. Eni Aluko last played for England in 2016 ""I know what I've been through and it wasn't a nice experience at all actually,"" says Aluko. ""But I would like to think that it's a lesson for everybody to say that if that happens again, we need to deal with it differently."" She adds: ""I think racism in sport is a bigger conversation than just the individual. ""I think it's about diversity in boardrooms, diversity in the media, how the media writes about players of colour which then plays into a lot of the stereotypes that people have on the terraces."" One of the first things players and fans at all levels are told to do if they encounter racism or abuse is to report it. Kick It Out, the anti-discrimination charity, is one of the channels you can use to do that, through their app or website. There were 109 reports of discrimination (not just racism) at grassroots level last season - and 40% of those were in under-18 matches. But Kick It Out's CEO Roisin Wood tells Newsbeat: ""I don't think our grassroots statistics reflect at all what's going on."" She adds: ""I just think we don't have an impact at grassroots football and we have to get better at that - I'm talking as us as Kick It Out as well as all football bodies."" Roisin says Kick It Out is ""trying to make sure our communication is better between [the FA] and us and between us and the victim."" She adds: ""We just need more resources to make sure people, even if the outcome doesn't go the way they wanted it to go, they feel confident in the process."" Kick It Out gets a total of about Â£800,000 a year in funding from the FA, Premier League, Football League and Professional Footballers' Association. With a lot of pressure on football's authorities this season to make sure there isn't a repeat of last season's incidents, it remains to be seen how much of an effect footballing bodies' promises will have.

Drugs firm to pay NHS Â£8m after competition probe,"Drugs firm Aspen is to pay Â£8m to the NHS after an investigation into the supply of a life-saving drug to thousands of patients. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the firm offered to make the payment following an investigation. The CMA said it suspects competition law was broken after Aspen paid two rivals to stay out of the market. This left Aspen as the only UK supplier of fludrocortisone and able to set prices without competition, it added. Aspen may also have to pay an additional Â£2.1m fine if the CMA formally decides the company broke the law. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's chief executive, said it was ""unacceptable for the NHS - and the taxpayers who fund it - to have to pay millions of pounds more than they should for this life-saving drug"". The prescription-only fludrocortisone is mainly used to treat Addison's Disease, a rare deficiency of the adrenal glands. This is the first time a CMA investigation will secure a payment such as this for the NHS. In addition, Aspen will ensure that there are at least two fludrocortisone suppliers in the UK. Shares in the firm dropped nearly 7% after the announcement. Aspen saidin a statement to investors,externalthat commitments it made, including the Â£8m payment to the NHS, did not ""constitute an admission of any wrongdoing by Aspen"" under EU law. However, it said it had admitted liability ""for entering into an agreement to acquire a potential competitor in fludrocortisone with the consequence that the conclusion of this agreement resulted in anti-competitive behaviour"". It added that the CMA would impose a penalty ""which shall not exceed Â£2,101,954"".

FirstGroup replaces Virgin to run West Coast route,"FirstGroup is to take over the running of the West Coast mainline train route, connecting London Euston to Glasgow Central, from December. Along with Italian firm Trenitalia, FirstGroup said the route would pave the way for an era of high-speed rail. First Trenitalia replaces Virgin Trains, which was barred from bidding to keep the route. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the bid was part of a shift to a new model for rail. Mr Shapps said the partnership was supported by Keith Williams, who has been commissioned to look at changes to the rail franchising system and who has told the BBC that government involvement should be limited to overall policy and budget decisions. Virgin plans cheaper rival Liverpool-London train service Government should not manage railways, says review The transport secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was a ""new type of contract, the idea here is that the risk is shared so that when it comes to the changes that Keith Williams has proposed this is fully compliant with it. ""We need them [the rail companies] paid for running the blooming trains on time and not for doing a bunch of other things. And that's what this new contract on the West Coast is about."" The new partnership will operate in two phases. The first will run from 8 December to March 2026, when First Trenitalia will operate the existing InterCity West Coast services. The second phase will run from March 2026 to March 2031, when it will operate the HS2 high-speed rail service. Mr Shapps will tell MPs about the timescale and terms of reference of review of HS2 by Douglas Oakervee - a former chairman of the high-speed network  - in ""due course"", It said its 56 Pendolino trains would be completely refurbished, with more reliable free Wi-Fi and better catering. By 2022, it says, it will offer more than 260 extra services each week, increasing seat miles by more than 10% compared with 2017-18. This will cost Â£117m, the Department for Transport said. The trains that run up and down the West Coast Main Line are called Pendolinos, with underlying technology supplied by what was Fiat Ferroviaria. Fitting, then, that an Italian company should finally start running the line - Trenitalia is the joint venture partner of First Group in the new West Coast franchise. Some rail commentators greeted this morning's announcement with surprise: not that First Group and the Italians had won it, but that a decision had been made at all. The government's franchising policy has been in disarray, with legal challenges, an abandoned competition, and in the background, a wide-ranging review of how the railways are run. The findings of that review, by former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams, are about to be published, so why award an important franchise just when the railways might be on the brink of another reorganisation? The Department for Transport says the West Coast deal is, in fact, a vision of things to come and has Mr Williams' blessing. It is apparently flexible enough to cope with whatever he recommends and the indications are that his main finding - that Network Rail should take a big role in the strategic direction of the railway - won't much impinge on this franchise. Another potential trap awaits, however. Stagecoach, one of the First Group's rivals, was in the running for the West Coast deal until it was blocked from bidding, because it refused to take on pensions risk. It has won the right to a judicial review of that decision. FirstGroup, based in Aberdeen, is being awarded the contract at a time when it has been overhauling its business, seeking a buyer for its Greyhound buses in the US. It is also looking at spinning off its UK bus division, First Bus. Its First Rail business also operates the South Western Railway and TransPennine Express. Its chief executive, Matthew Gregory, had indicated the group's train franchises could be reviewed, depending on the terms offered by the government. However, Mr Gregory's concerns about the profitability of train franchises appear to have been addressed by the Department for Transport. The West Coast Main Line runs up and down the UK Mr Gregory said: ""The differences between this contract and more traditional rail franchises were reflected in the terms set out by the [Department for Transport], which has resulted in  a more appropriate balance of risks and rewards for us as operators. ""The West Coast Partnership's first phase allows us to earn returns on the significant investments in services and facilities for passengers, but protected by a much improved revenue risk-sharing mechanism. ""This will transition to a management contract in the second phase, ensuring we can really focus on using the respective skills and experience within our joint venture to deliver the desired benefits of the HS2 project for passengers and the country."" The RMT's general secretary, Mick Cash, described it as a ""another political fix by a government whose privatised franchise model is collapsing around their ears"" and warned it was ""doomed to failure and sure to result in yet more rail chaos"". Questions about the rail franchising system were raised last week, when the government cancelled the competition to operate rail services between London, Kent and parts of East Sussex -  currently run by Southeastern. The awarding of the West Coast Mainline route prompted Labourto renewed its call to nationalise the railways. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""Awarding a complex contract for both the West Coast Partnership and HS2 services to FirstGroup, a company with questions over its finances, is a gross error of judgement."" But Paul Plummer, chief executive of industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""Virgin-Stagecoach have brought significant benefits to passengers on the West Coast route including nearly tripling the number of trains between London and Manchester.  We have no doubt that First Trenitalia will build on that record with plans for new trains and more services."" But Mr Shapps told the BBC: ""Privatisation has allowed the railway to expand massively - twice as many people, twice as many journeys and record number of people travelling on our railways, so I don't think nationalisation is the answer at all. Why would you put politicians in control?"" The Department for Transport said  the new contract award was a ""significant move away from the previous flawed franchising system"" and would use a forecast revenue mechanism (FRM) - which offers protection against shortfalls in estimated revenues - to avoid a repeat of the issues that affected the previous East Coast Main Line franchise. Last year, serviceson the East Coast Main Line were brought back under government control. FirstGroup said that if such a system had been in use on its South Western Railway and TransPennine Express, these contracts would have remained profitable. A spokesperson for Virgin Trains - which has operated train services for 22 years - said it would work with First Trenitalia to ""ensure a seamless handover for customers, who should still book and travel as normal"". The Department for Transport said that by December 2022, there would be 263 extra train services every week, with Motherwell set to become a major calling point for most West Coast Partnership services. Direct services from London to destinations including Llandudno and Gobowen will now be introduced, while Walsall will get its first direct InterCity services. Subject to approval from the Office of Rail and Road, First Trenitalia will operate two trains an hour between Liverpool and London - a route thatVirgin Trains had said it also hopes to run by launching a new hourly train service between the two cities from May 2021.

Drowned girl's mum accuses police force of racism,"Shukri Abdi died on 27 June The mother of a 12-year-old girl who drowned has claimed institutional racism within the police means the family may never know how she died. Shukri Abdi drowned in the River Irwell in Bury, in Greater Manchester, on 27 June. The family claim officers failed to carry out a full investigation and treated them differently because of their ethnic background. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) previously said the death was a ""tragic incident"" and it did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances. It has now told the BBC it is ""still investigating on behalf of the coroner"". Shukri's mother, Zam Zam Ture, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that when she reported her daughter missing on the day of her death, police initially failed to act. Approximately 10 hours later, she said, she was informed that her daughter had been found dead, but described police as ""not sympathetic"". She said they spoke to her ""harshly"" and were ""trying to convince [her] that her daughter had been swimming"", which the family say was unlikely as Shukri could not swim, had been wearing full Islamic dress and it would have been ""out of character"" for her to attempt to do so. Zam Zam Ture says police spoke to her ""harshly"" when informing her of her daughter's death The family's lawyer Attiq Malik said ""within hours"" of Shukri's death, GMP had published a press release saying there were no suspicious circumstances. He said this had left insufficient time to check all evidence trails and discount other possibilities. ""The family's firm position is they have only been treated in that way because of their race, and had it been a different racial background more sensitivity would have been given, more investigation would have been done,"" he said. Institutional racism, he claimed, meant officers had acted in such a way without ""even realising it"". Their claims are now being investigated by the police watchdog, the IOPC. The IOPC said: ""We treat complaints of this nature with the utmost seriousness, and I know GMP share the view that the IOPC has a responsibility to examine the actions of the force after Shukri was reported missing - not least for public confidence."" Shukri drowned in the River Irwell Ms Ture said her daughter had been unhappy at school prior to her death. She said she had personally reported instances of bullying to Broad Oak Sports College in Bury ""many times"". The school produced a report for the family, but Mr Malik said it ""essentially just said that they were not aware of any bullying"". He said the school failed to interview Shukri's mother for the report, despite promises, which he suggested showed they did not ""fully investigate"". Drowning case probed by police watchdog Bullying 'not part' of girl's drowning death Warning after girl, 12, drowns in river In a statement, head teacher Paul Greenhalgh said the school was ""deeply saddened to receive news of Shukri's tragic death"". ""We are currently working with Shukri's family in respect of any concerns which have been raised about the school [and] will be reviewing all policies and procedures at the school,"" he added. ""In particular, we will focus on the school's anti-bullying policy and procedures and other policies relating to the welfare of children.""

Apprentice Boys recognise 'upset' over band uniform,"This video can not be played Graeme Stenhouse said the Apprentice Boys had no prior knowledge of the uniform worn by Clyde Valley Flute Band The Apprentice Boys of Derry have said they recognise the potential upset caused to nationalists by a Parachute Regiment emblem worn by a visiting flute band during a parade in the city. They said they had no prior knowledge of the uniform worn by Clyde Valley Flute Band during Saturday's march. The Larne group wore a Parachute Regiment insignia on their shirts as they paraded, bearing the letter 'F'. Police escorted them during the parade, and later stopped the band's bus. The Apprentice Boys governor said on Tuesday night that the Apprentice Boys were unaware of the incident until after the parade. PSNI defends loyalist parade tactics Petrol bombs thrown at police in Londonderry Thousands in Derry for Apprentice Boys parade ""We had no prior knowledge of the band's uniform, or this incident, until the conclusion of the main parade on Bond Street,"" he said. ""We recognise this may have caused upset to many in the nationalist community."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the Apprentice Boys statement as a ""positive step that will contribute to healing in the city"". ""It is welcome and demonstrates the kind of leadership that Derry and the north needs right now,"" he added. Mr Stenhouse added that the main focus of the parade is to commemorate the 1689 Siege of Derry. He said it should in no way be used as a means to ""heighten tensions in a shared city"". The governor again rejected claims that an agreement about symbols supporting the Parachute Regiment had been put in place before the march. ""This agreement never took place,"" he said. ""We would never place our marshals under such difficult circumstances."" Members of Clyde Valley Flute Band from Larne wore the symbol with the letter 'F' on their shirts Mr Stenhouse said the police were ""heavy handed"" in how they dealt with the band and that he would discuss the matter further with local police commanders. ""A lot of hard work has been contributed to ensuring peaceful parades over many years,"" he said. ""We wish to continue with this constructive dialogue to ensure that good will and understanding prevails. ""We also wish to ensure our city continues to lead in promoting reconciliation and is a model of respect to all communities."" This video can not be played Arlene Foster said the policing of an Apprentice Boys parade in Londonderry was not balanced. Earlier on Tuesday, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said that a lot of loyalists are concerned by the police approach. ""It is important that everybody in the community in Northern Ireland has support for the police service. That's a fundamental of our society,"" she said. ""Therefore it concerns us greatly if there's a perception building that there isn't that confidence in policing. It's something that we are very concerned about."" The DUP and UUP met PSNI officials separately to discuss Saturday's policing operation. UUP leader Robin Swann, who led his party's delegation, said ""intervention could've been handled in a completely different way"". This video can not be played UUP leader Robin Swann ""The deployment of the TSG (Tactical Support Group), in my opinion, was uncalled for, unnecessary, and obviously too early because they should have given the elected representatives and stewards from the Apprentice Boys of Derry an opportunity to see what resolution could have come about before the TSG was deployed,"" he added. Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said he ""listened carefully to all the strong concerns that have been raised"" and that there will be a full debrief of the force's actions. Thirteen people were shot dead when members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators on Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972. This video can not be played Apprentice Boys: Police parade approach 'kept people safe' An ex-paratrooper, known as Soldier F, is facing prosecution for two murders. Relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday said the band's display caused great hurt. ""People are very angry about what happened,"" said John Kelly, whose brother, Michael, was killed on Bloody Sunday. ""The way we look at it, and I'm talking about the families, and the people of Derry, we found it very, very provocative."" Members of the Apprentice Boys, one of the Protestant Loyal Orders, made their way around the city's historic walls accompanied by bands Police said an agreement had been put in place before the march, and officers flanked the band during the parade. But DUP MP Gregory Campbell shared Mr Stenhouse's opinion that there was no such agreement. Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said the insignia display by the band had caused ""deep anger in the city"". ""Ahead of Saturday's parade, assurances were given that there would be no Parachute Regiment or Soldier F imagery involved but this agreement was broken,"" she said. ""Subsequent Apprentice Boys denials of such an agreement do not stand up to scrutiny, and are in direct contravention of the accounts from the PSNI and the Bogside Residents Group."" Responding to criticism of how police handled the incident,Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd it was ""proportionate, responsible and constructive"". The Parades Commission said it had received a number of complaints regarding the Apprentice Boys parade. Governor of the Apprentice Boys, Graeme Stenhouse, laid a wreath at the cenotaph in Derry on Saturday Clyde Valley Flute Band said that the symbol on their shirts was an expression of ""a legitimately held view which they are entitled to hold"". ""The officers of the band wish to correct any false impression which may be held regarding the band's uniform being deliberately provocative and specifically designed for the parade in Londonderry,"" the band said in a statement. Mr Stenhouse earlier said he would be willing to meet the Bloody Sunday families and other community representatives. ""I'm more than willing to meet them if that's something that they wish to do,"" he said. ""What the Apprentice Boys have achieved over the last 20 years is taking things forward by talking to different communities. ""That's why we do have very successful parades now in the Maiden City. We'll discuss with other community representatives and if there's some hard, straight talking to be done, then that's something that we'll have to do.""

FirstGroup, based in Aberdeen, is being awarded the contract at a time when it has been overhauling its business, seeking a buyer for its Greyhound buses in the US.

Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""Awarding a complex contract for both the West Coast Partnership and HS2 services to FirstGroup, a company with questions over its finances, is a gross error of judgement.""

We have no doubt that First Trenitalia will build on that record with plans for new trains and more services.""

Virgin plans cheaper rival Liverpool-London train service Government should not manage railways, says review The transport secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was a ""new type of contract, the idea here is that the risk is shared so that when it comes to the changes that Keith Williams has proposed this is fully compliant with it. ""We need them [the rail companies] paid for running the blooming trains on time and not for doing a bunch of other things. And that's what this new contract on the West Coast is about."" The new partnership will operate in two phases. The first will run from 8 December to March 2026, when First Trenitalia will operate the existing InterCity West Coast services. The second phase will run from March 2026 to March 2031, when it will operate the HS2 high-speed rail service. Mr Shapps will tell MPs about the timescale and terms of reference of review of HS2 by Douglas Oakervee - a former chairman of the high-speed network  - in ""due course"", It said its 56 Pendolino trains would be completely refurbished, with more reliable free Wi-Fi and better catering. By 2022, it says, it will offer more than 260 extra services each week, increasing seat miles by more than 10% compared with 2017-18. This will cost Â£117m, the Department for Transport said. The trains that run up and down the West Coast Main Line are called Pendolinos, with underlying technology supplied by what was Fiat Ferroviaria. Fitting, then, that an Italian company should finally start running the line - Trenitalia is the joint venture partner of First Group in the new West Coast franchise. Some rail commentators greeted this morning's announcement with surprise: not that First Group and the Italians had won it, but that a decision had been made at all. The government's franchising policy has been in disarray, with legal challenges, an abandoned competition, and in the background, a wide-ranging review of how the railways are run. The findings of that review, by former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams, are about to be published, so why award an important franchise just when the railways might be on the brink of another reorganisation? The Department for Transport says the West Coast deal is, in fact, a vision of things to come and has Mr Williams' blessing. It is apparently flexible enough to cope with whatever he recommends and the indications are that his main finding - that Network Rail should take a big role in the strategic direction of the railway - won't much impinge on this franchise. Another potential trap awaits, however. Stagecoach, one of the First Group's rivals, was in the running for the West Coast deal until it was blocked from bidding, because it refused to take on pensions risk. It has won the right to a judicial review of that decision. FirstGroup, based in Aberdeen, is being awarded the contract at a time when it has been overhauling its business, seeking a buyer for its Greyhound buses in the US. It is also looking at spinning off its UK bus division, First Bus. Its First Rail business also operates the South Western Railway and TransPennine Express. Its chief executive, Matthew Gregory, had indicated the group's train franchises could be reviewed, depending on the terms offered by the government. However, Mr Gregory's concerns about the profitability of train franchises appear to have been addressed by the Department for Transport. The West Coast Main Line runs up and down the UK Mr Gregory said: ""The differences between this contract and more traditional rail franchises were reflected in the terms set out by the [Department for Transport], which has resulted in  a more appropriate balance of risks and rewards for us as operators. ""The West Coast Partnership's first phase allows us to earn returns on the significant investments in services and facilities for passengers, but protected by a much improved revenue risk-sharing mechanism. ""This will transition to a management contract in the second phase, ensuring we can really focus on using the respective skills and experience within our joint venture to deliver the desired benefits of the HS2 project for passengers and the country."" The RMT's general secretary, Mick Cash, described it as a ""another political fix by a government whose privatised franchise model is collapsing around their ears"" and warned it was ""doomed to failure and sure to result in yet more rail chaos"". Questions about the rail franchising system were raised last week, when the government cancelled the competition to operate rail services between London, Kent and parts of East Sussex -  currently run by Southeastern. The awarding of the West Coast Mainline route prompted Labourto renewed its call to nationalise the railways. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""Awarding a complex contract for both the West Coast Partnership and HS2 services to FirstGroup, a company with questions over its finances, is a gross error of judgement."" But Paul Plummer, chief executive of industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""Virgin-Stagecoach have brought significant benefits to passengers on the West Coast route including nearly tripling the number of trains between London and Manchester.  We have no doubt that First Trenitalia will build on that record with plans for new trains and more services."" But Mr Shapps told the BBC: ""Privatisation has allowed the railway to expand massively - twice as many people, twice as many journeys and record number of people travelling on our railways, so I don't think nationalisation is the answer at all. Why would you put politicians in control?"" The Department for Transport said  the new contract award was a ""significant move away from the previous flawed franchising system"" and would use a forecast revenue mechanism (FRM) - which offers protection against shortfalls in estimated revenues - to avoid a repeat of the issues that affected the previous East Coast Main Line franchise. Last year, serviceson the East Coast Main Line were brought back under government control. FirstGroup said that if such a system had been in use on its South Western Railway and TransPennine Express, these contracts would have remained profitable. A spokesperson for Virgin Trains - which has operated train services for 22 years - said it would work with First Trenitalia to ""ensure a seamless handover for customers, who should still book and travel as normal"". The Department for Transport said that by December 2022, there would be 263 extra train services every week, with Motherwell set to become a major calling point for most West Coast Partnership services. Direct services from London to destinations including Llandudno and Gobowen will now be introduced, while Walsall will get its first direct InterCity services. Subject to approval from the Office of Rail and Road, First Trenitalia will operate two trains an hour between Liverpool and London - a route thatVirgin Trains had said it also hopes to run by launching a new hourly train service between the two cities from May 2021.

Rail fares set to rise again in January,"Rail users in the UK will be hit by a further rise in ticket prices which will come into effect next year. The increase will be based on the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation measure for July of 2.8%. The figure is likely to lead to an increase of more than Â£100 in the annual cost of getting to work for many commuters. Passenger groups urged a change in the way ticket prices are calculated, as RPI is no longer a national statistic. The cost of most train fares are set by train companies themselves, but about 40% of fares in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated so that they are only allowed to rise by an amount pegged to the RPI rate of inflation in July the previous year. These regulated fares include annual season tickets. The government's preferred measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), increased to 2.1%. What is the UK's inflation rate? New 50% off 16-17 railcard on sale next week The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) has repeatedly said that CPI, the most widely watched and used measure of inflation, should be used instead of RPI. Last month this was 2% and it is typically lower than the RPI rate of inflation. CBT chief executive Darren Shirley said the expected ticket price rises were ""exorbitant"". ""The government should commit now to January's fares rise being linked to CPI,"" he added. The difference between the two is stark. For every Â£100 paid on a season ticket, using RPI over CPI has increased prices by about Â£6 since RPI was abandoned by the National Audit Office as a national statistic in 2013. ""The only benefactors of using the retail price index (RPI) to calculate the cost of rail fares are the train companies,"" said Kevin Brown, savings specialist at Scottish Friendly, an investment firm. ""Passengers are therefore having to fork out more money to travel despite regularly having to deal with over-crowded and unpredictable services. The general outlook for consumers is already difficult and this will feel like another kick in the teeth for many hard-working families who are facing the prospect of a second recession in 10 years. A monthly season ticket from Widnes to Liverpool, currently costing Â£129.80 will cost Â£133.43, an increase of Â£3.63. A monthly pass from Reading to London will go from Â£442.00 to Â£454.38, up Â£12.38. A season ticket from Bath Spa to Bristol Temple Meads today costs Â£162.10 a month. From January it will be Â£166.64, up Â£4.54. Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said:  ""It's tempting to suggest fares should never rise. However, the truth is that if we stop investing in our railway, then we will never see it improved."" Rail firm offers free trips to university open day Reality Check: Where does your train fare go? FirstGroup replaces Virgin to run West Coast route The TUC, a federation of unions, renewed its call for the railway to be renationalised, arguing it would lead to lower ticket prices. ""We're already paying the highest ticket prices in Europe to travel on overcrowded and understaffed trains. ""The number one priority should be running a world-class railway service, not subsidising private train companies,"" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. Rachael, a commuter in Watford, Hertfordshire, told the BBC: ""I've seen the rail fares increasing again this year, and for me it's just becoming impossible to justify, and I'm worried I'll be priced out of working in London within a few years if this keeps happening. ""The cost of my train ticket, and the dreadful service is causing me such grief, and I'm only travelling from Watford junction to Euston. It costs me Â£3,680 on an annual ticket. ""Something needs to change. Please."" The bitter irony for rail passengers is that the quality of service in Britain is all too often undeserving of the price. After a cataclysmic year on parts of the network last year, punctuality was generally on the up this year before the hot, and then wet and windy, weather caused significant disruption this summer. The promise (via an ongoing Government-commissioned rail review) is that our train companies of the future will only make money if they run trains on time. In principle that sounds good for passengers but we still don't know how it will work in practice and when such a system will actually arrive at a station near you. The wider financial dilemma for Government is that our rail network is in large parts ageing and in need of a refit. Infrastructure upgrade work costing the taxpayer billions is ongoing or planned. Government sources point out that a relatively small proportion of public transport journeys are made by train (roughly 17%). Therefore, they argue, a rise in ticket prices, however painful for passengers, is a necessary evil to meet the rising costs linked to running the railways. At the start of this year, train fares went up by an average of 3.1% in England and Wales and 2.8% in Scotland. The rise in England and Wales - the highest since January 2013 - meant the price of some annual season tickets rose by more than Â£100. In Scotland, peak-time season tickets and anytime day tickets became 3.2% more expensive, while the capped increase of off-peak fares was 2.2%. Rail passengers have had to endure more delays on the network this year. Last week was particularly bad, with thousands of people affected by a signal failure,which led to the suspension of all services out of London Euston,on Thursday. And thentrains were also affected in Friday's power cut,with many stranded across the network Delays also happened during July's heatwave,while in January,London Overground commuters were given a month's free travelafter delays to the delivery of new electric trains.

HK flights resume as airport restricts protesters,"Flights have now resumed at Hong Kong airport Hong Kong airport has resumed operations after a night of chaos which saw protesters clash with riot police. Hundreds of flights were cancelled on Tuesday after protesters flooded the terminal buildings. Early on Wednesday flights appeared to be running as scheduled, though some still remained delayed or cancelled. After days of disruptions, the Airport Authority said it had obtained a temporary injunction banning protesters from entering certain areas. It said in a statement that people would be ""restrained from attending or participating in any demonstration or protest... in the airport other than in the area designated by the Airport Authority"". Additional security measures have been put in place restricting access to the terminal - with only staff and passengers with valid boarding passes allowed in. Hong Kong is in its tenth week of anti-government protests. How weeks of protests have hit Hong Kong tourism Hong Kong protests in 300 words The airport, one of the world's busiest, has been the site of daily protests since last Friday but they had been mostly peaceful. On Tuesday, protesters blocked travellers from accessing flights, using luggage trolleys to build barriers, and staging a mass sit-down. Some protesters held signs apologising to passengers for the inconvenience caused by their demonstrations. However, things escalated when one man was set upon by protesters reportedly because they thought he was an undercover police officer. Police, wearing riot gear and brandishing truncheons, later arrived at the airport and clashed with protesters. The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Why Cathay Pacific changed its tune on HK protests In one video, a policeman is seen frantically drawing his gun on protesters after being attacked with his own truncheon for manhandling a woman. Hong Kong police said the officer's life was ""under great danger"" and insisted he only drew his gun ""out of emergency and necessity"" and ""exercised great restraint"". This video can not be played A police officer draws his gun and aims at protesters in the airport building Protesters had boxed him into a corner after prying the baton from his hands during a violent skirmish. After collapsing to the ground, the policeman was eventually dragged to safety by his fellow officers. At least two other men, also suspected of being police officers, were also confronted by protesters. One was held for several hours and his hands zip-tied. Paramedics were initially blocked from evacuating the man, even as he appeared to lose consciousness. The actions came after Hong Kong police admitted on Monday that disguised officers were being planted among anti-government protesters. The editor of Chinese state media outlet the Global Times later said one of the men attacked was a reporter from the outlet. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The BBC's Asia-Pacific editor Michael Bristow says Chinese censors are allowing a video of the reporter's ordeal to be shared in mainland China, where news of the Hong Kong demonstrations is strictly controlled. On Wednesday, police likened the treatment of the men to ""torture"" and said they had arrested five men. Overnight, protest groups issued online apologies for the violence, saying they were ""scared"" and appealed for help. Some also handed out apology leaflets and chocolate to people arriving at the airport's train station. Separately, the Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific airline has fired two pilots for protesting after China demanded that they suspend personnel involved in the demonstrations. By Pody Lui, BBC Chinese service, Hong Kong ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong"" could be heard clearly in the arrival hall on Tuesday. Protesters were handing out posters to arriving tourists about what had happened in the past two months in Hong Kong, particularly an incident that happened on Sunday in a police dispersal action. A female protester was shot in the eye by police with a bean bag projectile. Occasionally, there were ""mini-parliaments"", where hundreds of protesters gathered and discussed what was next and how to encounter some possible scenarios in a peaceful manner. Everybody got their say as long as they raised their hand. Tourists undoubtedly were affected as they were not able to get into the security check area. Some cried, some chose to sleep through it. But some protesters offered to help them, including looking for accommodation, offering free food and drinks, and certainly apologising to them. The Hong Kong government has condemned the violence at the airport, saying it would take action against those found responsible. How could China intervene in Hong Kong protests? In pictures: Chaos as activists occupy terminal In a statement on Wednesday, it called the ""violent acts... outrageous"" and said that they had ""overstepped the bottom line of a civilised society"". It added that the police would take ""relentless enforcement action to bring the persons involved to justice"". China's Hong Kong affairs office condemned on Wednesday what it called ""near-terrorist acts"" at the airport. Anti-government protests started in June in response to a proposed extradition bill, which has now been suspended, but have evolved into a more demanding pro-democracy movement. They are being fuelled by fears that the freedoms Hong Kong enjoys as a special administrative region of China are being eroded. Are you at the airport? Have you been affected by recent events?

Media giants to merge in latest mega-dealThe deal between CBS and Viacom combines Paramount Pictures and some of TV's most-watched shows.,"The Late Late Show has been a fixture on US television for years Entertainment giants CBS and Viacom are to merge in the latest media mega-deal as broadcasters adapt to changing consumer demands. The new company will have $28bn in revenue and comprise brands like MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures. The deal would reunite the two firms, which were previously under the same corporate umbrella until a 2006 split. The move comes amid an increasingly competitive landscape dominated by Netflix, Disney-Fox and other rivals. The merged firm, to be called ViacomCBS, would be controlled by National Amusements, the holding company owned by billionaire Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari. There have been at least three attempts to re-combine the companies, but all failed due to clashes between executives and investors over who got the top jobs as well as the valuations of the business. There was also the dramatic fall of CBS's boss Les Moonves,ousted after allegations of sexual misconduct. Viacom chief executive Bob Bakish will be the president and chief executive of the combined company. Joe Ianniello, interim chief executive of CBS, will be named chairman and chief of CBS. The companies said,externalthey expected about $500m cost savings from the tie-up, which brings together a movie studio, string of cable channels, and some of US TV's most-watched shows, including 60 Minutes and The Big Bang Theory. In addition to their US operations, the merged group will have a global reach, including in Britain, Argentina and Australia. ""I am really excited to see these two great companies come together so that they can realise the incredible power of their combined assets,"" said Shari Redstone, who will chair the new company, ViacomCBS. The daughter of Sumner Redstone said: ""My father once said 'content is king,' and never has that been more true than today. We will establish a world-class, multiplatform media organisation that is well-positioned for growth in a rapidly transforming industry."" Mr Redstone broke up CBS and Viacom 14 years ago. He believed it would unlock the value of Viacom, which was broadcasting some of TV's most popular shows at a time when CBS was becoming less popular. Shari Redstone had been a big backer of re-combining the companies in the face of tough competition. The mergers of Disney with Fox,  and AT&T and Time Warner, coupled with expanding streaming services, left CBS and Viacom in a weaker position.

Trump delays some tariffs on Chinese imports,"The US is delaying imposing tariffs on some imports from China until 15 December because of ""health, safety, national security and other factors"". The products include mobile phones, laptops, video game consoles, some toys, computer monitors, and certain footwear and clothing. The surprise news from the United States Trade Representative,externaloffice sparked a rally in share prices. Other items facing a 10% tariff will go ahead as planned on 1 September. US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters, said that the delay was in part to avoid hitting US shoppers this Christmas. The USTR's announcement was released minutes after China's Ministry of Commerce said Vice Premier Liu He had conducted a phone call with US trade officials. US-China trade war in 300 words Technology investors welcomed news of the exemptions, pushing an index of chip stocks up 2.8%. Retailers and industrial shares also rose, with General Electric up 4.4%. On Wall Street, the three main share indexes were up more than 2% at one stage. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 finished 1.4% ahead, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq finished up 1.9% - led by a 4% rise in Apple. In the UK, stocks exposed to global trade also rose, with miner Glencore closing up 2.3%. Mr Trump said on 1 August he would impose a 10% tariff on $300bn of Chinese goods, blaming China for not following through on promises to buy more American agricultural products. He also personally criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping for failing to do more to stem sales of the synthetic opioid fentanyl amid an opioid overdosing crisis in the US. But in a tweet on Tuesday, Mr Trump hinted that he was expecting something in return, suggesting that China's failure to ""buy big"" from US farmers could be about to change. The USTR's announcement comes amid growing concerns about a global economic slowdown. Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that fears of the US-China trade war leading to a recession were increasing. Some analysts said Tuesday's delay does not mean the trade war is over. Elena Duggar, associate managing director at credit rating agency Moody's, said: ""This seeming de-escalation in ongoing tensions may be a temporary reprieve... Relations between the world's two largest economies will remain contentious, punctuated with occasional steps towards compromise."" Earlier on Tuesday, China's chief trade negotiators, Vice Premier Liu He and Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, spoke to their US counterparts, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The Xinhua news agency said that the Chinese officials issued ""a solemn protest"" against the punitive duties set to come into effect on 1 September. Mr Lighthizer and Mr Liu have scheduled another telephone call in two weeks. The two sides were due to hold another round of meetings in Washington in September, but the deterioration in relations in the past two weeks cast doubt on whether the talks would take place. Additional details and lists of the specific product types affected by the announcement are due to be published by USTR later.
