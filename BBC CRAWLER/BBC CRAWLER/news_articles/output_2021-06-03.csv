Groups of 30 to be able to meet outdoors in Wales,"This video can not be played Covid: Social distancing to stay as 'personal repertoire' Social distancing could continue in Wales for the rest of the year, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said it remained one of the ""strongest defences"" against Covid. The warning comes after the news outdoor sporting events and concerts can resume from Monday for up to 10,000 people sitting or 4,000 standing. Extended households can also expand to include a third and up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors, including in private gardens. But, Mr Drakeford said he was ""not certain there is a huge thirst"" for people to give up safeguards, including the 2m social distancing rule. ""I think they will remain part of the repertoire here in Wales during the rest of the summer, and maybe into the rest of this year,"" he told a coronavirus press briefing. ""Whether we will be able to move from them being mandatory to just [things] we advise people about will depend on whether we continue to see improvements of the position here in Wales."" Allowing more people to meet indoors was ruled out until at least late June, as other lockdown rules were eased. The decision to delay comes amid ""growing concern"" overthe Delta variant, first identified in India, and the Welsh government said the delay was designed to allow more people to get vaccinated. There are currently 97 cases of the variant in Wales, up 67% compared with the previous week. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Postcode check: How are the rules changing for you? Welsh government signals return of sports fans Mr Drakeford said: ""The risk of infection is significantly less outdoors than it is indoors. This is why we are phasing in the changes in this three-week cycle. ""This will allow more people to enjoy events outdoors and take advantage of the Welsh summer, while we continue to roll out the vaccination programme to all adults."" However, he added: ""We have to be realistic. The fact that the Delta variant is spreading so quickly in the north-west of England will mean that it will cross the border into Wales. ""That is why we are delaying some of the measures we might otherwise take to maximise the amount of vaccination that we can carry out because that is our best defence against that new variant."" The lockdown measures will be reviewed again on 21 June. The changes - described as a phased move toWales' alert level one,external- will begin from Monday. It means three households are able to meet indoors and have physical contact - but each household can only meet one other at a time. A further household with a single adult, or single adult with caring responsibilities, will still be able to join extended households. Further rule changes on indoor activity will be considered by the Welsh government before 21 June - when anending to restrictions in Englandmay happen. Call for pub rules to be lifted Why are hospitality workers leaving the industry? Pubs and restaurants have been allowed to serve customers inside from 17 May, however, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective has calledfor all significant restrictions to be liftedbefore July, including scrapping the 2m social distancing rule. WeMakeEvents organised protests and campaigns to help support the arts Sarah Hemsley-Cole, of campaign group WeMakeEvents Cymru, said the announcement was ""great news"" for the industry, having been crippled by repeated lockdowns. In recent weeks aseries of test eventshave been held, including the Tafwyl andEid festivals in Cardiff Castle, while the upcoming Wales v Albania football match at Cardiff City Stadium is limited to 4,000 spectators. Ms Hemsley-Cole said while they were happy with the Welsh government's ""cautious"" approach, the test events had been ""incredibly restrictive"" with some limited to just 100 people amid social distancing. She added: ""The reality is, as long as there is social distancing, that is a challenge for the sector... it's a real challenge to make things work, and people sort of forget they have to maintain it. ""But we understand it is there to make us safe and we will find solutions and a way to make it work."" Up to 4,000 standing can attend outdoor events in Wales from 7 June Annual events, such as Brecon Jazz andGreen Man Festival, were waiting to seeif they would be allowed to go ahead this summer, while Live Nation have confirmed they will now hold four outdoor concerts, each for up to 10,000 people, in Cardiff Bay in September. ""There's been an optimistic outlook for the last month or so but we're very pleased with this news,"" said Rob Waller, of Live Nation. ""It's great to have live music back."" The Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd says businesses will be concerned there were no announcements on financial support. Andrew RT Davies said: ""There's Â£140m of unallocated money in the Welsh government's coffers for business support but there was no mention of that."" Plaid Cymru welcomed the changes but pressed for more support to businesses while ""the economic devastation of the pandemic remains."" Welsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds welcomed the ""cautious"" move, but warned that after more than a year of changing restrictions, people were ""exhausted"". She also wanted a review of the rules on hospital visits. Despite concerns over the Delta variant, Wales will not push for a ban on travel from hot-spots in England, similar to thatdemanded last year. ""I don't think that's the position that we are in at the moment,"" said Mr Drakeford. ""We are asking people coming into Wales from those hotspot areas to behave carefully and responsibly, to take all the precautions you would expect them to take to keep themselves and other people safe."" Wales has the highest vaccination rate in the UK, with 2,169,624 people having been given a first vaccine dose, or 68.5%. Figures also show 1,181,259 people have now had a second jab, almost 40% of the population of Wales. The case rate in Walesis currently 8 per 100,000 people over seven days. A cluster of cases, attributed to the Delta variant, has been responsible fora spike in Conwy county, taking the case rate there to 23. There have been no new deaths with covid reported in Walesfor the past nine days. RUGBY - THE COST OF CONCUSSION:Have opportunities to protect players from brain injuries been missed?

Biden expands US investment ban on Chinese firms,"US President Joe Biden is set to ban Americans from investing in dozens of Chinese tech and defence firms with alleged military ties. The new executive order will come into effect on 2 August, hitting 59 firms including communications giant Huawei. The list of firms will be updated on a rolling basis. It expands an order previously issued by former President Donald Trump. Even before the official announcement, China suggested it would retaliate. Under the new order, US investors will be banned from buying or selling publicly-traded securities for other companies including the China General Nuclear Power Corporation, China Mobile Limited and Costar Group. It expands the previous list from 31 firms to include surveillance companies and is aimed at ensuring ""US persons are not financing the military industrial complex of the People's Republic of China,"" one White House official said. US and China hold first trade talks of Biden era US accuses China of acting more aggressively ""The prohibitions are intentionally targeted and scoped to maximise the impact on the targets while minimising harm to global markets,"" the official added. Huawei recently said that sanctions imposed on it by the US in 2019 have had a major impact on its mobile phone business. The US took action amid claims that the company posed a security risk and last July, andthe UK said it would exclude the companyfrom building its 5G network. The new list of companies barred from US investment will update one from the Department of Defense. ""We fully expect that in the months ahead... we'll be adding additional companies to the new executive order's restrictions,"" the White House said. It comes as the surveillance of citizens, including Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region in particular,has come under scrutiny. The Biden administration has also accused China of acting more aggressively abroad and more repressively at home. This video can not be played Why does Chinaâs economy matter to you? The China-US relationship is crucial to both sides and the wider world, with Beijing repeatedly calling on the new administration in Washington to improve relations which deteriorated under predecessor Donald Trump. In their first meeting under the Biden presidency last month, the two countries' top trade negotiators held ""candid, pragmatic"" talks on their trading relationship. President Biden has insisted, however, that existing tariffs will be kept in place for now as he looks to boost the US economy, which was hit hard early in the pandemic but is now recovering. Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin suggested China would retaliate against the latest measures. ""China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and resolutely support Chinese enterprises in safeguarding their rights and interests in accordance with the law,"" he said.

Labour demands further probe into PM's flat revamp,"Parliament's sleaze watchdog should investigate the funding of the prime minister's Downing Street flat refurbishment, Labour says. Boris Johnsonwas last week clearedof misconduct and of breaking the ministerial code by his adviser on ministerial interests. But Lord Geidt said the prime minister had ""acted unwisely"". Labour says he might have broken the rules governing the conduct of MPs after failing to declare a donation. Labour is keen to increase the pressure on Mr Johnson over the renovations to his flat as part of its wider charge of cronyism against the government, and has written to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, Kathryn Stone. Downing St flat: PM cleared but 'acted unwisely' What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? Johnson appoints new standards adviser Last Friday, Lord Geidt - who was appointed by the PM in April as his ministerial standards adviser - said Tory donor Lord Brownlow had paid an invoice to cover some of the costs for the works, which were overseen by Mr Johnson's wife Carrie. He accepted that Mr Johnson had not been aware how the bill had been paid but rebuked him for ""unwisely"" allowing the refurbishment to proceed ""without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded"". At the time, Labour said it was ""staggering"" that Mr Johnson could ""rack up"" a bill ""yet have no knowledge of how it was eventually paid"". Now, the party says Mr Johnson still has more questions to answer in his capacity as an MP, which falls under the remit of Ms Stone. In the letter to the commissioner, Labour's Deputy leader, Angela Rayner, noted Ms Stone had previously reprimanded Mr Johnson in 2019 for failing to register a share of a property within the required time frame, and warned any further breaches may warrant ""more serious sanction"". But Ms Rayner said ""far from learning the lessons of his previous transgressions, the prime minister has continued with his attitude of treating basic standards of integrity, openness and transparency with contempt, and behaving as though there is one rule for him and another for everyone else,"". She says the fact that Mr Johnson told Lord Geidt he became aware of the donations for the works on the flat in February this year but did not settle the invoices personally until 8 March suggests he is in breach of parliamentary rules that all MPs must follow. TheCode of Conduct for Members of Parliament,externalstates that all MPs must register financial interests, donations and gifts, and Mr Johnson, as prime minister, is not exempt from that. Ms Rayner added: ""I therefore write to request that you instigate a further investigation into the prime minister's failure to register this donation, using your powers as commissioner."" She also accused Mr Johnson of breaching the general principles on conduct in public life, including ""selflessness"", ""integrity"" and ""leadership"". Ms Stone is alreadyinvestigating whether Mr Johnson properly declared a Â£15,000 holidayon the Caribbean island of Mustique with his wife Carrie. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""Lord Geidt's independent report shows the prime minister acted in accordance with the ministerial code at all times and sets out the background to the intended establishment of a Downing Street trust. ""The report shows how, at all times, the prime minister followed the advice of officials and he has made a declaration in his list of ministerial interests, as advised by Lord Geidt. ""The House of Commons rules and Electoral Commission guidance are clear that support relating to ministerial activity should be declared through ministerial declarations and this has been done."" The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has the power to refer a case to the Committee on Standards if she deems it is serious enough and the committee can, in principle, recommend suspension. The sanction for less serious cases can require the MP to acknowledge and apologise for any breach. Mr Johnson faces two other inquiries in to the flat refurbishment. TheElectoral Commissionis conducting its own investigation in to whether the Conservative Party broke the rules on declaring donations over the Downing Street flat and has the power to issue a fine of up to Â£20,000. Meanwhile, Cabinet SecretarySimon Case, the UK's top civil servant, is also looking into the refurbishment, including whether donations were properly declared.

'Abhorrent' racist abusers taunted woman on train,"This video can not be played ""I'm not going to let racist abusers win"" A student felt ""trapped"" in her seat as a group directed racist chanting and Nazi salutes towards her on a train. Rose Williams said she and others were subjected to a stream of abuse after a group got on the Aberystwyth-bound train at Borth, Ceredigion, on Sunday. The microbiology student said the ""heinous attack"" came out of nowhere. British Transport Police (BTP) said it was treating it as a racist incident and transport bosses say they ""utterly condemn this abhorrent behaviour"". In a post widely shared on social media, Ms Williams shared video footage of a man pointing and laughing at her while shouting racist slurs in the carriage. Speaking to BBC Wales, she described in detail the language and abuse she had been subjected to. The student, who has lived in Aberystwyth for six years, said she was travelling back from a weekend away in Manchester with friends when the incident happened. She explained her friends had just got off, when a group of men and women came into the carriage at Borth and one of the men started pointing at her, calling her a ""big black dog"". ""It shocked me, it took me by surprise,"" she said. ""His friends joined in and they were all chanting, 'There's a dog on the train', raising their hands in the air like, jumping off their seats and laughing about it."" Ms Williams said she tried to remain calm as she was on her own, as the man started to change his chants, directing them towards other people of colour on the train. She said the abuse was continuous and lasted for about 20 minutes, adding she managed to film them before the train pulled into the station at Aberystwyth. Rose said she felt frightened as she tried to film the group as they stared and pointed at her Ms Williams said she felt so angry she could cry, but said she did not want to give the group the satisfaction of seeing her react, or ""let them win"". ""I was frozen in the seat, I was sat there shaking because I was angry and I was trying to not react and provoke or escalate the situation where it possibly become physical,"" she said. ""They were obviously looking for a reaction, that's why they continuously did it and did it, and I didn't give them that satisfaction. ""I was on my own on the train, I thought the best thing to do was to sit in silence and wait."" Sexual crimes and racism rise on Wales railway network Ms Williams said she texted her friends who met her at the station, and once out of sight of the group she broke down, before her friends helped her to report the incident to police. ""I've sat and gone through the situation in my head. I didn't say anything to these people, there was nothing that happened that provoked such a heinous attack on me, and the other people... it just came out of nowhere, he got on the train and started racially abusing us,"" she said. Ms Williams who described the university town as her second home said she had been subjected to racist abuse in the past but never to an extent where they ""verbalise the hate towards me for such a long period of time"". ""You see video footage of stuff like this happening to other people, I never thought it'd happen to me, although it was naive of me to think that, because I am a black woman,"" she added. Ms Williams said it was important people reported hate crime to the police, and she hoped they would not just get a slap on the wrist. A spokesperson for Transport for Wales, who run the service, said it was working closely with police with their investigations and urged anyone on the train to contact officers. ""We utterly condemn this abhorrent behaviour and are treating this report very seriously,"" they said.Â ""We encourage victims and those who witness such crimes to report it immediately - we will do all we can to help. ""We are proud of the diversity within Transport for Wales and the diversity of the customers we serve, and we stand together alongside our industry partners to say loud and clear that any form of hate crime will not be tolerated on our services."" A BTP spokesperson said they were investigating a report of a racist incident on board a train between Machynlleth and Aberystwyth. They urged anyone who had witnessed the incident to contact them.

Travel sector dismay over changes,"The travel and tourism industry has hit back after the announcement of tighter rules on foreign holidays. No more countries will be added to the green list and Portugal will be relegated to amber from next Tuesday. The government said Portugal had seen a doubling of infection rates since the previous travel review. Critics warned of a loss of jobs and confidence, while Easyjet said the government had torn up its own rules. Moving Portugal from the green to the amber list was a ""safety first approach"" to ""give us the best chance of unlocking domestically"", said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Labour said moving Portugal from green to amber on the UK's foreign travel system was ""not the answer"" and called for the amber list to be scrapped altogether. Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds accused the government of causing ""chaos with the mishandling of travel restrictions at the border"". In addition to not adding countries to the green list and relegating Portugal to amber, seven more countries have been added to the red list. All the changes will take effect on Tuesday at 04:00. In England'straffic light scheme,external, countries are classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests. Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalhave similar rules. The government saysyou should not holiday,externalin red or amber destinations - which means most countries. Holidays to countries on the green list can go ahead without quarantining when you return. There had been some speculation that Greek and Spanish islands could be added to the green list as well as Malta, Finland and parts of the Caribbean - but the government insisted it had to remain cautious. The UK government announced that Portugal would be on the travel green list on 7 May. Its low point for new cases (on a seven-day average) was 10 May and the number has been rising gradually since then. On 2 June, there were 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a touch higher than the UK at 5.1, although differences in the amount of testing being done make that comparison difficult. It is considerably higher than Israel, for example, which is still on the green list and had 0.2 new cases per 100,000 that day. The decision about which countries go on the green list is not just about the number of new cases, but a number of other criteria, such as the amount of testing capacity. That has not changed dramatically in the past month. Presence of variants of concern (VOCs) is also important. The latest report from the World Health Organization says all four VOCs have now been found in Portugal. A month ago, the variant first identified in India was not yet a VOC. The transport secretary says a new mutation of that variant has now been found in Portugal. British Airways said this was ""incredibly disappointing and confusing news, not just for aviation but also for our customers"". ""The UK has reached a critical point and urgently needs travel with low-risk countries, like the US, to re-start the economy, support devastated industries and reunite loved ones,"" a spokesperson said. Johan Lundgren, Easyjet's chief executive, said that with ""Portuguese rates similar to those in the UK"", relegating the country ""simply isn't justified by the science"". ""When this framework was put together, consumers were promised a waiting list to allow them to plan. ""Yet the government has torn up its own rule book and ignored the science, throwing people's plans into chaos, with virtually no notice or alternative options for travel from the UK. ""This decision essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world,"" he said. Jet2 said it would delay restarting flights from 23 June to 1 July. ""We know how disappointed our customers and independent travel agency partners will be following today's announcement, and we share their concerns and frustrations,"" said Steve Heapy, Jet2 chief executive. Charlie Cornish, Manchester Airports Group chief executive, said: ""We were told the traffic light system would allow people to travel safely, with the right measures in place to manage risk for different countries. ""But it is now clear the government doesn't trust its own system and that international travel is being unfairly scapegoated, with tens of thousands of jobs placed at risk in the process. Mr Lundgren says people want to go on holiday as soon as they can John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow Airport, said: ""Ministers spent last month hailing the restart of international travel, only to close it down three weeks later, all but guaranteeing another lost summer for the travel sector. ""Everyone wants to protect public health, but the entire point of the Global Travel Taskforce was to establish a system to unlock low-risk travel safely. ""Britain is the worst performing economy in the G7, and in the week that the prime minister hosts G7 leaders to launch his government's vision of Global Britain, he's sending a message that the UK will remain isolated from the rest of the world and closed to most of its G7 partners."" Virginia Messina, vice-president of the World Travel & Tourism Council, called the moves a ""huge disappointment for businesses and holidaymakers"", a point underlined by falls in the share prices of several airlines. She said: ""The government has once again cold-shouldered travel and tourism by refusing to add any new destinations to the already slim green list. ""The UK could and should leverage its hard-won competitive advantage from one of the world's best vaccine rollout programmes, to restore mobility and reopen the doors to safe international travel."" Paul Charles, chief executive of the PC Agency and spokesman for parts of the travel sector, said tighter restrictions ""will further threaten tens of thousands of jobs in aviation and travel, not to mention further damage consumer confidence"". He said that data showed several countries should be green-listed, so the government's decision ""defies logic"" and was being driven by ""a policy of fear"". John Foster, the CBI's director of policy, said businesses across the country were ""losing out on key links with trading partners just as the rest of the world is opening up"". ""The international travel sector is on its knees and unable to trade its way to recovery. Without a successful summer season, the government will need to consider further sector specific support to save jobs and skills essential for future growth,"" he added. The Caribbean island of Grenada was hoping to be put on green, and tourism minister Clarice Modeste Curwen said she was ""extremely disappointed"" not to be added. She said: ""Grenada has had just 161 cases of Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic and we have reported zero new cases locally since February. ""We strongly believe that Grenada should be added to the UK's green list as we have taken all the necessary measures to ensure the islands are safe and ready for visitors."" Shares in airlines and travel companies fell after the BBC reported that Portugal is set to move from green to amber. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, fell 5%, with Easyjet sinking about the same. Ryanair closed 1.3% lower and Tui fell about 4.5%. Are you in Portugal?

Portugal taken off UK green list amid case rise,"Portugal will be removed from the UK's green travel list from Tuesday, amid rising coronavirus cases and concern over a ""Nepal mutation of the so-called Indian variant"". It will join the amber list, meaning holidaymakers should not visit and returnees must isolate for 10 days. Seven nations - including Egypt, Costa Rica and Sri Lanka - will join the red list, with the toughest travel rules. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the move was a ""safety-first approach"". Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will adopt the same changes. Countries have their own rules about allowing visitors, so being on the UK's green list does not guarantee travellers can visit. Travel sector voices dismay over rule changes What are the rules for green, amber and red lists? More than half of UK adults fully vaccinated The red list will expand to include Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Trinidad and Tobago. People arriving in the UK from these destinations will be required to stay in a quarantine hotel for 10 days at a fixed cost of Â£1,750 per adult. The changes come into effect at 04:00 BST on Tuesday. No new countries will be added to the green list, Mr Shapps said. The removal of Portugal means the green list will, from Tuesday, consist of: Australia, Brunei, the Falkland Islands, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Iceland, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. The transport secretary said two factors had led to the decision to downgrade Portugal, along with the islands of Madeira and the Azores. ""One is the positivity rate has nearly doubled since the last review in Portugal,"" he said. ""And the other is there's a sort of Nepal mutation of the so-called Indian variant [now known as Delta] which has been detected and we just don't know the potential for that to be a vaccine-defeating mutation."" On the so-called ""Nepal mutation"", Public Health England told the BBC it was ""aware of reports linking Nepal to Delta (VOC-21APR-02) with the additional mutation K417N"". ""This variant is present in multiple countries including a small number of cases in the UK, detected through rapid testing and whole genome sequencing,"" PHE said. ""We are investigating K417N to better understand its significance."" On 2 June, Portugal had 5.4 new cases per 100,000 people per day, which was only a little higher than the UK at 5.1 - but differences in the amount of testing being done make direct comparisons difficult. Kerry says the prospect of a holiday was a ray of hope after a ""year of hell"" Kerry, a photographer from the Wirral, says her family - like many others - have had ""the year from hell"". Her partner has been shielding for over a year due to an auto-immune disease, Kerry has had to nurse her mother through Covid-19 and a stroke, and her 18-month old son has hardly known a world without a pandemic. She was just about to book a trip to Portugal when the rules changed. ""This holiday was everything for us our first with our baby who has had no experiences in his first 18 months on this planet,"" she says. But others say they are likely to make the trip anyway. One man told the BBC: ""Unless they say, you must not go, you will be fined if you go, we might well still go and just have to bear the additional costs of an extra PCR test and the fact that we have to quarantine."" Read more travellers' reactions Labour said downgrading Portugal was ""not the answer"" and called for the amber list to be scrapped altogether. The travel and tourism industry also voiced dismay, as shares fell in airlines and travel companies after the BBC first reported plans to lower Portugal's rating. EasyJet's chief executive accused the government of having ""torn up its own rule book"", saying the decision ""essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world"". The chief executive of Heathrow Airport said: ""Ministers spent last month hailing the restart of international travel, only to close it down three weeks later."" The debate over travel rules comes after it was announced that more than half of the UK's adult population has now been vaccinated. A total of 26,422,303 second doses have been given out since the vaccine rollout began nearly six months ago. Meanwhile, cases continue to rise in the UK with another 5,274 infections reported on Thursday, and another 18 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive test.

Travel guide to holiday hotspots,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations.

MoT lift faults and cancelled tests cost Â£4m,"Fears over the safety of equipment led to a backlog of MoTs Equipment failures at Northern Ireland's MoT centres that led to the cancellation of thousands of tests cost Â£3.9m, a report has found. Last year,cracks were discovered in 52 out of 55 liftsleading to significant disruption at vehicle test centres. Stormont's Public Accounts Committee found the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) had not correctly projected the lifespan of the lifts. The DVA should have been more rigorous with a lift replacement plan, it said. ""We find it ironic that an organisation in the business of testing the road-worthiness of vehicles was not able to ensure that its own equipment was being properly maintained,"" said committee chairman William Humphrey. The report, published on Thursday, examined the suspension of vehicle testing services due to safety issues. It followed two reviews commissioned by the minister for infrastructure that were carried out by independent engineers and the Northern Ireland Civil Service's Internal Audit and Fraud Investigation Services. Mr Humphrey said it was not the first time that problems had arisen within the DVA, with ""long MoT waiting times"" during 2019. He pointed out that the loss of equipment meant the DVA lost about Â£2.95m worth of income in the 2019-20 year. ""At the same time, DVA incurred costs of Â£980,000, primarily due to compensation for cancelled tests and then was required to spend Â£1.8m to replace 52 out of 55 scissor lifts,"" he said. Thousands of MoTs cancelled over cracked lifts Faults found on 48 out of 55 lifts in MOT centres Last February, it was reported that centres were operating at about half the normal capacity due to the safety concerns. About 1,500 vehicles were usually tested every day across Northern Ireland and about the same number would have been cancelled. At the time, an external review suggested aninadequate inspection regime and metal fatigueled to the situation with the scissor lifts, which are used to inspect the underside of vehicles. The BBC obtained a picture of a crack in a lift at one of the vehicle test centres The report also found that the DVA was ""overly reliant"" on a contractor and its maintenance schedule, and relied ""too heavily"" on a positive equipment survey in 2018, even though the scissor lifts were carrying out significantly more procedures than originally designed. While welcoming the fact a plan to address failings had been put in place after the independent review and audit, Mr Humphrey said the DVA needed to ""renew and strengthen its focus on customer service"". ""We are keen to see DVA's improvements through quarterly progress reports and look forward to the agency providing the service that people in Northern Ireland deserve,"" he said. The committee recommended: An estimated life-span of crucial equipment must be determined and a phased replacement programme put in place for all equipment to minimise disruption That the DVA should strengthen its oversight of the contract with Maha, particularly regarding the maintenance regime The DVA should ensure future relationships with new suppliers are underpinned by contracts that include strong performance and penalty clauses That the Department for Infrastructure should commission a review of the arrangements for the DVA and assess its effectiveness, including customer service, as it has been operating as a full trading fund for five years Thousands of MoTs cancelled over cracked lifts MOT exemptions for drivers hit by cancellations Faults found on 48 out of 55 lifts in MOT centres Use of MOT centre lifts suspended in fault check Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump faces sentencing in New York hush-money case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Poots denies refusal to go to north-south meetings,"Edwin Poots, Paul Givan and MicheÃ¡l Martin after the meeting Democratic Unionist Party leader Edwin Poots has said he will lead DUP ministers at this month's North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in Dublin. Mr Poots had denied boycotting some meetings in protest against the NI Protocol. After his first meeting as party leader with Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin, he confirmed plans to attend the next meeting. Mr Martin said they had shared an ""open exchange of views"". Speaking after the meeting, Mr Martin said they discussed a number of issues including north-south cooperation, the protocol and Covid-19. He said he recognised the ""genuine concerns in unionist and loyalist communities around the protocol"". The taoiseach said the focus must be on getting issues resolved and an ""obvious way to do this would be to reach agreement between the EU and UK on a temporary veterinary agreement - which would do away with 80% of checks at NI ports"". Mr Poots, who described the meeting as ""positive, frank and useful"", said most of their discussion had focused on the protocol. The protocol is thepart of the Brexit dealthat creates the Irish Sea border. He said they also talked about fulfilling commitments made in the New Deal New Decade agreement in a timely fashion. Before Thursday's meeting took place, he had said there was ""a lot of anger"" among the unionist community towards the protocol and said north-south relations ""have never been as bad"".

""I do not blame the current taoiseach for that, I blame the past taoiseach,"" Mr Poots said. ""Northern Ireland cannot be a plaything of the European Union or indeed of the southern government."" Later, on Irish broadcaster RTÃ's Prime Time programme, Mr Poots said he did not believe the protocol, as it currently exists, ""is fixable"". ""It is an international agreement that isn't working,"" he added. ""The 15,000 checks per week, more than there would be in the port of Rotterdam - in Belfast and Larne, from goods coming from Britain to a population of 1.8 million, is not feasible, it is not deliverable, it is not implementable and will not be implemented. ""Europe needs to wake up and smell the coffee here."" The new DUP leader said he planned to go to the British Irish Council meeting in Fermanagh next week. He said he believed outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster ""would like to lead on that and I would very much like her to do that"". His comments were made after Sinn FÃ©in joined the SDLP inseeking legal adviceover the DUP's non-attendance at North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood told BBC NI's The View on Thursday night that Mr Poots' confirmation that he would attend the next NSMC meeting was ""good news"". ""I am glad to see it, because the north-south institutions are a key part of the Good Friday Agreement,"" he said. ""There wouldn't have been a Good Friday Agreement frankly that nationalists would have been involved in if there wasn't a north-south dimension, and I want all of the three strands of the Good Friday Agreement to be fully implemented."" This video can not be played Edwin Poots says north-south relationships 'have never been as bad' The NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Under the DUP's five-point plan in protest at post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, ministers are refusing to take part in north-south engagement where the protocol is being discussed. Mr Pootswas criticised earlier this monthfor preventing what was billed as a ""long-standing meeting"" relating to agriculture from taking place. He told a Stormont committee earlier on Thursday, speaking in his capacity as NI agriculture minister, that he had every intention of fulfilling his ministerial obligations. ""At no point have I refused to attend north-south meetings,"" he said. This video can not be played Mr Poots told a Stormont committee he had every intention of fulfilling his ministerial obligations Earlier on Thursday, DUP MLA Paul Givan said any legal action over non-attendance at NSMC meetings would be an overreaction and should be a ""last resort"". Mr Givan said there had to be a recognition of the opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocol. However, the SDLP's Nichola Mallon said she firmly believed the DUP was in breach of the ministerial code. DUP MLA Paul Givan said legal action should be a last resort She also accused the DUP of being ""dishonest"" in how it has communicated its absences from NSMC meetings.

Tesco staff win legal argument in equal pay fight,"Thousands of current and former Tesco workers have won a legal argument in their fight for equal pay. The European Court of Justice has ruled that an EU law could be relied on in making equal pay claims against their employer. Tesco workers, mostly women, have argued that they failed to receive equal pay for work of equal value with colleagues in its distribution centres who are mostly men. They said this breached EU and UK laws. Tesco, the UK's biggest retailer, and law firm Leigh Day, acting on behalf of the workers, sought clarification from the Court of Justice of the European Union. They asked the court to rule on a specific aspect of European law - whether the so-called ""single source"" test applies to businesses in the UK. Under EU law, a worker can be compared with somebody working in a different establishment if a ""single source"" has the power to correct the difference in pay. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled thatAsda shop workers can compare their roles with those of their colleagues in distribution centresfor the purposes of equal pay. This ruling mainly focused on the UK legal test for comparability. According to Leigh Day, the latest decision reinforces the Supreme Court's ruling and makes it extremely difficult for other supermarkets to argue the roles of shop workers cannot be compared with those of their colleagues in distribution centres. Kiran Dauka, a partner in the employment team at Leigh Day, said: ""This judgement reinforces the Supreme Court's ruling that the roles of shop floor workers can be compared to those of their colleagues in distribution centres for the purposes of equal pay. ""For a long time, employers have argued that UK law in this area is unclear, but this judgment is simple: if there is a single body responsible for ensuring equality, the roles are comparable. ""Clarification from the CJEU confirms that this single source test can be relied upon by people in the UK bringing an equal value claim. This means that employers can no longer hide behind the grey areas of UK law. ""It's time for supermarkets to accept that the roles of shop floor workers and distribution centre workers are comparable."" Pam Jenkins, who works at Tesco, said: ""To get a judgement confirming shop floor workers can use an easier legal test to compare their jobs to male colleagues in distribution is uplifting. ""I've always been proud to work at Tesco, but knowing that male colleagues working in distribution centres are being paid more is demoralising. ""I'm hopeful that Tesco will recognise the contribution shop floor workers make to the business and reflect that in our pay."" The legal test for comparability is only the first of three stages within Asda's overall pay claim, which is expected to take several years to conclude. Leigh Day is also handing similar equal pay claims against Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and Co-op, which are not as far advanced. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""The jobs in our stores and distribution centres are different. These roles require different skills and demands which lead to variations in pay - but this has absolutely nothing to do with gender. ""We reward our colleagues fairly for the jobs they do and work hard to ensure that the pay and benefits we offer are fair, competitive and sustainable. ""These claims are extremely complex and will take many years to reach a conclusion. We continue to strongly defend these claims.""

Education secretary 'will not pass buck' on Scotland grades,"New Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville took over the role from John Swinney The new education secretary has said she will take ""absolute responsibility"" for Scotland's qualifications system. Shirley-Anne Somerville promised she would not blame anyone else if there were any issues with the awards. She said Scotland had a fair, credible and a consistent assessment policy despite criticism of the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA). The Scottish Greens have tabled an amendment at Holyrood expressing ""lack of confidence"" in the SQA. The Scottish government announced its overdue appeals process for Higher and National 5 candidates on Wednesday,amid widespread criticism from pupils, parents and teachers. An alternative qualifications model has been introduced after exams were formal exams were cancelled for a second year running due to the Covid pandemic. Grades are to be awarded on the basis of ""teacher judgement of evidence of learner attainment"". School appeals 'can revise grades up or down' What's happening with this year's school 'exams'? Scottish pupils sitting 'exams by another name' Senior pupils faced numerous assessments throughout May to provide evidence for awards. But the system came under attack after many students and parents claimed these assessments were ""exams by another name,"" conducted with less preparation and often in a more intensive time period. They said the assessments were causing more stress and anxiety than the usual exam system. On Wednesday, more than a month later than originally planned, Ms Somerville finally outlined controversial details of the appeals process - which she said could see pupils having their grades revised down as well as up. Speaking on the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programme, the education secretary said she had confidence in the arrangements that had been made for this year. There was no formal Scottish exam diet in 2020 or 2021 She added: ""Of course I will take absolute responsibility. That is part of becoming education secretary, it is my responsibility to listen to the stakeholders and make the decisions. I won't pass the buck onto anyone. ""I will ensure as we go through this process, I listen to young people, teachers educationalists and to parents to make sure we design the fairest most consistent and credible policy, and I think we have done that."" Ms Somerville said the ""the fair, credible and a consistent assessment policy"" was not devised by the government alone, but by the National Qualifications 2021 group that she said included young people, trade unions, parents and other educationalists. But the only young person on the group - Cameron Garrett, who serves as a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament - has strongly criticised the new appeals process. He claimed the voices of young people had not been listened to, and said they had been ""let down and ignored by this process"". He added: ""Young people deserve fairness this year and should be able to have confidence in the system. Neither is currently true."" Is there an exams crisis? It depends who you ask. I've been following this story closely for months and so far the vast majority of young people I have spoken to are not happy with the process. They say they were told there would be no exams, only to find themselves studying for tests which looked and felt exactly like exams but, for many, without the study leave. Teachers' representatives involved in creating the way qualifications work this year - the EIS union and School Leaders Scotland - say this is the best solution and the fairest way to measure pupils' abilities. The teachers' groups not involved in the process - the SSTA and NASUWT - say it's flawed and not allowing them to exercise real judgement. Like young people, the vast majority of parents I speak to are also unhappy with how things are panning out. That's backed up by the largest independent parents group, Connect, which is calling for the system to be changed. The SQA and the Scottish government have both said they do not expect a situation like last year, where a U-turn had to be made after results were given which meant they reverted only to teacher judgement. Ultimately, we are going to have to wait and see what happens when pupils are told their results. Are they what they would have expected? Have they been disadvantaged by circumstances outwith their control? And has the system stepped up to help them make up for the disruption they have faced? Ms Somerville said she recognised that young people had wanted some things to be done differently, but that there had been ""no genuine consensus and I have looked to ensure we have a very credible policy as we go through this."" Pupils will receive provisional grades from 24 June. After that, they can speak to teachers and register their intention to appeal if they wish to. Ms Somerville said: ""You absolutely have the right to appeal and for the first time this year young people have the right to appeal directly and at no cost. ""The appeals process has no algorithm involved, it goes to a second teacher outside the school, an SQA appointee. They look at all the evidence and take a decision based on that."" However, opposition parties have criticised the decisionto allow grades to be downgradedif a student does appeal, calling it a  ""perverse gamble"". Ms Somerville said there was a very low incidence of grades being downgraded, and that in 2019 just one candidate's grade in 11,138 appeals was adjusted down. Ross Greer has put forward an amendment which questions the SQA's ability ""to fulfil its duties"" The issue was raised at First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament later on Thursday, with Nicola Sturgeon insisting she had full confidence in the SQA while admitting that the system that had been drawn up was ""not perfect"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross described it as the ""same old shambles"" in education, and said lessons had not been learned from last year despite Mr Swinney being replaced as education secretary. He called on Ms Sturgeon to accept that the qualifications process was ""fundamentally flawed"" and said she should move on to address the deeper problems in education - ""starting by replacing the SQA"". Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer's amendment in Thursday's education debate acknowledges ""additional stress and anxiety felt by students, teachers, parents and carers as a result of the 2021 alternative certification model"". And it says this year's model should adopt a no-detriment policy - meaning grades cannot be lowered - and that provision should be made for appeals based on exceptional individual circumstances. It goes on to note the ""repeated underperformance of the SQA and expresses lack of confidence the body's ability to fulfil its duties"". MSPs previously voted on the performance of the SQA in February, when they backeda motion saying the exam body and schools' watchdog were not ""fit for purpose""after the government was forced to u-turn and upgrade the results of tens of thousands of pupils after an outcry over how the grades had been awarded.

UK open-minded on extending furlough - Gove,"The first ministers from Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are among those taking part in the meeting The UK government is ""open-minded"" on SNP calls to extend furlough, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants the job support scheme extended ""for as long as it is needed"". The call came ahead of a virtual meeting between Boris Johnson and the three devolved administrations on how to emerge from the Covid pandemic. The summitwas postponedafter the Scottish and Welsh first ministers criticised the ""very rough"" agenda. Ms Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford said the discussion needed to be ""meaningful"" and had asked Mr Johnson to provide more detail of the meeting's schedule. Mr Johnson called the summitin the wake of the election results in Great Britain earlier this month, which saw Ms Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP) returned to government in Scotland and Mr Drakeford's Labour triumph in Wales. Downing Street said the meeting - which was scheduled to begin at 13:30 BST - was an opportunity to share information and ideas on the way ahead. The meeting will be chaired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson First Minister Ms Sturgeon said that the four-nation meeting could not be ""a PR exercise"" and that getting ""certainty over funding... is the bare minimum or our expectations"". Ahead of the summit, the SNP urged the UK government to consider extending furlough ""beyond September if this is required"". The party also said those who have started jobs since 2 March 2021 should be able to be furloughed if needed. The furlough scheme - officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) - was launched in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, to minimise unemployment. It now covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they cannot work, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per month. The scheme is currently due to expire at the end of September. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland, Mr Gove said he was ""open-minded"" on the SNP's proposal. He added that furlough scheme was a ""huge success"" that was only possible ""thanks to the broad shoulders of the UK Treasury"". He also said Scotland would benefit from more spending by the UK government adding ""it is absolutely vital that we build back better."" In an earlier statement, Mr Gove said the four nations' ""joint success"" on fighting Covid had ""shown the world what we can achieve as a United Kingdom. ""We must take the same approach to the difficult challenge of rebuilding our economy and public services from the damaging impact of Covid-19."" Mr Gove, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and the secretaries of state for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are also expected to attend the meeting. There is a practical side to this meeting and, as ever, a political one. Officials in Downing Street say the prime minister wants to hear how the different parts of the UK are emerging from lockdown. There will be a discussion on how ideas can be shared and how links created during the pandemic can be maintained. But Number 10 will also want to reinforce the message that being part of the UK has helped in the fight against Covid. The meeting is expected to hear that the success of the vaccine rollout was down to the buying power of the UK government and supplies being sourced through London. The work of members of the British armed forceswho helped in the rollout of the vaccinewill also be highlighted. The virtual meeting with political representatives from across the UK will also examine how the pandemic has placed extra burdens on the health service and disrupted the education of millions of pupils and students. On Tuesday, the UK announced zero Covid deaths for the first time since the pandemic began, with a government adviser saying the latest coronavirus data looks encouraging. The timetable for relaxing Covid measures varies across the UK. InNorthern Ireland, ministers have been gradually introducing major relaxations of the Covid restrictions, with indoor hospitality, tourist accommodation and non-essential retail all allowed to reopen with mitigations in place. The next review is due on 10 June. There is currently a debate going on in England as to whether restrictionsshould be ended on 21 June. In Wales, the health minister has said the easing of restrictions - due to be reviewed on Thursday -could be affected by a ""very serious"" cluster of the Delta variant in Conwy county. It comes a day after the relaxing of measures in Scotlandwas paused for millions of peoplein areas where cases have been rising.

Concerns over NHS staff shortage for new scanners,"CT scanners are to be replaced at a number of hospitals Ageing equipment to spot cancer early is being upgraded to clear growing waiting lists - but there are concerns over a shortage of staff to operate the new scanners. More than 500,000 people arenow waiting for treatment on the Welsh NHS. Health Minister Eluned Morgan said Â£25m would be spent on NHS diagnostic equipment to stop a ""bottleneck"" in treatment. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) warned more staff must be recruited. Oncologist Sarah Gwynne said new CT scanners would make treatment more accurate and improve patient care. Dr Gwynne said the CT scanner at Singleton Hospital, Swansea, was 10 years old and ""technology had moved on dramatically in that time"". The (RCR) welcomed the new equipment, but said radiographers, radiologists and doctors were needed to operate it and interpret the results, adding there was ""a shortage of all three"", with more expected to leave the NHS or reduce their hours in the next year. Earlier this year,the shortage was described as ""shocking"". ""It's very welcome as the equipment it's funding is top-end stuff and it is going to make a different to patients,"" said Dr Toby Wells, from the RCR. ""You need the machines [but] you need the radiographers to take the imaging and the radiologists, the doctors, to interpret what the scans show and there's a shortage of all three of those."" There have been concerns that many people fearing they have cancer may not have contacted their GPs during the coronavirus pandemic. Latest Welsh government figures show more people than ever - the equivalent of 18% of the population - are waiting for planned treatments. There were 568,367 people on waiting lists in March, up 24.4% on the same time last year. With many people unable to attend hospitals for imaging and diagnostic appointments during the pandemic, waiting times for scans and tests have also increased. Dr Sarah Gwynne said the equipment would make a difference to how patients were treated Announcing Â£25m to upgrade CT, X-Ray, ultrasound and MRI machines across Wales, Baroness Morgan said the new diagnostic equipment was vital to start to clear the ""backlog"" and would ""transform lives"". Speaking during a visit to Singleton Hospital, she said she was concerned about 30,000 fewer people had contacted the NHS about cancer concerns this year, compared to 2020. Clearing the waiting list for cancer scans and treatment was a ""key priority"" for the Welsh government because people with cancer ""cannot wait"". ""We are aware there is a huge backlog that we need to address, but cancer services in particular have always been essential services throughout this pandemic,"" she said. Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task' Covid cancer delays 'could cause 2,000 deaths' 'Worrying gap' over cancer patients being seen Dr Gwynne said she hoped a Â£5.5m new state-of-the-art CT simulator would help to cut waiting lists for treatment, with its accuracy speeding up the process. She said the new CT simulator would allow them to get a ""better picture of where the tumour is"" to allow them to kill cancer cells with radiation more accurately, without harming surrounding cells. She said this greatly benefitted patients with tumours in their chest - such as breast and lung cancer - as they can move while breathing, as well as helping target radiation. The RCR estimates that Walesneeds to recruit 97 more radiologiststo meet growing demand. It also warned that many radiologists plan to leave NHS Wales next year and those staying intending to reduce their hours. ""They've started and they've given us this kit and they've funded more radiology trainees, but we need more,"" said Dr Wells. Those concerns were echoed by Judi Rhys, chief executive at Tenovus Cancer Care: ""We know that there are still approximately 35,000 people in Wales 'missing' from the cancer system and additional diagnostic equipment will help address the backlog. ""But we also need to invest in other elements of the NHS, including the workforce."" The Welsh government has already announced Â£100m of funding to help deal with the backlog caused by Covid-19. Baroness Morgan is to announce that Â£25m of the cash would be used to upgrade ""ageing equipment as part of our effort to ensure the NHS can respond to demand with resilient services"". The spending plan includes: Â£2.3m for a CT scanner and two diagnostic radiology rooms at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr, in Ystrad Mynach Â£3.3m for a gamma camera and interventional radiology suite at Wrexham Maelor Hospital Â£2.1m for CT simulator replacement at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd Â£3.2m for fluoroscopy and cath lab at University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff Â£3.1m for an upgrade of MRI and fluoroscopy room, providing X-ray imaging at the Princess of Wales Hospital, in Bridgend Â£4.5m for two replacement CT scanners at Glangwilli Hospital, in Carmarthenshire and Withybush Hospital, Pembrokeshire Â£1m for fluoroscopy X-ray imaging and MRI upgrade at Velindre Cancer Centre, in Cardiff Â£350,000 for four ultrasound machines at Brecon, Newtown, Llandrindod Wells and Welshpool hospitals ""It's our priority to support the recovery of the NHS and this is a first step to ensuring the health service has access to sufficient diagnostic capacity to deal with the people waiting as a result of the pandemic,"" Baroness Morgan added. ""We aren't out of the pandemic yet. Investing in the diagnostic national capital replacement programme and upgrading the equipment available to our incredible healthcare workforce is key to diagnosing, treating and caring for people as we move forward."" Cancer charities have raised concerns about the impact of the pandemic on waiting times for both patients and staff. Baroness Morgan has also previously warned that the Welsh NHS faced ""a gargantuan task"" to tackle ""record high"" NHS waiting lists.

"Self-harm in over-65s âneeds post-pandemic focusâLoneliness, bereavement and reluctance to access GPs can all lead to self-harm among older adults.Health","Wendy's mental health has struggled during the pandemic, with her mother having been seriously ill with Covid. Self-harm among the over-65s must receive greater focus because of the increased risks associated with the pandemic, a leading expert has said. Loneliness, bereavement and reluctance to access GPs can all be causes in older adults, said Prof Nav Kapur, who has produced guidelines on the subject. He warned that in over-65s, without the right help, self-harm can also be a predictor of later suicide attempts. The NHS's mental health director said it had expanded its community support. Claire Murdoch added that its services, including face-to-face appointments, had ""continued for all who needed them"", and 24/7 crisis lines had been established. Over-65s are hospitalised more than 5,000 times a year in England because of self-harm and self-poisoning, figures obtained from NHS Digital show. Wendy, 68, told the BBC that the pressures of the pandemic had led her to self-harm. She said her mother's severe ill health with Covid, feelings of isolation and difficulty accessing her GP have all caused an added mental toll. She added she felt like the weight of looking after her mother - who doctors initially said was unlikely to survive - was ""on my shoulders"". ""Trying to get her care sorted [once she left hospital] was when I felt at my most delicate,"" she explained, trying to hold back the tears. ""I was falling apart underneath... And that was when I ended up harming myself."" Prof Nav Kapur says every episode of self-harm must be taken seriously by heath professionals Prof Kapur, from the University of Manchester, developed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on self-harm and suicide prevention followed by the NHS. He said it was important to challenge the perception ""that self-harm doesn't happen to older people"", and added it was vital that GPs, specialist mental health services and the voluntary sector work together to provide care for patients. Prof Kapur warned that if older individuals don't get support, it can leave them at a much greater risk of taking their own lives. ""In one of the studies we did, [we found that over-65s] who hurt themselves were about 150 times more likely to die by suicide than adults who hadn't - and that was about three times higher than young people who hurt themselves. ""So highlighting that every episode of self-harm needs to be taken seriously, especially in older adults, is a really important clinical message. ""Even now, sometimes self-harm is regarded as a low-risk behaviour by clinicians."" Wendy has been unable to do the things she values most during the pandemic, such as supporting homeless individuals Wendy, from Northamptonshire, first struggled with self-harm in her early 20s. For her, the support of friends, loved ones and medical professionals is vital - but hasn't been as easy to obtain since the pandemic began. Her work volunteering as a street pastor and supporting homeless individuals - causes she feels passionately about - have had to be curtailed because of a mixture of lockdowns, and ill health from her own struggle with Covid. Her relationships have been affected too. ""I couldn't see my partner because we live in separate houses,"" she explained. While she used to drop into her GP when thoughts of self-harm arose, she said the extra stresses placed on the health service have meant this has not been possible. Listening without judgement and going for walks together can help those struggling with self-harm, the charity Mind says Rachel Boyd, from the mental health charity Mind, says there are many ways to help those struggling with self-harm. Give individuals space to talk, without being judgemental Encourage them to find support through GPs, charities and online peer support groups Understand that other factors that may be contributing to their self-harm - such as housing issues, job insecurity or financial worries - and help them seek advice Be there for them as a friend. Do things you enjoy, such as going for a walk together The self-harm organisation Harmless, which supports individuals ranging from young children to those in their 80s, describes over-65s as a ""forgotten"" group. It said there was a stigma around self-harm that can prevent individuals from seeking support - including from family and friends. Colin Menz, from the charity, said it was relatively common for older individuals to tell themselves ""why am I still self-harming at this age?"", or believe ""I should have it under control by now"". He added it was important that every individual feels listened to and receives care that addresses the underlying causes of their self-harm. ""Each individual is dealing with their own distress... and their support needs are so different,"" he explained. Wendy describes her dog Bo as a ""lifeline"" who is always able to comfort her. As Wendy looks towards the future, she believes ""there is always hope"". She is being supported by her local church, and said we can all play a role in helping others struggling with self-harm - simply by listening. ""Be kind. Have a cup of tea and a chat,"" she explained, as she sits with her closest companion, her dog Bo, in their favourite park. ""Somehow after a cup of tea and some kindness, you just feel better.""

Over-65s are hospitalised more than 5,000 times a year in England because of self-harm and self-poisoning, figures obtained from NHS Digital show. Wendy, 68, told the BBC that the pressures of the pandemic had led her to self-harm. She said her mother's severe ill health with Covid, feelings of isolation and difficulty accessing her GP have all caused an added mental toll. She added she felt like the weight of looking after her mother - who doctors initially said was unlikely to survive - was ""on my shoulders"". ""Trying to get her care sorted [once she left hospital] was when I felt at my most delicate,"" she explained, trying to hold back the tears. ""I was falling apart underneath... And that was when I ended up harming myself."" Prof Nav Kapur says every episode of self-harm must be taken seriously by heath professionals Prof Kapur, from the University of Manchester, developed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on self-harm and suicide prevention followed by the NHS. He said it was important to challenge the perception ""that self-harm doesn't happen to older people"", and added it was vital that GPs, specialist mental health services and the voluntary sector work together to provide care for patients. Prof Kapur warned that if older individuals don't get support, it can leave them at a much greater risk of taking their own lives. ""In one of the studies we did, [we found that over-65s] who hurt themselves were about 150 times more likely to die by suicide than adults who hadn't - and that was about three times higher than young people who hurt themselves. ""So highlighting that every episode of self-harm needs to be taken seriously, especially in older adults, is a really important clinical message. ""Even now, sometimes self-harm is regarded as a low-risk behaviour by clinicians."" Wendy has been unable to do the things she values most during the pandemic, such as supporting homeless individuals Wendy, from Northamptonshire, first struggled with self-harm in her early 20s. For her, the support of friends, loved ones and medical professionals is vital - but hasn't been as easy to obtain since the pandemic began. Her work volunteering as a street pastor and supporting homeless individuals - causes she feels passionately about - have had to be curtailed because of a mixture of lockdowns, and ill health from her own struggle with Covid. Her relationships have been affected too. ""I couldn't see my partner because we live in separate houses,"" she explained. While she used to drop into her GP when thoughts of self-harm arose, she said the extra stresses placed on the health service have meant this has not been possible. Listening without judgement and going for walks together can help those struggling with self-harm, the charity Mind says Rachel Boyd, from the mental health charity Mind, says there are many ways to help those struggling with self-harm. Give individuals space to talk, without being judgemental Encourage them to find support through GPs, charities and online peer support groups Understand that other factors that may be contributing to their self-harm - such as housing issues, job insecurity or financial worries - and help them seek advice Be there for them as a friend. Do things you enjoy, such as going for a walk together The self-harm organisation Harmless, which supports individuals ranging from young children to those in their 80s, describes over-65s as a ""forgotten"" group. It said there was a stigma around self-harm that can prevent individuals from seeking support - including from family and friends. Colin Menz, from the charity, said it was relatively common for older individuals to tell themselves ""why am I still self-harming at this age?"", or believe ""I should have it under control by now"". He added it was important that every individual feels listened to and receives care that addresses the underlying causes of their self-harm. ""Each individual is dealing with their own distress... and their support needs are so different,"" he explained. Wendy describes her dog Bo as a ""lifeline"" who is always able to comfort her. As Wendy looks towards the future, she believes ""there is always hope"". She is being supported by her local church, and said we can all play a role in helping others struggling with self-harm - simply by listening. ""Be kind. Have a cup of tea and a chat,"" she explained, as she sits with her closest companion, her dog Bo, in their favourite park. ""Somehow after a cup of tea and some kindness, you just feel better.""

Tesco staff win legal argument in equal pay fightThe European Court of Justice rules that an EU law can be relied on in making equal pay claims.Business,"Thousands of current and former Tesco workers have won a legal argument in their fight for equal pay. The European Court of Justice has ruled that an EU law could be relied on in making equal pay claims against their employer. Tesco workers, mostly women, have argued that they failed to receive equal pay for work of equal value with colleagues in its distribution centres who are mostly men. They said this breached EU and UK laws. Tesco, the UK's biggest retailer, and law firm Leigh Day, acting on behalf of the workers, sought clarification from the Court of Justice of the European Union. They asked the court to rule on a specific aspect of European law - whether the so-called ""single source"" test applies to businesses in the UK. Under EU law, a worker can be compared with somebody working in a different establishment if a ""single source"" has the power to correct the difference in pay. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled thatAsda shop workers can compare their roles with those of their colleagues in distribution centresfor the purposes of equal pay. This ruling mainly focused on the UK legal test for comparability. According to Leigh Day, the latest decision reinforces the Supreme Court's ruling and makes it extremely difficult for other supermarkets to argue the roles of shop workers cannot be compared with those of their colleagues in distribution centres. Kiran Dauka, a partner in the employment team at Leigh Day, said: ""This judgement reinforces the Supreme Court's ruling that the roles of shop floor workers can be compared to those of their colleagues in distribution centres for the purposes of equal pay. ""For a long time, employers have argued that UK law in this area is unclear, but this judgment is simple: if there is a single body responsible for ensuring equality, the roles are comparable. ""Clarification from the CJEU confirms that this single source test can be relied upon by people in the UK bringing an equal value claim. This means that employers can no longer hide behind the grey areas of UK law. ""It's time for supermarkets to accept that the roles of shop floor workers and distribution centre workers are comparable."" Pam Jenkins, who works at Tesco, said: ""To get a judgement confirming shop floor workers can use an easier legal test to compare their jobs to male colleagues in distribution is uplifting. ""I've always been proud to work at Tesco, but knowing that male colleagues working in distribution centres are being paid more is demoralising. ""I'm hopeful that Tesco will recognise the contribution shop floor workers make to the business and reflect that in our pay."" The legal test for comparability is only the first of three stages within Asda's overall pay claim, which is expected to take several years to conclude. Leigh Day is also handing similar equal pay claims against Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and Co-op, which are not as far advanced. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""The jobs in our stores and distribution centres are different. These roles require different skills and demands which lead to variations in pay - but this has absolutely nothing to do with gender. ""We reward our colleagues fairly for the jobs they do and work hard to ensure that the pay and benefits we offer are fair, competitive and sustainable. ""These claims are extremely complex and will take many years to reach a conclusion. We continue to strongly defend these claims."" Asda workers win key appeal in equal pay fight Tesco faces Â£4bn equal pay claim Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump faces sentencing in New York hush-money case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Israel opposition parties agree to form governmentNaftali Bennett will initially become PM, meaning an end to Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year tenure.Middle East","The right-wing Yamina party's Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, after reaching an agreement Israeli opposition parties have reached an agreement to form a new government that would end Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year tenure as prime minister. Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, announced an eight-faction coalition had been formed. Under a rotation arrangement, the head of the right-wing Yamina party, Naftali Bennett, would serve as prime minister first before handing over to Mr Lapid. Mr Netanyahu, however, attacked the new ""left-wing"" government as ""dangerous"". In his first comments since the agreement was reached, Mr Netanyahu urged Knesset (parliament) members ""elected by votes from the right"" to oppose the coalition, which still needs to be approved by a parliamentary vote before being sworn in. The vote is not expected to take place for some days, and there is still a chance this newly formed coalition could be upended by defections. Who is Naftali Bennett, Israel's likely PM? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM In a statement, Mr Lapid said he had informed President Reuven Rivlin of the agreement, adding: ""I pledge that this government will work in the service of all Israeli citizens, those who voted for it and those who did not. ""It will respect its opponents and do everything in its power to unite and connect all parts of Israeli society."" An image carried on Israeli media showed Mr Lapid, Mr Bennett and Mansour Abbas, leader of the Arab Islamist Raam party, signing the agreement, a deal many thought impossible. Allow Twitter content?

This is the first time in decades an Israeli Arab party has joined a governing coalition. Other parties representing Israeli Arabs - who make up 20% of the population - have said they will oppose a government led by Mr Bennett, who rejects the concept of a Palestinian state, AFP news agency reports. Mr Abbas told reporters: ""The decision was hard and there were several disputes but it was important to reach agreements."" He said that there were ""many things in this agreement for the benefit of Arab society"". No rational political enemy of Benjamin Netanyahu can underestimate his tenacity, ruthlessness and absolute determination to hold on to office. Until a new government with a new prime minister is sworn in, he will do all he can to stop it. If he found himself leader of the opposition, he would do all he could to destabilise a coalition with a wafer-thin majority that would be trying to span the entire Israeli spectrum, from the nationalist right to the liberal left. All that unites them is their desire to remove him from office. Mr Netanyahu has already called the proposed new government the ""fraud of the century"". He says it endangers the state of Israel, the people of Israel, and the soldiers of Israel. However loudly he complains, the likelihood is that he is leaving office. In the end his defeat was sealed not by left-wing opponents but by fellow right-wingers he has made into enemies by his ruthless, high-handed tactics. No-one should expect big, new initiatives from a new government. Just surviving the onslaught Mr Netanyahu is undoubtedly planning will be a full-time job. His opponents will be hoping that his fall will continue in the Jerusalem courthouse where he is already on trial on serious corruption charges. In his note to the president, Mr Lapid said he would head the government alongside Mr Bennett, who he would replace as prime minister on 27 August 2023. Mr Rivlin has called on parliament to convene as soon as possible to hold the confidence vote. If the coalition fails to win the support of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, there is a risk of the country having to go to elections for the fifth time in two years. The coalition members span the full spectrum of Israeli politics. The parties have little in common apart from their plan to replace Mr Netanyahu. They are: Yesh Atid(centrist) - led by Yair Lapid (17 seats) Kahol Lavan (Blue and White)(centrist) - led by Benny Gantz (eight) Israel Beiteinu(centre-right to right-wing nationalist) - led by Avigdor Lieberman (seven) Labor(social-democratic) - led by Merav Michaeli (seven) Yamina(right-wing) - led by Naftali Bennett (seven) New Hope(centre-right to right-wing)- led by Gideon Sa'ar (six) Meretz(left-wing, social-democratic) - led by Nitzan Horowitz (six) Raam(Arab Islamist) - led by Mansour Abbas (four) All eight factions were needed to pass the 61 majority figure. Wednesday's marathon talks took place in a hotel near Tel Aviv, with a large number of issues - from legalising cannabis to fines for illegal construction to the rotation of judicial selection committee posts - all on the agenda. Israeli media suggested that not all the elements were finalised, and this could still create doubts over whether the coalition will win its confidence vote. Allow Twitter content?

Why are people talking about Dr Fauci's emails?The US infectious disease chief's emails take us behind the scenes of the early pandemic response.,"Thousands of private emails from US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci have revealed the concern and confusion at the start of the pandemic. So what did we learn from them? A National Institutes of Health specialist with a career spanning seven US presidents, Dr Fauci, 80, became the face of the nation's Covid-19 response and has since been the subject of both effusive praise and ferocious criticism. The over 3,000 pages of emails, obtained by the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News and CNN through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, date from January to June 2020. His conversations offer a glimpse into the early days of the US Covid outbreak and his dealings with the government, foreign and domestic health officials, the media, celebrities and everyday Americans. The face of America's fight against Covid-19 Fauci warns of 'needless suffering and death' Top scientist's Covid warning angers White House The Wuhan lab theory Dr Fauci and his colleagues took notice, in the early days, of the theory that Covid-19 may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. The controversial claim was dismissed by experts last year, who said it was ""extremely unlikely"". No evidence to support it has emerged. But in recent days, amid criticism of an inconclusive international probe into the virus' origins and new reports of Covid-related illness in the region weeks before it was officially identified, the theory is once again sparking debate. Why the lab-leak theory is being taken seriously A January 2020 email to Dr Fauci from the director of the country's largest biomedical research facility suggested the ""unusual features"" of the virus may indicate it is ""engineered"", prompting Dr Fauci to say he will reach out via phone. In April 2020, an email from the director of the National Institute of Health, Francis Collins, nudged Dr Fauci with the subject line ""conspiracy gains momentum"". The doctor's response to this is fully redacted. This May, Dr Fauci said he is ""not convinced"" the virus originated naturally and expressed support for an investigation. On masks In the early months of the virus, the US government was still working out mask guidance - a move that has been criticised for adding to the confusion. In a February 2020 email exchange with a former US health secretary, Dr Fauci said: ""Masks are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection."" He added that store-bought masks are ""not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through material"". The following month, a friend in the Chinese public health field wrote to say he has been misquoted in the media for saying the West is making a ""big mistake"" in not recommending mask use. Dr Fauci responded: ""I understand. No problem. We will get through this together."" Questions from all sides As the public sought answers to the worsening crisis, Dr Fauci fielded inquiries from across the US - including Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg invited the doctor to participate in the social media platform's Covid information hub and respond to users' questions. Actress Morgan Fairchild - who reportedly collaborated with him during the Aids epidemic of the 1980s - reached out in February asking how she could help. Dr Fauci suggested she tweet: ""The American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures including social distancing, teleworking, temporary closure of schools, etc."" And, soon after a phone call with Bill Gates, a senior executive at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation wrote to say he was ""seriously worried"" about Dr Fauci's health and safety. This video can not be played Fauci: 'Absolutely not' surprised Trump got Covid-19 The emails also reveal Dr Fauci frequently and firmly shut down rumours that he was being censored by President Trump. ""I actually have not been muzzled at all,"" he wrote to one unidentified fan in February 2020. Some moments of levity Lionised on prayer candles and bobble-head toys, the emails show Dr Fauci professing discomfort with the adulation coming from many corners of the internet. When a colleague emailed him a story of how a shop sold out of doughnuts emblazoned with his face, he responded: ""Truly surrealistic. Hopefully this all stops soon... It is not at all pleasant, that is for sure."" In another email, he shared a story about 'Fauci Fever' with the quip: ""It will blow your mind. Our society is really totally nuts."" And, when actor Brad Pitt played him on the Saturday Night Live sketch comedy show, he happily told a colleague that one reviewer said Pitt ""looked 'exactly like me'. That statement made my year."" Some conservative politicians and media pundits have cited the emails in their calls to sack Dr Fauci for his work on the pandemic response. US Senator Rand Paul, a Republican who has frequently clashed with Dr Fauci in hearings on Capitol Hill, said the emails make it ""abundantly clear"" the doctor is ""a massive fraud"". Across the political aisle, liberals have argued Dr Fauci's positions adapted to the scientific evidence available at the time. Others celebrated his style and tone of response to various emails. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter Fauci's emails are like a Rorschach ink blot: what you see in them reveals more about you than the ink blot, or, in this case, the emails. For Trump supporters I know in small Kansas towns and other rural areas, Fauci is a villain. He broadcasts conflicting messages about the virus, these Republicans say, and twists science. They also say that he undermined then-President Trump. These conservatives refused to wear masks, even during the worst days of the pandemic, because, they said, the scientific guidelines changed constantly, and Fauci had flip-flopped. His emails will reinforce their opinions. Fauci did indeed change his mind about health guidance, such as the wearing of masks, as more information emerged about the virus. He told someone in February 2020 they did not need to wear a mask while travelling. Later, he encouraged people to wear them. In contrast, for liberals in the Midwest and in other regions, Fauci is a hero. His emails reinforce their views - that he changed his mind about what people should do to fight the virus, depending upon the scientific data, and not on what Trump wanted people to hear.

"Petrol prices at highest in two years, says RACFuel prices are climbing as economies reopen and energy prices soar.Business","Petrol prices have climbed to their highest level in two years, according to the RAC. Retailers may be charging more to make up for lower fuel sales during the pandemic, it said. Pump prices fell in May 2020 to a low of 106p as oil prices plummeted, but motorists had to abide by travel restrictions. The average cost of a litre has since soared to 129.27p, the highest level since August 2019. The cost of a litre of unleaded is now more than 22p more expensive than a year ago - the biggest 12-month increase seen for 11 years. ""After seven consecutive months of rising prices drivers will be wondering if the increases are ever going to end,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. Higher petrol prices drive up cost of living in March He said motorists have faced the biggest petrol price rise in any 12-month period since May 2010 when unleaded rocketed from 99p a year earlier to 121p. Unleaded petrol has climbed 2p in the last month and 15p since November, since when prices have climbed every month. That has left motorists paying Â£8 more for a full tank of petrol than seven months ago. Diesel prices are climbing slightly less rapidly, up just less than 20p a litre over the last 12 months. ""Looking at the wholesale price of both fuels, in normal circumstances unleaded definitely shouldn't be continuing to rise with the numbers actually pointing to the potential for a 2p reduction,"" said Mr Williams. He added that diesel is currently 4p too expensive ""which suggests retailers are using the saving in the wholesale price to help make up for lower fuel sales over the last year"". The future of fuel prices is hard to predict more than a few weeks in advance and even more so now as the pandemic appears to have altered the dynamics of fuel retailing, he said. Supermarkets have an even greater share of the market, according to the RAC. Buying fuel at a forecourt run by one of the four major supermarket chains will currently save drivers around 4p a litre with the average price of petrol standing at 124.83p and diesel 127.36p. ""We urge retailers not to take advantage of drivers and fairly reflect what's happening with wholesale prices on the country's forecourts,"" he said. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said: ""Oil prices rising back above 70 US dollars a barrel casts a shadow over staycation travel, with petrol prices at their highest for 20 months. ""The speed of the price rises at a time when drivers are beginning to travel much longer distances is a post-lockdown shock for many.""

MoT lift faults and cancelled tests cost Â£4mThousands of vehicle tests were cancelled after cracks were found in 52 of 55 lifts at MoT centres.Northern Ireland,"Fears over the safety of equipment led to a backlog of MoTs Equipment failures at Northern Ireland's MoT centres that led to the cancellation of thousands of tests cost Â£3.9m, a report has found. Last year,cracks were discovered in 52 out of 55 liftsleading to significant disruption at vehicle test centres. Stormont's Public Accounts Committee found the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) had not correctly projected the lifespan of the lifts. The DVA should have been more rigorous with a lift replacement plan, it said. ""We find it ironic that an organisation in the business of testing the road-worthiness of vehicles was not able to ensure that its own equipment was being properly maintained,"" said committee chairman William Humphrey. The report, published on Thursday, examined the suspension of vehicle testing services due to safety issues. It followed two reviews commissioned by the minister for infrastructure that were carried out by independent engineers and the Northern Ireland Civil Service's Internal Audit and Fraud Investigation Services. Mr Humphrey said it was not the first time that problems had arisen within the DVA, with ""long MoT waiting times"" during 2019. He pointed out that the loss of equipment meant the DVA lost about Â£2.95m worth of income in the 2019-20 year. ""At the same time, DVA incurred costs of Â£980,000, primarily due to compensation for cancelled tests and then was required to spend Â£1.8m to replace 52 out of 55 scissor lifts,"" he said. Thousands of MoTs cancelled over cracked lifts Faults found on 48 out of 55 lifts in MOT centres Last February, it was reported that centres were operating at about half the normal capacity due to the safety concerns. About 1,500 vehicles were usually tested every day across Northern Ireland and about the same number would have been cancelled. At the time, an external review suggested aninadequate inspection regime and metal fatigueled to the situation with the scissor lifts, which are used to inspect the underside of vehicles. The BBC obtained a picture of a crack in a lift at one of the vehicle test centres The report also found that the DVA was ""overly reliant"" on a contractor and its maintenance schedule, and relied ""too heavily"" on a positive equipment survey in 2018, even though the scissor lifts were carrying out significantly more procedures than originally designed. While welcoming the fact a plan to address failings had been put in place after the independent review and audit, Mr Humphrey said the DVA needed to ""renew and strengthen its focus on customer service"". ""We are keen to see DVA's improvements through quarterly progress reports and look forward to the agency providing the service that people in Northern Ireland deserve,"" he said. The committee recommended: An estimated life-span of crucial equipment must be determined and a phased replacement programme put in place for all equipment to minimise disruption That the DVA should strengthen its oversight of the contract with Maha, particularly regarding the maintenance regime The DVA should ensure future relationships with new suppliers are underpinned by contracts that include strong performance and penalty clauses That the Department for Infrastructure should commission a review of the arrangements for the DVA and assess its effectiveness, including customer service, as it has been operating as a full trading fund for five years Thousands of MoTs cancelled over cracked lifts MOT exemptions for drivers hit by cancellations Faults found on 48 out of 55 lifts in MOT centres Use of MOT centre lifts suspended in fault check Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump faces sentencing in New York hush-money case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Why are people talking about Dr Fauci's emails?The US infectious disease chief's emails take us behind the scenes of the early pandemic response.US & Canada,"Thousands of private emails from US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci have revealed the concern and confusion at the start of the pandemic. So what did we learn from them? A National Institutes of Health specialist with a career spanning seven US presidents, Dr Fauci, 80, became the face of the nation's Covid-19 response and has since been the subject of both effusive praise and ferocious criticism. The over 3,000 pages of emails, obtained by the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News and CNN through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, date from January to June 2020. His conversations offer a glimpse into the early days of the US Covid outbreak and his dealings with the government, foreign and domestic health officials, the media, celebrities and everyday Americans. The face of America's fight against Covid-19 Fauci warns of 'needless suffering and death' Top scientist's Covid warning angers White House The Wuhan lab theory Dr Fauci and his colleagues took notice, in the early days, of the theory that Covid-19 may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. The controversial claim was dismissed by experts last year, who said it was ""extremely unlikely"". No evidence to support it has emerged. But in recent days, amid criticism of an inconclusive international probe into the virus' origins and new reports of Covid-related illness in the region weeks before it was officially identified, the theory is once again sparking debate. Why the lab-leak theory is being taken seriously A January 2020 email to Dr Fauci from the director of the country's largest biomedical research facility suggested the ""unusual features"" of the virus may indicate it is ""engineered"", prompting Dr Fauci to say he will reach out via phone. In April 2020, an email from the director of the National Institute of Health, Francis Collins, nudged Dr Fauci with the subject line ""conspiracy gains momentum"". The doctor's response to this is fully redacted. This May, Dr Fauci said he is ""not convinced"" the virus originated naturally and expressed support for an investigation. On masks In the early months of the virus, the US government was still working out mask guidance - a move that has been criticised for adding to the confusion. In a February 2020 email exchange with a former US health secretary, Dr Fauci said: ""Masks are really for infected people to prevent them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection."" He added that store-bought masks are ""not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through material"". The following month, a friend in the Chinese public health field wrote to say he has been misquoted in the media for saying the West is making a ""big mistake"" in not recommending mask use. Dr Fauci responded: ""I understand. No problem. We will get through this together."" Questions from all sides As the public sought answers to the worsening crisis, Dr Fauci fielded inquiries from across the US - including Hollywood and Silicon Valley. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg invited the doctor to participate in the social media platform's Covid information hub and respond to users' questions. Actress Morgan Fairchild - who reportedly collaborated with him during the Aids epidemic of the 1980s - reached out in February asking how she could help. Dr Fauci suggested she tweet: ""The American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures including social distancing, teleworking, temporary closure of schools, etc."" And, soon after a phone call with Bill Gates, a senior executive at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation wrote to say he was ""seriously worried"" about Dr Fauci's health and safety.

""I actually have not been muzzled at all,"" he wrote to one unidentified fan in February 2020. Some moments of levity Lionised on prayer candles and bobble-head toys, the emails show Dr Fauci professing discomfort with the adulation coming from many corners of the internet. When a colleague emailed him a story of how a shop sold out of doughnuts emblazoned with his face, he responded: ""Truly surrealistic. Hopefully this all stops soon... It is not at all pleasant, that is for sure."" In another email, he shared a story about 'Fauci Fever' with the quip: ""It will blow your mind. Our society is really totally nuts."" And, when actor Brad Pitt played him on the Saturday Night Live sketch comedy show, he happily told a colleague that one reviewer said Pitt ""looked 'exactly like me'. That statement made my year."" Some conservative politicians and media pundits have cited the emails in their calls to sack Dr Fauci for his work on the pandemic response. US Senator Rand Paul, a Republican who has frequently clashed with Dr Fauci in hearings on Capitol Hill, said the emails make it ""abundantly clear"" the doctor is ""a massive fraud"". Across the political aisle, liberals have argued Dr Fauci's positions adapted to the scientific evidence available at the time. Others celebrated his style and tone of response to various emails. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter Fauci's emails are like a Rorschach ink blot: what you see in them reveals more about you than the ink blot, or, in this case, the emails.

They also say that he undermined then-President Trump. These conservatives refused to wear masks, even during the worst days of the pandemic, because, they said, the scientific guidelines changed constantly, and Fauci had flip-flopped. His emails will reinforce their opinions. Fauci did indeed change his mind about health guidance, such as the wearing of masks, as more information emerged about the virus.

FBI accuses Russia-linked hackers of attack on JBS,"JBS, founded in Brazil in 1953, is the world's largest meat supplier A Russian cyber-criminal group was behind a ransomware attack that has targeted the world's largest meat processing company, the FBI has said. The FBI said it was working to bring the REvil group to justice for the hack on JBS. The cyber-breach over the weekend shut some JBS operations in the US, Canada and Australia. REvil - also known as Sodinokibi - is one of the most prolific and profitable cyber-criminal groups in the world. ""We have attributed the JBS attack to REvil and Sodinokibi and are working diligently to bring the threat actors to justice,"" the FBI statement said. ""We continue to focus our efforts on imposing risk and consequences and holding the responsible cyber actors accountable."" The White House said on Wednesday that US President Joe Biden would bring up the issue of cyber-attacks when he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in two weeks. ""Responsible states do not harbour ransomware criminals,"" said press secretary Jen Psaki. The ransomware surge ruining lives Colonial Pipeline boss confirms $4.4m ransom paid Should paying hacker ransoms be banned? JBS said it was on schedule to resume meatpacking operations on Thursday in the US, where its five biggest beef plants are located. The company, which identified the ransomware attack on Sunday, has not disclosed whether it paid the hackers. Ransomware is one of the most prolific forms of cyber-attack. It typically involves hackers gaining access to a computer network and either encrypting files or locking users out of their systems until a ransom is paid. In recent years, the use of ransomware for extortion has become a national security issue of serious concern. Last month, fuel delivery in the south-east of the US was crippled for several days after a ransomware attack targeted the Colonial Pipeline. Investigators say that attack was linked to another group, DarkSide, with ties to Russia. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? Colonial Pipeline has confirmed it paid a $4.4m (Â£3.1m) ransom to the cyber-criminal gang responsible. The US government has recommended in the past that companies do not pay criminals over ransomware attacks, in case they invite further hacks in the future. Just days after the attack on Colonial Pipeline, a different group ofÂ cyber-criminalsinfected the Irish national health system with ransomware. REvil is a criminal network of ransomware hackers that first came to prominence in 2019. Most of its members are believed to be based in Russia or countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Pronounced ""R"" followed by the word ""evil"", REvil has been linked to GandCrab, a now-defunct hacker gang that has used similar ransomware in the past. REvil is known as a ransomware-as-a-service (RAAS) enterprise for the way it operates. This involves ransomware developers recruiting affiliates, or partners, to spread their malicious malware. If the attacks are successful, developers take a percentage of the earned income and provide the other portion to the affiliates. The group threatens to post stolen documents on its website - known as the ""Happy Blog"" - if victims don't comply with its demands. One of the group's best-known attacks was on an Apple Inc supplier named Quanta Computer Inc earlier this year. In a note posted on the dark web, the group said it would release sensitive internal documents unless it received $50m in ransom. REvil was also linked to a co-ordinated attack on nearly two dozen local governments in Texas in 2019. JBS is the world's largest meat supplier with more than 150 plants in 15 countries It was founded in Brazil in 1953 as a slaughtering business by rancher JosÃ© Batista Sobrinho The company now has more than 150,000 employees worldwide Its customers include supermarkets and fast food outlet McDonald's In the US, JBS processes nearly one-quarter of the country's beef and one-fifth of its pork Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump faces sentencing in New York hush-money case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"School catch-up tsar resigns over lack of fundingEngland's school recovery commissioner Sir Kevan Collins quits, saying the funding ""falls far short"".Family & Education","Sir Kevan Collins said the funding for school recovery ""does not come close"" to what was needed The education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, has resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding. Sir Kevan took on the role as catch-up tsar in February to develop a long-term plan to help pupils make up for lost learning during the pandemic. But on Wednesday he stepped down saying the government's funding for the plan ""falls far short of what is needed"". Head teachers labelled the Â£1.4bn cash over three years as a ""damp squib"". The Education Policy Institute had calculated that a catch-up funding recovery would need Â£13.5bn - and Sir Kevan was reported as having put forward plans costing Â£15bn. The government's proposal represents Â£50 per pupil per year - and Sir Kevan wrote to the prime minister saying: ""I do not believe it is credible that a successful recovery can be achieved with a programme of support of this size."" A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister is hugely grateful to Sir Kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic. ""The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning, with over Â£3bn committed for catch up so far."" Earlier on Wednesday, the government announced an extra Â£1.4bn over three years for education recovery, in addition to the Â£1.7bn already announced. This included Â£1bn for 100 million hours of tutoring, aimed at disadvantaged pupils, and Â£250m for teacher training and development. PM vows more school catch-up cash amid funding row What students want from catch-up plans Sport and music 'should be part of pupil catch-up' The resignation statement from Sir Kevan,reported by The TES,external, said: ""A half-hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of pupils. ""The support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge and is why I have no option but to resign from my post."" His resignation letter to Boris Johnson said: ""When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support than the government has to date indicated it intends to provide."" This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson says there will be more funding coming ""down the track"" This was a chaotic end to what should have been a showcase of the catch-up plan for England's schools. The widely-respected adviser brought in to deliver the plans walked out in protest - turning a story that should have been about extra money into an awkward debate about the lack of it. The resignation letter from Sir Kevan Collins to the prime minister makes plain that this should not have come as a surprise. ""When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support,"" wrote Sir Kevan. Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had spent the day trying to keep the plans afloat, presenting them as a ""next step"" with more to follow - after strong criticism that the funding was only a tenth of what was required. But Sir Kevan's resignation has fired a torpedo at the government's contention that school recovery is one of its top priorities. Earlier, head teachers had said they were ""hugely disappointed"" by the announcement after expectations of a much bigger set of proposals. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, described it as a ""damp squib"" and said ""education recovery cannot be done on the cheap"". As such, he said: ""It is completely understandable that Sir Kevan chose not to become a pawn in whatever game the government is playing."" Mr Johnson then reassured schools and parents thatmore funding would be ""coming down the track"". Sir Kevan had been responsible for overseeing efforts to help schools in England recover from the disruption of the pandemic and lockdowns, which has seen pupils studying from home and exams cancelled over two academic years. He had reportedly called for funding for 100 extra hours of teaching per pupil - including for sports, music and the arts. But any extra teaching time, or longer school days, will now depend on getting further funding from the spending review. In a statement, Sir Kevan said a ""sustained and comprehensive programme of support"" would be needed and that ""more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge"". Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""We are sad but not surprised that Sir Kevan Collins is standing down. ""We know that Sir Kevan had much bolder and broader plans but that these required substantially more investment than the government was willing to provide. ""He's tried his hardest on behalf of children and young people, but, in the final analysis, the political will just wasn't there to support him."" Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the resignation was a ""damning indictment of the Conservatives' education catch-up plan"". ""He was brought in by Boris Johnson because of his experience and expertise in education, but the government have thrown out his ideas as soon as it came to stumping up the money needed to deliver them."" Before taking up his post as tsar, Sir Kevan was head of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), which examines evidence for what works in education. As EEF chief executive, he ran an organisation that examined ideas for raising achievement, with the aim of breaking the link between deprivation and poor outcomes in school. Sir Kevan has had a long career in education, as a former teacher who went on to be the director of children's services and chief executive of Tower Hamlets, east London.

Ageing scanners replaced to clear Covid backlogConsultants say Â£25m of gear will speed-up treatment after the pandemic leaves a huge backlog.Wales,"CT scanners are to be replaced at a number of hospitals Ageing equipment to spot cancer early is being upgraded to clear growing waiting lists - but there are concerns over a shortage of staff to operate the new scanners. More than 500,000 people arenow waiting for treatment on the Welsh NHS. Health Minister Eluned Morgan said Â£25m would be spent on NHS diagnostic equipment to stop a ""bottleneck"" in treatment. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) warned more staff must be recruited. Oncologist Sarah Gwynne said new CT scanners would make treatment more accurate and improve patient care. Dr Gwynne said the CT scanner at Singleton Hospital, Swansea, was 10 years old and ""technology had moved on dramatically in that time"". The (RCR) welcomed the new equipment, but said radiographers, radiologists and doctors were needed to operate it and interpret the results, adding there was ""a shortage of all three"", with more expected to leave the NHS or reduce their hours in the next year. Earlier this year,the shortage was described as ""shocking"". ""It's very welcome as the equipment it's funding is top-end stuff and it is going to make a different to patients,"" said Dr Toby Wells, from the RCR. ""You need the machines [but] you need the radiographers to take the imaging and the radiologists, the doctors, to interpret what the scans show and there's a shortage of all three of those."" There have been concerns that many people fearing they have cancer may not have contacted their GPs during the coronavirus pandemic. Latest Welsh government figures show more people than ever - the equivalent of 18% of the population - are waiting for planned treatments. There were 568,367 people on waiting lists in March, up 24.4% on the same time last year. With many people unable to attend hospitals for imaging and diagnostic appointments during the pandemic, waiting times for scans and tests have also increased. Dr Sarah Gwynne said the equipment would make a difference to how patients were treated Announcing Â£25m to upgrade CT, X-Ray, ultrasound and MRI machines across Wales, Baroness Morgan said the new diagnostic equipment was vital to start to clear the ""backlog"" and would ""transform lives"". Speaking during a visit to Singleton Hospital, she said she was concerned about 30,000 fewer people had contacted the NHS about cancer concerns this year, compared to 2020. Clearing the waiting list for cancer scans and treatment was a ""key priority"" for the Welsh government because people with cancer ""cannot wait"". ""We are aware there is a huge backlog that we need to address, but cancer services in particular have always been essential services throughout this pandemic,"" she said. Tackling NHS waiting lists 'a gargantuan task' Covid cancer delays 'could cause 2,000 deaths' 'Worrying gap' over cancer patients being seen Dr Gwynne said she hoped a Â£5.5m new state-of-the-art CT simulator would help to cut waiting lists for treatment, with its accuracy speeding up the process. She said the new CT simulator would allow them to get a ""better picture of where the tumour is"" to allow them to kill cancer cells with radiation more accurately, without harming surrounding cells. She said this greatly benefitted patients with tumours in their chest - such as breast and lung cancer - as they can move while breathing, as well as helping target radiation. The RCR estimates that Walesneeds to recruit 97 more radiologiststo meet growing demand. It also warned that many radiologists plan to leave NHS Wales next year and those staying intending to reduce their hours. ""They've started and they've given us this kit and they've funded more radiology trainees, but we need more,"" said Dr Wells. Those concerns were echoed by Judi Rhys, chief executive at Tenovus Cancer Care: ""We know that there are still approximately 35,000 people in Wales 'missing' from the cancer system and additional diagnostic equipment will help address the backlog. ""But we also need to invest in other elements of the NHS, including the workforce."" The Welsh government has already announced Â£100m of funding to help deal with the backlog caused by Covid-19. Baroness Morgan is to announce that Â£25m of the cash would be used to upgrade ""ageing equipment as part of our effort to ensure the NHS can respond to demand with resilient services"". The spending plan includes: Â£2.3m for a CT scanner and two diagnostic radiology rooms at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr, in Ystrad Mynach Â£3.3m for a gamma camera and interventional radiology suite at Wrexham Maelor Hospital Â£2.1m for CT simulator replacement at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd Â£3.2m for fluoroscopy and cath lab at University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff Â£3.1m for an upgrade of MRI and fluoroscopy room, providing X-ray imaging at the Princess of Wales Hospital, in Bridgend Â£4.5m for two replacement CT scanners at Glangwilli Hospital, in Carmarthenshire and Withybush Hospital, Pembrokeshire Â£1m for fluoroscopy X-ray imaging and MRI upgrade at Velindre Cancer Centre, in Cardiff Â£350,000 for four ultrasound machines at Brecon, Newtown, Llandrindod Wells and Welshpool hospitals ""It's our priority to support the recovery of the NHS and this is a first step to ensuring the health service has access to sufficient diagnostic capacity to deal with the people waiting as a result of the pandemic,"" Baroness Morgan added. ""We aren't out of the pandemic yet. Investing in the diagnostic national capital replacement programme and upgrading the equipment available to our incredible healthcare workforce is key to diagnosing, treating and caring for people as we move forward."" Cancer charities have raised concerns about the impact of the pandemic on waiting times for both patients and staff. Baroness Morgan has also previously warned that the Welsh NHS faced ""a gargantuan task"" to tackle ""record high"" NHS waiting lists.

"The village with more holiday homes than residentsTwo out of about 50 homes in Cwm-yr-Eglwys have permanent residents, with a third on the market.","This video can not be played In recent times, Cwm-yr-Eglwys has become hugely popular as a holiday destination Residents of a small village fear their community will be lost forever as most of the homes are being used for holiday lets. Only two out of the 50 properties in Cwm-yr-Eglwys, Pembrokeshire, have permanent residents. A third is for sale for more than Â£1m and locals say they are being priced out of the market. They want to see urgent action to protect coastal communities from the rise in second home ownership. Cwm-yr-Eglwys is one of the most picturesque villages in Pembrokeshire - a sheltered cove with a ruined church on the foreshore, echoing a sea-faring past and a time when sea captains and their families, fishermen and farmers all lived in the village and surrounding area. Second-home council tax to fund affordable housing Second-home owners 'use loophole' to claim grants In recent times, it has become hugely popular as a holiday destination, with the Pembrokeshire coastal path running directly through the village. There is a small caravan park and about 50 properties, which by now are nearly all holiday homes. There is not much else here - no shop, no pub - only an ice cream kiosk in high season. In winter, the place is deserted but in summer, it is bustling with tourists. But locals say the community has been lost as each house in turn has become a holiday home. Keith Battrick is a councillor with Dinas Cross community council. He lives nearby and has seen the area change in the 50 years or so since he moved here from Bridgend. ""It's a summer village - winter time it's completely dead. No-one here, just the odd walker - that's it,"" he said. ""So it's a sad village really and probably will never change. It makes me sad that the local indigenous community can't afford to live here. ""Local children - my son included - who want to move back here, find it hard. Within 10 years there probably won't be anyone local living here - the future of Cwm-yr-Eglwys is as a holiday place."" Of the three properties still lived in all year, one is on the market for Â£1.3m and the other two are home to people in their 80s. Norman Thomas's house sits on the water's edge, overlooking the beach. It was the home he shared with his wife and four children. He is 88 years old and also the only remaining Welsh speaker in the village and said the language would disappear entirely after his time. ""All those houses through the valley have been sold to English people,"" he said. ""I'm not against them - they bring work here. I get on with them all. But it's sad that the Welsh can't afford these houses. ""That house over there is on the market for Â£1.3m. It's ridiculous. The government should have stepped in and stopped these high prices. ""We've got to accept this is what it's coming to - there are lots of little places like Cwm-yr-Eglwys - nothing left - there isn't even a pub here."" The only other permanent residents are the Broughtons - Elizabeth and Harry who are 80 and 85. Originally from Lancashire, they came on holiday to Cwm-yr-Eglwys in the 1960s and fell in love with the place. When the opportunity came to buy a house in the village, they jumped at the chance. Twenty years ago, they moved here permanently and said they did not mind the village being full of holiday homes - it means there are usually people around and they have seen their investment grow beyond all expectation. ""We get notes through the door, asking can they rent it or are we selling,"" explained Elizabeth. ""Our family would like to keep it but it comes down to pounds, shillings and pence. We are sitting on a goldmine here, no question about it. Very few houses come for sale here so they're pretty sought after."" House prices in Pembrokeshire have risen more than 5% in the past year, with the average home in the county costing Â£225,000, well above the Welsh average. Estate agents are reporting a surge in demand for rural and coastal properties as people emerge from the pandemic, looking for a new way of life. Pembrokeshire also has the second highest number of second homes in Wales - about 9% of the county's housing stock. People say all this is not only creating an impossible challenge for those trying to get on to the property market, but also that whole communities are now under threat. Mr Battrick said more villages and communities like Cwm-yr-Eglwys would be lost unless action is taken to tackle the issue. ""It all goes back to Welsh government - really they should sit down and think really hard about what is happening to villages in Pembrokeshire and all through Wales. ""We will end up eventually with villages like Cwm-yr-Eglwys where there are no local people left living in them and that time is coming quickly I think."" A Welsh government spokesman, said: ""A large number of second homes in a local community can have a real impact on that community. ""Wales is the only UK nation to give local authorities powers to charge higher levels of council tax on both long-term empty properties and second homes. The decision to apply and increase council tax premiums rests with local authorities. ""We've also increased the higher rate of land transaction tax, which applies when people buy an additional property. We are looking at what further interventions are available and how our partners can use existing powers."" Bob Kilmister, Pembrokeshire council cabinet member for finance said the second homes council tax premium - introduced on 1 April 2017 - meant such owners were charged an extra 50% on top of their usual rates. ""The funds are used to increase the supply of affordable housing and enhance the sustainability of local communities.""

"Amazon beefs up Covid testing capabilitiesThe online giant may use this as a further opportunity to get into the health sector, analysts say.","Amazon has set up its own Covid testing facilities in Greater Manchester Amazon is to expand its Covid testing lab facilities in the UK as the pandemic continues. The online giant said this was to benefit employees and UK public health. However, analysts said it could also provide business opportunities in the health sector and buff up Amazon's reputation after questions over working conditions. Amazon recently moved into the online pharmacy business in the US for subscribers to its Prime service. In 2020, the online retailing giant set up laboratories in Kentucky and in Greater Manchester to process employees' PCR tests. The lab in Manchester has processed 900,000 test samples to date. The test results are anonymous and will be shared with Public Health England once the lab is approved for sequencing. Its coronavirus response efforts have so far cost the company $11.5bn (Â£8.1bn). Tom Forte, managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Amazon could convert staff Covid-19 testing and healthcare clinics for consumer use. ""We believe Covid-19 inspired Amazon to accelerate its healthcare-related efforts, by necessity. ""That said, we had long believed healthcare was an attractive opportunity for Amazon given its large market size and chances for the company to both improve the customer experience and lower the costs."" There are very few companies in the world who could have decided to build a state of the art diagnostics lab and have it functioning within months, but Amazon is one of them. While the company insists that at the moment this site is purely to help keep their staff safer at work, they are sending out a very clear message. They are able to process medical diagnostics and feed that information into public health agencies. Right now this multimillion-pound site in Salford is only testing for Covid-19, but it's unlikely to be left idle after the pandemic. Amazon's most valuable product is the information they already hold about their customers, and medical data is a very rich pool indeed to be dipping their toes into. Covid-19: Nearly 4,000 Amazon staff given wrong test results Amazon plots a course into the healthcare industry Lab director Luke Meredith joined Amazon from the World Health Organization and works alongside 70 Amazon lab technicians at the site in Wardley, Manchester. ""What we decided during the Covid outbreak is that we really needed to maximise protection for safe working in the fulfilment centres,"" he told the BBC. Luke Meredith said the lab will help increase protection in Amazon's warehouses At the moment, the two sites are processing samples from staff across Europe and the Americas, tapping into the company's logistics network. Neil Travis, North West regional director for Amazon UK, said: ""For now, we are focused on the safety of our colleagues."" James Moar, lead analyst for Juniper Research, thinks that Amazon's expansion of its testing laboratories is ""intended to enhance Amazon's reputation"", although he said Amazon would be unlikely to pass up a business opportunity. There have been a number of controversies about how Amazon treats its staff. On Wednesday, a report found that staff at its warehouses in the US are injured at a higher rate than those doing similar jobs at other companies' warehouses. Earlier this year, the company apologised for falsely denying that its drivers were having to urinate in plastic bottles. And during the first wave of the pandemic, the company was accused of ""cutting corners"" on Covid safety,which it denied. However, Mr Moar thinks that having the laboratories could be useful to Amazon in the future. ""Amazon has tried to get into healthcare in a number of ways,"" he said. ""This is basically Amazon saying that as well as providing the facilities for its employees' healthcare, it's a demonstration that they can work to provide healthcare services. ""This means they've already got some groundwork to show any potential partners.""

FBI accuses Russia-linked hackers of attack on JBSThe White House says President Biden will bring up cyber-attacks when he meets Russia's President Putin.US & Canada,"JBS, founded in Brazil in 1953, is the world's largest meat supplier A Russian cyber-criminal group was behind a ransomware attack that has targeted the world's largest meat processing company, the FBI has said. The FBI said it was working to bring the REvil group to justice for the hack on JBS. The cyber-breach over the weekend shut some JBS operations in the US, Canada and Australia. REvil - also known as Sodinokibi - is one of the most prolific and profitable cyber-criminal groups in the world. ""We have attributed the JBS attack to REvil and Sodinokibi and are working diligently to bring the threat actors to justice,"" the FBI statement said. ""We continue to focus our efforts on imposing risk and consequences and holding the responsible cyber actors accountable."" The White House said on Wednesday that US President Joe Biden would bring up the issue of cyber-attacks when he meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in two weeks. ""Responsible states do not harbour ransomware criminals,"" said press secretary Jen Psaki. The ransomware surge ruining lives Colonial Pipeline boss confirms $4.4m ransom paid Should paying hacker ransoms be banned? JBS said it was on schedule to resume meatpacking operations on Thursday in the US, where its five biggest beef plants are located. The company, which identified the ransomware attack on Sunday, has not disclosed whether it paid the hackers. Ransomware is one of the most prolific forms of cyber-attack. It typically involves hackers gaining access to a computer network and either encrypting files or locking users out of their systems until a ransom is paid. In recent years, the use of ransomware for extortion has become a national security issue of serious concern. Last month, fuel delivery in the south-east of the US was crippled for several days after a ransomware attack targeted the Colonial Pipeline. Investigators say that attack was linked to another group, DarkSide, with ties to Russia. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? Colonial Pipeline has confirmed it paid a $4.4m (Â£3.1m) ransom to the cyber-criminal gang responsible. The US government has recommended in the past that companies do not pay criminals over ransomware attacks, in case they invite further hacks in the future. Just days after the attack on Colonial Pipeline, a different group ofÂ cyber-criminalsinfected the Irish national health system with ransomware. REvil is a criminal network of ransomware hackers that first came to prominence in 2019. Most of its members are believed to be based in Russia or countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Pronounced ""R"" followed by the word ""evil"", REvil has been linked to GandCrab, a now-defunct hacker gang that has used similar ransomware in the past. REvil is known as a ransomware-as-a-service (RAAS) enterprise for the way it operates. This involves ransomware developers recruiting affiliates, or partners, to spread their malicious malware. If the attacks are successful, developers take a percentage of the earned income and provide the other portion to the affiliates. The group threatens to post stolen documents on its website - known as the ""Happy Blog"" - if victims don't comply with its demands. One of the group's best-known attacks was on an Apple Inc supplier named Quanta Computer Inc earlier this year. In a note posted on the dark web, the group said it would release sensitive internal documents unless it received $50m in ransom. REvil was also linked to a co-ordinated attack on nearly two dozen local governments in Texas in 2019. JBS is the world's largest meat supplier with more than 150 plants in 15 countries It was founded in Brazil in 1953 as a slaughtering business by rancher JosÃ© Batista Sobrinho The company now has more than 150,000 employees worldwide Its customers include supermarkets and fast food outlet McDonald's In the US, JBS processes nearly one-quarter of the country's beef and one-fifth of its pork Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump faces sentencing in New York hush-money case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?
