"Facebook removes Trump's 'Covid misinformation'The social network said the post had violated its rules around ""harmful Covid misinformation"".US Election 2020","A clip from President Trump's Fox News interview was posted to his Facebook page Facebook and Twitter have penalised Donald Trump and his campaign for posts in which the president claimed children were ""almost immune"" to coronavirus. Facebook deleted the post - a clip from an interview Mr Trump gave to Fox News - saying it contained ""harmful Covid misinformation"". Twitter followed by saying it had frozen a Trump campaign account until a tweet of the same clip was removed. US public health advice makes clear children have no immunity to Covid-19. A Facebook spokesperson said on Wednesday evening: ""This video includes false claims that a group of people is immune from COVID-19 which is a violation of our policies around harmful COVID misinformation."" It was the first time the social giant had taken action to remove content posted by the president based on its coronavirus-misinformation policy, but not the first time it has penalised Mr Trump over content on his page. Later on Wednesday, Twitter said it had frozen the @TeamTrump account because it posted the same interview excerpt, which President Trump's account shared. A Twitter spokesman said the @TeamTrump tweet ""is in violation of the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation"". ""The account owner will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again."" It later appeared to have been deleted. Twitter last month temporarily suspended Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, for sharing a clip it said promoted ""misinformation"" about coronavirus and hydroxychloroquine. But in March, Twitter said a tweet by entrepreneur Elon Musk suggesting children are ""essentially immune"" to coronavirus did not break its rules. Elon Musk coronavirus misinformation stays online Speaking by telephone to morning show Fox and Friends on Wednesday, Mr Trump argued it was time for all schools nationwide to reopen. He said: ""If you look at children, children are almost - and I would almost say definitely - almost immune from this disease. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How pods and zutors are changing home-schooling Coronanomics: 'I'm just looking for whatever I can get' ""So few, they've got stronger, hard to believe, I don't know how you feel about it, but they've got much stronger immune systems than we do somehow for this. ""And they don't have a problem, they just don't have a problem."" Mr Trump, who is running for re-election in November, also said of coronavirus: ""This thing's going away. It will go away like things go away."" This video can not be played Reopening US schools ""makes our kids guinea pigs"" Children can catch and transmit the virus, but they run an extremely low risk of becoming ill from it. Adults - and particularly older adults - are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? The largest study done so far, involving more than 55,000 hospital patients, found that only 0.8% were under the age of 19. Half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were 60 or older as of 31 July,according to a research charity.,external A recent US study of coronavirus cases among 7,780 children from 26 countries found almost one in five patients had no symptoms. Another one in five developed lesions on their lungs during the infection. Some 3.3% were admitted to intensive care units and seven deaths were reported,according to the research from the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio,external. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,externalfound that people under 20 were about half as susceptible to coronavirus infection as those over 20. There have been some extremely rare cases of children developingan inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease, and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus. In June, Facebook said it had removed adverts for President Trump's re-election campaign that featured a symbol used in Nazi Germany. The company said the offending ad contained an inverted red triangle similar to that used by the Nazis to label opponents such as communists. Mr Trump's campaign team said the far-left activist group antifa uses the symbol and it was a reference to them. The ads, which were posted on the site on pages belonging to President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence, were online for about 24 hours and had received hundreds of thousands of views before they were taken down. Hundreds of school districts around the country have scrapped plans to reopen as coronavirus infections have spiked in a number of US states. Some 20 of the nation's largest 25 school districts have announced they will start remotely. Among the schools that are not reopening is one attended by the president's son, Barron Trump, in suburban Maryland. St Andrew's Episcopal School said in a letter to parents it would opt instead for virtual learning to protect the health of students, families and staff. Last week Georgia's largest school district, Gwinnett County, returned to school campuses to start planning for autumn reopening. A day later, 260 employees had been told to stay away from their schools because they tested positive for coronavirus, or had been exposed to someone else who had the infection. One of the first school districts in the nation to reopen, near Indianapolis, Indiana, had a student test positive on the first day. The child's parents had sent him to campus, knowing that his test result was pending, schools officials said. Other students who had come within 6ft of the patient for more than 15 minutes were sent home to self-isolate for 14 days. EASY STEPS:What can I do?

That takes the total fatalities, as measured by National Records of Scotland, to 4,208 For 20 days in a row there have been no new deaths of someone who tested positive for Covid-19. BBC Scotland News Thatâs
all from us on the latest coronavirus developments in Scotland for Wednesday 5
August. Here
are todayâs biggest headlines: We'll be back in the morning. Have a good evening and
stay safe. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The number of positive cases stemming from the Aberdeen outbreak is ""likely"" to increase over the next few days, the interim chief medical officer has said. As of today 54 people have tested positive in relation to this cluster. Dr Gregor Smith told Drivetime that not all of these cases are people living within the city. He also said he would be ""very surprised"" if there were no further outbreaks elsewhere in Scotland. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland An Aberdeen councillor has suggested the outbreak in the city is in part due to confusion around the guidelines. Cllr Marie Bolton, who convenes the city's licensing board, told Drivetime that officials were engaging with businesses and encouraging compliance. But she added: ""I don't think Aberdeen's alone in finding themselves, perhaps, a bit confused with some of the guidance that's been issued."" In particular, Ms Bolton pointed to confusion around when to wear face masks and the distance people should be keeping between one another. ""There's lots of different things where people are saying, 'should I be doing this, shouldn't I be doing that?',"" she said. Katie McEvinneyBBC Scotland News Lauren, Luke and Kelly are among thousands of students whose estimated grades were lowered When Luke Robertson, 16, from Motherwell opened his exams results on Tuesday, the scramble of letters on the page wasn't what he had hoped for. ""It just doesn't make sense to me,"" Luke said. ""I got a B in my physics prelim but the SQA gave me a C. I feel annoyed with them"". He had been predicted to achieve mostly As by his teachers and had been assured by them that his final grades would not be lower than his prelim performance. But like many pupils across Scotland, Luke said he was ""disappointed and shocked"" by the surprise grades and now felt uncertain about the future. Read more. Edinburgh's Sleeping Beauty cast includes Allan Stewart, Andy Gray, Grant Stott and Jordan Young The UK's biggest pantomime producer has started cancelling its 2020 shows amid ongoing uncertainty about when theatres will be able to reopen fully. Qdos has put this year's festive shows in Aberdeen, Belfast, Edinburgh and Southampton back to 2021. The operator of the King's Theatre in Edinburgh said the move would result in ""the massive loss of Â£2.3m at the worst possible time for the theatres"". Read more. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland A petition urging the SQA to reevaluate this year's exam results has garnered over 20,000 signatures in a day. Thousands of Scottish pupilsreceived worse results than expectedyesterday after the country's exam body lowered 125,000 estimated grades. School pupil Sarah McLauchlan started the petition calling for each student to be looked at independently, rather than having their school's historic attainment data taken into account. ""This isn't just me and a small group of friends trying to kick up a fuss. It is affecting thousands of people,"" she told BBC Drivetime. She said the SQA had assumed teachers had overestimated pupils' grades instead of investigating. ""They had no exams. So why, instead of using that time to give more accurate results, did they use a system that really didn't reflect any student personally?"" she asked. The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system. Siberia took the decision to close for two weeks yesterday, before the local lockdown was announced The Aberdeen and Shire Licensed Trade Association has
described the reimposition of restrictions as âvery disappointingâ. President of the association Mike Kinnaird said the sector
was âworked tirelesslyâ to put in place various measures to allow venues to
open safely. He added: âThe Shire members are also concerned. This is a
major problem for restaurants who have taken in food and staff... Itâs very
disappointing.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Conciliation service Acas said calls to its redundancy advice line almost tripled in June and July, as concerns mounted about the government's job retention scheme winding down.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland A partial lockdown in Aberdeen after a cluster of 54 coronavirus cases was announced by the first minister today. John Beattie will be speaking to the businesses having to close the shutters for at least seven days. Tune in on BBC Radio Scotland or the play icon above. Also on the programme: Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor In a bid to kick-start the economy in a post-coronavirus era planning rules are set to change Planning rules are to be revised and applications handled
more swiftly, to reduce obstacles to business investment. That is one of a wide-ranging set of Scottish government
policies to help economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. The other measures include: Business groups have welcomed many of the measures, but say
there must be swift action as well as policy development.  Environmental campaigners complain the plans do not go far
enough in helping make homes more energy efficient. The Westminster plan for
home improvement grants is not being applied in Scotland, though there are some
funds already available. Following an
increase in coronavirus cases in Aberdeen, local restrictions on
travel, indoor gatherings between households and the closure of indoor and
outdoor hospitality are being introduced in the Aberdeen City local authority
area. From 5pm today bars, restaurants, cafes and pubs will be
required by law to close. Hotel restaurants can remain open to provide food for
existing guests, and takeaway services can continue. People in
Aberdeen City are asked not to meet other households indoors or travel more
than five miles for leisure or recreational purposes. People can
continue to travel for work, or education purposes. Visiting in hospitals and
care homes will return to essential visits only. The restrictions
come as NHS Grampian have reported there are now 54
positive cases of Covid-19 in the cluster associated with the Hawthorn Bar in
Aberdeen. A total of 191 close contacts have been traced through Test
& Protect. More than 20 licensed
premises have now been identified as being linked to people who have
subsequently tested positive and the outbreak is linked to the
night time economy. Ben PhilipBBC Scotland Councillor Jenny
Laing, the co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said the renewed restrictions in the city were ""unfortunate"" just as a degree of normality was returning after the initial coronavirus pandemic. But she said ""the safety of our citizens remains our first priority"". The council's other co-leader, Councillor Douglas Lumsden, said: ""Itâs really disappointing that weâre having to take a backwards step. âHowever, looking at the data from NHS Grampian and looking ahead to the schools re-opening next week, I think itâs the right thing to do. âWe had a meeting with the first minister this morning and we were all in full agreement on the route weâve taken today... ""And in terms of lockdown, we donât want this to continue any longer than it needs to. It will be reviewed again in seven days' time and hopefully we can come out of these temporary lockdown measures next week.â Restrictions to deal with new coronavirus outbreaks have been imposed in parts of Europe since lockdowns were eased.

The Scottish Tourism Alliance and UK Hospitality have called Aberdeen's new lockdown restrictions a ""devastating blow"" to hospitality businesses who have invested significant amounts of money in
reopening. The two bodies released a statement saying that Aberdeen serves as an example of how quickly the virus can reignite and
illustrates the immediate impact that this has on a local economy and public
health. It said: ""Todayâs news comes as a shock and should serve as a reminder that disregarding
these guidelines has almost immediate consequences, however we must also
recognise that many people and businesses are enjoying the easing of
restrictions in a safe way that poses little threat to public safety."" They also said that further sector
specific financial support would be required. Police in Aberdeen said they will have additional patrols in areas where local restrictions have been introduced. Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said officers will continue to engage,
educate and encourage people to comply with the guidelines. But they will not hesitate to take enforcement action where appropriate, he said. âAs a national service, Police
Scotland is able to quickly flex capacity to support local communities across
the country, and we will provide whatever additional resources are necessary to
protect and support the communities affected,"" he said. DCC Kerr said the majority of the public followed the law and Scottish government
advice during the pandemic. ""I realise that this situation will be frustrating for people in the
affected area but itâs really important that we all continue to do so,"" he said.   Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Caravan and camp sites 'inundated' with calls,"The ""sun is shining"" with customers' return to Three Cliffs Bay Holiday Park in Gower Caravan and camp sites around Wales ""haven't stopped"" due to the volume of guests and staycation inquiries since coronavirus restrictions were eased. ""Everyone seems desperate to go to the countryside and coast,"" said campsite owner Fil Marshall in Pembrokeshire. One park in Gower reported receiving 100 calls a day, while a Vale of Glamorgan campsite said it had been ""inundated"" with inquiries. It is also said to be ""going well"" in Ceredigion, Gwynedd and Flintshire. Tony Beynon from Three Cliffs Bay Holiday Park in Gower said the early days of the pandemic caused some ""dark days"". ""Now we're open, the campers are back, we're doing what we do best and the sun is shining,"" he said. ""Normally in August the phone would die off because once people realise the site is saying full, it's full. ""But this year, more than ever, we're still receiving 100 calls a day."" Customers are coming from as far as Birmingham to stay at White Wheat Caravan Park in Porthcawl Coronavirus restrictions allowed holiday parks and camping sites with shared facilities to reopen from 25 July, providingstrict ruleswere followed. Alyson Baroth, owner of White Wheat Caravan Park, in Porthcawl, explained how people have been calling from as far away as Birmingham to try to secure a touring pitch. Her site is fully booked in August, and September is ""filling up"" which is good news as she says she and her husband had spent a lot on the complex since buying it in 2017. Customers have to fill in a compliance form before entering the site and toilet facilities are repeatedly cleaned. ""We have to be very strict because of Covid-19,"" Ms Baroth said. ""It's still out there. We are in a pandemic and people don't realise."" The Three Golden Cups campsite has had to cut the number of pitches for social distancing Autumn surge and winter peak 'most likely scenario' Campsites reopen - but not as you remember them Alun Williams, who manages the Three Golden Cups campsite at Southerndown, on the Vale of Glamorgan coast, said August weekends have been booked out with some availability in the week. ""We have been inundated with calls. It hasn't stopped,"" he said. Mr Williams has had to reduce the number of pitches from 35 to 30 to ensure compliance with social distancing requirements. And the adjoining pub has added screens between restaurant tables to help ""build customer confidence"". ""We are seeing a good proportion of locals coming back,"" said Mr Williams. Screens have been put up in the Three Golden Cups pub In Gwynedd, Kayleigh Bradbury from Min-Y-Don Holiday Home Park in Harlech said there had been an increase in inquiries and purchases of owner-occupier static caravans this year. ""It's going brilliantly well,"" she said. ""A lot of customers want to support the UK."" The site's touring park was also ""pretty busy"", Ms Bradbury added, with the odd vacancy in August. ""We are getting back to normality of some kind with people enjoying their holidays,"" she said. Fil Marshall, who runs Point Farm Campsite in Dale, Pembrokeshire, with wife Nia, said an influx of people to the area was like a ""cork let out of a champagne bottle"". Pubs ignoring Covid rules could be forced to shut New approach to antisocial behaviour from weekend ""Everyone seems desperate to go to the countryside and coast,"" he said. But due to social distancing regulations, the couple decided to reopen only a shepherd's hut which sleeps four, rather than an additional seven pitches, giving their guests exclusive use of the site's showers and toilet facilities. Mr Marshall said the area was popular with second homes and whilst it was busy with people there was ""not a lot of social distancing"". He described lockdown as a ""nightmare"" with a ""complete loss of income"" but the shepherd's hut has been booked up until September since regulations were lifted. People are calling from Merseyside and Manchester to pitch up at Fron Farm Country Holiday Park in Flintshire Fron Farm Country Holiday Park at Hendre, near Mold, Flintshire, is ""choc-a-block"" this weekend, albeit that the camping and caravan site has reduced its number of pitches due to social distancing rules. Teleri Roberts explained that, as the site was close to the English border, people from Liverpool and Manchester had been looking for a place to pitch up. ""We are not struggling,"" she said. Neuadd Caravan Park said customers were staying in their own ""bubbles"" to maintain social distancing In Ceredigion, Peter Evans, owner of Neuadd Caravan Park in New Quay, said he was seeing a higher volume of calls than normal. ""There are a lot more staycation inquiries,"" he said. ""We are where we should be for August,"" Mr Evans said, with regard to bookings. And he added that social distancing had been ""going well"" with groups staying in their own ""bubbles"". ""On the whole people are sensible and are prepared to cooperate because of where we have been,"" Mr Evans said.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who have been injured or lost their lives, and all those whose homes and livelihoods have been affected,"" she saidin a message of condolence.,external Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons defence select committee, said the West needed to be ""far more greatly involved in helping"" Lebanon, which he described as ""a country that's been on its knees for decades"". Why Lebanon is in crisis Even before Tuesday's explosion, tensions were high in Lebanon, with street demonstrations against the government's handling of the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. Many blame the ruling elite, who have dominated politics for years. People have to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare. The whole city was shaken by the explosion Mr Ellwood said the international community has ""taken a step back strategically from the Middle East and Lebanon is paying the price for that"". ""There's massive corruption in the government itself - it's poorly governed. Economic crisis - there's a quarter of the people out of work there. And of course they've had their own lockdown issues with Covid-19. On top of that over a million refugees have spilled across from Syria. And I have to say there's been dwindling international support... And now this,"" he said. Mr Raab said the ""wider challenges facing Lebanon and the region haven't gone away"" and that the UK would be ""looking at ways in which we can help with their medium term challenges on governance on financial support, given the situation there"". He also said he and Lebanon's PM had discussed the need for ""a full, thorough and rigorous investigation to get to the truth"" of how the blast happened, adding: ""I think the people of Lebanon deserve no less."" Earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for the UK to offer Lebanon its ""full support"" to deal with the crisis. TheSNP's foreign affairs spokesman also called,externalfor the UK to give ""immediate humanitarian assistance"" to Lebanon, as well as enter talks to possibly suspend its state debt.

Conspiracy theories spread after blast,"The huge explosion caused widespread destruction in Beirut port Early reports of the explosion in Beirut's port began circulating on social media moments after the blast. Whilst most of the videos appeared authentic, filmed by residents from their homes, rumours about the cause of the blast were also quickly shared on platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp. So, what misinformation spread online? The videos circulating showed smaller explosions and an initial fire followed by the huge blast, which led to tweets suggesting it had happened at a firework factory. Claims about fireworks seemed plausible at the time, but other viral tweets suggested the event was caused by a nuclear bomb because of the white mushroom-like cloud seen rising in some of the footage. A now-deleted tweet suggesting the explosion was ""atomic"" was shared by a verified Twitter account with over 100,000 followers and racked up thousands of shares and likes. A tweet falsely claims that the explosion in Beirut was ""atomic"" Weapons experts have been quick to point out that had the explosion been caused by a nuclear device, it would have been accompanied by a blinding white flash and a surge of heat that would have severely burned people. Also, mushroom clouds are not unique to nuclear bombs. According to experts, they are a result of the compression of humid air, which condenses water and creates the cloud. In pictures:  Chaos and destruction in Beirut after blast What is ammonium nitrate and how dangerous is it? Lebanon: Why the country is in crisis Unfounded claims continued to spread, blaming the ""nuclear bomb"" on the US, Israel or Hezbollah. These were shared by partisan news sites as well as public figures. Conspiracy theories promoted by far-right groups have also been shared on Facebook, 4chan, Reddit and messaging apps like Telegram, according to research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. Messages have mainly focused on false claims that this was an Israeli attack, either a bomb or a missile strike on a Hezbollah weapons depot. False claims circulated online suggesting a missile caused the explosion in Beirut Chloe Colliver, from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told BBC News: ""We have seen known disinformation sources, including far-right extremist networks online, spreading unfounded claims about the nature and motivations behind the blast. ""This has included theories trying to tie the explosion to Israel or other nation states."" The authorities in Lebanon and Israel have dismissed suggestions that Israel had anything to do with the incident. Far-right conspiracy theorists, including QAnon supporters, have also started sharing false claims about the explosion on Facebook. They suggest that the attack is related to a ""war between the government and the central banking system"". QAnon is a wide-ranging, unfounded conspiracy theorythat says US President Donald Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and the media. Photographs of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressing the UN General Assembly in 2018 have been posted on social media amid claims that he is pointing at the site of Tuesday's Beirut explosion. Some social media users are using the images as ""proof"" that Israel had a hand in the blast. The Israeli prime minister at the United Nations in 2018 The images are genuine and not manipulated, but have been taken out of context. Mr Netanyahu is actually pointing to a completely different district in the city of Beirut where he claimed Hezbollah was hiding weapons. The blast site is several kilometres to the north of ""Site 1"" on Mr Netanyahu's map. Rumours about a possible attack picked up steam after President Trump described the event as ""a terrible attack"" at a White House press conference. Research from the Institute for Strategic dialogue has identified his comments being shared and edited by far-right groups on social media to suggest that the blast was a terror attack or bomb. One post on Telegram claimed that Trump said ""it looks like a terrible terrorist attack"". Instead, he actually said it looks like a ""terrible attack"". Posts on social media attributed false quotes to President Trump ""We have also seen claims building off President Trump's statement about the explosion as an 'attack', which has provided fuel to conspiracy and disinformation communities over the past 24 hours, demonstrating the risks of inaccurate language and communications during crisis moments,"" Ms Colliver says. Other posts on social media make unfounded claims that Mr Trump's comments suggested the US was forewarned of the explosion.

Rescue workers search rubble after deadly Beirut blast,"This video can not be played ""Now I'm shaking, all the way from up to down"" - Eyewitnesses describe the power of the explosion Rescue workers in Lebanon are searching for dozens of people missing a day after a huge explosion devastated the port area of the capital, Beirut. The blast, which shook the whole city, killed at least 113 people and injured more than 4,000 others. A two-week state of emergency has been declared. President Michel Aoun said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse. All port officials have been put under house arrest pending an investigation. Customs chief Badri Daher told local media that his agency had repeatedly called for the ammonium nitrate to be removed, but ""this did not happen, and we leave it to the experts to determine the reasons"". Ammonium nitrate is used as a fertiliser in agriculture and as an explosive. Follow our latest updates In pictures: Chaos and destruction in Beirut What is ammonium nitrate and how dangerous is it? What we know about the explosion Why Lebanon is in crisis Opening an emergency cabinet meeting, President Aoun said: ""No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city"". The explosion occurred just after 18:00 (15:00 GMT) after a fire at the port, and it was felt 240km (150 miles) away on the island of Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean. Security forces have sealed off a wide area around the blast site, and rescuers have been looking for bodies and survivors under rubble while boats searched the waters off the coast. However the overnight rescue effort was hampered by a lack of electricity. Public Health Minister Hamad Hassan said Lebanon's health sector was short of beds and lacked the equipment necessary to treat the injured and care for patients in critical condition. This video can not be played Beirut explosion: The moment blast hit BBC bureau caught in interview He said a ""large number of children"" had been rescued but added that he feared that the number of dead would rise further. The Saint Georges hospital near the site of the explosion was badly damaged and several members of staff were killed. Three Beirut hospitals were closed with two others only partially operational, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. The body said it would airlift medical supplies to Lebanon on Wednesday evening. Three French planes are due to arrive carrying 55 rescuers, medical equipment and a mobile clinic equipped to treat 500 people. French President Emmanuel Macron will visit on Thursday. The EU is sending 100 firefighters with vehicles, dogs and equipment. Russia is sending five planes carrying rescuers, doctors and equipment. Meanwhile, many buildings and homes have been reduced to an uninhabitable mess of glass and as many as 300,000 people have been left homeless, Beirut's governor Marwan Aboud said. This video can not be played Rami Ruhayem has been to Gemmayze, the closest residential area to the port where the explosion happened The ammonium nitrate had reportedly been in a warehouse in Beirut port for six years after it was unloaded from a ship impounded at the port in 2013. The head of Beirut port and the head of the customs authority both told local media that they had written to the judiciary several times asking that the chemical be exported or sold on to ensure port safety. The port's General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV that they had been aware that the material was dangerous when a court first ordered it stored in the warehouse, ""but not to this degree"". Lebanon's Supreme Defence Council has vowed that those found responsible will face the ""maximum punishment"" possible. Economy Minister Raoul Nehme told the BBC: ""I think it is incompetence and really bad management and there are a lot of responsibilities from management and probably previous governments. We do not intend after such an explosion to stay silent on who is responsible for what."" British former intelligence officer Philip Ingram told the BBC's Today programme that ammonium nitrate could only be turned into an explosive substance under certain circumstances. Mr Ingram said that safely stored it was relatively safe but that in confined space and when contaminated with items such as fuel oil it could cause an explosion. The port area was largely flattened The ammonium nitrate arrived on a Moldovan-flagged ship, the Rhosus, which entered Beirut port after suffering technical problems during its voyage from Georgia to Mozambique, according to Shiparrested.com, which deals with shipping-related legal cases. The Rhosus was inspected, banned from leaving and was shortly afterwards abandoned by its owners, sparking several legal claims. Its cargo was then removed and stored in a port warehouse for safety reasons, the report said.

With Covid-19 infections on the rise, hospitals were already struggling to cope. Now, they are faced with treating thousands of injured people. The country is also going through the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, and tensions were already high with street demonstrations against the government. Many blame the ruling elite who have dominated politics for years and amassed their own wealth while failing to carry out the sweeping reforms necessary to solve the country's problems. People have to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare. Lebanon imports most of its food and large quantities of grain stored in the port have been destroyed causing fears of widespread food insecurity to come. The future of the port itself is in doubt due to the destruction caused. President Aoun announced that the government would release 100 billion lira (Â£50.5m; $66m) of emergency funds but the impact of the blast on the economy is expected to be long-lasting. The explosion happened close to the scene of a huge car bombing which killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005. A verdict is due in the trial of four men accused of orchestrating the attack on Mr Hariri at a special court in the Netherlands. Have you been personally affected by this story?

Beirut port officials in house arrest after blast,"This video can not be played ""Now I'm shaking, all the way from up to down"" A number of Beirut port officials are being placed under house arrest pending an investigation into Tuesday's huge explosion, Lebanon's government says. The blast killed at least 135 people and injured more than 4,000 others. A two-week state of emergency has begun. President Michel Aoun said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse. Customs chief Badri Daher said his agency called for the chemical to be removed, but ""this did not happen"". ""We leave it to the experts to determine the reasons,"" he said. Ammonium nitrate is used as a fertiliser in agriculture and as an explosive. Opening an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday, President Aoun said: ""No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city"". Specialists at the University of Sheffield in the UK estimate that the blast had about one tenth of the explosive power ofthe atomic bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshimaduring World War Two and was ""unquestionably one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in history"". The ammonium nitrate had reportedly been in a warehouse in Beirut port for six years after it was unloaded from a ship impounded in 2013. The head of Beirut port and the head of the customs authority both told local media that they had written to the judiciary several times asking that the chemical be exported or sold on to ensure port safety.

Its cargo was stored in a port warehouse for safety reasons, the report said. By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor Volunteers have poured onto the streets of Beirut to help clear up the devastation while others have been visiting the worst affected areas in a state of shock. The government has been promising a full and transparent investigation and told the military to put those responsible for storing the vast quantity of ammonium nitrate under house arrest. But Beirutis have been unimpressed, seeing it as another attempt by the political elite to dodge the blame for disaster. Instead, they are demanding full accountability. Many on social media have welcomed the generosity of those offering help from around the world, but have asked people to avoid making any donations through the government, which they now regard as terminally corrupt and incompetent.

Ethnic minorities 'over-exposed' to coronavirus,"People from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to report taking public transport People from ethnic minority backgrounds in Britain ""face greater barriers"" when trying to protect themselves from coronavirus, according to a report. The Runnymede Trust, a race equality think-tank, said Bangladeshi and black African people were most vulnerable. Jobs, households and using public transport are all said to be risk factors. The government said it is working to help ethnic minorities, who have been disproportionately harmed by Covid-19. There is growing evidence that people from those communities are at greater risk from the virus. The Runnymede Trust also warned important public safety messages aimed at reducing transmission were currently not reaching all black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Covid studies to examine virus link with ethnicity The survey of 2,585 adults in Great Britain, including 750 from BAME backgrounds, suggests ethnic minorities are ""over-exposed"" because they are more likely to live in multigenerational households, which can reduce the ability to self-isolate and shield from the virus. Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Black African groups are said to be the most likely to live in ""overcrowded housing"". And more than a quarter of people from BAME backgrounds classified themselves as a ""key worker"" (28%), compared with 23% of white British people questioned in the same survey. This video can not be played BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? BAME key workers were also more likely to report feeling as if they had faced additional risks through not having adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). The survey found those from ethnic minority backgrounds were also more likely to say they had used public transport during lockdown - which could increase the chance of transmission because they are enclosed spaces. The Runnymede Trust said all these factors helped to explain why certain parts of society had been hardest hit during the pandemic. ""While we have all faced the same storm, we are not in the same boat."" said Dr Zubaida Haque, interim director of the trust. ""Our findings explain why we are seeing outbreaks in places like Leicester, densely populated areas with multigenerational households. Many people are also struggling to pay bills so have to leave their homes to work. ""Temporary housing and financial support should be made available to facilitate those who need to self-isolate."" The report also found ethnic minorities are less likely to know about government messaging like ""Stay Home"" and economic measures like the furlough scheme. It recommends the NHS Test and Trace system needs to be better at reaching the most vulnerable, including working closer with local authorities who already have trusted relationships with their communities. A statement from the Department for Health said: ""We know that Covid-19 has had a disproportionate effect on people from Bame backgrounds, and, following the findings of the Public Health England report, the equalities minister is now taking forward vital work to tackle these disparities and protect our most vulnerable communities from the impact of the virus.""

Minister denies deprived pupils were penalised,"Mr Swinney met pupils who were receiving their results at Stonlelaw High School in Rutherglen on Tuesday Scotland's education secretary has rejected claims that bright pupils from deprived areas were unfairly penalised by the country's exam system. Thousands of pupils received worse results than they were expecting on Tuesday after the country's exam body lowered about 125,000 estimated grades. Some pupils believe they were penalised because their schools have historically not performed as well. But John Swinney insisted that the data ""does not bear this out"". Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said it was always accepted that there would be ""questions"" about the grading system that was introduced when exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of Scots pupils have exam grades lowered 'Medical dream in tatters because of where I live' How grades were worked out for Scottish pupils But he said the pass rate for pupils in the most deprived areas was higher this year than it was last year, while the attainment gap between the wealthiest and poorest pupils had narrowed. The education secretary added: ""What I would accept is that there will be individual results which will cause disappointment. ""That is why the final stage of the process that was put in place by the Scottish Qualifications Authority is a free appeals process which enables young people, in consultation with their schools, to come forward with evidence which would challenge some of the judgements that have been made. ""I would encourage any young person who feels disappointed by their results, and that they should have had a better result, to use that service"". Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended Olivia Biggart, from Motherwell, achieved five As in her Higher prelims at the start of the year, and was predicted by her teachers to be awarded the same when her results arrived on Tuesday morning. But despite having spent the summer studying for the University Clinical Aptitude Test (Ucat), she was awarded two As and three Bs. Olivia, 16, and her family believe she was downgraded because of where she lives. Her father, David Biggart, said: ""It is a small school and in a poorer catchment area. ""Olivia got seven As in her Nat 5 exams. She was in fifth year doing maths, English, chemistry, physics and PE. The school predicted five As and that is what they submitted to the SQA. ""We had increased our expectations based on Olivia's prelims, researching medical schools. ""Olivia has been studying all summer for the Ucat medical test to study medicine at university, but all her dreams are now in tatters as a result of the SQA and their treatment of poorer schools and high achieving pupils at those schools. ""I am absolutely livid at the SQA."" Read the full story here School exams in Scotland were cancelled for the first time ever, with the grades of pupils worked out using estimates made by their teachers based on their performance over the school year. However, these estimates were then moderated by the SQA exams body - which led to about 125,000 results being downgraded. The SQA said its aim was to ""ensure consistency across schools and colleges, and with results from previous years"". As part of the process, the SQA looked at each school's previous history of estimating results and attainment.

Minister denies deprived pupils were penalisedSome pupils say they got lower grades because their schools have not performed as well as others in the past.Scotland,"Mr Swinney met pupils who were receiving their results at Stonlelaw High School in Rutherglen on Tuesday Scotland's education secretary has rejected claims that bright pupils from deprived areas were unfairly penalised by the country's exam system. Thousands of pupils received worse results than they were expecting on Tuesday after the country's exam body lowered about 125,000 estimated grades. Some pupils believe they were penalised because their schools have historically not performed as well. But John Swinney insisted that the data ""does not bear this out"". Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said it was always accepted that there would be ""questions"" about the grading system that was introduced when exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of Scots pupils have exam grades lowered 'Medical dream in tatters because of where I live' How grades were worked out for Scottish pupils But he said the pass rate for pupils in the most deprived areas was higher this year than it was last year, while the attainment gap between the wealthiest and poorest pupils had narrowed. The education secretary added: ""What I would accept is that there will be individual results which will cause disappointment. ""That is why the final stage of the process that was put in place by the Scottish Qualifications Authority is a free appeals process which enables young people, in consultation with their schools, to come forward with evidence which would challenge some of the judgements that have been made. ""I would encourage any young person who feels disappointed by their results, and that they should have had a better result, to use that service"". Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended Olivia Biggart, from Motherwell, achieved five As in her Higher prelims at the start of the year, and was predicted by her teachers to be awarded the same when her results arrived on Tuesday morning. But despite having spent the summer studying for the University Clinical Aptitude Test (Ucat), she was awarded two As and three Bs. Olivia, 16, and her family believe she was downgraded because of where she lives. Her father, David Biggart, said: ""It is a small school and in a poorer catchment area. ""Olivia got seven As in her Nat 5 exams. She was in fifth year doing maths, English, chemistry, physics and PE. The school predicted five As and that is what they submitted to the SQA. ""We had increased our expectations based on Olivia's prelims, researching medical schools. ""Olivia has been studying all summer for the Ucat medical test to study medicine at university, but all her dreams are now in tatters as a result of the SQA and their treatment of poorer schools and high achieving pupils at those schools. ""I am absolutely livid at the SQA."" Read the full story here School exams in Scotland were cancelled for the first time ever, with the grades of pupils worked out using estimates made by their teachers based on their performance over the school year. However, these estimates were then moderated by the SQA exams body - which led to about 125,000 results being downgraded. The SQA said its aim was to ""ensure consistency across schools and colleges, and with results from previous years"". As part of the process, the SQA looked at each school's previous history of estimating results and attainment.

LiveLiveUK 'underestimated virus threat from Europe'1 minute ago,"Global deaths passes 700,000; more than 11 million people have recovered from the virus Outbreaks in the US, Brazil, India are behind a significant proportion of the daily worldwide toll The spread of coronavirus in the UK could have been slowed with earlier quarantine restrictions on arrivals, MPs say Lockdown restrictions are being reimposed in Aberdeen, Scotland, due to a coronavirus cluster in the city Spain announces 1,772 new daily cases - the largest increase since national lockdown measures ended Sweden - which controversially did not impose a strict lockdown - sees its economy shrink but less than in other EU nations Virgin Atlantic becomes latest airline industry casualty as it files for bankruptcy in the US Edited by Lauren Turner, Victoria Bisset and Ella Wills We're wrapping up our live coverage of the biggest coronavirus stories across the world and will be back again on Thursday morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Hazel Shearing, Joshua Nevett, Ella Wills and Victoria Bisset, and edited by Kevin Ponniah and Lauren Turner. As global deaths pass 700,000, here's a reminder of Wednesday's biggest coronavirus stories: New York City plans to introduce quarantine checkpoints at key entrances to the city to screen travellers arriving from parts of the US with rising numbers of coronavirus cases. âTravellers coming in from those states will be given information about the quarantine, they will be reminded that it is required, not optional,â the city's mayor Bill de Blasio explained at a news conference on Wednesday. âTheyâll be reminded that failure to quarantine is a violation of state law and it comes with serious penalties,"" he added. Travellers from more than 30 states must quarantine for 14 days after arriving in the city. According to the head of New York City's test and trace service, a fifth of all new local infections are from travellers. Once the city worst affected by coronavirus, New York has reported no coronavirus deaths in three days, Mayor de Blasio said. Could this year's Christmas panto season be cancelled? It's the question many theatres in the UK have been asking. Now the UK's biggest pantomime producer has started cancelling its 2020 shows amid ongoing uncertainty about when theatres will be able to reopen fully. Qdos has put this year's festive shows in Aberdeen, Belfast, Edinburgh and Southampton on hold to 2021. The operator of the King's Theatre in Edinburgh said the move would result in ""the massive loss of Â£2.3m at the worst possible time for the theatres"". Qdos had been planning to stage 34 pantos across the UK this Christmas. Other producers and venueshave already pulled the plugon festive productions in locations including Leicester, Norwich and Welwyn Garden City.  We've already reported that the leader of the opposition in the UK is calling for ""rapid improvements"" to England's test and trace programme. Here are some further comments from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who has said the government is ""running out of time"" to implement any such improvements ahead of schools opening in September. âWe need to get our children back into schools, that has to be the priority, but the government is running out of time,"" he said. ""We've got schools reopening in September, we've got outbreaks of the infection across the country and the government has got basically the month of August to get a grip on this and to get things in place. ""Track, trace and isolate is critical, but it's still not working."" This video can not be played Starmer: Reopening English schools and coronavirus tests Teachers in New York joined a nationwide protest against schools reopening earlier this week Chicago has become the latest major US school district to allow teaching to go fully online for the start of the new academic year, after a backlash from teachers. The city had originally planned to offer a hybrid approach of online and in-person learning, but the teachers' union had threatened to strike over the move. Figures on Tuesday showed 7,545 deaths and almost 185,000 coronavirus cases in the state of Illinois. New York City, the largest school district in the US and previously the epicentre of the US outbreak, is one of the few areas still planning some form of in-person teaching in September, with students attending school for one to three days per week.  There has been a spike in coronavirus cases in Calderdale which has led to a local lockdown An area of northern England currently under a local coronavirus lockdown is launchingits own track and trace system. Calderdale was among parts of West Yorkshire, alongside east Lancashire and Greater Manchester, to havesome lockdown restrictions reimposedlast week. Now Calderdale council is implementing a local track and trace programme, after the area saw a large increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last week, with the R-infection number going above one. It is the second authority to make the move after Blackburn and Darwen said it was setting up a locally-focused system. Council leader Tim Swift said contact tracers would speak to people in person rather than just over the telephone. England's Test and Trace programme, which launched in May, sees people contacted by email, text or phone if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus.  Aritana was transferred to a hospital in Goiania on 22 July A prominent indigenous leader in Brazil has died of complications from Covid-19. Yawalapiti chief Aritana had fought to protect the Amazon and for the rights of indigenous groups. He tested positive for coronavirus around two weeks ago, and was later transferred to intensive care. Indeigenous communities have been badly affected by Brazil's coronavirus outbreak, with the Brazilian Indigenous Peoples' Association reporting that more than 22,000 people have died. Brazil has the second highest number of deaths and infections worldwide, with 96,000 fatalities and 2.8 million infections. The mayor of Luton has stepped down from his role in the UK, after breaking coronavirus guidelines to attend a gathering in a garden. Tahir Malik was forced to apologise last month after he was pictured with two other councillorsat a large outdoor gathering at a house in Luton. In a statement after his resignation, he said: ""Once again I regret my actions which were below the standard of my position and would like to sincerely apologise to the people of Luton for attending this gathering which was in breach of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. ""There is no excuse for what I did â I should have known better and I accept full responsibility for my actions."" A new mayor will be appointed on 29 September. They will serve for the remainder of the municipal year.  This video can not be played Coronvirus: Video shows Luton mayor breaking lockdown rules Spain announced 1,772 new daily cases on Wednesday, in the largest increase since national lockdown measures ended. One death was also recorded, bringing Spain's death toll in the pandemic to 28,499. The number of new infections does not include two regions which have not yet reported their statistics. The news came as Switzerland became the latest European country to announce quarantine measures for travellers arriving from Spain, although its rules do not apply to the Canary and Balearic islands. Spain enforced one of Europe's strictest lockdowns, but has experienced a rise in cases since restrictions were eased in June. Italy's national civil aviation authority has threatened to suspend Ryanair flights in the country after accusing the budget airline of ""repeated violations"" of the country's coronavirus safety measures. ""Not only is the obligation to distance passengers not respected, but the conditions for making an exception to that rule are also being ignored,"" ENAC said in a statement. The body added that it would suspend the airline's activities in Italy's national airports if it failed to comply with the rules. Italy has been one of the countries worst hit by coronavirus, with more than 35,000 deaths. Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate in November's US presidential election, will not accept his nomination in person due to the pandemic. Both Republican and Democratic presidential hopefuls formally become candidates at their respective parties' national convention, where they also announce their running mate. Biden's party said the former vice-president ""will no longer travel to Milwaukee and will instead address the nation and accept the Democratic nomination from his home state of Delaware"", with no speakers physically attending the event, which is due to take place from 17-20 August. Last month President Trump, who is the only remaining Republican nominee,scrapped a Florida convention, blaming the coronavirus ""flare-up"", and announced a scaled-down event in North Carolina. The election will take place on 3 November. Here are our latest charts illustrating the figures on coronavirus in the UK. Crucially, the downward trend in daily deaths continues to slow, and confirmed cases of the virus are rising. The US government has ordered 100 million doses of an experimental coronavirus vaccine. Johnson & Johnson, which is behind the jab, announced the $1bn-deal on Wednesday, noting that the government may purchase a further 200 million doses at a later stage. The vaccine is based on the same technology the company used to create an experimental Ebola vaccine that was used in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year. But Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is not the only candidate being considered by the US government. Last week, Sanofi and FlaxoSmithKline announced a deal to develop and deliver 100 million doses of a vaccine they are developing, with a similar agreement between the government and Pfizer and BioNTech announced in July. âWith the portfolio of vaccines being assembled for Operation Warp Speed, the Trump Administration is increasing the likelihood that the United States will have at least one safe, effective vaccine by 2021,â a US official said. Around 140 vaccines are currently under development worldwide, though only six have the reached final phase of testing.

Schools are set to reopen fully in England in September and new guidancehas been published.,externalThere are separate plans forWales,Northern Irelandand alsoScotland, where schools are scheduled to open their doors next Tuesday. Who will be expected to go back? Nearly all children of legal school age will be expected to return to class full-time in September - mid-August in Scotland - including those with special educational needs and disabilities, and those who have been shielding. Do I have to send my child back? Attendance will be mandatory again from the beginning of the autumn term. But pupils must self-isolate and not attend school if they - or a close contact - develop symptoms or test positive for coronavirus. And how will the school day work? Schools will be asked to minimise the number of contacts each pupil has during the day, by keeping classes or whole year groups apart in separate ""protective bubbles"" rather than practising individual social distancing. They must have strict hand-washing policies, promote the ""catch it, bin it, kill it"" approach for coughing and sneezing, step up cleaning and be ready to assist with contract tracing and testing. Hugh SchofieldBBC News Paris correspondent in Sancerre France's wine industry has been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic The French government is stepping up its financial aid to the countryâs wine sector, which has been badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Speaking at an organic winery near Sancerre, Prime Minister Jean Castex said an extra â¬80m (Â£72m; $95m) would be made available. Among the many sectors clamouring for state aid in France, the wine industry has a significance that is not just economic, but also symbolic: itâs a part of French life that everyone holds dear. But the last months have been testing. First of all, there was a big rise in duty on exports to the US - fallout from a trade row - and then Covid-19, which meant the closure of bars and restaurants. Overall, the sector reckons it has lost â¬1.5bn. The new aid promised by Castex will be used partly to stock surplus wine until the market improves. Here in Sancerre, with its quality wine, thatâs what growers prefer. But Castex said some aid would go towards turning unsold bottles into alcohol for perfumery or hand sanitiser. A further 65 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 46,364, figures show. And another 892 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK in the past 24 hours, the government has announced. This brings the total number of people who have tested positive for the virus in the UK to 307,184. The latest figures are published onthe government's coronavirus dashboard,external- although areview is taking placeinto the way deaths from coronavirus are counted in England. BBC Radio 5 Live Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has told BBC Radio 5 Live that he doesn't think the country could afford another national lockdown. Speaking to Emma Barnett, Mr Blair talked about the importance of reviving the economy, adding: ""Weâre going to do major long-term damage to the rest of our healthcare system if our economy canât get moving again and if people canât get out and about againâ. This video can not be played Mr Blair said he feels âhorrifiedâ by the economic damage stemming from the pandemic. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm New economic figuresshow that Sweden, which opted not to impose a strict lockdown, has been hit less hard by the pandemic than other EU nations. But it still recorded its worst results in decades. The authorities here have always said the country's approach wasn't designed to protect the economy. They stressed that the aim was to introduce sustainable, long-term measures. Even so, the government did hope that keeping more of society open would help limit job losses and mitigate the effect on businesses. The latest figures are a sign of just how vulnerable Sweden is to global economic shifts. Like other Scandinavian nations, it has a small, open, economy that is dependent on international trade. They also suggest that, while more of society remained open than in other parts of Europe, plenty of Swedes still chose to stay away from shops, restaurants and gyms. Recent opinion polls have suggested declining confidence in the minority government's handling of the pandemic. If the economy continues to worsen, there may be sharper national debates about the  decision not to lockdown and the subsequent early high death toll. But given the rapid drop in daily recorded deaths since July, supporters of the controversial strategy are hopeful that the measures will help provide long-term stability. Dr Ryan urged young people to be responsible Young people should re-consider their partying habits to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) expert has said. As lockdowns loosen around the world, some countries are seeing a higher proportion of new coronavirus infections among young people than during the earlier stage of the pandemic. ""Younger people also need to take on board that they have a responsibility,"" Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHOâs health emergencies team,said in a Q&A session on Wednesday,external. ""Ask yourself the question - do I really need to go to that party? Do I really need to be part of that indoor disco or nightclub?â His comments echothose of the WHOâs chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who previously said the choices made by the young can be ""the difference between life and death for someone else"".

TV watching and streaming surge during lockdown,"Comedy series The Good Place can be seen on Netflix, which saw an increase in new subscribers Lockdown measures enforced due to the Covid-19 pandemic brought about a surge in TV watching and online streaming, according to media watchdog Ofcom. Its annual study into UK media habits suggested adults - many stuck indoors - spent 40% of their waking hours in front of a screen, on average. Time spent on subscription streaming services also doubled during April. At the height of lockdown, adults spent an average of six hours and 25 minutes each day staring at screens. Screen time overall was up almost a third (31%) on last year. People watched streaming services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+, for one hour 11 minutes per day, and 12 million people joined a service they hadn't used previously. Three million of these viewers had never subscribed to any service before. The majority signed up to Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, although Disney+ overtook Now TV as the third most popular paid-for streaming platform. Older viewers, who typically watch more traditional broadcast TV, increased their use of streaming platforms, too. One third of 55-64-year-olds, and 15% of people aged 65+ used subscription services in the early weeks of lockdown. The study, entitled Media Nations 2020, suggested that as lockdown measures eased towards the end of June, the uplift in streaming services held firm - 71% up on the same time last year. This figure also included people viewing more non-broadcast content on platforms like YouTube and gaming sites. And more than half of UK adults (55%) with new streaming subscriptions said they will keep them and spend the same amount of time watching streamed content in future. ITV halts Coronation Street, Emmerdale, Lorraine, Loose Women filming Emily Eavis: Glastonbury 2021 will be 'a double celebration' TV in lockdown: How shows are coping without a studio audience EastEnders to return with shorter episodes However in July,Netflix warned investors that subscriber growth will slow, after it it added more than 10 million subscribers in the previous three months, bringing the total of new subscribers to 26 million in 2020. In contrast, Netflix saw 28 million new subscribers for the whole of 2019. This video can not be played Coronation Street filming has resumed following a break during the pandemic ""Growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of coronavirus and social restrictions,"" the company said. As for the public service broadcasters  - BBC, ITV, STV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 - they achieved their highest combined monthly share of broadcast TV viewing (59%) in more than six years in March, as people turned to trusted news services for updates on the virus. The BBC was the most popular source of news and information about Covid-19 - used by 82% of adults during the first week of lockdown. In the age of information overload, our attention is the most precious resource. These days we devote ever more of it to screens. And that was before lockdown. The surge in screen viewing through the pandemic is genuinely extraordinary. It's important to remember that many of the companies or services that have turned us into screen addicts didn't exist a decade ago. Sadly for Britain's commercial broadcasters, all these eyeballs haven't turned into revenue, as advertising is in sharp retreat, for now at least. Before lockdown, the creative industries were growing several times faster than the rest of the economy, albeit powered by US companies. Never mind ""Eat Out to Help Out""; might ""Tune In to Help Out"" be a slogan to boost Britain's path out of recession? Broadcasters' video-on demand services also received a boost in lockdown. Dramas Normal People and Killing Eve helped BBC iPlayer attract a record 570m programme requests in May 2020 - 72% higher than in May 2019. Channel 4's on-demand service, All 4, generated 30% more views among 16-34s in the first two weeks of lockdown compared with the same period in 2019; and viewers spent 82% more time year-on-year watching ITV Hub. However, the boost to PSBs' linear audiences was short-lived as coronavirus interrupted production of soaps including EastEnders, Coronation Street and Emmerdale, as well as major sporting events like the Olympics and entertainment broadcasts such as the Glastonbury Festival. By the end of June and with lockdown easing, the amount of time viewers spent watching traditional broadcast content fell 44 minutes to three hours and two minutes per day.

Why Lebanon is in crisis,"Lebanon is in the throes of its worst crisis for many years The Lebanese government has resigned amid growing public anger following a devastating explosion in Beirut on 4 August that killed at least 200 people and injured about 5,000 others. The blast came at a difficult time for Lebanon, which is not only trying to curb the spread of the coronavirus but is also mired in an unprecedented economic crisis. The economic situation has pushed tens of thousands people into poverty and triggered large anti-government protests. Announcing the move on Monday, outgoing Prime Minister Hassan Diab said his government was taking ""a step back... to stand with the people, in order to wage the battle of change with them"". Discontent in Lebanon has been brewing for years. In late 2019, a plan to tax Whatsapp calls spilled over into mass protests against economic turmoil and corruption, which eventually led to the then government's resignation. Coronavirus had curbed the protests, but the financial situation continued to worsen and last week's deadly explosion was seen by many as the deadly result of years of corruption and mismanagement. People have taken to the streets again, and there have been clashes between protesters and police. The government's plans to investigate the cause of the explosion were not enough for most people, who have lost all faith in the political elite. Before the cabinet's resignation, a number of ministers had offered to step down. But the end of this government does not necessarily mean an end to the anger. Last year's protests led to the formation of the government which has now been forced to step down over the same accusations of corruption. In his strongly worded speech on Monday, Mr Diab blamed ""a system of corruption... deeply-rooted in all the functions of the state"". ""One of the many examples of corruption exploded in the port of Beirut, and the calamity befell Lebanon,"" he said. ""But corruption cases are widespread in the country's political and administrative landscape; other calamities hiding in many minds and warehouses, and which pose a great threat, are protected by the class that controls the fate of the country."" Even before the coronavirus pandemic at the start of this year, Lebanon seemed to be headed for a crash. Its public debt-to-gross domestic product (what a country owes compared to what it produces) was the third highest in the world; unemployment stood at 25%; and nearly a third of the population was living below the poverty line. The Lebanese pound has lost about 80% of its value over the past 10 months Late last year also saw the unravelling ofwhat analysts said was effectively a state-sponsored pyramid, or Ponzi, scheme,externalrun by the central bank, which was borrowing from commercial banks at above-market interest rates to pay back its debts and maintain the Lebanese pound's fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. At the same time, people were getting increasingly angry and frustrated about the government's failure to provide even basic services. They were having to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water, limited public healthcare, and some of the world's worst internet connections. 'Now there is nothing' - Lebanon pushed to brink How did Lebanon get into such a deep crisis? How Lebanon became the third most indebted nation Many blamed the ruling elite who have dominated politics for years and amassed their own wealth while failing to carry out the sweeping reforms necessary to solve the country's problems. At the start of October 2019, a shortage of foreign currency led to the Lebanese pound losing value against the dollar on a newly emerged black market for the first time in two decades. When importers of wheat and fuel demanded to be paid in dollars, unions called strikes. Then, unprecedented wildfires in the country's western mountains highlighted how underfunded and underequipped the fire service was. Saad Hariri resigned as prime minister in response to the protests In mid-October, the government proposed new taxes on tobacco, petrol, andvoice calls via messaging services such as WhatsAppto drum up more revenue, but a backlash forced it to cancel the plans. However, the debacle unleashed a surge of discontent that had been simmering in Lebanon for years. Tens of thousands of Lebanese took to the streets, leading to the resignation of Western-backed Prime Minister Saad Hariri and his unity government. The protests have cut across sectarian lines and involved people from all sections of society Protests cut across sectarian lines - a rare phenomenon since the country's devastating 1975-1989 civil war ended - and brought the country to a virtual standstill. Newly appointed Prime Minister Hassan Diab subsequently announced that Lebanon would default on its foreign debt for the first time in its history, saying its foreign currency reserves had hit a ""critical and dangerous"" level and that those remaining were needed to pay for vital imports. In the wake of the first Covid-19 deaths and a surge in infections, a lockdown was imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of the disease. On the one hand, it forced anti-government protesters off the streets, but on the other, it made the economic crisis much worse and exposed the inadequacies of Lebanon's social welfare system. The prime minister has warned that Lebanon is at ""risk of a major food crisis"" Many business were forced to lay off staff or put them on furlough without pay; the gap between the Lebanese pound's value on the official and black-market exchange rates widened; and banks tightened capital controls. As prices rose further, many families were unable to buy even basic necessities. Growing economic hardship triggered fresh unrest. In Aprila young man was shot dead by soldiers during a violent protest in Tripoliand several banks were set ablaze. The government, meanwhile, finally approved a recovery plan that it hoped would end the economic crisis and win support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout package worth $10bn. Banks have been attacked and set on fire by protesters By the time the coronavirus restrictions began to be lifted in May, the prices of some foodstuffs had doubled and Mr Diab warned that Lebanon was at risk of a ""major food crisis"". ""Many Lebanese have already stopped buying meat, fruits and vegetables, and may soon find it difficult to afford even bread,"" he wrote in the Washington Post. Most analysts point to one key factor: political sectarianism, or groups looking after their own interests. Lebanon officially recognises 18 religious communities - four Muslim, 12 Christian, the Druze sect and Judaism. The three main political offices - president, speaker of parliament and prime minister - are divided among the three biggest communities (Maronite Christian; Shia Muslim; and Sunni Muslim, respectively) under an agreement dating back to 1943. Parliament's 128 seats are also divided evenly between Christians and Muslims (including Druze). The seats in parliament are divided between religious communities It is this religious diversity that makes the country an easy target for interference by external powers, as seen with Iran's backing of the Shia Hezbollah movement, widely seen as the most powerful military and political group in Lebanon Since the end of the civil war, political leaders from each sect have maintained their power and influence through a system of patronage networks - protecting the interests of the religious communities they represent, and offering - both legal and illegal - financial incentives. Lebanon ranked 137th out of 180 countries,external(180 being the worst) on Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index. The watchdog says corruption ""permeates all levels of society"" in Lebanon, with political parties, parliament and the police perceived as ""the most corrupt institutions of the country"". It says it is the very system of sectarian power-sharing which is fuelling these patronage networks and hindering Lebanon's system of governance.

Neil Young sues Trump campaign for using his songs,"Neil Young is suing Donald Trump's re-election campaign for repeatedly using his music without his permission. The rock star says the US president breached copyright laws by playing his songs at political rallies and events. The Canadian has objected to the use of Rockin' in the Free World and Devil's Sidewalk for what he called an ""un-American campaign of ignorance and hate"". The Trump campaign has not yet commented. Young said he had complained about Mr Trump's use of his music since 2015, but had been ""wilfully"" ignored. The singer, who is now officially a US citizen after having lived in the country for decades, is seeking damages of up to $150,000 (Â£114,400) per infringement. These include at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, and the US president's visit to Mount Rushmore in July. ""This complaint is not intended to disrespect the rights and opinions of American citizens, who are free to support the candidate of their choosing,"" Young's lawyers wrote in the filing, which wasposted on the performer's website.,external ""However, Plaintiff in good conscience cannot allow his music to be used as a 'theme song' for a divisive, un-American campaign of ignorance and hate."" The 74-year-old has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice - first as a solo artist, and then with his old band Buffalo Springfield. He's not the only musician angry with the US president for having used their material. Rolling Stones warn Trump not to use their songs Neil Young US citizenship 'delayed over marijuana' Bob Dylan and Neil Young share Hyde Park stage Last month, The Rolling Stones warned President Trump that he could face legal action if he continued using their songs at his campaign rallies. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards also joined artists including Aerosmith and Sir Elton John in recently signing an open letter calling on politicians to obtain permission before playing their music at campaign and political events. According to music rights organization BMI, regular music licences issued to concert halls and other venues do not cover political rallies. Political candidates must obtain a separate Political Entities Licence, which gives them access to 15 million songs. The Trump campaign does have such a licence. But artists have the right to take their music off the list. The Rolling Stones have done so, although Young has not explicitly said whether he also has.

Swinney denies deprived pupils were penalisedSome pupils say they got lower grades because their schools have not performed as well as others in the past.,"Mr Swinney met pupils who were receiving their results at Stonlelaw High School in Rutherglen on Tuesday Scotland's education secretary has rejected claims that bright pupils from deprived areas were unfairly penalised by the country's exam system. Thousands of pupils received worse results than they were expecting on Tuesday after the country's exam body lowered about 125,000 estimated grades. Some pupils believe they were penalised because their schools have historically not performed as well. But John Swinney insisted that the data ""does not bear this out"". Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Swinney said it was always accepted that there would be ""questions"" about the grading system that was introduced when exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of Scots pupils have exam grades lowered 'Medical dream in tatters because of where I live' How grades were worked out for Scottish pupils But he said the pass rate for pupils in the most deprived areas was higher this year than it was last year, while the attainment gap between the wealthiest and poorest pupils had narrowed. The education secretary added: ""What I would accept is that there will be individual results which will cause disappointment. ""That is why the final stage of the process that was put in place by the Scottish Qualifications Authority is a free appeals process which enables young people, in consultation with their schools, to come forward with evidence which would challenge some of the judgements that have been made. ""I would encourage any young person who feels disappointed by their results, and that they should have had a better result, to use that service"". Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended Olivia Biggart, from Motherwell, achieved five As in her Higher prelims at the start of the year, and was predicted by her teachers to be awarded the same when her results arrived on Tuesday morning. But despite having spent the summer studying for the University Clinical Aptitude Test (Ucat), she was awarded two As and three Bs. Olivia, 16, and her family believe she was downgraded because of where she lives. Her father, David Biggart, said: ""It is a small school and in a poorer catchment area. ""Olivia got seven As in her Nat 5 exams. She was in fifth year doing maths, English, chemistry, physics and PE. The school predicted five As and that is what they submitted to the SQA. ""We had increased our expectations based on Olivia's prelims, researching medical schools. ""Olivia has been studying all summer for the Ucat medical test to study medicine at university, but all her dreams are now in tatters as a result of the SQA and their treatment of poorer schools and high achieving pupils at those schools. ""I am absolutely livid at the SQA."" Read the full story here School exams in Scotland were cancelled for the first time ever, with the grades of pupils worked out using estimates made by their teachers based on their performance over the school year. However, these estimates were then moderated by the SQA exams body - which led to about 125,000 results being downgraded. The SQA said its aim was to ""ensure consistency across schools and colleges, and with results from previous years"". As part of the process, the SQA looked at each school's previous history of estimating results and attainment. It developed a maximum and minimum pass rate for each course at every school based on the four-year average, but said it had built in flexibility to account for year on year changes. One of Scotland's leading education experts, Prof Lindsay Paterson of the University of Edinburgh, says this means that ""each school's attainment is constrained to look more or less the same as it has been in recent years"". Prof Patersontold the Scotsman newspaper,externalthat this was unfair because it could mean ""an outstanding student in an average school will be likely to have had their grades pulled down"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the moderation process ensured the credibility of the system by preventing this year's results being vastly better than previous years. Ms Sturgeon added: ""I would love to be in the position of standing here credibly saying that 85% of the 20% in the most deprived areas had passed Higher. ""But given that it was 65% last year, that would raise a real credibility issue."" And Mr Swinney said he believed that teachers were often ""optimistic and aspirational"" about their pupils' abilities, while an exam system ""does something different"". About 138,000 Scottish pupils were given their National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher results He said: ""What the exam system has to assess is the attainment of young people against the standards which we have asked the SQA to maintain at all times. ""The crucial point about the maintenance of standards is that it would not serve young people in 2020 in any way satisfactorily if there was to be any doubt about the validity and the credibility of the qualifications that they have achieved. ""I am satisfied, based on the recommendation and the advice of the chief examiner, that the standards of Scotland's exam system have been maintained and the young people of 2020 should be proud of the qualifications that they have achieved.""

Olivia Biggart got A grades in her prelims but her final results did not reflect what teachers recommended Olivia Biggart, from Motherwell, achieved five As in her Higher prelims at the start of the year, and was predicted by her teachers to be awarded the same when her results arrived on Tuesday morning. But despite having spent the summer studying for the University Clinical Aptitude Test (Ucat), she was awarded two As and three Bs. Olivia, 16, and her family believe she was downgraded because of where she lives. Her father, David Biggart, said: ""It is a small school and in a poorer catchment area. ""Olivia got seven As in her Nat 5 exams. She was in fifth year doing maths, English, chemistry, physics and PE. The school predicted five As and that is what they submitted to the SQA. ""We had increased our expectations based on Olivia's prelims, researching medical schools. ""Olivia has been studying all summer for the Ucat medical test to study medicine at university, but all her dreams are now in tatters as a result of the SQA and their treatment of poorer schools and high achieving pupils at those schools. ""I am absolutely livid at the SQA."" Read the full story here School exams in Scotland were cancelled for the first time ever, with the grades of pupils worked out using estimates made by their teachers based on their performance over the school year. However, these estimates were then moderated by the SQA exams body - which led to about 125,000 results being downgraded. The SQA said its aim was to ""ensure consistency across schools and colleges, and with results from previous years"". As part of the process, the SQA looked at each school's previous history of estimating results and attainment. It developed a maximum and minimum pass rate for each course at every school based on the four-year average, but said it had built in flexibility to account for year on year changes. One of Scotland's leading education experts, Prof Lindsay Paterson of the University of Edinburgh, says this means that ""each school's attainment is constrained to look more or less the same as it has been in recent years"". Prof Patersontold the Scotsman newspaper,externalthat this was unfair because it could mean ""an outstanding student in an average school will be likely to have had their grades pulled down"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the moderation process ensured the credibility of the system by preventing this year's results being vastly better than previous years. Ms Sturgeon added: ""I would love to be in the position of standing here credibly saying that 85% of the 20% in the most deprived areas had passed Higher. ""But given that it was 65% last year, that would raise a real credibility issue."" And Mr Swinney said he believed that teachers were often ""optimistic and aspirational"" about their pupils' abilities, while an exam system ""does something different"". About 138,000 Scottish pupils were given their National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher results He said: ""What the exam system has to assess is the attainment of young people against the standards which we have asked the SQA to maintain at all times. ""The crucial point about the maintenance of standards is that it would not serve young people in 2020 in any way satisfactorily if there was to be any doubt about the validity and the credibility of the qualifications that they have achieved. ""I am satisfied, based on the recommendation and the advice of the chief examiner, that the standards of Scotland's exam system have been maintained and the young people of 2020 should be proud of the qualifications that they have achieved."" Chris McEleny, a senior SNP councillor in Inverclyde,has claimed,externalthat the moderation system meant that ""a kid not attaining as well in a more affluent school gets lifted, a bright kid in a school in a more deprived area gets shafted"". And opposition parties have highlighted SQA figures which showed that Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds wasreduced by 15.2 percentage points,external, compared to only 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. Mr Swinney said that the focus should be on ""closing the poverty-related attainment gap"" and tackling social disadvantage. He added: ""That is what drives the difficulties and the differentials in examination performance. ""And that is what the government has devoted the last four years of its work to achieve, in closing the poverty related gap through the Scottish attainment challenge and the many measures we have taken in that respect."" As in the rest of the UK, the grades of pupils who were unable to sit exams have been worked out using estimates made by their teachers based on their performance over the school year. Teachers were asked to place students within bands for each subject, and rank their pupils in order. These assessments were then checked by the SQA, which said grades had been moderated ""where appropriate"" to ""maintain national standards"". The SQA said it had sought to ""uphold the integrity and credibility"" of the system in its moderation, but that its efforts had been focused on ""ensuring fairness for all learners"". The exams body also said it would look at each school's previous history of estimating results and attainment, but denied that a school's previous record could put pupils at either an advantage or a disadvantage.

LiveLiveUK 'underestimated virus threat from Europe'11 minutes ago,"Global deaths passes 700,000; more than 11 million people have recovered from the virus Outbreaks in the US, Brazil, India are behind a significant proportion of the daily worldwide toll The spread of coronavirus in the UK could have been slowed with earlier quarantine restrictions on arrivals, MPs say Lockdown restrictions are being reimposed in Aberdeen, Scotland, due to a coronavirus cluster in the city Spain announces 1,772 new daily cases - the largest increase since national lockdown measures ended Sweden - which controversially did not impose a strict lockdown - sees its economy shrink but less than in other EU nations Virgin Atlantic becomes latest airline industry casualty as it files for bankruptcy in the US Edited by Lauren Turner, Victoria Bisset and Ella Wills We're wrapping up our live coverage of the biggest coronavirus stories across the world and will be back again on Thursday morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Hazel Shearing, Joshua Nevett, Ella Wills and Victoria Bisset, and edited by Kevin Ponniah and Lauren Turner. As global deaths pass 700,000, here's a reminder of Wednesday's biggest coronavirus stories: New York City plans to introduce quarantine checkpoints at key entrances to the city to screen travellers arriving from parts of the US with rising numbers of coronavirus cases. âTravellers coming in from those states will be given information about the quarantine, they will be reminded that it is required, not optional,â the city's mayor Bill de Blasio explained at a news conference on Wednesday. âTheyâll be reminded that failure to quarantine is a violation of state law and it comes with serious penalties,"" he added. Travellers from more than 30 states must quarantine for 14 days after arriving in the city. According to the head of New York City's test and trace service, a fifth of all new local infections are from travellers. Once the city worst affected by coronavirus, New York has reported no coronavirus deaths in three days, Mayor de Blasio said. Could this year's Christmas panto season be cancelled? It's the question many theatres in the UK have been asking. Now the UK's biggest pantomime producer has started cancelling its 2020 shows amid ongoing uncertainty about when theatres will be able to reopen fully. Qdos has put this year's festive shows in Aberdeen, Belfast, Edinburgh and Southampton on hold to 2021. The operator of the King's Theatre in Edinburgh said the move would result in ""the massive loss of Â£2.3m at the worst possible time for the theatres"". Qdos had been planning to stage 34 pantos across the UK this Christmas. Other producers and venueshave already pulled the plugon festive productions in locations including Leicester, Norwich and Welwyn Garden City.  We've already reported that the leader of the opposition in the UK is calling for ""rapid improvements"" to England's test and trace programme. Here are some further comments from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who has said the government is ""running out of time"" to implement any such improvements ahead of schools opening in September. âWe need to get our children back into schools, that has to be the priority, but the government is running out of time,"" he said. ""We've got schools reopening in September, we've got outbreaks of the infection across the country and the government has got basically the month of August to get a grip on this and to get things in place. ""Track, trace and isolate is critical, but it's still not working."" This video can not be played Starmer: Reopening English schools and coronavirus tests Teachers in New York joined a nationwide protest against schools reopening earlier this week Chicago has become the latest major US school district to allow teaching to go fully online for the start of the new academic year, after a backlash from teachers. The city had originally planned to offer a hybrid approach of online and in-person learning, but the teachers' union had threatened to strike over the move. Figures on Tuesday showed 7,545 deaths and almost 185,000 coronavirus cases in the state of Illinois. New York City, the largest school district in the US and previously the epicentre of the US outbreak, is one of the few areas still planning some form of in-person teaching in September, with students attending school for one to three days per week.  There has been a spike in coronavirus cases in Calderdale which has led to a local lockdown An area of northern England currently under a local coronavirus lockdown is launchingits own track and trace system. Calderdale was among parts of West Yorkshire, alongside east Lancashire and Greater Manchester, to havesome lockdown restrictions reimposedlast week. Now Calderdale council is implementing a local track and trace programme, after the area saw a large increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last week, with the R-infection number going above one. It is the second authority to make the move after Blackburn and Darwen said it was setting up a locally-focused system. Council leader Tim Swift said contact tracers would speak to people in person rather than just over the telephone. England's Test and Trace programme, which launched in May, sees people contacted by email, text or phone if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus.  Aritana was transferred to a hospital in Goiania on 22 July A prominent indigenous leader in Brazil has died of complications from Covid-19. Yawalapiti chief Aritana had fought to protect the Amazon and for the rights of indigenous groups. He tested positive for coronavirus around two weeks ago, and was later transferred to intensive care. Indeigenous communities have been badly affected by Brazil's coronavirus outbreak, with the Brazilian Indigenous Peoples' Association reporting that more than 22,000 people have died. Brazil has the second highest number of deaths and infections worldwide, with 96,000 fatalities and 2.8 million infections. The mayor of Luton has stepped down from his role in the UK, after breaking coronavirus guidelines to attend a gathering in a garden. Tahir Malik was forced to apologise last month after he was pictured with two other councillorsat a large outdoor gathering at a house in Luton. In a statement after his resignation, he said: ""Once again I regret my actions which were below the standard of my position and would like to sincerely apologise to the people of Luton for attending this gathering which was in breach of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. ""There is no excuse for what I did â I should have known better and I accept full responsibility for my actions."" A new mayor will be appointed on 29 September. They will serve for the remainder of the municipal year.  This video can not be played Coronvirus: Video shows Luton mayor breaking lockdown rules Spain announced 1,772 new daily cases on Wednesday, in the largest increase since national lockdown measures ended. One death was also recorded, bringing Spain's death toll in the pandemic to 28,499. The number of new infections does not include two regions which have not yet reported their statistics. The news came as Switzerland became the latest European country to announce quarantine measures for travellers arriving from Spain, although its rules do not apply to the Canary and Balearic islands. Spain enforced one of Europe's strictest lockdowns, but has experienced a rise in cases since restrictions were eased in June. Italy's national civil aviation authority has threatened to suspend Ryanair flights in the country after accusing the budget airline of ""repeated violations"" of the country's coronavirus safety measures. ""Not only is the obligation to distance passengers not respected, but the conditions for making an exception to that rule are also being ignored,"" ENAC said in a statement. The body added that it would suspend the airline's activities in Italy's national airports if it failed to comply with the rules. Italy has been one of the countries worst hit by coronavirus, with more than 35,000 deaths. Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate in November's US presidential election, will not accept his nomination in person due to the pandemic. Both Republican and Democratic presidential hopefuls formally become candidates at their respective parties' national convention, where they also announce their running mate. Biden's party said the former vice-president ""will no longer travel to Milwaukee and will instead address the nation and accept the Democratic nomination from his home state of Delaware"", with no speakers physically attending the event, which is due to take place from 17-20 August. Last month President Trump, who is the only remaining Republican nominee,scrapped a Florida convention, blaming the coronavirus ""flare-up"", and announced a scaled-down event in North Carolina. The election will take place on 3 November. Here are our latest charts illustrating the figures on coronavirus in the UK. Crucially, the downward trend in daily deaths continues to slow, and confirmed cases of the virus are rising. The US government has ordered 100 million doses of an experimental coronavirus vaccine. Johnson & Johnson, which is behind the jab, announced the $1bn-deal on Wednesday, noting that the government may purchase a further 200 million doses at a later stage. The vaccine is based on the same technology the company used to create an experimental Ebola vaccine that was used in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year. But Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is not the only candidate being considered by the US government. Last week, Sanofi and FlaxoSmithKline announced a deal to develop and deliver 100 million doses of a vaccine they are developing, with a similar agreement between the government and Pfizer and BioNTech announced in July. âWith the portfolio of vaccines being assembled for Operation Warp Speed, the Trump Administration is increasing the likelihood that the United States will have at least one safe, effective vaccine by 2021,â a US official said. Around 140 vaccines are currently under development worldwide, though only six have the reached final phase of testing.

Schools are set to reopen fully in England in September and new guidancehas been published.,externalThere are separate plans forWales,Northern Irelandand alsoScotland, where schools are scheduled to open their doors next Tuesday. Who will be expected to go back? Nearly all children of legal school age will be expected to return to class full-time in September - mid-August in Scotland - including those with special educational needs and disabilities, and those who have been shielding. Do I have to send my child back? Attendance will be mandatory again from the beginning of the autumn term. But pupils must self-isolate and not attend school if they - or a close contact - develop symptoms or test positive for coronavirus. And how will the school day work? Schools will be asked to minimise the number of contacts each pupil has during the day, by keeping classes or whole year groups apart in separate ""protective bubbles"" rather than practising individual social distancing. They must have strict hand-washing policies, promote the ""catch it, bin it, kill it"" approach for coughing and sneezing, step up cleaning and be ready to assist with contract tracing and testing. Hugh SchofieldBBC News Paris correspondent in Sancerre France's wine industry has been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic The French government is stepping up its financial aid to the countryâs wine sector, which has been badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Speaking at an organic winery near Sancerre, Prime Minister Jean Castex said an extra â¬80m (Â£72m; $95m) would be made available. Among the many sectors clamouring for state aid in France, the wine industry has a significance that is not just economic, but also symbolic: itâs a part of French life that everyone holds dear. But the last months have been testing. First of all, there was a big rise in duty on exports to the US - fallout from a trade row - and then Covid-19, which meant the closure of bars and restaurants. Overall, the sector reckons it has lost â¬1.5bn. The new aid promised by Castex will be used partly to stock surplus wine until the market improves. Here in Sancerre, with its quality wine, thatâs what growers prefer. But Castex said some aid would go towards turning unsold bottles into alcohol for perfumery or hand sanitiser. A further 65 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to 46,364, figures show. And another 892 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK in the past 24 hours, the government has announced. This brings the total number of people who have tested positive for the virus in the UK to 307,184. The latest figures are published onthe government's coronavirus dashboard,external- although areview is taking placeinto the way deaths from coronavirus are counted in England. BBC Radio 5 Live Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has told BBC Radio 5 Live that he doesn't think the country could afford another national lockdown. Speaking to Emma Barnett, Mr Blair talked about the importance of reviving the economy, adding: ""Weâre going to do major long-term damage to the rest of our healthcare system if our economy canât get moving again and if people canât get out and about againâ. This video can not be played Mr Blair said he feels âhorrifiedâ by the economic damage stemming from the pandemic. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm New economic figuresshow that Sweden, which opted not to impose a strict lockdown, has been hit less hard by the pandemic than other EU nations. But it still recorded its worst results in decades. The authorities here have always said the country's approach wasn't designed to protect the economy. They stressed that the aim was to introduce sustainable, long-term measures. Even so, the government did hope that keeping more of society open would help limit job losses and mitigate the effect on businesses. The latest figures are a sign of just how vulnerable Sweden is to global economic shifts. Like other Scandinavian nations, it has a small, open, economy that is dependent on international trade. They also suggest that, while more of society remained open than in other parts of Europe, plenty of Swedes still chose to stay away from shops, restaurants and gyms. Recent opinion polls have suggested declining confidence in the minority government's handling of the pandemic. If the economy continues to worsen, there may be sharper national debates about the  decision not to lockdown and the subsequent early high death toll. But given the rapid drop in daily recorded deaths since July, supporters of the controversial strategy are hopeful that the measures will help provide long-term stability. Dr Ryan urged young people to be responsible Young people should re-consider their partying habits to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) expert has said. As lockdowns loosen around the world, some countries are seeing a higher proportion of new coronavirus infections among young people than during the earlier stage of the pandemic. ""Younger people also need to take on board that they have a responsibility,"" Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHOâs health emergencies team,said in a Q&A session on Wednesday,external. ""Ask yourself the question - do I really need to go to that party? Do I really need to be part of that indoor disco or nightclub?â His comments echothose of the WHOâs chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who previously said the choices made by the young can be ""the difference between life and death for someone else"".

"TV watching and streaming surge during lockdownUK adults spent double the usual amount of time watching small screens, research shows.Entertainment & Arts","Comedy series The Good Place can be seen on Netflix, which saw an increase in new subscribers Lockdown measures enforced due to the Covid-19 pandemic brought about a surge in TV watching and online streaming, according to media watchdog Ofcom. Its annual study into UK media habits suggested adults - many stuck indoors - spent 40% of their waking hours in front of a screen, on average. Time spent on subscription streaming services also doubled during April. At the height of lockdown, adults spent an average of six hours and 25 minutes each day staring at screens. Screen time overall was up almost a third (31%) on last year. People watched streaming services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+, for one hour 11 minutes per day, and 12 million people joined a service they hadn't used previously. Three million of these viewers had never subscribed to any service before. The majority signed up to Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, although Disney+ overtook Now TV as the third most popular paid-for streaming platform. Older viewers, who typically watch more traditional broadcast TV, increased their use of streaming platforms, too. One third of 55-64-year-olds, and 15% of people aged 65+ used subscription services in the early weeks of lockdown. The study, entitled Media Nations 2020, suggested that as lockdown measures eased towards the end of June, the uplift in streaming services held firm - 71% up on the same time last year. This figure also included people viewing more non-broadcast content on platforms like YouTube and gaming sites. And more than half of UK adults (55%) with new streaming subscriptions said they will keep them and spend the same amount of time watching streamed content in future. ITV halts Coronation Street, Emmerdale, Lorraine, Loose Women filming Emily Eavis: Glastonbury 2021 will be 'a double celebration' TV in lockdown: How shows are coping without a studio audience EastEnders to return with shorter episodes However in July,Netflix warned investors that subscriber growth will slow, after it it added more than 10 million subscribers in the previous three months, bringing the total of new subscribers to 26 million in 2020. In contrast, Netflix saw 28 million new subscribers for the whole of 2019. This video can not be played Coronation Street filming has resumed following a break during the pandemic ""Growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of coronavirus and social restrictions,"" the company said. As for the public service broadcasters  - BBC, ITV, STV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 - they achieved their highest combined monthly share of broadcast TV viewing (59%) in more than six years in March, as people turned to trusted news services for updates on the virus. The BBC was the most popular source of news and information about Covid-19 - used by 82% of adults during the first week of lockdown. In the age of information overload, our attention is the most precious resource. These days we devote ever more of it to screens. And that was before lockdown. The surge in screen viewing through the pandemic is genuinely extraordinary. It's important to remember that many of the companies or services that have turned us into screen addicts didn't exist a decade ago. Sadly for Britain's commercial broadcasters, all these eyeballs haven't turned into revenue, as advertising is in sharp retreat, for now at least. Before lockdown, the creative industries were growing several times faster than the rest of the economy, albeit powered by US companies. Never mind ""Eat Out to Help Out""; might ""Tune In to Help Out"" be a slogan to boost Britain's path out of recession? Broadcasters' video-on demand services also received a boost in lockdown. Dramas Normal People and Killing Eve helped BBC iPlayer attract a record 570m programme requests in May 2020 - 72% higher than in May 2019. Channel 4's on-demand service, All 4, generated 30% more views among 16-34s in the first two weeks of lockdown compared with the same period in 2019; and viewers spent 82% more time year-on-year watching ITV Hub. However, the boost to PSBs' linear audiences was short-lived as coronavirus interrupted production of soaps including EastEnders, Coronation Street and Emmerdale, as well as major sporting events like the Olympics and entertainment broadcasts such as the Glastonbury Festival. By the end of June and with lockdown easing, the amount of time viewers spent watching traditional broadcast content fell 44 minutes to three hours and two minutes per day. Broadcast TV viewing is now comparably lower than it was in 2014-2017, although it remains 11% higher than this time last year. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

NHS gets Â£800m to prepare for virus second wave,"Wales came within days of running out of PPE at one stage in the pandemic An Â£800m fund to prepare the Welsh NHS for a possible second coronavirus wave has been announced by ministers. A large portion of the money will be used to boost supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). The cash will also be used to retain some field hospitals and Â£11.7m will go to fundWales' biggest flu campaign. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said she was confident the announcement would give the NHS the ""stability it needs"" to respond to the pandemic. The Conservatives said the money was needed to ""increase access to vital health provision which has been closed or greatly reduced since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak"". Plaid Cymru warned that ""good management"" was needed as well as money. Between 9 March and 26 July 2020 66.6msurgical masks 45.6maprons 2.1mface visors 119.4mgloves 180,894hand sanitisers 1.12mgowns The Welsh Government said access would continue to expand and it had now provided more than Â£1.3bn of Covid-19 support to NHS organisations. ""We understand the growing financial pressures and challenges being faced across the public sector and we are doing all we can to alleviate these,"" Ms Evans said, announcing what ministers are calling an NHS ""stabilisation package"". ""We are also continuing to work with local authorities to understand the considerable pressures they are facing and their priorities so that we can provide them with further support."" How has the first coronavirus wave looked across Wales? What do the stats tell us? People told to phone ahead before going to A&E Welsh Tory health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said that without the UK Conservative government's ""historic funding packages today's announcement would not have been possible"". ""This money needs to increase access to vital health provision which has been closed or greatly reduced since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak,"" he said. ""As we have seen with the number of cancer deaths it is vital that these pathways to treatment are reopened as soon as possible to prevent as few premature deaths as possible."" Rhun ap Iorweth, Plaid's health spokesman, said dealing effectively with a second wave would require ""good management"" from the Welsh Government and health boards so routine care could continue. Rebecca Evans says she believes the NHS will have the money to cope with a difficult winter An Â£800m ""stabilisation"" package is a lot of cash, but much of it has come as a result of spending decisions already made in England. For example, we already knew the Welsh Government was due to get Â£675m as a result of UK government spending to build up stocks of PPE. A significant amount of the Â£800m will be spent doing the same in Wales, along with preparing for winter. In April Wales' health minister admittedthe Welsh NHS had come ""within days"" of running out of specific items. But nobody doubts NHS Wales will face immense challenges dealing with what is likely to be its most difficult winter. Not only will it have to gear up for the potential threat of a second coronavirus wave but also the prospect that the usual winter illnesses like flu might be circulating at the same time - and those on their own in a ""normal"" winter can stretch capacity and resources to the limit. The NHS will also have to try to juggle the extra pressures with the growing need to make inroads into waiting lists which have been growing following the postponement of many procedures and operations during the coronavirus first wave.

William Hill to close 119 betting shops,"William Hill says 119 of its High Street betting shops will not re-open after the shutdown forced by the coronavirus outbreak. The company, which has 1,500 UK outlets, said it did not expect customers to return in the numbers seen before the Covid-19 pandemic. It said about 300 staff were affected, and most had been redeployed elsewhere. Trading has recovered well post-lockdown, William Hill said, and it is repaying Â£24.5m of UK furlough funds. Its comments came as it reported pre-tax profits of Â£141m for the first six months of 2020, compared with a loss of Â£63m last year. Its revenues, however, fell by a third to Â£554m, reflecting the impact of the lockdown, and the fact that with so many sporting events cancelled, there were fewer events to take a punt on. William Hill punters bet on table tennis in sports lull William Hill employs 12,000 people in 10 countries, with 7,000 in the UK. In a statement it said: ""We anticipate that longer term retail footfall will not return to pre-COVID levels and 119 [UK] shops will remain closed following early lease breaks, with the majority of colleagues redeployed within the estate."" Fewer than 20 people will not be redeployed. The company said trading had been strong before the pandemic. When the lockdown came in, it said it had controlled costs ""effectively"" and was now recovering well. Its presence on the High Street and town centres was already receding. Last year, it said it was cutting 700 shops after new regulations dramatically cut the size of a stake in fixed-odds betting terminals - gaming machines situated in shops - from Â£100 to Â£2. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: ""A spike in bored consumers turning to online gaming provided some respite and much-needed revenue, offering a new market for the company to target. ""But the business will need to continue developing its technology platform and product offering if it is to regain some of the lost revenue from the past few months in what is a competitive market."" William Hill plans to expand further in the US, where new opportunities are arising as the country's previously strict gambling rules are relaxed in some states. It said its international online business grew by 17%, and added that it now had almost a third of all US sports betting. Chief executive Ulrik Bengtsson said: ""I am delighted with William Hill's performance in these extraordinary times. Our team has been remarkable, supporting each other and our customers throughout the pandemic, and I would like to thank them for their continuing efforts. ""The furlough scheme provided welcome and timely support, and meant we could protect the jobs of our 7,000 UK retail colleagues. Therefore, given the strength of our recovery post-lockdown, we have decided to repay the furlough funds.""

"Gold price rises above $2,000 for first time","Gold has topped $2,000 (Â£1,527) an ounce for the first time as traders look for havens amid the pandemic. Investors have moved cash into the precious metal as Covid-19 cases rise in the US and more money is pumped into the global economy. The record high gold price has also been driven by concerns over tensions between Washington and Beijing. Prices of other precious metals, including silver, have also risen sharply since the start of this year. The price of gold has increased by more than 30% this year as coronavirus cases continue to rise in America, causing dozens of states to halt or reverse their plans to reopen. The rapid rise in cases, which has dented hopes of a swift US economic recovery, has also helped to drive up the price of silver by around a third this year. Gold rush as pandemic roils India economy Gold hits record high as investor jitters spread More precious than gold: Why palladium is soaring Among the reasons for those rises is investors preparing themselves for a possible pick-up in inflation due to the impact of trillions of dollars of stimulus from governments and central banks around the world. In Washington, Trump administration negotiators have said that they will work ""around the clock"" with Democrats as they attempt to strike a deal on more economic relief measures by the end of the week. According to Bank of America, governments around the world have already announced approximately $20tn worth of stimulus to combat the economic impact of the pandemic. This video can not be played The BBCâs Frank Gardner has been given access to the Bank of Englandâs gold vaults Some investors see the fallout from the Covid-19 crisis, along with ongoing tensions between the US and China, continuing to push up the price of gold. Market strategist Margaret Yang says she sees potential for bullion to continue rising in the coming weeks and months: ""The mid-to-long-term prospect of gold and other precious metals remains bullish against the backdrop of low interest rate environment and fiscal and monetary stimulus."" Peter McGuire from XM.com said he sees gold reaching ""$2,200 by Christmas"" with silver, platinum and palladium also set to see strong gains.

Neil Young sues Donald Trump for using his songs,"Neil Young is suing Donald Trump's re-election campaign for repeatedly using his music without his permission. The rock star says the US president breached copyright laws by playing his songs at political rallies and events. The Canadian has objected to the use of Rockin' in the Free World and Devil's Sidewalk for what he called an ""un-American campaign of ignorance and hate"". The Trump campaign has not yet commented. Young said he had complained about Mr Trump's use of his music since 2015, but had been ""wilfully"" ignored. The singer, who is now officially a US citizen after having lived in the country for decades, is seeking damages of up to $150,000 (Â£114,400) per infringement. These include at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, and the US president's visit to Mount Rushmore in July. ""This complaint is not intended to disrespect the rights and opinions of American citizens, who are free to support the candidate of their choosing,"" Young's lawyers wrote in the filing, which wasposted on the performer's website.,external ""However, Plaintiff in good conscience cannot allow his music to be used as a 'theme song' for a divisive, un-American campaign of ignorance and hate."" The 74-year-old has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice - first as a solo artist, and then with his old band Buffalo Springfield. He's not the only musician angry with the US president for having used their material. Rolling Stones warn Trump not to use their songs Neil Young US citizenship 'delayed over marijuana' Bob Dylan and Neil Young share Hyde Park stage Last month, The Rolling Stones warned President Trump that he could face legal action if he continued using their songs at his campaign rallies. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards also joined artists including Aerosmith and Sir Elton John in recently signing an open letter calling on politicians to obtain permission before playing their music at campaign and political events. According to music rights organization BMI, regular music licences issued to concert halls and other venues do not cover political rallies. Political candidates must obtain a separate Political Entities Licence, which gives them access to 15 million songs. The Trump campaign does have such a licence. But artists have the right to take their music off the list. The Rolling Stones have done so, although Young has not explicitly said whether he also has.

"Ethnic minorities 'over-exposed' to coronavirusThey ""face greater barriers"" when trying to protect themselves from coronavirus, a report says.","People from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to report taking public transport People from ethnic minority backgrounds in Britain ""face greater barriers"" when trying to protect themselves from coronavirus, according to a report. The Runnymede Trust, a race equality think-tank, said Bangladeshi and black African people were most vulnerable. Jobs, households and using public transport are all said to be risk factors. The government said it is working to help ethnic minorities, who have been disproportionately harmed by Covid-19. There is growing evidence that people from those communities are at greater risk from the virus. The Runnymede Trust also warned important public safety messages aimed at reducing transmission were currently not reaching all black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Covid studies to examine virus link with ethnicity The survey of 2,585 adults in Great Britain, including 750 from BAME backgrounds, suggests ethnic minorities are ""over-exposed"" because they are more likely to live in multigenerational households, which can reduce the ability to self-isolate and shield from the virus. Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Black African groups are said to be the most likely to live in ""overcrowded housing"". And more than a quarter of people from BAME backgrounds classified themselves as a ""key worker"" (28%), compared with 23% of white British people questioned in the same survey. This video can not be played BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? BAME key workers were also more likely to report feeling as if they had faced additional risks through not having adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). The survey found those from ethnic minority backgrounds were also more likely to say they had used public transport during lockdown - which could increase the chance of transmission because they are enclosed spaces. The Runnymede Trust said all these factors helped to explain why certain parts of society had been hardest hit during the pandemic. ""While we have all faced the same storm, we are not in the same boat."" said Dr Zubaida Haque, interim director of the trust. ""Our findings explain why we are seeing outbreaks in places like Leicester, densely populated areas with multigenerational households. Many people are also struggling to pay bills so have to leave their homes to work. ""Temporary housing and financial support should be made available to facilitate those who need to self-isolate."" The report also found ethnic minorities are less likely to know about government messaging like ""Stay Home"" and economic measures like the furlough scheme. It recommends the NHS Test and Trace system needs to be better at reaching the most vulnerable, including working closer with local authorities who already have trusted relationships with their communities. A statement from the Department for Health said: ""We know that Covid-19 has had a disproportionate effect on people from Bame backgrounds, and, following the findings of the Public Health England report, the equalities minister is now taking forward vital work to tackle these disparities and protect our most vulnerable communities from the impact of the virus.""

New approach to antisocial behaviour from weekend,"This video can not be played Cardiff Bay crowds: ""Older people gathered on VE Day"" A new approach to antisocial behaviour at Cardiff Bay will be implemented by police from the weekend. Since lockdown has eased,hundreds of young people have been gatheringand drinking alcohol in large groups there. Ch Supt Wendy Gunny from South Wales Police said people would see a more visible police presence from the weekend. Young people meeting there told the BBC they cleaned up their litter and that a minority were behind the problems. Speaking to Claire Summers onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Ch Supt Gunny said: ""We need to take a different approach with Cardiff Bay to make it a more controlled environment so everyone can enjoy it safely."" ""There will be more structured commands over that police presence so we can move around the city and towards disturbances if and when we need to."" Minority of young people 'ruining it for majority' Barry Island: Police break up 'antisocial' gatherings Party of 200 dispersed from Gower beauty spot by police Large groups of people visited Cardiff Bay on the first weekend of Wales' stay local travel advice ended She said marshals would be meeting and greeting visitors, barriers would be erected and there would be more bins. She added: ""It has been particularly challenging since we've seen lockdown eased with the pop up of this disorder across the city and across south Wales really... ""It is completely disappointing and we had hoped that people would be responsible and behave themselves. ""Recent events have shown that a small minority spoil this for others."" Police say there were several disturbances in Cardiff Bay on Saturday evening Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton said: ""I don't think we should try to demonise a particular group in society, I think there is something for all of us. ""We need to think about young people and the way that they have had a very difficult summer, many of their kind of pleasures and enjoyments have been taken away and we can understand this sort of behaviour."" But he added: ""We have to get the message through that this does put all of us at risk, it risks us having to go back to the stage where we have to close things down rather than as we are now opening things up. ""There is something about young people behaving responsibly so they protect their relatives, their older relatives, in particular grandparents... that message needs to get through, but it's really for all of us to take those messages on board."" Lily Schofield, a medical student at Cardiff University, has been called up to work on an acute stroke ward in Bridgend which has meant she cannot see her family as her mother is shielding. She toldDot Davies on BBC Radio Walesthe images from Cardiff Bay were upsetting but said it was ""dangerous to make generalisations about how young people are acting at the moment"". She said: ""We don't hear about people who are at home abiding by the rules. ""I've got lots of friends who have been putting themselves at risk being part of the temporary workforce - friends working in hospitals, actors being hospital cleaners, working for charities, people being supermarket staff and delivery driversâ¦ now more than ever it's important to celebrate those young people and thank them for what they've done."" Lewis Tebbut (left) and Rhys Mallard say social media has helped drive crowds to public spaces in lockdown The BBC spoke to a number of small groups enjoying a quiet drink in the sun at Cardiff Bay's Roald Dahl Plass on Monday. Rhys Mallard and Lewis Tebbut, both 21, said most people gathered for a quiet few drinks with friends and cleaned up after themselves. Police have additional powers to disperse people congregating in Cardiff Bay ""I've seen problems with drinking and fighting, people don't clean up their rubbish and it ruins it for everyone else,"" said Lewis. ""Coming down here with mates is one thing, but inviting everyone you know and people bringing massive speakers is another."" Rhys and Lewis said numbers could grow very quickly on weekends, especially when the weather is nice and people are attracted to the area when they see friends posting on social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat. ""Before you know it, you've got 200 to 400 people down here,"" Rhys explained. Pictured right to left: Lowri Rees, Alisha Watkins, Tyler Pidjon, Elli Lloyd and Morgan Lloyd say some people get too drunk and leave their rubbish Lowri, Alisha, Tyler, Elli and Morgan say they like to meet down Cardiff Bay and have a few quiet drinks when the weather is nice. They say they would only stay until about 22:00 and would take all their rubbish away with them. ""Rubbish is the problem,"" said Lowri. ""They could have had a good night without leaving rubbish. They get too drunk and then leave it there."" Cardiff Council said it had removed 28 tonnes of waste at a cost of Â£4,000. Claire Simms and Simon Graham say families are unable to enjoy the area when there are large crowds in the Bay Claire Simms and Simon Graham live in Penarth but regularly walk across the barrage to enjoy the ""ambience"" of Cardiff Bay. ""I can understand all these kids and their frustration, but we have all got the same frustration,"" said Claire. ""Families with young children can't enjoy it. It's a nice ambience normally. It's nice to come here and relax, people watch and that."" Last weekend,a 48-hour dispersal orderwas put in place near the Wales Millennium Centre to deal with problems. ""It is a really concerning situation,"" International Relations Minister Elunned Morgan said at a Welsh Government press conference on Tuesday. ""It is something where I think we do have to get messages out, in particular to younger people, that this does affect them, it will affect them. ""Clearly the evidence suggests that the younger people are really perhaps in some parts of the country not taking this as seriously as some of the other age groups. ""That is a message that we need to get out but the police are very well aware of the situation in Cardiff Bay, and will be enforcing measures to make sure that people comply with the rules.""

all from us on the latest coronavirus developments in Scotland for Wednesday 5
August. Here
are todayâs biggest headlines: We'll be back in the morning. Have a good evening and
stay safe. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The number of positive cases stemming from the Aberdeen outbreak is ""likely"" to increase over the next few days, the interim chief medical officer has said. As of today 54 people have tested positive in relation to this cluster. Dr Gregor Smith told Drivetime that not all of these cases are people living within the city. He also said he would be ""very surprised"" if there were no further outbreaks elsewhere in Scotland. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland An Aberdeen councillor has suggested the outbreak in the city is in part due to confusion around the guidelines. Cllr Marie Bolton, who convenes the city's licensing board, told Drivetime that officials were engaging with businesses and encouraging compliance. But she added: ""I don't think Aberdeen's alone in finding themselves, perhaps, a bit confused with some of the guidance that's been issued."" In particular, Ms Bolton pointed to confusion around when to wear face masks and the distance people should be keeping between one another. ""There's lots of different things where people are saying, 'should I be doing this, shouldn't I be doing that?',"" she said. Katie McEvinneyBBC Scotland News Lauren, Luke and Kelly are among thousands of students whose estimated grades were lowered When Luke Robertson, 16, from Motherwell opened his exams results on Tuesday, the scramble of letters on the page wasn't what he had hoped for.

He had been predicted to achieve mostly As by his teachers and had been assured by them that his final grades would not be lower than his prelim performance. But like many pupils across Scotland, Luke said he was ""disappointed and shocked"" by the surprise grades and now felt uncertain about the future. Read more.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland A petition urging the SQA to reevaluate this year's exam results has garnered over 20,000 signatures in a day. Thousands of Scottish pupilsreceived worse results than expectedyesterday after the country's exam body lowered 125,000 estimated grades. School pupil Sarah McLauchlan started the petition calling for each student to be looked at independently, rather than having their school's historic attainment data taken into account. ""This isn't just me and a small group of friends trying to kick up a fuss. It is affecting thousands of people,"" she told BBC Drivetime. She said the SQA had assumed teachers had overestimated pupils' grades instead of investigating. ""They had no exams. So why, instead of using that time to give more accurate results, did they use a system that really didn't reflect any student personally?"" she asked. The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system. Siberia took the decision to close for two weeks yesterday, before the local lockdown was announced The Aberdeen and Shire Licensed Trade Association has
described the reimposition of restrictions as âvery disappointingâ. President of the association Mike Kinnaird said the sector

open safely. He added: âThe Shire members are also concerned. This is a
major problem for restaurants who have taken in food and staff... Itâs very
disappointing.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Also on the programme: Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor In a bid to kick-start the economy in a post-coronavirus era planning rules are set to change Planning rules are to be revised and applications handled
more swiftly, to reduce obstacles to business investment. That is one of a wide-ranging set of Scottish government
policies to help economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. The other measures include: Business groups have welcomed many of the measures, but say
there must be swift action as well as policy development.  Environmental campaigners complain the plans do not go far
enough in helping make homes more energy efficient. The Westminster plan for
home improvement grants is not being applied in Scotland, though there are some
funds already available. Following an
increase in coronavirus cases in Aberdeen, local restrictions on
travel, indoor gatherings between households and the closure of indoor and
outdoor hospitality are being introduced in the Aberdeen City local authority
area. From 5pm today bars, restaurants, cafes and pubs will be
required by law to close. Hotel restaurants can remain open to provide food for
existing guests, and takeaway services can continue. People in
Aberdeen City are asked not to meet other households indoors or travel more
than five miles for leisure or recreational purposes. People can
continue to travel for work, or education purposes. Visiting in hospitals and
care homes will return to essential visits only. The restrictions
come as NHS Grampian have reported there are now 54
positive cases of Covid-19 in the cluster associated with the Hawthorn Bar in
Aberdeen. A total of 191 close contacts have been traced through Test

premises have now been identified as being linked to people who have

Laing, the co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said the renewed restrictions in the city were ""unfortunate"" just as a degree of normality was returning after the initial coronavirus pandemic. But she said ""the safety of our citizens remains our first priority"". The council's other co-leader, Councillor Douglas Lumsden, said: ""Itâs really disappointing that weâre having to take a backwards step. âHowever, looking at the data from NHS Grampian and looking ahead to the schools re-opening next week, I think itâs the right thing to do. âWe had a meeting with the first minister this morning and we were all in full agreement on the route weâve taken today... ""And in terms of lockdown, we donât want this to continue any longer than it needs to. It will be reviewed again in seven days' time and hopefully we can come out of these temporary lockdown measures next week.â Restrictions to deal with new coronavirus outbreaks have been imposed in parts of Europe since lockdowns were eased.

The Scottish Tourism Alliance and UK Hospitality have called Aberdeen's new lockdown restrictions a ""devastating blow"" to hospitality businesses who have invested significant amounts of money in
reopening. The two bodies released a statement saying that Aberdeen serves as an example of how quickly the virus can reignite and
illustrates the immediate impact that this has on a local economy and public
health. It said: ""Todayâs news comes as a shock and should serve as a reminder that disregarding
these guidelines has almost immediate consequences, however we must also
recognise that many people and businesses are enjoying the easing of
restrictions in a safe way that poses little threat to public safety."" They also said that further sector
specific financial support would be required. Police in Aberdeen said they will have additional patrols in areas where local restrictions have been introduced. Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said officers will continue to engage,
educate and encourage people to comply with the guidelines. But they will not hesitate to take enforcement action where appropriate, he said. âAs a national service, Police
Scotland is able to quickly flex capacity to support local communities across
the country, and we will provide whatever additional resources are necessary to
protect and support the communities affected,"" he said. DCC Kerr said the majority of the public followed the law and Scottish government
advice during the pandemic. ""I realise that this situation will be frustrating for people in the
affected area but itâs really important that we all continue to do so,"" he said.   Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Crisis-hit Virgin Atlantic files for US bankruptcy,"Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic could run out of cash next month if creditors do not approve a Â£1.2bn rescue deal, a UK court has heard. The airline is ""fundamentally sound"" but a restructuring and fresh injection of money is critical to securing its future, Virgin's lawyers said. The plans need approval from creditors under a court-sanctioned process. As part of that process Virgin Atlantic is also seeking protection under chapter 15 of the US bankruptcy code. That enables a foreign debtor to shield assets in the country. Like other airlines, Virgin Atlantic's finances have been hit hard by the collapse in air travel due to the pandemic. Last month, the company agreed arescue deal worth Â£1.2bn($1.6bn) to secure its future beyond the coronavirus crisis. The court in London heard that the airline's cash flow would drop to ""critical levels"" by the middle of next month and it would ""run out of money altogether"" by the week beginning 28 September. David Allison QC, for Virgin Atlantic, told Mr Justice Trower in written submissions that the group had ""a fundamentally sound business model which was not in any problems at all before the Covid-19 pandemic"". ""Passenger demand has plummeted to a level that would, until recently, have been unthinkable,"" he said. ""As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the group is now undergoing a liquidity crisis."" Mr Allison said that without a ""solvent recapitalisation"", including an injection of new money, Virgin Atlantic's directors would have ""no choice"" but to place the company into administration in mid-September 2020 in order to wind down the business and sell any assets, where possible. Aviation industry buckles up for turbulent times Virus drives airlines to 'worst' year on record How recession means jets end up in 'boneyards' He said the restructuring needed to be sanctioned by early September. Mr Justice Trower gave the go-ahead for a meeting of creditors on 25 August. In a related procedural move, Virgin Atlantic filed for US bankruptcy protection, saying it had negotiated a deal with stakeholders ""for a consensual recapitalization"" that will get debt off its balance sheet and ""immediately position it for sustainable long-term growth"". Virgin Atlantic said in a statement on Wednesday that it continues to operate its limited flight schedule, adding: ""With support already secured from the majority of stakeholders, it's expected that the Restructuring Plan and recapitalisation will come into effect in September. We remain confident in the plan."" Under the airline's restructuring plan, Sir Richard's Virgin Group will inject Â£200m, with additional funds provided by investors and creditors. The billionaire Virgin boss had a request for UK government money rejected, leaving the airline in a race against time to secure new investment. In May, Virgin Atlantic, which is 51% owned by Virgin Group and 49% by US airline Delta, announced that it wouldcut more than 3,000 jobs in the UK and close its operation at Gatwick airport. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia's new owner, the US private equity group Bain Capital, said it will cut 3,000 jobs, which is about a third of the airline's employees. The turnaround plan for Australia's second largest airline will also see it retire the budget brand Tigerair. ""Working with Bain Capital, we will accelerate our plan to deliver a strong future in a challenging domestic and global aviation market,"" Virgin Australia's chief executive Paul Scurrah said. This video can not be played A Virgin Australia flight attendant says goodbye on a final international flight In April,Virgin Australia went into voluntary administration, making it Australia's first big corporate casualty of the coronavirus pandemic. The following month it was bought by Bain Capital, which said it supported the airline's current management team and its turnaround plan for the business. Bain also promised a ""significant injection of capital"" that would help Virgin Australia recapitalise and retain thousands of jobs. Carriers around the world are struggling as they deal with the severe plunge in air travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The International Air Transport Association warned in June that the slump will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (Â£64bn) this year.

Â£800m to prepare NHS for coronavirus second waveMost of the money will be used to boost supplies of Personal Protective Equipment.Wales politics,"Wales came within days of running out of PPE at one stage in the pandemic An Â£800m fund to prepare the Welsh NHS for a possible second coronavirus wave has been announced by ministers. A large portion of the money will be used to boost supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). The cash will also be used to retain some field hospitals and Â£11.7m will go to fundWales' biggest flu campaign. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said she was confident the announcement would give the NHS the ""stability it needs"" to respond to the pandemic. The Conservatives said the money was needed to ""increase access to vital health provision which has been closed or greatly reduced since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak"". Plaid Cymru warned that ""good management"" was needed as well as money. Between 9 March and 26 July 2020 66.6msurgical masks 45.6maprons 2.1mface visors 119.4mgloves 180,894hand sanitisers 1.12mgowns The Welsh Government said access would continue to expand and it had now provided more than Â£1.3bn of Covid-19 support to NHS organisations. ""We understand the growing financial pressures and challenges being faced across the public sector and we are doing all we can to alleviate these,"" Ms Evans said, announcing what ministers are calling an NHS ""stabilisation package"". ""We are also continuing to work with local authorities to understand the considerable pressures they are facing and their priorities so that we can provide them with further support."" How has the first coronavirus wave looked across Wales? What do the stats tell us? People told to phone ahead before going to A&E Welsh Tory health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said that without the UK Conservative government's ""historic funding packages today's announcement would not have been possible"". ""This money needs to increase access to vital health provision which has been closed or greatly reduced since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak,"" he said. ""As we have seen with the number of cancer deaths it is vital that these pathways to treatment are reopened as soon as possible to prevent as few premature deaths as possible."" Rhun ap Iorweth, Plaid's health spokesman, said dealing effectively with a second wave would require ""good management"" from the Welsh Government and health boards so routine care could continue. Rebecca Evans says she believes the NHS will have the money to cope with a difficult winter An Â£800m ""stabilisation"" package is a lot of cash, but much of it has come as a result of spending decisions already made in England. For example, we already knew the Welsh Government was due to get Â£675m as a result of UK government spending to build up stocks of PPE. A significant amount of the Â£800m will be spent doing the same in Wales, along with preparing for winter. In April Wales' health minister admittedthe Welsh NHS had come ""within days"" of running out of specific items. But nobody doubts NHS Wales will face immense challenges dealing with what is likely to be its most difficult winter. Not only will it have to gear up for the potential threat of a second coronavirus wave but also the prospect that the usual winter illnesses like flu might be circulating at the same time - and those on their own in a ""normal"" winter can stretch capacity and resources to the limit. The NHS will also have to try to juggle the extra pressures with the growing need to make inroads into waiting lists which have been growing following the postponement of many procedures and operations during the coronavirus first wave.

Further education colleges 'let down' by ministers,"Colleges have said they need more financial help Further education providers have been ""let down"" by the Welsh Government's response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to Colleges Wales. Chief executive Iestyn Davies said he was disappointed with the ""shape and time"" it had taken for colleges to receive guidance. The Welsh Government published new guidance on Friday - less than five weeks before the new term in September. It said it had worked ""closely"" with the sector andprovided nearly Â£28m. The guidance includes how to engage with the test, trace and protect programme and advice on personal protective equipment (PPE). Colleges Wales represents 12 colleges in Wales that provide post-16 education However, Colleges Wales said questions remained over transport as well as vulnerable learners and staff, and urged ministers to provide prolonged financial and practical support. ""We have a wide range of individuals who come into colleges,"" said Mr Davies. ""Young people, [those] in their 30s and 40s returning to education, we provide work-based learning, apprenticeships and some incredibly personalised support to learners with complex needs. ""It's important the sector doesn't become an afterthought."" Djainizio Brito, 17, from Grangetown in Cardiff, is facing uncertainty over his course. ""I don't know if we're even starting in September,"" said student Djainizio Brito Having completed his GCSEs at school, he said he was excited to start a creative media production and technology course - but admitted he was still in the dark over his next step. ""I know what I want to do - I just don't know when I'm going to be able to do it, or if it's going to be online or face to face,"" he said. Thirteen UK universities 'facing insolvency' Students with no relatives 'may have to drop out' Uni admissions could see emergency controls ""It is difficult for the college but all the little details that a person should know by now are literally unknown to any student starting in September. ""My friends who are staying in sixth form already know what they're going to do next year. I'm literally clueless. I don't know if we're even starting in September."" However, the head of the largest further education organisation in Wales said colleges had been working behind the scenes to ensure students could return safely for the new term. ""The scenario planning has been happening in the background on a local basis [but] we haven't been actively communicating that with the learners until we're clear exactly how it's going to work,"" said Dafydd Evans of GrÅµp Llandrillo Menai. Young people 'not taking pandemic seriously' Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' ""Dialogue with the Welsh Government has been constructive, though we would have wished to have the guidelines for September a bit sooner because we're only four weeks away. ""Whatever we put in place in September has to be agile enough to meet whatever is ahead of us over the winter months in terms of Covid."" Further education could play a crucial role in Wales' economic recovery, particularly for workers who have been left unemployed by the pandemic to retrain or learn new skills. The Welsh Government is providing Â£23m to help colleges and students following coronavirus But making sure students of all ages have access to digital equipment must be a priority, Mr Evans said, in case colleges are forced to close again in the winter. ""We've received some funding but that only scratches the surface,"" he said. ""A far more radical scheme needs to be put in place by the Welsh Government to ensure digital poverty doesn't exist."" The Welsh Government said it was providing more than Â£3m for digital equipment for post-16 learners as part of the additional Â£28m funding aimed to help soften the impact of the pandemic. ""We have worked closely with colleges in developing the latest guidance, ensuring it's as comprehensive as possible, while remaining relevant to rapid changes at a national level on key matters such as social distancing,"" a spokesman said. ""We have responded to specific questions from Colleges Wales and continue to work with the sector and Public Health Wales to resolve queries that may arise as colleges implement the guidance."" Testing and tracing 'key to schools returning' Â£50m support package for universities and colleges Furloughed student 'drowning' in rent arrears Coronavirus transmission rates key to school return Universities' concern over 2m rule in Wales Students with no relatives 'may have to drop out' From exams to the coronavirus front line Universities warn of going bust without extra cash Colleges Wales 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Tractors and animals taken as rural crime cost up,"This video can not be played ""They've stolen a Land Rover, diesel, roof slates"" Rural crime cost Welsh businesses Â£2.6m last year as organised gangs targeted machinery and livestock, an insurance company has said. NFU Mutual's annual rural crime report said the cost rose 11.1% in 2019, compared to 2018 - higher than the average UK rise of 8.8%. Across the UK, rural crime cost Â£54m - an increase of nearly 9%. There are fears that incidents could escalate when the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is felt. The report said high-value tractors, quad bikes and large numbers of livestock had been targeted. Farmers' helpline to be expanded across Wales Welsh farmers 'lag behind on diversification' Machinery and tractors have been targeted by thieves Expensive tractors are being exported and sold in rich countries, the insurer said, while older models are being shipped to poorer countries. While crime generally decreased during the initial lockdown period earlier this year, NFU Mutual said there were fears rural crime could now escalate. Manager for Wales, Owen Suckley, said: ""Rural crime is like a wave as organised criminality spreads through our farms and villages, affecting everyone in the countryside. ""We continue to work hard to stem the tide and are warning rural communities and helping with prevention advice, as there are concerns for the months ahead as the economic impact of coronavirus bites. ""As well as the financial cost, there's a serious effect on the mental well-being of people living in rural and often isolated areas. ""There are fears that the impact will be felt harder this year as farmers have been working flat-out to feed the nation and many rural communities have been put under additional pressure by the challenges brought by Covid-19."" Livestock have been taken and there are fears the problem could grow worse in the coming months Chris Alford, who farms in the Brecon area, has previously had vehicles and machinery stolen, and more recently, a solar-powered fence charger. He said: ""I'd only had the fence energiser for two weeks before it was taken. A brand new piece of solar-powered kit that obviously looked expensive. ""People can so easily search the value of things on their phones now that even specialist items like this can be identified as a payday by a passer-by. ""The energiser was worth a couple of hundred pounds, which might not seem like much, but the effect of rural crime goes so much deeper than the monetary costs."" He added: ""Then there's the emotional impact. Once you've stopped feeling angry, it's actually gut-wrenching. You can write-off the day you find you've fallen victim to crime. In the past, when I've had larger things like vehicles stolen, it's affected me for weeks. ""It plays on your mind and makes it hard to concentrate on anything else. ""The thought of a stranger being on your property, and stealing from you, can make you feel paranoid, with a voice in your head telling you that they'll be back to steal again. You find yourself making business decisions based on what will make you least attractive to repeat theft.""

"Ethnic minorities 'over-exposed' to coronavirusThey ""face greater barriers"" when trying to protect themselves from coronavirus, a report says.Health","People from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to report taking public transport People from ethnic minority backgrounds in Britain ""face greater barriers"" when trying to protect themselves from coronavirus, according to a report. The Runnymede Trust, a race equality think-tank, said Bangladeshi and black African people were most vulnerable. Jobs, households and using public transport are all said to be risk factors. The government said it is working to help ethnic minorities, who have been disproportionately harmed by Covid-19. There is growing evidence that people from those communities are at greater risk from the virus. The Runnymede Trust also warned important public safety messages aimed at reducing transmission were currently not reaching all black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Covid studies to examine virus link with ethnicity The survey of 2,585 adults in Great Britain, including 750 from BAME backgrounds, suggests ethnic minorities are ""over-exposed"" because they are more likely to live in multigenerational households, which can reduce the ability to self-isolate and shield from the virus. Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Black African groups are said to be the most likely to live in ""overcrowded housing"". And more than a quarter of people from BAME backgrounds classified themselves as a ""key worker"" (28%), compared with 23% of white British people questioned in the same survey. This video can not be played BAME coronavirus deaths: What's the risk for ethnic minorities? BAME key workers were also more likely to report feeling as if they had faced additional risks through not having adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). The survey found those from ethnic minority backgrounds were also more likely to say they had used public transport during lockdown - which could increase the chance of transmission because they are enclosed spaces. The Runnymede Trust said all these factors helped to explain why certain parts of society had been hardest hit during the pandemic. ""While we have all faced the same storm, we are not in the same boat."" said Dr Zubaida Haque, interim director of the trust. ""Our findings explain why we are seeing outbreaks in places like Leicester, densely populated areas with multigenerational households. Many people are also struggling to pay bills so have to leave their homes to work. ""Temporary housing and financial support should be made available to facilitate those who need to self-isolate."" The report also found ethnic minorities are less likely to know about government messaging like ""Stay Home"" and economic measures like the furlough scheme. It recommends the NHS Test and Trace system needs to be better at reaching the most vulnerable, including working closer with local authorities who already have trusted relationships with their communities. A statement from the Department for Health said: ""We know that Covid-19 has had a disproportionate effect on people from Bame backgrounds, and, following the findings of the Public Health England report, the equalities minister is now taking forward vital work to tackle these disparities and protect our most vulnerable communities from the impact of the virus.""

"Childcare workers quit 'undervalued' jobsYou could earn more in Tesco, admits one pre-school leader as thousands leave the profession.","Early-years childcare workers are quitting jobs blighted by low pay, long hours and poor prospects, says a report from the  Social Mobility Commission. The workforce is ""increasingly unstable"", with not enough new entrants to replace those who leave, the study says. The government says it has boosted funding to childcare providers, in order to help parents get back to work. But the report urges a total overhaul of early-years careers. Childminders are 'the unsung heroes of the pandemic' Some childminders in England told they can reopen Lack of childcare 'forces key workers to stay home' Childminder numbers in England plummet Good-quality early-years provision is key to reducing the attainment gap between children from disadvantaged families and their better-off peers, say the authors. But this provision is at risk as committed professionals find themselves undervalued, underpaid and unable to make ends meet, they add. Early-years workers face ""multiple barriers"" on a daily basis, says report author Dr Sara Bonetti, director of early years at the Education Policy Institute. ""We must do far more to support workers, otherwise we risk compromising the quality of provision and widening the disadvantage gap."" The authors studied the pay of about 290,000 workers. The latest full official figures available, for the two years ending in March 2017, showed: 96% were female 40% were under 30 about one in eight, largely younger workers, earned less than Â£5 an hour average hourly pay was Â£7.42, compared with Â£11.37 for female workers as a whole Average salaries are pushed down because of the large number of apprentices working in the sector who can be paid as little as Â£4.15 an hour under government rules and who often move on quickly, says Dr Bonetti. And self-employed workers find their working hours extended by unpaid paperwork and the requirements of Ofsted, she adds. The report finds: about one in six early-years workers leaves their employment within a year many take second jobs to make ends meet more than half of employers lack the funds to spend adequately on training Lydia Pryor, who runs a pre-school in Aldborough, Norfolk, told the authors she had recently lost her deputy ""because she found another job that pays more, and I had nothing that could entice her to stay"". ""She's had enough of just making do and worrying about money when her car breaks down."" Lydia admits: ""You could earn more at Tesco"". In Warrington, Cheshire, childminder Melanie Han says lockdown pushed many in the sector out of business, but as it eases, good-quality childcare will be needed more than ever. ""I think we're going to have significant behavioural problems to deal with over the coming months. ""Children have missed out on so much at a critical time in their development. ""It's heartbreaking."" Melanie Han has been a childminder for 15 years According to Liz Bayram, chief executive of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, childminder numbers are ""in freefall"". ""The sector is crying out for a coherent workforce development strategy that supports and incentivises practitioners to continuously improve their skills, gain higher qualifications and progress their careers."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: ""Research shows that the first five years of a child's life are absolutely critical for their long-term learning and development and yet, when it comes to education policy in this country, all too often the early years sector is still seen as the poor relation of schools. He said it was no surprise that staff, on ""unacceptably low salaries"", were opting to leave. The report urges the government to convene an expert group to devise a new careers strategy, to include: a clear training pathway from apprenticeship to primary school headship a plan to attract people into the profession later in their careers, and careers advice to portray early years as a profession rather than a fall-back option Tulip Siddiq , the shadow minister for children and early years, said years of underfunding was ""driving talented staff out of the sector and letting down the young children whose life chances are shaped by vital early education"". She said: ""Labour has been calling for targeted support to save the thousands of nurseries and childminding business that are threatened with closure due to Covid-19 but we cannot go back to undervaluing the childcare workforce after this crisis. ""We must invest in them for the sake of the next generation."" The Department for Education said the government had invested Â£20m in better training and development for early-years staff, particularly in disadvantaged areas. ""We are supporting their career progression through better qualifications, more apprenticeship opportunities and routes to graduate level qualifications,"" it said. ""Nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are a vital support network for families and will play an integral role in this country's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. ""That's why they have received significant financial support over the past months and will benefit from a planned Â£3.6bn funding in 2020-21 to local authorities for free early education and childcare places."" The DfE added: ""We continue to provide extra stability and reassurance to nurseries and childminders that remain open by 'block-buying' childcare places for the rest of this year at the level we would have funded before coronavirus, regardless of how many children are attending.""

""We must do far more to support workers, otherwise we risk compromising the quality of provision and widening the disadvantage gap."" The authors studied the pay of about 290,000 workers. The latest full official figures available, for the two years ending in March 2017, showed: 96% were female 40% were under 30 about one in eight, largely younger workers, earned less than Â£5 an hour average hourly pay was Â£7.42, compared with Â£11.37 for female workers as a whole Average salaries are pushed down because of the large number of apprentices working in the sector who can be paid as little as Â£4.15 an hour under government rules and who often move on quickly, says Dr Bonetti. And self-employed workers find their working hours extended by unpaid paperwork and the requirements of Ofsted, she adds. The report finds: about one in six early-years workers leaves their employment within a year many take second jobs to make ends meet more than half of employers lack the funds to spend adequately on training Lydia Pryor, who runs a pre-school in Aldborough, Norfolk, told the authors she had recently lost her deputy ""because she found another job that pays more, and I had nothing that could entice her to stay"". ""She's had enough of just making do and worrying about money when her car breaks down."" Lydia admits: ""You could earn more at Tesco"". In Warrington, Cheshire, childminder Melanie Han says lockdown pushed many in the sector out of business, but as it eases, good-quality childcare will be needed more than ever. ""I think we're going to have significant behavioural problems to deal with over the coming months. ""Children have missed out on so much at a critical time in their development. ""It's heartbreaking."" Melanie Han has been a childminder for 15 years According to Liz Bayram, chief executive of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, childminder numbers are ""in freefall"". ""The sector is crying out for a coherent workforce development strategy that supports and incentivises practitioners to continuously improve their skills, gain higher qualifications and progress their careers."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: ""Research shows that the first five years of a child's life are absolutely critical for their long-term learning and development and yet, when it comes to education policy in this country, all too often the early years sector is still seen as the poor relation of schools. He said it was no surprise that staff, on ""unacceptably low salaries"", were opting to leave. The report urges the government to convene an expert group to devise a new careers strategy, to include: a clear training pathway from apprenticeship to primary school headship a plan to attract people into the profession later in their careers, and careers advice to portray early years as a profession rather than a fall-back option Tulip Siddiq , the shadow minister for children and early years, said years of underfunding was ""driving talented staff out of the sector and letting down the young children whose life chances are shaped by vital early education"". She said: ""Labour has been calling for targeted support to save the thousands of nurseries and childminding business that are threatened with closure due to Covid-19 but we cannot go back to undervaluing the childcare workforce after this crisis. ""We must invest in them for the sake of the next generation."" The Department for Education said the government had invested Â£20m in better training and development for early-years staff, particularly in disadvantaged areas. ""We are supporting their career progression through better qualifications, more apprenticeship opportunities and routes to graduate level qualifications,"" it said. ""Nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are a vital support network for families and will play an integral role in this country's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. ""That's why they have received significant financial support over the past months and will benefit from a planned Â£3.6bn funding in 2020-21 to local authorities for free early education and childcare places."" The DfE added: ""We continue to provide extra stability and reassurance to nurseries and childminders that remain open by 'block-buying' childcare places for the rest of this year at the level we would have funded before coronavirus, regardless of how many children are attending.""

Redundancy advice calls triple in June and July,"Citizens Advice had the highest daily number of visitors to its website topped four times in one week Thousands of firms and employees are seeking redundancy advice as the coronavirus crisis continues to bite into the UK economy. Conciliation service Acas said calls to its redundancy advice line almost tripled in June and July, as concerns mounted about the government's job retention scheme winding down. There has been a spate of redundancies as some firms struggle to stay afloat. Nearly 4,500 jobs have been cut only a few days into August. In June and July, calls to the Acas helpline to talk about redundancy rose nearly 170% compared with the same months last year, from more than 12,000 to more than 33,000 calls. In July, Citizens Advice said it had alsoseen a surge in demand for redundancy advice. Acas chief executive Susan Clews said: ""At the moment, nearly a third of calls to our helpline are redundancy-related. ""The economic impact of coronavirus, alongside fears around the furlough scheme tapering off, has left many employers and their staff concerned about their future livelihoods."" Thelatest figures,externalfrom the government show 9.6 million jobs - about a third of the private sector workforce - have been furloughed during the pandemic, at a cost of Â£33.8bn to the Treasury. Businessesbegan to pay towards the furlough schemefrom the beginning of August, putting more pressure on struggling firms. The scheme ends in October. Coronavirus: What happens when the furlough scheme ends? Acas recommended that employers should look for alternatives to redundancies, which should be used as a last resort. These alternatives include consulting staff ""on ideas that can help mitigate the financial difficulties that the business may be facing due to coronavirus"", such as: recruitment freezes limits on overtime more flexible working to cut down on office costs moving employees into other roles. A number of major employers have announced job cuts since strict coronavirus lockdown rules were announced on 23 March. According to the Press Association news agency, these include: August 4: Dixons Carphone - 800 August 4: Pizza Express - 1,100 at risk August 3: Hays Travel - up to 878 August 3: DW Sports - 1,700 at risk July 31: Byron - 651 July 30: Pendragon - 1,800 July 29: Waterstones - unknown number of head office roles July 28: Selfridges - 450 July 27: Oak Furnitureland - 163 at risk July 23: Dyson - 600 in UK, 300 overseas July 22: Mears - fewer than 200 July 20: Marks & Spencer - 950 at risk July 17: Azzurri Group (owns Zizzi and Ask Italian) - up to 1,200 July 16: Genting - 1,642 at risk July 16: Burberry - 150 in UK, 350 overseas July 15: Banks Mining - 250 at risk July 15: Buzz Bingo - 573 at risk July 14: Vertu - 345 July 14: DFS - up to 200 at risk July 9: General Electric - 369 July 9: Eurostar - unknown number July 9: Boots - 4,000 July 9: John Lewis - 1,300 at risk July 9: Burger King - 1,600 at risk July 7: Reach (owns Daily Mirror and Daily Express newspapers) - 550 July 6: Pret a Manger - 1,000 at risk July 2: Casual Dining Group (owns Bella Italia and Cafe Rouge) - 1,909 July 1: SSP (owns Upper Crust) - 5,000 at risk July 1: Arcadia (owns TopShop) - 500 July 1: Harrods - 700 July 1: Virgin Money - 300 June 30: Airbus - 1,700 June 30: TM Lewin - 600 June 30: Smiths Group - ""some job losses"" June 25: Royal Mail - 2,000 June 24: Jet2 - 102 June 24: Swissport - 4,556 June 24: Crest Nicholson - 130 June 23: Shoe Zone - unknown number of jobs in head office June 19: Aer Lingus - 500 June 17: HSBC - unknown number of jobs in UK, 35,000 worldwide June 15: Jaguar Land Rover - 1,100 June 15: Travis Perkins - 2,500 June 12: Le Pain Quotidien - 200 June 11: Heathrow - at least 500 June 11: Bombardier - 600 June 11: Johnson Matthey - 2,500 June 11: Centrica - 5,000 June 10: Quiz - 93 June 10: The Restaurant Group (owns Frankie and Benny's) - 3,000 June 10: Monsoon Accessorise - 545 June 10: Everest Windows - 188 June 8: BP - 10,000 worldwide June 8: Mulberry - 375 June 5: Victoria's Secret - 800 at risk June 5: Bentley - 1,000 June 4: Aston Martin - 500 June 4: Lookers - 1,500 May 29: Belfast International Airport - 45 May 28: Debenhams (in second announcement) - ""hundreds"" of jobs May 28: EasyJet - 4,500 worldwide May 26: McLaren - 1,200 May 22: Carluccio's - 1,000 May 21: Clarks - 900 May 20: Rolls-Royce - 9,000 May 20: Bovis Homes - unknown number May 19: Ovo Energy - 2,600 May 19: Antler - 164 May 15: JCB - 950 at risk May 13: Tui - 8,000 worldwide May 12: Carnival UK (owns P&O Cruises and Cunard) - 450 May 11: P&O Ferries - 1,100 worldwide May 5: Virgin Atlantic - 3,150 May 1: Ryanair - 3,000 worldwide April 30: Oasis Warehouse - 1,800 April 29: WPP - unknown number April 28: British Airways - up to 12,000 April 23: Safran Seats - 400 April 23: Meggitt - 1,800 worldwide April 21: Cath Kidston - 900 April 17: Debenhams - 422 March 31: Laura Ashley - 268 March 30: BrightHouse - 2,400 at risk March 27: Chiquito - 1,500 at risk.

Lebanon mourns after massive Beirut blast,"This video can not be played ""Now I'm shaking, all the way from up to down"" - Eyewitnesses describe the power of the explosion Rescue workers in Lebanon are searching for dozens of people missing a day after a huge explosion devastated the port area of the capital, Beirut. The blast, which shook the whole city, killed at least 113 people and injured more than 4,000 others. A two-week state of emergency has been declared. President Michel Aoun said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely in a warehouse. All port officials have been put under house arrest pending an investigation. Customs chief Badri Daher told local media that his agency had repeatedly called for the ammonium nitrate to be removed, but ""this did not happen, and we leave it to the experts to determine the reasons"". Ammonium nitrate is used as a fertiliser in agriculture and as an explosive. Follow our latest updates In pictures: Chaos and destruction in Beirut What is ammonium nitrate and how dangerous is it? What we know about the explosion Why Lebanon is in crisis Opening an emergency cabinet meeting, President Aoun said: ""No words can describe the horror that has hit Beirut last night, turning it into a disaster-stricken city"". The explosion occurred just after 18:00 (15:00 GMT) after a fire at the port, and it was felt 240km (150 miles) away on the island of Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean. Security forces have sealed off a wide area around the blast site, and rescuers have been looking for bodies and survivors under rubble while boats searched the waters off the coast. However the overnight rescue effort was hampered by a lack of electricity. Public Health Minister Hamad Hassan said Lebanon's health sector was short of beds and lacked the equipment necessary to treat the injured and care for patients in critical condition. This video can not be played Beirut explosion: The moment blast hit BBC bureau caught in interview He said a ""large number of children"" had been rescued but added that he feared that the number of dead would rise further. The Saint Georges hospital near the site of the explosion was badly damaged and several members of staff were killed. Three Beirut hospitals were closed with two others only partially operational, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. The body said it would airlift medical supplies to Lebanon on Wednesday evening. Three French planes are due to arrive carrying 55 rescuers, medical equipment and a mobile clinic equipped to treat 500 people. French President Emmanuel Macron will visit on Thursday. The EU is sending 100 firefighters with vehicles, dogs and equipment. Russia is sending five planes carrying rescuers, doctors and equipment. Meanwhile, many buildings and homes have been reduced to an uninhabitable mess of glass and as many as 300,000 people have been left homeless, Beirut's governor Marwan Aboud said. This video can not be played Rami Ruhayem has been to Gemmayze, the closest residential area to the port where the explosion happened The ammonium nitrate had reportedly been in a warehouse in Beirut port for six years after it was unloaded from a ship impounded at the port in 2013. The head of Beirut port and the head of the customs authority both told local media that they had written to the judiciary several times asking that the chemical be exported or sold on to ensure port safety. The port's General Manager Hassan Koraytem told OTV that they had been aware that the material was dangerous when a court first ordered it stored in the warehouse, ""but not to this degree"". Lebanon's Supreme Defence Council has vowed that those found responsible will face the ""maximum punishment"" possible. Economy Minister Raoul Nehme told the BBC: ""I think it is incompetence and really bad management and there are a lot of responsibilities from management and probably previous governments. We do not intend after such an explosion to stay silent on who is responsible for what."" British former intelligence officer Philip Ingram told the BBC's Today programme that ammonium nitrate could only be turned into an explosive substance under certain circumstances. Mr Ingram said that safely stored it was relatively safe but that in confined space and when contaminated with items such as fuel oil it could cause an explosion. The port area was largely flattened The ammonium nitrate arrived on a Moldovan-flagged ship, the Rhosus, which entered Beirut port after suffering technical problems during its voyage from Georgia to Mozambique, according to Shiparrested.com, which deals with shipping-related legal cases. The Rhosus was inspected, banned from leaving and was shortly afterwards abandoned by its owners, sparking several legal claims. Its cargo was then removed and stored in a port warehouse for safety reasons, the report said. Common industrial chemical used mainly as fertiliser in agriculture Also one of the main components in explosives used in mining Not explosive on its own, ignites only under the right circumstances When it explodes, it can release toxic gases including nitrogen oxides and ammonia gas Strict rules on how to store it safely: site has to be fire-proofed, and not have any drains, pipes or other channels in which ammonium nitrate could build up The explosion comes at a sensitive time for Lebanon. With Covid-19 infections on the rise, hospitals were already struggling to cope. Now, they are faced with treating thousands of injured people. The country is also going through the worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, and tensions were already high with street demonstrations against the government. Many blame the ruling elite who have dominated politics for years and amassed their own wealth while failing to carry out the sweeping reforms necessary to solve the country's problems. People have to deal with daily power cuts, a lack of safe drinking water and limited public healthcare. Lebanon imports most of its food and large quantities of grain stored in the port have been destroyed causing fears of widespread food insecurity to come. The future of the port itself is in doubt due to the destruction caused. President Aoun announced that the government would release 100 billion lira (Â£50.5m; $66m) of emergency funds but the impact of the blast on the economy is expected to be long-lasting. The explosion happened close to the scene of a huge car bombing which killed former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005. A verdict is due in the trial of four men accused of orchestrating the attack on Mr Hariri at a special court in the Netherlands. Have you been personally affected by this story?
