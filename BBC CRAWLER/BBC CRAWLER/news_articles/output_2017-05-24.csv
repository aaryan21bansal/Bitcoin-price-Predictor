Morgan ton in England win over S Africa,"First one-day international, Headingley: England 339-6 (50 overs):Morgan 107 (93), Moeen 77* (51) South Africa 267 (45 overs):Woakes 4-38, Amla 73 England won by 72 runs Match scorecard A brilliant Eoin Morgan century led England to a 72-run victory over South Africa in the first one-day international at Headingley. Skipper Morgan made 107 from 93 deliveries and Moeen Ali an unbeaten 77 from 51 to get the home side to 339-6. South Africa were well placed at 145-1, but were bowled out for 267 with Chris Woakes taking 4-38. England will seal the three-match series with victory at Southampton on Saturday (11:00 BST). After routine victories over Ireland,world number ones South Africa present much sterner opposition for England in the build-up to the Champions Trophy,which begins on 1 June. With IPL trio Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Woakes back in the side - and the in-form Jonny Bairstow omitted as expected - England's powerful batting took full advantage of being put in on a flat surface under glorious sunshine. Though they wobbled after a strong start, Morgan and man-of-the-match Moeen took England to the highest ODI total at Headingley and their 20th in excess of 300 since the 2015 World Cup. For a time, their attack looked vulnerable - improvement is likely to be needed in the Champions Trophy - but a series of poor South African strokes helped England's cause. England were also guilty of some recklessness. Alex Hales and Joe Root both fell to Andile Phehlukwayo when well set, before Stokes and Buttler went in the space of 10 balls to leave the hosts 198-5 in the 35th over. The wristy Morgan, with flays through the off side and power on the leg, had already passed 50, but Moeen looked uncomfortable against the short ball. However, after Morgan heaved Phehlukwayo over the mid-wicket fence, England charged. Moeen launched leg-spinner Imran Tahir for three sixes in an over to bring up a 35-ball half-century and Morgan reached his 10th ODI century for England with his fifth maximum. Though Morgan was held at long-off from the impressive pace bowling of Chris Morris, Moeen hit the same bowler for six from the last delivery of the innings to make a total of 102 runs from the final 10 overs. There is a suspicion that England's bowling does not match the strength of their batting in ODIs. Indeed, while England have scored more runs per over than any other side since the 2015 World Cup, they have also conceded more than all but Sri Lanka. Here, Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis looked set to exploit the England attack, not missing an opportunity to punish anything marginally short or wide. They shared a stand of 112 until Mark Wood, otherwise expensive, returned to trap Amla lbw on review and, in the next over, Liam Plunkett had Du Plessis caught behind. JP Duminy and David Miller both hit poor deliveries straight to the fielder on the leg-side boundary and Morris was caught reverse sweeping, but South Africa remained dangerous so long as AB de Villiers was at the crease. The Proteas skipper, the number one ODI batsman in the world, had just begun to open his shoulders when he lofted Moeen to Plunkett at deep mid-wicket. As he departed, so too did South Africa's hopes, with a bad day for the tourists capped by a fine for a slow over-rate. De Villiers lost 20% of his match fee and the rest of the team 10%. Headingley observed a minute's silence before the start of the game following Monday's attack in Manchester England's 339-6 is the highest total made in an ODI at Headingley. This is the first time England have made 300 at home against South Africa. It is also their second-highest total against the Proteas. The highest is 399 at Bloemfontein in February 2016. That was Eoin Morgan's third century in his past eight ODI innings, having not scored one in his previous 24 matches. Eoin Morgan (4,767) has now overtaken Alec Stewart (4,692) to become the third-highest run-scorer for England in ODIs. Only Paul Collingwood (5,092) and Ian Bell (5,416) have more. England captain Eoin Morgan on TMS:""It was a pretty good day at the office for us. Playing against a strong South Africa team and putting in an all-round performance was brilliant. ""I have felt good for a while. I didn't play as much in the IPL as I would have liked but I got a few runs in the Ireland game and to continue that here is a good feeling. ""If Moeen Ali didn't get any runs and had a bad day, I'd probably pick him again. I have that much confidence in the guy. He's made some huge contributions for us over the last couple of years and beyond that."" Man of the match Moeen Ali on TMS:""To get us to 339 in the end, I was very pleased with that. We finished well with the momentum. We bat all the way down so I gave myself a bit of a chance. I backed my game a bit more today - in the past sometimes I've not done that. ""I've not been batting or bowling well recently. Paul Farbrace gave me a few tips with my batting and that really helped me today."" South Africa captain AB de Villiers: ""England played phenomenally well with the bat in hand. Morgan really dominated with the hundred and manipulated us really well. ""We didn't bat well enough, we definitely should have come a lot closer. We just didn't get partnerships going tonight."" Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on TMS:""England have still got a lot of room for improvement but I'm very impressed with how they've approached today. Eoin Morgan has the awareness of the game and the gaps. He'll have a gameplan within seconds, and he'll free his arms. He's in fine form leading in to that Champions Trophy.""

They are now working out a plan to pay his rent for the next six months, while also providing him with new clothes and opportunities to find work .

Ajax 0-2 Manchester United,"Manchester United have now won all three of Europe's major competitions Manchester United claimed their second major trophy of the season and secured Champions League football as they overcame Ajax to win the Europa League final in Stockholm. On an emotional night following the attack which killed 22 people at Ariana Grande's concert at the Manchester Arena on Monday, United's fans were allowed a measure of celebration as Jose Mourinho's side won in comfort. Paul Pogba's deflected shot put them ahead in the 18th minute and Henrikh Mkhitaryan's sixth Europa League goal of the campaign, flicked in from Chris Smalling's header at a corner, confirmed they would add to the EFL Cup won against Southampton earlier this season. Wayne Rooney made a brief appearance as a substitute with a minute left and the game won, being handed the captain's armband by Antonio Valencia on what could well be his farewell appearance for United. And as the final whistle sounded and United's celebrations began, chants of ""Manchester"" rang around the Friends Arena in tribute to those who died and were injured in the attack which cast a shadow over this showpiece occasion. Mourinho - who has so often looked so unhappy this season - ran on to the field to celebrate with his players and was thrown in the air by his coaching staff and hugged by his son. It means United are now the fifth team to claim the full quota of European trophies, joining an illustrious list with Ajax, Chelsea, Juventus and Bayern Munich. Herrera dedicates trophy to victims Relive Manchester United's Europa League victory over Ajax Listen to Mark Chapman's emotional tribute to Manchester on 5 live How the Man Utd players rated Jose Mourinho has now won four major European trophies Mourinho has had his moments of frustration this season - especially with 15 Premier League draws that led to an unsatisfactory sixth-place finish. It left United's Champions League hopes resting on this game but the win and subsequent qualification for the group stages of Europe's elite tournament means that Mourinho can regard this season as a real success. Some may question the quality of United's performances and this undoubtedly remains a work in progress but two trophies and that place back in the Champions League is an impressive outcome, irrespective of the style in which it was achieved. It was also a European final won without key defender Eric Bailly, who was suspended, and 28-goal leading scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who sustained a serious knee injury in the quarter-final win against Anderlecht at Old Trafford. This video can not be played 'This is for Manchester' - Man Utd fans on emotional triumph Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino and Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp have received much praise for their work this season and getting into next season's Champions League - Mourinho has done that and added the actual tangible reward of two pieces of silverware on top. Mourinho's mood has often been dark this season but he still has that habit of dealing in his favourite currency, namely trophies. And the result means United can, finally, regard their season as a successful one as a night which started with a mixture of silence then applause for those who died in Monday's attack and ended with Wayne Rooney lifting the Europa League trophy on what is very likely to be his final appearance for the club. 5 live football daily - 'Mourinho has had an outstanding season' Watch: Neville celebrates Man Utd victory Paul Pogba scored his ninth goal of the season Pogba has struggled to justify the world-record transfer fee of Â£89m paid to Juventus last summer but this was a stage on which he showed flashes of the qualities that persuaded Mourinho to make him such a high-priority signing. Like this United side, there is still much to do before he can be regarded as the finished article but the manner in which he made sure early midfield dominance was secured was impressive and he added a goal for good measure. It may end up being classed as an own goal but Pogba will happily accept it, trying his luck from 20 yards after being afforded just a little too much space by Ajax captain Davy Klaassen and helped by a huge deflection off Davinson Sanchez. And perhaps he was due that touch of good fortune after being thwarted by the woodwork so often this season. And it was another profitable night for another big-money Mourinho buy, Mkhitaryan. The Armenian struggled in the first half but showed what a priceless poacher's instinct he has, swooping from close range for another Europa League goal. Ajax were appearing in their first European final since 1996 Ajax coach Peter Bosz said it would be understandable for his young side to feel nervous - and his fears were confirmed as they were never able to show off the full extent of their glittering promise. Six of the starting line-up were 21 or under in the youngest 11 to start a major European final, with an average age of 22 years and 280 days. In defender Matthijs de Ligt, they had the youngest player to feature in one at 17 years and 285 days. ""It was a boring game. There were no chances from both sides,"" Bosz said after the final whistle. ""I'm disappointed because you play finals to win them. We didn't. I haven't seen the Ajax that I'm used to."" This was a night of disappointment for this great, historic old club but they are staying true to their finest traditions by producing outstanding young talent and showing a commitment to attacking football. Ajax have established the foundations for more success. ""For all the players, this is the first final,"" he added. ""They will learn a lot from it and we will become stronger, and if we can keep this squad together we will be stronger next season, for sure."" Paul Pogba rejoined Manchester United last summer for a world record fee of Â£89m Paul Pogba scored in back-to-back games for United after a run of 19 games without one. It was the first time he had done so at club level since April 2016 for Juventus. Five of Henrikh Mkhitaryan's last six United goals have come in the Europa League. Jose Mourinho has won all four of his European finals as a manager, winning the 2003 Uefa Cup and 2004 Champions League with Porto, as well as the 2010 Champions League with Inter Milan. Mourinho has maintained his 100% win record against Ajax, winning all seven matches against the Dutch side. Late substitute Wayne Rooney made his fourth appearance in a major European final for Manchester United (also the 2008, 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals), equalling the record held by Ryan Giggs. United did not lose a single game this season in which they scored first (W37 D8). Marcus Rashford became the youngest Englishman - aged 19 years and 205 days - to start a major European final since Gary Mills in May 1980 for Nottingham Forest, who was aged 18 years and 198 days when he played against Hamburg.

Lipstick and dresses return to Mosul,"People living in the Iraqi city of Mosul, overrun by so-called Islamic State (IS) three years ago, have described a life of terror, with children killed for minor misdemeanours, public floggings and regular disappearances. Exclusive footage and testimony from the east of Iraq's second city, recaptured in January, reveals how the extremist group persecuted women and religious minorities and tried to control all aspects of people's lives. However, the videos also show how schools and cafes are reopening and shops restocking with previously banned products. Journalist Ghadi Sary captured the scenes after returning to the city three years afterexposing the brutality of life under ISin secretly-filmed videos for the BBC. While Iraqi security forces have reclaimed most of Mosul, part of the west remains under IS control. WARNING: This article contains disturbing details about violent acts. The videos, filmed in March on mobile phones, show how some aspects of women's lives are returning to normal, with shops starting to sell clothes and cosmetics once again. However, women living in the city describe how the legacy of IS rule remains. Mosul SYRIA IRAQ Fashion shop restocks women's goods Qadisiya Fashion shop restocks women's goods Qadisiya Mosul SYRIA IRAQ Baghdad IS Kurdish forces Mosul Mosul SYRIA Fashion shop restocks women's goods Qadisiya IRAQ Baghdad IS Kurdish forces Mosul This video can not be played Women regain some freedoms in Mosul Maha, 36, Al Zuhour neighbourhood:I will never forget that awful day and what happened to a little seven-year-old on our street. The girl had come down to the small neighbourhood shop to buy some sweets when IS militants approached her. The girl, chatting innocently to the old shop owner, was asked by the militants where her home was. She pointed it out before running and hiding. Her parents come to see what was going on and the IS fighters lectured them about how their daughter was violating Sharia law by being alone with the seller. Even this innocent young girl was not allowed to enjoy her childhood and go and buy sweets. Mosul from above: 360 aerial view Mosul: The story so far After a long debate, the fighters decided the girl's punishment was to be bitten or pinched in her face or on her hands by the women of the Hisba [the religious police], or the more adequately described ""monsters of Hisba"". The terrified mother begged them to punish her instead of her young daughter but there is no room for discussion with IS. The child was punished in front of her screaming mother. The monsters aggressively and repeatedly beat her and pinched her. The child was screaming until she passed out and her heart stopped. The wailing mother completely lost her mind when she saw her child die in front of her. The whole neighbourhood went mad in fear for our children after that day. Reem, 27, Al-hadbaa neighbourhood: My father was quite protective of us growing up, and during the two-and-a-half years of IS rule, he worried about where we were, so we were homebound for most of the time. It felt like living in prison all this time, and our outings we extremely rare. Once, I was walking down the street when I started stumbling because of the way our faces were constantly covered by black fabric. IS fighters saw me and started following me. This only made me run faster and stumble even more - like a prisoner escaping some death sentence. I managed to make it home that day, but that feeling never left me. I constantly have nightmares about being followed by those men, and I wake up completely terrified and exhausted. Even after liberation I still have those nightmares. Our lives under IS were empty and boring as we were locked in our homes. They shut down our universities and wrote on the front door: ""A woman's kingdom is her home"". Unnamed female resident:Schools, universities and education in general were the biggest losers of the dark rule of IS. Most of those institutions were shut down, and education under IS was focused on teaching jihad and combat techniques. Women and men were separated and women were told to completely cover up. Women suffered the most under IS as many had chosen to stay at home throughout all the years they had been controlling our city. The city itself was one large prison. Life for the city's residents was changed beyond recognition under IS. Footage reveals how the city's closed university was badly damaged. However, residents are trying to restart classes.

Hussein, 30, Al-Andalus neighbourhood:A year-and-a-half into the control of IS, they decided to ban satellite dishes. My father worried we would be severely punished if we were caught in possession of one at our home, so we had to remove it. But after several weeks of staying at home under almost total lockdown - we were left jobless and without any university or other activity since IS had taken over - we eventually grew bored and decided to set it up again. We did it in a way that was not obvious to those looking in from the street, by locating it on the roof behind some water tanks. A few days later, we heard loud knocking and yelling on our street and we knew the Hisba [religious police] had come, so I ran upstairs to dismantle the dish. As soon as I peeked my head out, I heard a voice shout, ""Come down we saw you"", and I realised they had agents peering in from higher rooftops. At that point some men knocked on our door and started dragging my father outside. I ran quickly and pushed them off. As a result, I was taken away along with many men from my neighbourhood. I was then locked up for nine sleepless nights. We rotated between standing and sitting in our overcrowded cell. I was then put in front of a judge who was younger than I was and clearly couldn't read or write. He sentenced me to be flogged 60 times. They asked me which part of my body I would choose, but I didn't understand the difference, so I said the upper part. They tied me down and started flogging the upper part of my body. Every time I screamed in pain they would start again from zero. It felt like an eternity until my ordeal ended. I felt my life was ending I was in so much pain. Tamarra, 25, English literature graduate:My father works for Iraqi intelligence and the last two years have been spent in full-on psychological war with IS. When we didn't leave Mosul, we started hiding within the city and my father was arrested on nine separate occasions. The first time they took him away for three days, which felt like three years. He was told by a judge that he was going to be put before a ""blood judge"" [an IS executioner], but they subjected him to immense torture and then released him. We were so happy when he was released. All was over, my dad was standing amongst us again. But they [IS militants] were back within days, and the disappointment returned as we lived another three nights of horror. At that time, we were all showing signs of depression. Our house was looted by IS and then it was bombed by international coalition air strikes. We had to move to the top floor of my uncle's neighbouring house. A few days later the door bell rang again, and when my young cousin Ahmed went to open the door, IS fighters grabbed him and asked him about my father's whereabouts. Ahmed told them he wasn't there, but they beat him up and climbed up the stairs to where we were. They threw my dad on the ground. The female religious police were cursing at us, even at my poor old grandmother in her wheelchair. One of the women in the religious police was being really violent to my grandmother. She strip-searched her and left her without clothes. They then took my father away. It has been months since I laid eyes on him. I have cried till my tears ran dry. The day that my father was longing for has happened. We were liberated, but he wasn't there to witness it. Ahmad, 28, Al-Arabi neighbourhood:I stopped going out. I was sick of seeing people punished all the time by IS. They made a point of rallying everyone whenever someone was punished, beaten or even beheaded. People were accused of all sorts of crimes - adultery, conspiring with security forces and other excuses they used to subdue people. I was already out of work by that point so I decided to stay at home. But only two days later the power went off and the neighbourhood back-up generator failed to kick in. I figured the guy in charge had forgotten to switch it on, so I decided to go and check it out. As I was leaving, my eight-year-old nephew decided to come along. He was also stuck at home because his school was closed. We didn't want him learning in the IS-controlled schools. As we approached the generator, I noticed many people had gathered around it, but I quickly spotted the IS fighters there too. They had forced the generator owner to shut it off, just so that people would come out and gather around and watch their heinous crimes. I regretted coming out that day and I blame myself for allowing my nephew to be exposed to the awful scenes that I know he will never forget. IS imposed strict controls over economic activity during their three-year rule. One grocery shop owner describes how he had to cover up faces and flags on products while the militants were in charge. Residents say images on baby milk and nappies also had to be hidden.

IS enforcers would set the type of goods traders were allowed to sell. The first thing they did was to ban the import of beef and chicken and forced everyone to rely on local produce. They also forbid men from trading in women's cosmetics and accessories. Those caught breaking that rule were flogged and fined. They also ensured that any wrappers that featured a man or a woman's face were covered. It was the same with pictures showing women's hair or babies. Even baby milk and nappies had to be covered up because of that. When news of the ""battle of liberation"" was announced, IS fighters were confused, and they intensified their harassment of people by raising prices and issuing tough rules. They even banned satellite dishes and started publishing their own audiovisual publications through their own channels. They were spreading rumours about their victories and their so called ""conquest"" of liberated cities. They were going door-to-door searching for mobile phones and having one was punishable by death. Churches and mosques have been destroyed by IS, as well as people's homes. Residents have spoken about how empty houses were looted - especially those belonging to Christians.

They used the furniture from some of the churches at some of their so-called media points, where they disseminated their propaganda. IS militants were looking all across town for empty houses to loot and where they could confiscate belongings, especially the houses of Christians who had fled the city. They also looted the houses of Muslims who had fled calling them apostates and seized their property. People tried to protect these houses by lodging members of their own family in them and pretending the houses were still occupied. One of my neighbours was given the key to his Christian friend's house before he fled town. One day, armed men showed up to confiscate the house, so my neighbour told them that this house is under his protection and safekeeping, and that if they [IS] respected the Prophet, they should respect the concept of protection. They let him be that day, but they kept coming back. Once they took him away to be flogged but he never yielded. He eventually convinced them he had bought the house for his son, and he kept it until the liberation, when he handed the key back to his friend who came to check on his house.

Whatâs in the Popeâs gift to Trump?,"In the Vatican early on 24 May, President Trump and Pope Francis met for the first time. To mark the occasion the pair exchanged gifts, and President Trump was given a copy of the pontiff's writings on the environment. Mr Trump received Pope Francis's seminal, 183-pageencyclical letter (a Papal document),external- published in June 2015 - on the subject of climate change. ""Well, I'll be reading them"", Mr Trump said. Reality Check has been looking into the Encyclical letter to find out what's inside. ""The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,"" wrote Pope Francis in the Encyclical 'Laudato Si'. The letter is a striking message of warning for the world to recognise the scientific consensus about the warming of the planet and blames humanity for rising temperatures: ""Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day."" He calls on those with the economic and political resources to take proactive measures to combat climate change and criticised those who ""seem mostly to be concerned with masking the problems or concealing their symptoms."" He goes on to urge political leaders to develop policies to ensure ""the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced."" Following the release of the letter, Pope Francis continued to make climate change a core issue of his papacy. Ahead of the Paris climate change summit in November 2015, the Pope told journalists that it was ""now or neverâ¦Every year the problems are getting worse."" ""Global warming hoaxsters"". Before his presidency, Trump expressed pride at his property empire's ""great"" environmental record which he said ""everybody would love"" according to theWashington Post,externalin 2011. In the White House, the president has vowed to promote clean air and clean water. But while the Pope has warned world leaders about the severe threat posed by climate change, Mr Trump has called it a ""hoax"". On Twitter in November 2012, the businessman blamed China, it seemed, for inventing global warming. ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."" In January 2014 another tweet read ""Any and all weather events are used by the GLOBAL WARMING HOAXSTERS to justify higher taxes to save our planet! They don't believe it $$$$!"" On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeated this view. ""I am not a great believer in man-made climate change"", he told the Washington Post in March 2016. After winning the election, Mr Trump has appeared to temper those views, and he told the New York Times he thought there was ""some connectivity"" between human activity and climate change and that he has an open mind on the subject. In March, Mr Trump signed an executive order that aims to review President Obama's signature plan to reduce carbon emissions and seeks to remove regulations which the president said holds back domestic energy production. Last year, Mr Trump promised to ""cancel"" the landmark Paris climate deal that aimed to reduce global carbon emissions, signed by President Obama. That decision has been put on hold until after the G7 meeting on 26 May, says the White House. Whether the US pulls out or not could send the biggest signal yet on how the Trump administration views climate change.

What can be done to make public spaces safe?,"Fans ran down stairs as they left the Manchester Arena after the explosion A suicide bomber haskilled 22 people and injured many more at a concert in the Manchester Arena. Is there any way of protecting crowded public spaces from terrorists? When counter-terrorism experts talk about protecting crowded places, they ask us to think about security as the rings of an onion. The centre of the onion is the target - perhaps a government building, military base, shopping centre or other public place. Around that are the rings of the onion - the obstacles and barriers that an attacker must first get past. The most obvious defences are physical ones: the bollards, gates and chicanes that can stopattackers intent on using vehicles. Unfortunately, if these are effective there is the potential that the threat will shift to easier targets, including crowded public spaces. A counter-terrorism lorry test seen by the BBC demonstrated the use of barriers In an attack such as the one on fans at the Ariana Grande concert, it can appear to be difficult to know how to offer protection. Where do you put a security perimeter to stop a suicide bomber who can just move to another location? While it is impossible to stop every attack, what happened at Manchester Arena demonstrates the importance of measures other than physical deterrents. A series of measures are already in place to try to keep our public spaces safe - the external layers of security. Bomber 'likely' not acting alone What we know about Manchester suspect Manchester attack: The next steps for police and MI5 One change intended to make attacks less likely is the introduction of strict controls on the sale of commonly available substances - including some fertilisers and chemicals - that can be used to make explosives. Certain chemicals and poisons can be bought only by individuals who have a licence. Counter-terrorism workers also offer shops and suppliersadvice to ensure that these materials are kept securely,external. There is alsoadvice for businesses,externalabout how to keep their staff and visitors safe. Simple solutions such as staff training, communication about security tools and security-minded organisational practices can significantly improve a business's ability to respond to terrorist attacks. This training is delivered across a range of organisations - including stadiums - under an initiative known asProject Argus,external. Businesses can work through terrorist scenarios in a series of phases, to allow staff to practise risk assessment and decision-making, and liaison with the emergency services. Other campaigns have encouraged businesses to get to know their customers - and to start asking questions if they have concerns. This approach demonstrated its effectiveness whenfive men involved in a bomb plot that could have killed hundreds,externalwere caught. Staff at a storage unit had raised concerns about why a single large bag of fertiliser was being stored and called in police, who swapped the fertiliser for cat litter. These policies and practices are incredibly effective, but individuals intent on terrorism can and do find ways round them. The fertiliser and chemicals used by the Norwegian far-right terroristAnders Breivikto make bombs that killed 77 people in 2012 were acquired legally because he ran a farm. The ability of terrorists to adapt their methods and target selection means the policies and practices that form the outer edges of our defences - the layers of the onion - must change as frequently and rapidly as terrorists change their methods. Counter-terrorism initiatives, such as theAct campaign,external- which stands for Action Counters Terrorism, and encourages people to report suspicious activity - assume that members of the public can play a critical part in helping to tackle the terrorist threat. Similarly, the British Transport Police campaignSee It, Say It, Sorted,externalencourages train passengers and station visitors to report anything unusual. The blast happened at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on Monday night This type of campaign has been proven to be effective. For example, a train passenger noticed that a man was watching a number of videos of explosions during her journey. She reported her concerns, and further investigation identified this individual as a threat to national security. Public information campaigns such as theRun, Hide, Tell film,externalcan also significantly improve people's awareness of what they should do if they ever have the misfortune of being caught up in an attack. Finally, it is important to recognise the rationale employed by terrorists when targeting public places. In carrying out these attacks, terrorists hope to create fear, uncertainty and outrage. They also want us to change our behaviour, to lose trust in the security services, the government and - ultimately - one another.

Why a $1.6bn car plant has been left to decay,"The skeletal structure is all that remains of Ford's factory plans Mexico is currently the world's fourth largest car exporter, but could US President Donald Trump's plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico bring this to an end? On the outskirts of the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, the skeletal remains of the partially constructed Ford plant loom over the desert. To the residents of the small towns surrounding the site it's a constant reminder of a failed economic promise. For Jose Puebla Ortiz, who sold his plot of land to Ford, it's still painful to think of the economic prosperity his family could have had. Mr Puebla Ortiz used the proceeds from the sale to buy a truck. He expected to work as a private contractor during the plant's construction, but since the company cancelled its plans he has struggled to find regular high-paying work. Jose Puebla Ortiz bought his truck with money from selling land to Ford ""When Ford arrived and we thought everything would be good... there was investment and there was money,"" he says. Now that investment has dried up. ""[Ford] decided to pull out and overnight they told us, 'it's over, we're not continuing, we're leaving, this is cancelled.' And, well, there was nothing we could do."" More stories from the BBC's global trade series looking at trade from an international perspective: 'You don't have to be a squillionaire to buy art' The slimming pills that put me in hospital How Scottish salmon conquered the world Read more global trade series here. In January, Ford announced it was cancelling plans to spend $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) building a factory in here in central Mexico. The company's chief executive at the time, Mark Fields, said the decision related to the declining sales of small cars the company was intending to build at the new plant. But he also admitted that Donald Trump's presidential victory and the ""improved business climate"" the company expected as a result was a factor. During the campaign and since assuming the presidency Mr Trump has expressed his anger at car companies such as GM and Toyota for using Mexican plants to build cars sold in the US. He has called forthe North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) to be renegotiated, blaming it for the loss of US jobs. The agreement - which came into effect between the US, Canada and Mexico in 1994 - created one of the world's largest free trade zones by reducing or eliminating tariffs on most products. Before taking office Donald Trump tweeted a threat targeting General Motors It is that kind of executive pressure that has residents here worried. ""It's because of [Donald Trump] that the plant wasn't made here - he said if he became president he'd take it away. He became president and he followed through,"" says Fidel Ribera, who had been working on the construction of the Ford plant. Fidel Rivera (second from left) and others who were construction workers on the Ford plant are now unemployed For many in San Luis Potosi, Mr Trump's presidency is seen as a real threat. But most economists, politicians and industry observers think his calls to pull out of or rework Nafta are all talk. ""There's a learning curve,"" says Eduardo Soliz Sanchez, head of Mexico's car trade body AMIA. He says the checks and balances in the US government, where the different branches of government hold equal authority and offset one another, and the interdependence of the car industry across the Nafta members will keep the deal alive. ""Someone should explain to Mr Trump,"" says Manuel Molano from the Mexican Competitiveness Institute. ""Maybe you started with an oil molecule in Mexico. That becomes some plastic [part] and goes up north to the US, and becomes a more sophisticated part of a car. [Then the piece] goes back south and becomes a motor, and then goes back up and becomes a complete car."" President Bill Clinton signed Nafta in 1994 On average car parts made in North America cross the US border to Mexico or Canada eight times. And that could mean that restricting Nafta or imposing border taxes on car parts made in the US's neighbours could cost American jobs. Mexican officials are betting the US won't shoot itself in the foot even as its new president tries to change his country's role in the global economy. It's a bet they can't afford to lose. The car sector makes up 6% of Mexico's gross domestic product and 25% of its exports. In just over 20 years Mexico has gone from a relatively insular economy to the fourth largest car exporter - behind Germany, South Korea and Japan. GM's San Luis Potosi plant is just a few kilometres from where Ford started to build its factory Economist Jonathan Heath says Nafta ""cemented"" the opening of Mexico's economy. ""That is when the auto industry started to flourish. Now almost every single carmaker in the world is present in Mexico,"" Mr Heath says. It is not just Nafta that has attracted companies such as BMW, Nissan and General Motors. Mexico has trade deals with 45 countries and its position on the US border, with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, makes it an ideal trading hub for carmakers. Mexico is the fourth largest car exporter behind Germany, South Korea and Japan But any changes to its deal with the US would still be a big blow. Mexico exported 77% of the cars it made to the US last year. Still AMIA head Mr Soliz Sanchez admits that after 23 years Nafta would benefit from being updated. He says his group, which represents Mexico's car and car parts makers, would be okay with ""deepening and modernising"" the trade agreement. Mexico's car industry has a lot to lose if trade with the US is damaged But for Mexicans who have benefited from its influence, changes to the deal pose a risk. ""We have people from the community here working in BMW, in General Motors,"" says Mr Ortiz. ""That's what we imagined with Ford - that there'd be a lot of work so there'd be enough for all the boys. But there's nothing we can do, this was cancelled. Ford was cancelled."" Mr Ortiz's village is thousands of miles from Washington DC, but the decisions and the rhetoric coming from the US is having a direct impact on him and his neighbours. While the car industry as a whole may not be turning its back on Mexico, the uncertainty is casting a shadow over the livelihoods of Mexicans that rely on the sector.

Trump's view of Europe creates uncertainty,"President Trump sees Europe as a place filled with cheaters and bedlam - and as a place populated by lovely people. Soon he'll be meeting with European leaders and will try to explain his contrasting views. What could go wrong? On Wednesday, Trump will spend his first full day in Europe as the US president. He's said so many different things about the place - sometimes he says he loves the continent and other times calls it a hellhole - that it's hard to know how things will go. One thing is certain: his schedule is packed. He'll visit Rome, the Vatican and Brussels on Wednesday, speaking on that day with Pope Francis and later in the evening with King Philippe of the Belgians. On Thursday he'll spend the day in Brussels, having lunch with President Emmanuel Macron of France and talking with European Union officials, then he heads to Sicily for a Group of Seven meeting. During his whirlwind tour of the continent, he'll speak with the Europeans about Nato and defence spending of various countries (he thinks they should make a bigger financial commitment to the alliance). This video can not be played Trump on first foreign trip as US President He'll also talk about US foreign policy and his vision for the nation's role on the global stage. Over the course of the trip he's likely to be preoccupied, however, with the recent controversies in Washington, including the sacking of the FBI director James Comey and his own relationship with Russian officials. His meetings in Europe could go well, or they could go very badly. So much depends upon his mood, say those who are close to him, and on the temperament of those who meet with him. Trump is a ""salesman"", said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of Italian studies and history at NYU, and for that reason he's likely to adjust his remarks to make the people around him happy - at least for the moment. Why has Trump been so harsh on Iran? Saudi deals kick off Trump foreign tour How will homebody Trump cope abroad? Trump-Russia scandal: How did we get here? His aides believe that one of the president's strengths is his ability to deal with people in the moment and adapt on the fly. They cast him as a dealmaker par excellence, closing a sale when the time is right (or abruptly upping the ante), and in this way justify the way that he's expressed so many, conflicting views of the continent. Michael S Smith, a terrorism analyst who has advised the US government, said: ""The biggest challenge he's going to face is managing relationships after sending so many mixed signals."" He's offered up odd, disjointed praise: ""Belgium is a beautiful city,"" he once said (he's also called Brussels ""a hellhole,external""). He seems to be fond of Scotland, the place where his mother was born. Still he's not exactly embraced local customs. Last year he visited a Scottish town with pubs where, as one of his travelling companions told me, ""They served rabbit."" So they drove to a town about 25 miles away with a McDonald's. It was another sign that he doesn't embrace European traditions and - sometimes at least - views them with distaste. On a more serious level he's said Nato is ""obsolete"" and then seemed to change his mind. He once described Germany as a ""total mess,external"", tweeting that the country ""owes vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!"" A joint press conference with Nato Secretary General Jens Stolenberg in April In his reckoning, the Europeans exploit trade deals. He's said the trade agreements are ""very unfair to the United States."" He's said he doesn't think the EU ""matters very much for the United States"", and he's described it as ""basically a vehicle for Germany"". He was elected in part because of his outspoken manner and his tough, uncompromising positions: he made it clear that America wasn't going to get pushed around - by the Europeans or anybody else - and that he'd focus on American interests. It's harder to act like a pit bull about American interests when you're talking to people who don't see them as their priority. Since taking office, he's tried to make amends with the Germans and the other Europeans who've visited the White House. More recently he's been advised to soften his tone while he's in Belgium and Italy, and to downplay his views about trade. This video can not be played Will Trump envy Pope's Vatican wall? Still he's not going to soft-pedal all of his views. George Mason University's Francis Buckley, who worked on a foreign-policy speech for Trump during the campaign, said Trump has made it clear Europeans must contribute more to Nato and believes, Buckley explained, ""that would have to be corrected"". Critics of the administration believe that the president has a dark view of Europe and has aligned himself with nationalist forces - and point to his generous assessment of authoritarian leaders in Russia and Turkey. In this way the president's views are, said Ben-Ghiat, ""destabilising"". Smith adds: ""The president has been posturing his intention to align the US with Russia in a manner that most people would consider stunning."" Smith said he hoped the president's travels through Europe would help to clarify his positions towards Nato, the EU and other institutions and dispel concerns about his intentions. Up to this point, Smith said: ""It's all been a fog of known unknowns.""

Gay couple's hopes for Taiwan marriage,"Jay Lin (l) and his partner Jona Chen with their twins Taiwan has just taken a major step towards increasing rights for lesbian and gay people. The top courthas ruled it is unconstitutionalto ban same-sex couples from getting married and legally registering those marriages. Parliament now has two years to amend the law, or same-sex couple will be able to marry under existing laws. Jay Lin and his partner are raising twin sons, conceived with the help of an egg donor and a surrogate mother. Jay, their biological father, told the BBC why a law change was important to him and his family. I believe the manifestation of love should not have different categories. I have seen so many gay couples in Taiwan who have been together for a long time, longer in fact than heterosexual couples. And these couples need these legal protection to get married. I've been with my partner, Jona, for four years. We're not married, but we hope to get married soon. Last year, my surrogate gave birth to my twins in the US. I brought the twins back to Taiwan when they were one month old. Since then, we've been doing everything parents would do with newborns: vaccines, bathing and feeding, introducing them to family and friends and adjusting our lives around them. I work but my partner has quit his job to take care of our kids. Yet when he's taking them to the doctor or nursery schools for instance, he gets immediately discredited as the non-parent. The problem is that I travel a lot for work, but there are certain things that happen to the boys that need a parent's approval, like medical procedures or school issues. If I'm not able to sign off or approve certain procedures then the new law would mean that my partner can be there to make those decisions. Knock on wood, nothing drastic has happened that has put us in a very difficult spot - so far it's mostly been things like doctor's visits or signing contracts to send them to school. But of course we want Jona to be recognised as the co-parent of these twins so that he has legal rights to them. Allowing gay couples to marry so they can qualify for adoption is also something that's important to me in terms of wanting to help gay couples who want to have children. I tried adoptions first in Taiwan, but was told by so many people, ""don't even bother, the social workers wouldn't think it's feasible"". Last year the number of adoptions in Taiwan was only around 300. If you include intra-family adoptions it's about 1,000. Half of the 300 kids adopted by non-family members went overseas, the other half stayed in Taiwan. And that shows there aren't a lot children being adopted by local heterosexual couples. So gay couples should be allowed to adopt and provide homes for these children. Surrogacy is costly, and you have to devote a lot of time to the whole process. There are an estimated 200 gay families registered with the Taiwan LGBT Family Rights Advocacy [these partnerships are not accepted as marriages by the state]. But that's an extremely low number. I'm sure there are thousands of such families, they're just not coming out to be recorded. Jay's parents are happy about their grandkids There are a lot of underreported cases of such gay partnerships and a lot of people don't know the option [of registering with the advocacy group]. We'd like to have this law passed earlier rather than later. The president will be campaigning for re-election in 2018; issues like this will be sidelined. The entire goal for a lot of people is to harness all this energy to have something happen by the end of June. Reporting by the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei.

Why Venezuelan parents keep children at home,"Andrew PÃ¡ez and his wife Sara YÃ©pez are not sending Manuel and Mathias to school Venezuela is gripped by an ever-deepening economic and political crisis that has triggered almost daily anti-government protests since April. Triple-digit inflation, a high crime rate and clashes between protesters and security forces have affected the lives of many, including schoolchildren. ""We're not living in normal times,"" says former professional football player Andrew PÃ¡ez, 48, who has decided to keep his two sons at home. Manuel, 12, and Mathias, 10, have not been to school since 19 April. ""Our priority at this point is to keep them safe,"" Mr PÃ¡ez says. Mathias and Manuel attend La Salle Education Centre, a private school run by the Christian Brothers Catholic religious order in the western town of MÃ©rida. On that day, director Javier RamÃ­rez tells me, the school was closed for independence day, but he was in his office doing some grading. Javier RamÃ­rez was doing some grading when protesters took refuge in the school Outside, anti-government protesters were marching. When Mr RamÃ­rez heard some noise and went to investigate, he found a group of about 40 demonstrators had taken shelter inside the school after police had tried to disperse them. Some of them had been injured. Inside Venezuela's anti-government protests 'I begged my son not to go and protest' Why Venezuela's crisis is likely to get worse What's behind the turmoil? Mr RamÃ­rez called the local emergency services, who took away those too badly wounded to walk, and then he asked the remaining protesters to leave, which they did peacefully. Not long after, however, a group of six people forced the locks on the main gate and broke into the school grounds on motorcycles. Brother Freddy, one of the Christian Brothers teaching at the school, lives in a house on the grounds. Brother Freddy was threatened by members of a motorcycle gang After helping tend to the wounded protesters, Brother Freddy returned to the house. There he was with his sister, a school administrator, and her husband, when the motorcycle gang broke through the main gate. ""Some were masked, others not, some had weapons such as bats, others did not,"" Brother Freddy recalls. ""They broke the windows of all the cars parked here and ripped out their radios and sound systems, bashing the cars as they went."" The gang broke down the doors of the building where the Brothers live While the gang broke down the door, Brother Freddy and three other people took refuge at the top of the stairs ""Not satisfied with that, they broke down the door to the house, smashing everything in their way."" ""It was terrible. I thought, when they get to us they're going to give us a bashing, too,"" Brother Freddy says. ""I was standing on the top of the stairs, with my hands in the air and my eyes closed as two of them came up the stairs."" The gang took all the food it could and destroyed things they could not carry with them The two told Brother Freddy to hand over his phone, which he did, and then one of them gave a signal and they all left. ""They took everything, all the food, and what they couldn't take they destroyed, such as the microwave. ""They even overturned the pots with the plants!"" Brother Freddy is convinced that the group was organised and suspects that its members were part of a ""colectivo"", the name given to pro-government militant groups. Clashes between anti-government marchers and colectivos are not unusual at marches. Mr RamÃ­rez thinks the intruders may have been searching for the protesters who had earlier taken shelter in the school, and that when they did not find them they went on the rampage. The building where the Christian Brothers live is still being repaired after vandals damaged it He reported the incident to the authorities and police are investigating. The mayor's office sent three guards to protect the school in the aftermath of the attack and while the main gate was being fixed. The school re-opened on 24 April. Classes have restarted but on the best of days only 60% of students turn up But Mr Ramirez says that at least 40% of the school's 704 students are not attending class out of fear a similar incident could happen again. Manuel and Mathias are among those being kept at home. Manuel says he was very sad when he heard about what had happened. ""How can it be that someone would attack a school just because it sheltered some people?"" he asks. A keen footballer like his father, he has been using his free time to train. His younger brother Mathias is also fed up with the situation in Venezuela. ""It's been two years since I've had any Nutella,"" he says of the shortages of imported goods. Their mother, Sara YÃ©pez, says she just does not want to run the risk of them getting hurt in school or on the way there. Sara YÃ©pez says it is time to stop carrying on as normal But it is not just that, she says. Like her husband, Andrew PÃ¡ez, she believes that the situation in Venezuela has deteriorated so much, drastic measures are called for. ""Normal life has ceased, and if we want our children to have the opportunities they once had, we need to stop carrying on as normal,"" she says. ""And if that means that our children may have to repeat a year, so be it."" ""At any moment you can get hurt, you can get robbed and your salary does not cover the basics, even if you can find them,"" she says of Venezuela's rampant crime rate and its hyperinflation. Lina Contreras, an independent business woman who has a 17-year-old son at La Salle school, agrees. Lina Contreras says children will be affected by missing class but it is a sacrifice she is willing to make ""We want to send a message to the country that we can't send our kids to school when other young people are giving their lives on the streets,"" she says referring to the protest in which dozens of people have been killed over the past weeks. Andrew PÃ¡ez says that what his sons are missing out on in terms of schooling is made up for by what they are learning as individuals. ""Ethics and values are more important at this point,"" he says. They also try to ensure that the children keep up with the curriculum. After teaching mechanical engineering at the University of the Andes, Sara YÃ©pez rushes home to sit down and study with Manuel and Mathias. They say they are lucky to have someone to help them look after them when they are both at work. As owners of their own company, Lina Contreras and her husband have also been able to adapt their schedule enough to make sure someone is there for their son at key times. All three say it is a sacrifice they are willing to make. Not all parents agree with the stand Lina Contreras, Andrew PÃ¡ez and Sara YÃ©pez are taking. More than half are sending their children to La Salle whenever the roads around the school are not blocked by protests, not wanting them to miss out on their schooling. These days, the school yard is rather empty Others just do not have anyone who can look after them while they are at work. But they, too, are worried by the security situation and many have had to leave work to collect their children from school early when a march passed nearby. With no end to the protests in sight, Andrew PÃ¡ez and Sara YÃ©pez say they may have to consider leaving Venezuela altogether, as 17 of their nieces and nephews have already done. Lina Contreras says she is optimistic that the protests will bring about a change of government and that her son may be able to graduate this year as planned.

It's been a hugely eventful and emotional week in Manchester, and in Stockholm, but it ends with Manchester United back in the Champions League and with another trophy back in their cabinet. Thanks as ever for all of your company. Good night one and all. Ajax 0-2 Manchester United Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera: ""I want to dedicate this trophy to the victims. This is just football and
what happened two days ago was horrible. ""We want peace in the world, a normal world with respect. We are just
football players but we have an audience so we just want to see everyone work
together for a normal world. This happened in Manchester but everywhere we want
to see a united world and fight for peace, respect in the world - no more
attack and no more deaths please."" Ajax 0-2 Manchester United Robbie SavageEx-Leicester City & Wales midfielder in Stockholm âI think the club needs at least four or five players. If David De Gea goes
then you need a new keeper, even though Romero has done nothing wrong. ""You need a full back and a centre-back to go alongside
Bailly, who has been brilliant this season. ""If Carrick goes you
need another creative midfielder and if Zlatan Ibrahimovic goes then you need a
striker. ""You wonder if Marcus Rashford is good enough to be the
number nine, he is a huge talent but does he score enough goals? I think you
need another striker for him to play with."" Ajax 0-2 Manchester United Ajax 0-2 Manchester United Phil NevilleFormer Manchester United defender on Radio 5 live It's been a wonderful evening.

Ajax v Manchester United,"Manchester United have now won all three of Europe's major competitions Manchester United claimed their second major trophy of the season and secured Champions League football as they overcame Ajax to win the Europa League final in Stockholm. On an emotional night following the attack which killed 22 people at Ariana Grande's concert at the Manchester Arena on Monday, United's fans were allowed a measure of celebration as Jose Mourinho's side won in comfort. Paul Pogba's deflected shot put them ahead in the 18th minute and Henrikh Mkhitaryan's sixth Europa League goal of the campaign, flicked in from Chris Smalling's header at a corner, confirmed they would add to the EFL Cup won against Southampton earlier this season. Wayne Rooney made a brief appearance as a substitute with a minute left and the game won, being handed the captain's armband by Antonio Valencia on what could well be his farewell appearance for United. And as the final whistle sounded and United's celebrations began, chants of ""Manchester"" rang around the Friends Arena in tribute to those who died and were injured in the attack which cast a shadow over this showpiece occasion. Mourinho - who has so often looked so unhappy this season - ran on to the field to celebrate with his players and was thrown in the air by his coaching staff and hugged by his son. It means United are now the fifth team to claim the full quota of European trophies, joining an illustrious list with Ajax, Chelsea, Juventus and Bayern Munich. Herrera dedicates trophy to victims Relive Manchester United's Europa League victory over Ajax Listen to Mark Chapman's emotional tribute to Manchester on 5 live How the Man Utd players rated Jose Mourinho has now won four major European trophies Mourinho has had his moments of frustration this season - especially with 15 Premier League draws that led to an unsatisfactory sixth-place finish. It left United's Champions League hopes resting on this game but the win and subsequent qualification for the group stages of Europe's elite tournament means that Mourinho can regard this season as a real success. Some may question the quality of United's performances and this undoubtedly remains a work in progress but two trophies and that place back in the Champions League is an impressive outcome, irrespective of the style in which it was achieved. It was also a European final won without key defender Eric Bailly, who was suspended, and 28-goal leading scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who sustained a serious knee injury in the quarter-final win against Anderlecht at Old Trafford. This video can not be played 'This is for Manchester' - Man Utd fans on emotional triumph Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino and Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp have received much praise for their work this season and getting into next season's Champions League - Mourinho has done that and added the actual tangible reward of two pieces of silverware on top. Mourinho's mood has often been dark this season but he still has that habit of dealing in his favourite currency, namely trophies. And the result means United can, finally, regard their season as a successful one as a night which started with a mixture of silence then applause for those who died in Monday's attack and ended with Wayne Rooney lifting the Europa League trophy on what is very likely to be his final appearance for the club. 5 live football daily - 'Mourinho has had an outstanding season' Watch: Neville celebrates Man Utd victory Paul Pogba scored his ninth goal of the season Pogba has struggled to justify the world-record transfer fee of Â£89m paid to Juventus last summer but this was a stage on which he showed flashes of the qualities that persuaded Mourinho to make him such a high-priority signing. Like this United side, there is still much to do before he can be regarded as the finished article but the manner in which he made sure early midfield dominance was secured was impressive and he added a goal for good measure. It may end up being classed as an own goal but Pogba will happily accept it, trying his luck from 20 yards after being afforded just a little too much space by Ajax captain Davy Klaassen and helped by a huge deflection off Davinson Sanchez. And perhaps he was due that touch of good fortune after being thwarted by the woodwork so often this season. And it was another profitable night for another big-money Mourinho buy, Mkhitaryan. The Armenian struggled in the first half but showed what a priceless poacher's instinct he has, swooping from close range for another Europa League goal. Ajax were appearing in their first European final since 1996 Ajax coach Peter Bosz said it would be understandable for his young side to feel nervous - and his fears were confirmed as they were never able to show off the full extent of their glittering promise. Six of the starting line-up were 21 or under in the youngest 11 to start a major European final, with an average age of 22 years and 280 days. In defender Matthijs de Ligt, they had the youngest player to feature in one at 17 years and 285 days. ""It was a boring game. There were no chances from both sides,"" Bosz said after the final whistle. ""I'm disappointed because you play finals to win them. We didn't. I haven't seen the Ajax that I'm used to."" This was a night of disappointment for this great, historic old club but they are staying true to their finest traditions by producing outstanding young talent and showing a commitment to attacking football. Ajax have established the foundations for more success. ""For all the players, this is the first final,"" he added. ""They will learn a lot from it and we will become stronger, and if we can keep this squad together we will be stronger next season, for sure."" Paul Pogba rejoined Manchester United last summer for a world record fee of Â£89m Paul Pogba scored in back-to-back games for United after a run of 19 games without one. It was the first time he had done so at club level since April 2016 for Juventus. Five of Henrikh Mkhitaryan's last six United goals have come in the Europa League. Jose Mourinho has won all four of his European finals as a manager, winning the 2003 Uefa Cup and 2004 Champions League with Porto, as well as the 2010 Champions League with Inter Milan. Mourinho has maintained his 100% win record against Ajax, winning all seven matches against the Dutch side. Late substitute Wayne Rooney made his fourth appearance in a major European final for Manchester United (also the 2008, 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals), equalling the record held by Ryan Giggs. United did not lose a single game this season in which they scored first (W37 D8). Marcus Rashford became the youngest Englishman - aged 19 years and 205 days - to start a major European final since Gary Mills in May 1980 for Nottingham Forest, who was aged 18 years and 198 days when he played against Hamburg.

"Super-yachts, gaudy glamour & raw racing","Forget sitting in the grandstand, in Monaco a hot-tub view of the race is the way to go Monaco Grand Prix on the BBC Date:25-28 MayVenue:Circuit de Monaco Coverage:Practice on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra (final practice online only). Qualifying and race on BBC Radio 5 live. Live text commentary, leaderboard and imagery on BBC Sport website and app. No matter how many times you have seen it, the sheer preposterousness of it never fails to strike you. Here are the racing cars that less than two weeks ago were rounding Barcelona's Turn Three at 160mph, and soon will be swooping through Eau Rouge at Spa at close to 200mph, being driven on the limit through streets barely wide enough for a Rolls-Royce. A Rolls-Royce - or a Lamborghini or a Ferrari or any other material symbol-on-wheels of the global uber-rich - is the more 'normal' transport for a trip around the roads of this Mediterranean principality that combines glamour and seediness like perhaps nowhere else on earth. The glamour; everyone knows about that - the weather, the boats, the cars, the beautiful people, the lovely Beaux-Arts villas clinging precipitously to the hillsides. Fans watch 'Mr Monaco' Graham Hill cruise by as he wins the 1965 grand prix The seediness? Well, Somerset Maugham's observation a century ago that Monaco was a ""sunny place for shady people"" still applies. Although the conspicuous consumption has grown notably more conspicuous. The yachts have become super-yachts - some so big they don't fit in the original harbour and resemble floating buildings rather than pleasure cruisers. The elegant villas are in danger of being swamped by modern skyscrapers. And every year there seem to be more supercars crawling around the streets. Whatever one's feelings about this, though, they are apt to evaporate for a time when the Formula 1 cars go out on track. Watch at Casino Square or in the tunnel or at Tabac or Piscine and the violence and awe involved in an F1 car on the limit around the streets takes your breath away. It is F1 at its most raw, the incredible skill of the drivers and performance of the cars forcing a recalibration of one's sense of the possible. And an experience not to be missed. BBC Sport's chief F1 writer Andrew Benson ""Come on mate don't neck it all!"" Lewis Hamilton shares his 2016 win with Justin Bieber From 1984 to 1993, the race was won by only two drivers: Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. Senna's record of six wins still stands In 2016, lunch on race day at the exquisite Salle Empire terrace would have set you back an eye-watering 1,400 euros. You cannot even see the cars from there! Hamilton was impressing the fans on his motorbike in the paddock... ...while Massa went for a scooter instead Some people say its a true driver's circuit, but three-time world champion Nelson Piquet was not a fan. ""Tell you the truth, I hate Monaco,"" he said. ""It's like riding a bicycle around your living room."" Who says F1 livery needs to be bright and bold?

Right for final to go ahead - police,"Manchester United players inspected the pitch at the Friends Arena on Tuesday Police say it is right for Wednesday's Europa League final between Manchester United and Ajax to go ahead, but postponing the game was discussed after Monday's Manchester Arena attack. ""Very quickly a decision was taken the game would go on,"" said Greater Manchester Police's John O'Hare. The chief superintendent anticipates a ""poignant"" occasion in Stockholm. The UK terror threat level has been raised to itshighest levelfollowing the bombing, which killed 22 people. Asked if postponing the match had been considered, O'Hare told the BBC: ""That would have been discussed, but the whole rhetoric that has got to come out is terrorism can't win. We can't stop doing the things we enjoy and nourish our lives."" He said Uefa, European football's governing body, had ""changed some of the planning to be a bit more respectful and poignant"". O'Hare added some potential trouble-making supporters from both sides had been identified, and details passed on to Swedish police. ""You would like to think the events in Manchester would make people think twice about wanting to cause trouble and put things in perspective,"" he said.

A minute's silence will be observed before the final in Stockholm, and both teams will wear black armbands. The opening ceremony will also be considerably reduced as a mark of respect for the victims. ""Success tonight is nothing compared to the pain and suffering back home,"" Woodward told MUTV.

""I think it's very difficult to think about football."" Former United defenderPhil Neville,who is in Stockholm working for BBC Radio 5 live, said the club's home-grown players will find it particularly ""difficult"". ""When I was told I'd be working on this match, it felt like it was Christmas Day,"" said the 40-year-old. ""But I don't want to be at this game now, I want to be in Manchester. ""Players like Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard - they've been brought up in this city. Paul Pogba was brought up in the city from the age of 14. They will find if difficult.

Rio Ferdinand,a former England and United team-mate, said the match was a chance for players""to show Manchester solidarity"". He told 5 live: ""Playing after such an unforgiving and devastating act, I don't think it matters whether you're a red or you're a blue, you want these guys to go out and represent Manchester and show the togetherness this city has got. ""It will dawn on the players after that this is such a huge game not only for Manchester United Football Club but also for a player to show they can bring a community, a city, a country together by playing and showing that whatever goes on they will go out there and perform to the best of their ability."" BBC sports news correspondent Andy Swiss, who is also in Stockholm, said there will be 1,200 police on duty around the 50,000-capacity Friends Arena, although there is no specific intelligence of any threat. Manchester United fans with a banner outside the Friends Arena in Stockholm United were given 9,500 tickets for the final, although more fans are expected in Stockholm for Wednesday's match. Several told BBC Radio 5 live it was a subdued atmosphere. One supporter said: ""I don't want to be here, I didn't want to come. I've been getting messages all day: 'Look after yourself.' But it's them who have been targeted - it's Manchester, not Stockholm."" Another said: ""We can't get drunk, enjoy ourselves, take pictures of ourselves enjoying ourselves in nice scenery and send them back home to Manchester. We can't do that. The whole mood's absolutely flattened."" One fan said the atmosphere at the airport was ""like we'd already lost"", adding: ""There's lads I have known for years who are absolute jokers who were sat there so quiet. It's so sombre. We've got to win this now for the people of Manchester. I live near the Arena and was woken up by the sirens. It's heartbreaking."" Another said: ""Football does become secondary but what we won't do is fall to these people. All we can say is our thoughts are with these families. We'll get behind our team, and when the game's finished, our thoughts will turn back to these people.""

""We have a job to do and we will fly to Sweden to do that job. It is a pity we cannot fly with the happiness that we always have before a big game. ""I know, even during my short time here, that the people of Manchester will pull together as one.""

British sprinter Asha Philip, the European indoor 60m champion, is due to compete in the 100m and hopes the public comes out to watch. ""What can you do? We can't live our lives in fear. It's always going to be in the back of my mind, but we know it can happen anywhere,"" she said. A decision is expected on Wednesday on whether the Great Manchester Run, which features Europe's largest 10km run and a separate half-marathon, will go ahead on Sunday. Meanwhile, South African cricketers are said to be ""uneasy"" as they prepare for aone-day internationalagainst England at Headingley on Wednesday. The teams will wear black armbands as a mark of respect to those killed in the bombing, with a minute's silence observed shortly before the 14:00 BST start. There will also be an increased police presence inside and outside the stadium. South Africa team manager Mohammed Moosajee said: ""As you can understand we have some genuine concerns, there was a lot of chatter during breakfast. ""I am happy to say we've had constant communications from the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) and their security manager. ""There have been guarantees put in place that security arrangements will be supplemented. We're told there will be more visible police at the stadium, at practice sessions as well as the hotels we will reside at.""

Wembley Stadium will host theFA Cup finalbetween Arsenal and Chelsea on Saturday. The arena's arch was lit red, white and blue overnight, with ""For Manchester"" written on its giant screens.

attack at the MEN Arena and put tonight's game in perspective as he said:

affected."" Football Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel has been talking to BBC Sport about Monday's attack at the Manchester Arena, which killed 22 people. ""Itâs been a really tragic event, itâs very, very sad and
heart-breaking, something that is difficult to comprehend,"" said Schmeichel. ""We live in a world
where these attacks happen quite often, too often, but this time they attacked
children and I just canât get my head around that, itâs really really sad. ""So yesterday, the day before, and days to come,
are very sad days for Manchester and England and everyone, but I have to say â
I was in Manchester yesterday, it was also a very beautiful day, to see how the
Mancunians got together, a cross of beliefs, religion, social status,
lifestyle, and held each other and I was very, very proud to be a part of the

Wenger unsure if final will be last game,"Wenger has led Arsenal to six FA Cup titles since joining the club as manager in 1996 Arsene Wenger ""does not know"" if Saturday's FA Cup final will be his last match as Arsenal manager. The Frenchman, whose future will be decided ata board meeting after the game,has been Gunners boss since 1996 but his contract expires this summer. On Sunday he said uncertainty over his futuredid affect the club's form this season,but he again refused to expand further before the match with Chelsea. ""I want to win the cup for my club and that's all I care about,"" he said. ""Would it be a nice farewell? No, what I want is to win the next game. It's not about me, it's about us winning the trophy and giving everything to achieve it."" Wenger has won three Premier League titles and six FA Cup finals during two decades at the north London club, but this season he has faced fierce protests from fans calling for him to quit. By finishing fifth in the Premier League, the Gunners failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years. Gabriel and Koscielny out of FA Cup final Arsenal are not for sale - Kroenke Should Arsenal win Saturday's match at Wembley, Wenger will claim his seventh FA Cup - matching the number of times Liverpool and Chelsea have won it in their entire history. When asked on Wednesday if it would be his last game as Gunners boss he replied: ""I don't know. It will not be my last match anyway because I will stay in football. ""I want to win the cup because I think the team has redressed very well the situation on the sporting side. It would be a good crowning of what we have done in the last two months."" Chelsea won the Premier League this season - the fifth time they have done so under the ownership of billionaire Roman Abramovich, who has spent heavily since taking control in 2003. Blues boss Antonio Conte is reportedly to be grantedÂ£200m to spend,externalon new players this summer. Following the news of Alisher Usmanov's failedÂ£1bn takeoverbid Wenger was asked about Arsenal's comparative financial power. ""It's not all about money, football,"" he said. ""It is important but it's not everything. I guided this club for years with very limited resources, I had to always sell our best players. ""Some clubs are stronger than us yes, but now I believe we are in a position to compete and we have a strong enough basic squad to compete at the top level."" Mertesacker played 37 minutes of Arsenal's 3-1 win over Everton last Sunday Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker ""cannot tell"" whether Wenger will still be in charge at the Emirates next season, but says the Gunners ""are lucky to have him"". ""That was always my mindset when I came here,"" he added. ""I was so happy to have him. He trusted me a lot. ""Short-term, we are just thrilled to be in that final with our manager."" Mertesacker has only made one substitute appearance this season, with the 32-year-old suffering from a knee injury. However, he could start in the FA Cup final against Chelsea on Saturday with defenders Laurent Koscielny suspended, Gabriel Paulista injured and Shkodran Mustafi battling to overcome illness. ""I haven't played this year. But I have done this for 15 years so I expect myself to be absolutely ready no matter what comes,"" said the former Germany international. ""That is my mindset, no matter what happens or what is facing me on Saturday, I am going to go for it. I owe this to this team and to this club.""
