O'Sullivan out of World Championship,"This video can not be played Ding conquers O'Sullivan in thriller Venue:The Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:15 April - 1 May Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC Red Button, Connected TVs, online and app. Five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan has been knocked out of the World Championship, losing 13-10 to China's Ding Junhui in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan's tournament had been overshadowed by his claims that he had been bullied by snooker bosses. But he seemed unaffected by the controversy as he scored a tournament-high break of 146 to win three from four frames and get back to 11-9, having trailed 10-6. The pair then shared the next two frames and Ding held his nerve, scoring a classy 117 to earn a semi-final place againstMark Selby. Tournament schedule BBC coverage times This video can not be played O'Sullivan makes 'absolutely incredible' 146 break Selby was in sensational form to thrash Marco Fu 13-3. The reigning champion scored 139 and 143 but it was no surprise the latter mark was beaten by O'Sullivan in a match that featured five centuries and 18 breaks of more than 50. Only one of the 23 frames did not include a half-century. O'Sullivan, 41, who hugged his equally emotional opponent at the end, said: ""It was a fantastic match and I am really pleased to be involved. I really enjoyed it. I would rather lose a good match than win an awful one. ""Ding is a special lad, a beautiful guy. He is all good; he doesn't have a bad bone in his body. ""He wants to win this title so bad. He is in a great place and I wish him all the best."" Six-time world champion Steve Davis on BBC Two: O'Sullivan gave opponent Ding a warm embrace after the match In the same way boxers collapse into each other's arms at the end and say, 'you are a great player'. That moment was very similar, regardless of whether it was a physical contest or not, it was the same mentality. For all of the times when Ronnie O'Sullivan throws teddies out of the pram, players appreciate other great players. From Ding Junhui's perspective, getting to the final last year was a massive stepping stone. This is another part of the jigsaw puzzle and unlocks the World Championship a little further for him. Ding has always been clinical in among the balls and he looks very strong in that department, but beating Liang Wenbo from behind, showing heart and determination, and now beating O'Sullivan, he has answered a lot of questions at the Crucible that he has not answered before. It is a bit like a video game for Ding, he has beaten the boss but now has to go to the next level to face a bigger boss - Mark Selby. Facing the world champion will be a bigger hurdle mentally and we cannot say how it will pan out. Selby has looked astonishing so far, if Ding beats him, then he has to play someone great in the final. He is only halfway through in sessions played. Ding, last season's runner-up, is looking to become the first Asian player to lift the world title, and said he ""played great"". ""I kept my form from the first frame to the last frame and I put him under pressure,"" Ding said. ""I do not have a good record against him but every time I had a chance I did well. He was not in his best form but he is still good enough. ""Ronnie said I looked a different player and I looked stronger. I thank him. To beat him you have to work hard. I am more confident."" A spirited O'Sullivan comeback  before the mid-session break kept alive hopes of him claiming a sixth World Championship title. The Englishman had won a crucial final frame on Tuesday with a blistering century inside four minutes and, after taking scrappy opener, a rapid break of 97 made it three in a row to cut the gap to 10-8. But Ding, who has often been accused of crumbling under pressure, responded with a fine 69. O'Sullivan was in full flow, turning down the chance of a maximum by going for a pink rather than a slightly trickier black during a magnificent 146. Only Mark Allen and Graeme Dott have ever managed a 146 at the Crucible but neither did so in the seven minutes and 32 seconds it took O'Sullivan to clear up and reduce the gap to two frames. But Ding, 30, kept his opponent at bay in the closing stages with breaks of 87, 63 and 117 to win two of the final three frames and get over the line. Barry HawkinsbeatStephen Maguire13-9 to reach the last four, having made breaks of 126, 98 and 86 in the match. The 2013 finalist facesfour-time championJohn Higgins next.

Is Joshua the perfect heavyweight?,"This video can not be played Joshua has left 'no stone unturned' for Klitschko fight Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko Date:Saturday, 29 AprilVenue:Wembley StadiumTime:22:00 BST Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live from 21:00 BST and text updates on the BBC Sport website and app from 20:00 BST. A crowd of 90,000 around the ring at Wembley, a million more on pay-per-view at home, an opponent who has been in more world title fights than he has professional bouts. Little about Saturday's heavyweight showdown with Wladimir Klitschko should leave Anthony Joshua as unnaturally calm as he appears to be. But the kid from Watford turned IBF world champion stands in a sweet eddy in his division's turbulent waters - the past all promise, the future more auspicious still. Heavyweight boxing is so often about hope and hype above authenticity, delusion rather than cold reality. Punters come back not because so many title fights prove unforgettable, but for the promise that the next really will be - repeat experiences of disappointing champions, meaningless titles and badly made matches pushed away by the beguiling possibility of what might yet lie ahead. Joshua - 18 fights and less than a cumulative two ring hours into a professional career that followed hard on a late start and rapid progression - goes to Wembley defined by the same heady mix of promise and possibility: that at 27 he has too much speed and power for the 41-year-old Klitschko, that his rapid improvement will continue at the same steep pace, that he could yet prove the perfect heavyweight at an imperfect time for the most captivating class of all. For the Joshua of today - hours before the biggest test of his sporting life - appears to have everything the archetypal champion should possess. Ali? Lewis? Klitschko? Which heavyweight great are you? Klitschko fight a whole new level - Joshua Joshua v Klitschko preview - BBC Radio 5 live podcast Gold in London 2012: The judges scored the super-heavyweight final with Italy's Roberto Cammarelle 18-18 with Joshua winning on countback There is his physique: big without being bulky, powerful but explosive, a little reminiscent of Ken Norton through his mid-70s trilogy with Muhammad Ali. There is the back story: just the right amount of jeopardy, on remand in Reading prison and later caught in possession of eight ounces of cannabis, before a classical conversion to boxing via a dedicated cousin and grassroots coach, winning the last homegold medalof Great Britain's historic haul on the very last day of the 2012 Olympics. There is the unpretentiousness of a man who still lives much of the time with his mother, Yeta, in Golders Green, north London. He has prepared for Saturday night with a three-month training camp at the same unglamorous English Institute of Sport in Sheffield that was both home to fellow Olympic champion Dame Jess Ennis-Hill and where he trained under coach Rob McCracken in the build-up to those London Games. There is enough easy charisma to attract both boxing acolytes and cynics, enough charm to stop for every selfie without making it look like a conscious exercise in personal marketing, sufficient understanding of where he has come from to recently gift that first coach at the Finchley & District Amateur Boxing Club, Sean Murphy, a brand new BMW with personalised plates. This video can not be played What a gesture - Joshua surprises coach with a car And there are the knockouts. Eighteen in 18 pro fights, 13 of them inside the first three rounds. People don't pay big money for heavyweight fights to see them go the distance. Nobody turned up to watch Mike Tyson look technically neat for 12 rounds. Lots have decried Klitschko for his sensible strategies. They go to see it end as quickly as possible, the sudden termination worth more than a drawn-out dance. It is the only sport where punters are more satisfied the less they see. As Joshua said when bumping into a beaming Jose Mourinho backstage at the O2 arena a year ago after taking the IBF heavyweight title from Charles Martin with a second-round knockout: ""People want to see blood, uh?"" That was the first fight Mourinho had ever been to - another illustration of Joshua's rare draw, with the Manchester United manager's star-struck grin one more. Joshua looked as relaxed as if he was shaking hands with a steward, his composure as unbroken as it had been in the ring. All possibilities, all promises. All pointers to a special future and a place amongst the elite. And yet so little of it can be guaranteed this early in his entry into a brutal business, not when the challenges will keep coming in different shapes and guises both on Saturday and beyond. Klitschko bout perfect time for Joshua - Lewis 'Father Time has caught up with Klitschko' Delivering the knockout blow against Eric Molina to successfully defend his IBF heavyweight title in 2016 There is no obvious nastiness about Joshua, his behaviour in the build-up to this fight is in contrast to that of fellow BritonsDavid HayeandTyson Furyin their own battles with Klitschko. In traditional boxing parlance that is a flaw rather than a strength. Villains sell tickets. Bad guys get paid to be bad. When you've sold 90,000 tickets on the appeal of your other attributes that may be less of a worry than it would be for other fighters. But there are still great unknowns amid the allure. How might a man who didn't box until after his 18th birthday fare against an opponent who has been fighting in front of stadium sellouts for decades? How will a kid who was seven years old when Klitschko made his professional debut cope with an atmosphere that British boxing has never seen before? Age gap: Klitschko on his way to winning gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics - when Joshua was only six years old Klitschko is now 41 years old. He was soundly beaten by Fury and hasn't fought in the 16 months since. But he has held all three world titles and lost only four out of 68 professional fights. When Joshua last felt real pressure - in his grudge match againstDillian Whyte- the composure sometimes slipped. In his rush to finish it, he was almost finished himself. ""There is a chance that Josh could be completely out of his depth,"" says his promoter Eddie Hearn, before adding: ""And there is a chance he could be the fighter we believe he is, and he goes out there and dismantles Klitschko. No-one really knows - and that's the beauty of the fight."" Can Joshua handle the unexpected explosive punch? Maybe very few heavyweights can. Ask Lennox Lewis about that night in Carnival City Casino and the impact of Hasim Rahman's right hand. Maybe the rumours of Joshua being dropped in sparring are just that, or that he is not a gym fighter, or that he needs the challenge of a big fight to bring out his best. Maybe it doesn't matter that only twice in his professional career has he gone beyond the third round. ""Professional fighters - we're not gods, we're not superheroes,"" he has said. ""We are just human and we make mistakes."" Are greater fame and fortune on the cards for Joshua with a win over Klitschko? At this moment, Joshua has both a burgeoning aura of invincibility and the character outside the ring to match it. He is also at his tipping point between relative fame inside sport and a leap - should he triumph at Wembley - into the wider public consciousness. ""If it's all fake, people will soon figure it out,"" he has said. ""Just be yourself."" The one-time bricklayer believes it. He also admitted recently that he is aiming to become boxing's first billionaire. Both that and the extravagance of his recent escapades on holiday in Dubai pointed to a possible contradiction between the two positions. Few intend to change when they pass through that tipping point - but when the world around you changes, you tend to adjust to it. It is all part of the fascination with Joshua, all part of that same magic blend of prospect and probability. Nothing has been lost, everything is still possible. Boxing still feels fresh to him, its fascination bright, his love of its nuances and enthusiasm for its punishing routines undimmed. And so we wait, hoping again, drawn in once more by rich promise and real talent - and, of course, a little hype.

Flawed & controversial - the complex career of Joey Barton,"Barton has become a highly valued player by fans at Burnley Joey Barton was never destined to leave football by going quietly into the sunset - so it should come as no surprise that one of the game's most complex, contradictory and divisive personalities has effectively been forced into retirement by an 18-month Football Association suspension for betting offences. The 34-year-old has travelled a troubled and tempestuous road since emerging as a talented youngster at Manchester City, earning one England cap and a career full of headlines while also playing for Newcastle United, Queen's Park Rangers, Marseille, Rangers and Burnley. The headline on Barton's personal website reads: ""Footballer. Question Time Guest. Philosophy Student. Future Coach. Fluent French Speaker. What Has Become Of Me?"" ""I'm addicted to gambling"" - Barton's statement in full 53 footballers reported over potential breaches of betting rule Gambling companies prey on 'vulnerable' footballers Osman blames betting company, not Barton Many will wonder what will be become of Barton after his ban, Â£30,000 fine and warning about his future conduct after accepting he placed 1,260 bets on matches between 26 March 2006 and 13 May 2016. What is certain is that it is highly unlikely football has heard the last of an outspoken controversialist who mixes intelligence with a self-destructive streak that has too often disguised a player of genuine talent. Barton was given a four-month sentence suspended for two years after assaulting his Manchester City team-mate Ousmane Dabo Barton comes from the same Huyton area of Merseyside that produced former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard - a tough, uncompromising part of the world that shapes characters. He survived rejection by his beloved Everton to emerge at Manchester City, where his ability after making his debut against Bolton Wanderers on 5 April 2003 made him stand out. Barton's constant courting of controversy, however, often overshadowed what he offered the team. It was a strand that has run through his career. He picked up his first red card in an FA Cup fourth-round tie at Tottenham in 2004 and later demonstrated his rebellious streak by storming away from the stadium after being dropped by then City manager Kevin Keegan for a game against Southampton. The more serious problems came off the field when he was fined six weeks' wages, with two weeks suspended, for stubbing a cigar out in the eye of young team-mate Jamie Tandy at City's Christmas party. Tandy later sued Barton and won Â£65,000 in damages. Barton was also fined eight weeks' wages after being found guilty of gross misconduct following a confrontation with a teenage Everton fan at the team hotel in Bangkok on a pre-season tour in summer 2005. In May 2007 he was suspended by City after a training ground altercation left team-mate Ousmane Dabo needing hospital treatment. He was charged with assault, receiving a four-month suspended jail sentence on 1 July 2008 as well as being ordered to perform 200 hours of community service and pay Â£3,000 in compensation to Dabo. He was also banned for 12 matches, six suspended, by the FA and fined Â£25,000. Barton made his one England appearance while at City, a 12-minute appearance as a substitute against Spain in February 2007. He was linked with a recall in 2011 but then-manager Fabio Capello wrote him off, saying: ""He is a good but dangerous player because you could end up 10 v 11."" It was the old, old story. The talent was obvious. The temperament too risky. Barton has been sent off six times in his Premier League career - two fewer than Patrick Vieira, Richard Dunne and Duncan Ferguson Barton joined Newcastle United in June 2007 for Â£5.8m but was arrested on 27 December 2007 after an incident in Liverpool city centre. He was charged with common assault and affray, and subsequently jailed for six months on 20 May 2008 after admitting the charges. He served 77 days of his prison term and also continued to suffer on-field disciplinary problems, drawing heavy criticism from then-Newcastle manager Alan Shearer after being sent off for a late challenge on Liverpool's Xabi Alonso in May 2009 as the Magpies fought for their Premier League life. Barton was suspended by the club and the misery was compounded by Newcastle's subsequent relegation. He stayed with Newcastle but his career on Tyneside concluded amid acrimony in August 2011 after contract talks broke down and Barton aired his frustrations on social media, tweeting: ""Somewhere in those high echelons of NUFC they have decided I am persona non grata."" Barton then joined QPR but an unfulfilling spell - which included a sending-off at former club City on the day the hosts won the Premier League so dramatically in 2012 - ended with a loan move to Marseille in France. QPR were relegated in his absence, but even far afield Barton could not escape controversy, receiving a two-match suspended ban for likening Paris St-Germain defender Thiago Silva to an ""overweight ladyboy"" on Twitter. Barton's first spell at Burnley was an unqualified success as they won promotion to the Premier League and he was included in the 2016 PFA Championship team of the year, but a short stint in Scotland at Rangers turned into a nightmare. He was suspended for three weeks following a training-ground row with team-mate Andy Halliday after a 5-1 loss at Celtic and his contract was terminated in November. Now, after his latest collision with authority, it is hard to see him back on the field again. This video can not be played Joey Barton had a heated exchange with UKIP MEP Louise Bours Barton's reputation is as contrary as it is controversial - listen to interviews and an eloquent, thoughtful character can be detected amid the outspoken statements that have attracted such adverse publicity. There were those at Manchester City, in particular, eager to highlight this other side of Barton. They spoke about an individual with very obvious personal issues who also had a softer side, as well as a bright and intelligent manner at odds with the public perception of an unsavoury, ill-disciplined individual. Barton's reputation as a midfield enforcer on the field often obscured the natural gifts that saw him represent his country and command much interest when he came on the transfer market. The man regarded as too dangerous to play for England reported from Rio during the 2014 World Cup, penning an article for his website on 'Social Media, Protest, And The Pacification Of The Favelas'. Even to those of us who do not know him personally, it is clear there is much more to Barton than meets the public eye. He was invited to appear on the BBC's flagship political programme Question Time in May 2014, although he admitted first-night nerves led to him being accused of sexism when he likened choosing a political party to making a choice ""between four really ugly girls"". It was a sign of his status as someone with something to say that he was asked to be a panellist and an indication that Barton was always keen to operate on a broader front than simply football. Barton was a guest of the Oxford Union in March 2014, where he was invited to debate philosophy, football and social media at the university. His appearance was later described as ""inspirational"" by students. And he can be a character who, for all the lurid publicity, draws loyalty and affection - as demonstrated by Burnley manager Sean Dyche's willingness to take him back into the fold at Turf Moor. Dyche prides himself on a tight-knit, trouble free, well-disciplined dressing room, so it was testimony to his high regard for Barton that he welcomed him back this season despite the player leaving Turf Moor for that ill-fated spell at Rangers following promotion back into the Premier League. Only last week Barton displayed his enthusiasm for engaging in community work on the club's behalf, spending time with patients at the local Pendleside Hospice. Barton, for all the noise surrounding him, was seen as a leader and a mature, experienced voice at Burnley during their promotion season. It was a far cry from undergoing anger management in 2005 and also completing a programme of behavioural management at the Sporting Chance clinic, set up to help troubled sportsmen and women. If Barton the man is a mass of contradictions, the same could be said of some of his opinions. Barton was embarrassed earlier this season when he dived theatrically after a clash with Matt Rhead at Turf Moor as Burnley slumped out of the FA Cup to non-league Lincoln City. He soon found himself reminded of his own former stance on the subject via a tweet from February 2013 that had stated: ""Players who roll around when nobody touches them should be subsequently banned. I hate cheats. Authorities should address it."" British boxer Carl Frampton tweeted that Barton should have been ""embarrassed and ashamed"". Barton is also prepared to fly in the face of conventional wisdom, often at the risk of ridicule, as when he recently questioned the current praise of Chelsea's Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year N'Golo Kante. He said of a player on course for a second successive title with Chelsea after Leicester's triumph last season, and enjoying successes Barton could only dream about: ""At the moment, in England, people only swear by N'Golo Kante. It's the fashion. ""For pundits he's the best midfield player in the world. Oh, he's very good but I played against him three weeks ago and that's not the case. He's a fantastic destroyer in a phenomenal team but not a creator."" Barton's club Burnley are sponsored by a betting company Barton has divided opinion throughout his career - and he was at it again in what was effectively his retirement statement when he said: ""If the FA is serious about tackling gambling, I would urge it to reconsider its own dependence on the gambling industry."" He was referring to the links between betting chain Ladbrokes and the FA Cup. It was a view that, yet again, polarised feelings. Was Barton making a valid point or simply trying to absolve himself from blame for breaking clear FA rules? If this is the end of Barton's career, it is one that will be remembered with distaste by many and yet he creates interest to such an extent that he has 3.25 million followers on Twitter. He has achieved notoriety, but also plenty of interest, with his opinions on sport, politics and society and the occasional dabble in homespun philosophy. He is prepared to lay bare his own shortcomings with gambling in his most recent statement and yet is regarded by his many detractors as someone simply excusing himself for more wrongdoing. For all his faults - and his timeline of trouble hints at many - Barton is an intelligent, but clearly flawed man. Will there yet be more chapters in Barton's contrary, controversial, eventful story?

Are weddings getting out of control?,"Duck for the drone, darling! Three or four dress changes, a bevy of bridesmaids, photos taken by drone and its own #weddinghashtag. The modern wedding has begun to take on the look of a vulgar ""arms race"", a lifestyle magazine has warned. Country Lifehas urged people to rein it in a bit,external- saying weddings, and their constant cataloguing on visual social media, may put couples under pressure to spend big. They also place guests under duress to pay for the hen-do; the stag weekend; the day itself; a present or honeymoon contribution; and a new outfit. ""The whole thing has got rather out of hand,"" editor Mark Hedges observes. Figures from the close of the 2016 wedding season,externalput the average cost of the UK wedding at Â£27,000 and that rises to Â£38,000 in London. WebsiteBridebook,externallooked at 20,000 UK weddings and found 4% of those held in the south-east of England cost more than Â£100,000. Lost wedding dress found Bride and groom ski off after marriage Indian weddings: Curbs sought on excessive spending Considering thelatest figures from the ONS show there were 247,372 marriages,externalbetween opposite sex couples in England and Wales in 2014, and 4,850 same sex couples tied the knot, it is certainly big business. There were also111,169 divorces in the same year,,externaland while the average UK annual income stands at around Â£27,195, the costs are substantial to most, and unrealistic for many. Country Life's good calls for a perfect day: A reliable (and sober) best man Small canapes: you shouldn't have to struggle to eat them Morning dress for men, hats for women Subsidising the costs of a lavish hen-do/stag party Always ask a father's permission Not royal? Then more than six bridesmaids is ""excessive"" And its pitfalls: Children at the reception Strapless dresses (brides and guests) Any guests you dated within the past three years Dutch courage before a speech Asking bridesmaids to pay for their own dresses The magazine's Rosie Paterson believes there is a trend for ""very elaborate showy weddings"" that detract from the real purpose of the day. She says: ""I've seen a few friends go through the planning process, and not necessarily enjoying it. This is our gentle plea for restraints for weddings to come back to what they are really about - the wedding itself."" Weddings abroad from Mexico to Vietnam, stag dos in Europe or Las Vegas, wedding styling or themes poached from celebrity wedding culture or reality shows like Don't Tell the Bride. They all feed the fire, she says. When weddings are then posted on Instagram or Pinterest, with their own hashtag, she adds, it may be an outlet for creativity, but: ""You're suddenly looking at how everyone else is doing it. There's the ooh and aah of a giant party, but you are not, in fact, looking at the commitment. "" Not royal? Leave most female friends seated Mark Hedges adds: ""Everyone sees what everyone else has done and feels they have to do better. ""They don't need to do better, they just need to get married and have a very special, sometimes simple, day.  It should be fun, it should be delightful."" Then there's the ""nightmare"" of the three-day extravaganza, says Hedges, culminating in that ""sorry, sorry day afterwards, when everyone's probably got slightly sore heads, wondering why they can't go home"". But is advice from a middle-to-upper-class lifestyle magazine on how to keep it real a bit rich? People have always been competitive. Bridezilla is no new phenomenon. Idealised images, in a vast range of wedding magazines, have been around for years. For nuptials organiser George Watts,known as the Wedding Fairy,externalit's all relative and based on what individuals want to achieve with, as he puts it, ""their big day"". ""Some people might want to host their wedding in a two-star Michelin restaurant, some might want the local country pub. At the end of the day, it's the couple's choice,"" he says. He is currently planning a client's six-figure celebration, ""Â£100,000 plus, it's a huge wedding"". And he says there are more choices available than there were 20 years ago. With this French bulldog... I thee wed ""I deal with so many couples, particularly brides, who have dreamt of their wedding day all their life. They've saved for it all their life, their family have. So why not put on a big day exactly how they want to?"" he asks.

How to make everyone hate you on email,"Stop before you copy your boss into that email. It's not going to make you look good - it's going to make everyone else in the office distrust you. That's the finding of research into the pernicious ""cc effect"", carried out by a professor of management studies at Cambridge University's Judge Business School. David De Cremer has looked into the emotional undergrowth of office email traffic. When people keep copying in a manager, it doesn't create ""transparency"", says Prof De Cremer, but feeds a ""culture of fear"". But what about the other unspoken evils of office email clogging up your inbox? ""I am here, really"":This is where email is used to tell colleagues near and far that you're actually at work. A random sharing of a document could do the trick, with a few words of insightful comment that show you're really on the case. There's also the ""midnight express"" version, sending round an email when everyone else with any sense is in the pub or their pyjamas. If I keep emailing they'll know I'm still here at work Ego-mail:Just as there are people who interpret the word ""meeting"" as an invitation to share a few recent career highlights, there are colleagues who see email as purpose-made for shameless self-promotion. These can be managers on the make, as well as underlings with naked, attention-seeking ambitions. But it's so obvious that, er, everyone starts emailing about it. BCC:This is the WMD of email, invisible but potentially massively destructive. And if anyone finds out you're using these underhand tactics, it will be self-destructive too. Where are you sending that email? To X or not to X?How do you sign off an email? These are the questions that feed our online anxiety. If someone sends a work email with a big X at the end do you send one back? And if you don't, does it make you look rude and uptight? There are also people who sign off just with a single initial, like the monogram of an electronic monarch. According to Prof De Cremer, the type of sign-off most likely to get a response is, ""With thanks in advance"". Polite but expectant. Taking the credit:Watch out for the email that's really a land-grab of everyone else's work. They'll be written in management-speak more slippery than eels in engine oil. Or else there is the passive-aggressive dig at someone else's difficulty. So sorry. That thing they saw on Facebook:They thought it was hilarious and had to email everyone in their address book. You're thinking this is cringemakingly dull. And they keep sending more. But what do you say? Is there such a thing as anti-social networking? Employ the wordless shrug of a single character: ""!"" Short measures:Email at work is part of a hierarchy, with distribution lists like small maps of power, and there is a theory that the length of emails is related to the power relationship between the senders. The minion sends in a long essay and the boss writes back in a handful of terse words. So keep it short to keep ahead. What makes you think I'm an attention seeker? The disaster that still makes you wince years later:There's no escaping it. It happens as though Fate has its own irresistible send button. You've just sent an email about the person you're slagging off to the person you're slagging off. This overshadows all other minor indiscretions such as sending to Reply All and telling the entire building about why you can't go to a leaving party. And it's even worse than failed sincerity, such as an email I had recently: ""Dear [blank], Hope all is well with you at [blank]."" It makes you feel so special. The baffling non-responder.This is the shark in the water of email. You've sent something pretty direct and then you wait. Maybe they missed it, so you come up with another excuse to re-send. And nothing. What does it mean? Are they really there? The mid-conversation non-responders are even weirder. They ask you a question, you reply to open up the exchange and then total radio silence. Hello? Thanks, not sorry, is the hardest word.How do you respond to a congratulatory email from a boss? You get an electronic pat on the back and are feeling a warm glow of appreciation. But then it strikes. What do you say back? Is it a gruff ""thanks"" of muted recognition. Or a launchpad for that other brilliant idea you've been nurturing? But would that look too needy? And now the spontaneity of the moment has passed. They might not even see the reply now... And that's when you accidentally send a blank reply. You've snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Another person to avoid in the corridor.

Grief and shock over baby's Facebook death,"Jiranuch Trirat next to a picture of her daughter An incident as shocking as a man murdering his 11-month-old daughter live on Facebook before killing himself was bound to provoke heated debate. The 21-year-old man broadcast himself hanging his daughter from a half-finished building on the island of Phuket in Thailand, reportedly after ending a turbulent and sometimes violent relationship with his wife. The man's Facebook page has received dozens of comments from Thai people outraged by the death of the little girl. Some men who have also had failed relationships have posted how they got through their problems and rebuilt bonds with their children. Thais are accustomed to seeing violent scenes on their television news bulletins, which would be deemed unacceptable in many Western countries. Previous shocking incidents, like appalling car accidents caused by negligent driving, have led to brief national debates, but have quickly dropped from public consciousness. But there have been some reflective responses to this incident, with a number of people urging people not to share the video. Ms Trirat and her husband had a sometimes violent relationship, reports said The long period of time the video remained viewable on Facebook - 24 hours - is one area the social media giant may be able to address. Thai police were aware of the video almost immediately after the crime took place. It is not clear yet when the Thai authorities alerted Facebook. The police now say that in future they will discuss inappropriate online content with social media companies like Facebook, YouTube or Instagram, and how to take it down quickly. But the challenge of stopping offensive and disturbing content on a medium, which is used by so many people, including two-thirds of the Thai population, is a difficult one. The Thai military government does operate a range of censorship regimes, and blocks many thousands of websites, especially those carrying content deemed critical of the monarchy. On the day this awful incident occurred, the Ministry of Digital Information and Economy demanded that local internet service providers (ISPs) do even more to block anti-monarchy content, and the government is believed to be trying to implement a single digital gateway which will allow it to wall Thailand off from such content. But until now it has been wary of tampering with Facebook. A clumsy attempt to block Facebook shortly after the military had seized power in 2014 provoked a huge public outcry, and the social media giant remained unavailable for only 30 minutes. Facebook is hugely popular with Thai people and businesses Aside from the general popularity of Facebook for social communication, it is also used by large numbers of Thai businesses to promote their products and services. Until now there has been little public debate over the negative sides of social media, for example hate speech, trolling and fake news, which have aggravated Thailand's bitter political polarisation. There is no law against hate speech. So Thai society is less prepared to address issues like those thrown up by this murder-suicide. A more fruitful area for discussion coming out of this incident might instead be the issue of domestic violence in Thailand, and the high level of suicides related to it. The Thai Department of Mental Health reports that there are around 350 suicides a month here, a figure it says it is working to reduce. Four times as many men than women are victims of suicide, and the highest number of those male suicides are related to relationship problems, and reactions to being criticised or insulted, or loss of face. The department says alcohol consumption also plays a big role in encouraging these men to kill themselves, and that it is very common for them to assault others, usually family members, before they do.

Seven ways the world has changed under Trump,"With Donald Trump in the White House, the US's relationship with the rest of the world has changed in some important ways. Here are seven of them. Donald Trump still has to decide how to handle this man - Kim Jong-un A Donald Trump presidency has raised major security questions in Asia. Not only did he shock China with comments on Taiwan before his inauguration, but his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has spoken of blocking China's access to artificial islands it has been building in the South China Sea, prompting warnings of a ""military clash"" from a state-run newspaper. Japan and South Korea have both been singled out by Mr Trump for relying too much on the US. He has even said they would benefit from having their own nuclear arsenals. Then there is the region's renegade state, North Korea, which is currently developing its own nuclear weapons. Mr Trump faces the task of curbing those ambitions, something that has eluded successive US leaders. Under President Obama, the policy was called ""strategic patience"" - squeeze North Korea with sanctions, persuade others to do the same, particularly China, and wait it out. But Mr Trump's Vice-President Mike Pence has now said the ""era of strategic patience is over"". The administration says ""all options are on the table"" and Mr Trump's announcement that he was sending an ""armada"" of US warships towards the Korean peninsula raised the spectre of military action. The move was met with defiance from North Korea's regime, whichthreatened ""weekly"" missile testsand warned of ""all-out war"". Butthere was increased confusion just 10 days laterwhen it emerged that the US Navy strike group, which Mr Trump said had been deployed towards the Korean peninsula, instead travelled in the opposition direction. While the White House clarified the whereabouts of the ships and insisted they were on their way, Mr Trump returned his focus to pressuring China to take action. ""China is very much the economic lifeline to North Korea so, while nothing is easy, if they want to solve the North Korean problem, they will,"" he tweeted. His next step is unknown, but the early attempts of this unpredictable president in tackling the world's most unpredictable state have already exposed a flashpoint that is likely to return in years to come. Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised the incoming US president and the feeling is mutual During the US election campaign, Mr Trump praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, with whom he would love to have a good relationship. That was before US intelligence agencies determined Russia was responsible for hacking Democratic Party emails during the campaign - a conclusion that Mr Trump eventually conceded he agreed with. The explosive publication of an unverified dossier alleging that Russia holds compromising material on Mr Trump has also raised prickly questions for him. He has batted them away, dismissing the allegations as ""fake news"". But concerns over his administration's ties with Russia continue to dog his presidency, with his national security adviser Michael Flynn abruptly resigning over conversations with Russia's ambassador in the weeks before inauguration. Mr Trump said he wanted to start off trusting President Putin but warned ""it might not last long at all"". And it seems it didn't. The relationship appeared to take a sharpdownward turnfollowing a chemical attack in Syria, which was blamed on the Syrian government, and Russia's continued support for President Bashar al-Assad. President Trump went on to say the US ""may be at an all-time low in terms with our relationship with Russia"".  He said it would be a ""fantastic thing"" if the nations improved ties, but warned ""it might be just the opposite"". This video can not be played The US president has reversed his condemnation of the defence alliance Nato Mr Trump has previously been hugely critical of Nato (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization), a cornerstone of American foreign policy for more than 60 years. He attacked the organisation as ""obsolete"" and characterised its members as ungrateful allies who benefit from US largesse. Defence Secretary James Mattiswarned Nato members in Februarythat Washington would ""moderate its commitment"" if members did not meet his boss's demand that they raise their defence spending to 2% of their GDP. Mr Trump claimed his tough talk was causing the ""money to pour in"", although analysts point out that countries were already increasing their contributions under a 2014 agreement. But during a joint press conference in April, Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg thanked the US president for his attention to the issue. ""We are all seeing the effects of your strong focus on burden sharing in the alliance,"" he told him. Meanwhile, Mr Trump had a change of heart and said Nato was ""no longer obsolete"". He said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance and called on members to do more to help Iraqi and Afghan ""partners"". This video can not be played The moment the MOAB bomb struck the IS cave and tunnel system President Obama was elected to end America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and was extremely reluctant to get involved in another conflict in the Middle East. Even when the scale of atrocities in Syria became brutally clear, he remained convincedmilitary intervention would be a costly failure. Instead the Obama administration focused on providing humanitarian aid, giving some funding to moderate Syrian rebels and promoting a ceasefire and political negotiations aimed at President Assad's departure. Donald Trump was also previously opposed to US military action in Syria, calling for greater focus on domestic policies. ""Forget Syria and make America great again!""he tweeted,externalin 2013. So it was quite a turnaround when the president ordered US missile strikes on a Syrian government airbase in April. He said the chemical attack blamed by the Syrian government had changed his attitude. ""That attack on children had a big impact on me,"" he said. The missile strike was the first time the US had directly targeted the Syrian regime since the conflict began, and viewed as a breathtaking policy shift for a previously isolationist leader. But it was just days until the Trump administration flexed its military muscles once again, this time hitting Islamic State militants in Afghanistan with a weapon known as the ""mother of all bombs"", or MOAB, that had never been used by the US in combat before. And with greater US defence spending on the table, the US appears - at least for now - to be taking a more forceful role in foreign conflicts. Read more:What does all this bombing tell us about Trump? There has been strong public opposition to free trade deals With his trade policies, Donald Trump has embarked on bringing about the biggest change to the way the US does business with the rest of the world for decades. He has threatened to scrap a number of existing free trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, which he blames for job losses. He has even suggested withdrawing the US from the World Trade Organization. Since winning the election, he has focused on threatening companies, particularly automobile makers, that he will slap a tariff of 35% on goods manufactured in Mexico. How far he will get with this is still unclear. But on his first day in office, Mr Trumpabandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation trade deal brokered by President Obama and representing 40% of the world's economic output. The deal had yet to be ratified by a divided Congress, but Mr Trump's executive order withdrew US participation altogether. The thrust behind his trade policy is to create jobs in the US, close the trade deficit, and get ""good deals"" for Americans. Already he hastargeted the country's foreign worker visa programmeand ordered a review of waivers in free-trade agreements to see whether they allow foreign firms to undermine American companies in the global government procurement market. However, he has rowed back on a campaign promise to label China a currency manipulator - a move that experts warned could have provoked a trade war. Mr Trump has promised a renewed push to use coal across the US Mr Trump had said that he would ""cancel"" theParis Climate Agreement,externalwithin 100 days of taking office. This has not happened and his senior advisers are now reportedly divided on whether it should. He has, however, made large strides in his pledge to reverse climate change regulations introduced by President Obama. He signed an executive order in March that reversed the Clean Power Plan, which had required states to regulate power plants, but had been on hold while being challenged in court. The president said the order was necessary to ensure US energy independence and jobs. But environmental groups warned that undoing the regulations would have serious consequences at home and abroad. Mr Trump has repeatedly denied the science of human-caused climate change, describing it as ""fictional'. Like many issues, however, he has expressed conflicting views, telling the New York Times in November that he acknowledged there was ""some connectivity"" between human activity and climate change and saying he would ""take a look at"" the Paris agreement, rather than having already decided to pull the US out of it. Even if he wanted to do that though, the US remains legally bound to the Paris plan for four years. Climate change: Nations will push ahead with plans despite Trump There are also ""legal and procedural roadblocks"" which would inhibit Mr Trump from a complete overhaul of US climate policy, The New York Times says. But critics say his stance could cause other reluctant governments sceptical about the issue to reduce their efforts to cut planet-warming emissions. The Iranian nuclear accord was the ""worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated"", said Mr Trump For President Obama, the deal that saw sanctions against Iran lifted in exchange for guarantees it would not pursue nuclear weapons was a ""historic understanding"". But for Donald Trump, echoing Republican concerns, it was ""the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated"". He had said dismantling it would be his ""number one priority"" but had not specified what he wanted to do. Now his administration has announceda review of the whole US policy towards Iran. This would take in not only Tehran's compliance with the nuclear deal but also its actions in the Middle East where it is a key player in the Syrian conflict and a rival of Saudi Arabia and Israel. Already Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has urged Trump to stay committed to the nuclear deal. He previously suggested the US would have to respect the accord given that it was thrashed out with several world powers. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been more blunt. ""If they tear it up, we will burn it,"" The Associated Press quoted him as saying. Relations to the countries did not get off to a good start after the Trump presidency began - the USplaced new sanctions on Iranafter it conducted a ballistic missile test. ""Iran is playing with fire,"" President Trump tweeted. The people around Donald Trump Has Trump delivered on his promises?

Girl on The Train author's new book puzzles critics,"The Girl on the Train was Paula Hawkins's first novel under her own name The only problem with writing a debut novel that sells 20 million copies and spawns a Hollywood film is - your follow-up has a lot to live up to. Paula Hawkins' 2015 debut The Girl on the Train was a publishing phenomenon, and the first reviews for her new book Into The Water are in. And most critics are not impressed. Reviewing it forThe Guardian,external, crime author Val McDermid predicted Hawkins' sales would be ""massive"" but ""her readers' enjoyment may be less so"". McDermid was puzzled by the 11 narrative voices used in Into The Water, which is released in the UK next week. She wrote: ""These characters are so similar in tone and register - even when some are in first person and others in third - that they are almost impossible to tell apart, which ends up being both monotonous and confusing."" She added: ""Hawkins had a mountain to climb after the success of The Girl on the Train and no doubt the sales of her second thriller will be massive. I suspect her readers' enjoyment may be less so."" Slate,external's Laura Miller declared that Into the Water ""isn't an impressive book"". She wrote: ""Its tone is uniformly lugubrious and maudlin, and Hawkins' characters seldom rise to the level of two dimensions, let alone three."" But Miller pointed out: ""None of this will necessarily prevent Into the Water from triumphing at the cash register. The book surely will become a best-seller, if only on the strength of residual name recognition for The Girl on the Train."" Janet Maslin wasn't much more enthusiastic inThe New York Times,external. ""If The Girl on the Train seemed overplotted and confusing to some readers, it is a model of clarity next to this latest effort. ""Her goal may be to build suspense, but all she achieves is confusion. Into the Water is jam-packed with minor characters and stories that go nowhere."" She asks: ""What happened to the Paula Hawkins who structured The Girl on the Train so ingeniously?"" However,The New Statesman,external's Leo Robson defended the book, writing: ""Most of the time, the novel is plausible and grimly gripping. ""Into the Water follows its predecessor in applying laser scrutiny to a small patch, but there are signs of growth and greater ambition."" He described Hawkins's writing as ""addictive"", adding that the novel ""is on a par with The Girl on a Train"". The film adaptation of The Girl on the Train was released last September The Evening Standard,external's David Sexton wrote: ""Unfortunately, Into the Water turns out to be hard work."" ""There's a ridiculous multiplication of narrators from the start, some first-person, others third, so that on first reading it is almost impossible to keep track of who's who and what relation they have to one another... several of the stories never really cohere."" Marcel Berlins inThe Times,externalsaid: ""This novel has its intriguing attributes. ""It does not follow the usual samey fashionable pattern of 'domestic noir' and psychological thrillers. For that Hawkins ought to be commended, even if the result is not a full success. ""She is let down by her overambitious structure and a lack of sufficient tension. Hawkins does not quite pass the second-book test."" Of course, reviews of any kind are unlikely to deter the millions who enjoyed The Girl on the Train. After all, criticsdidn't much likethe film adaptation of her previous book, starring Emily Blunt, but that didn't stop it being a box office success. The Girl on the Train was Hawkins' first book under her own name, but she had previously written a string of chick-lit novels under the pen name Amy Silver.

France says City at risk post-Brexit,"One of the most important sectors at the heart of the Brexit negotiations will be financial services. As Mark Carney said, London is ""effectively, the investment banker for Europe"" and the City is the financial capital of the European Union. Nearly 80% of foreign exchange trading and 30% of all bank lending in the EU flows through the UK. How much that will change after Britain leaves the European Union is a matter of increasingly tense debate. In the UK, very senior figures within the financial services sector argue that it is ""nonsensical"" to argue that after Brexit, large amounts of euro-denominated trading should move on to the continent. They point out that significant amounts of dollar-trading are executed through London - and neither the EU nor the UK has a single-market agreement with the US. Many on the continent of Europe see it differently, saying that financial oversight will only be possible if euro-trading valued in trillions of pounds a year is put under the direct jurisdiction of European Union-based regulators. The biggest sector seen at risk is euro-denominated clearing, the billions of pounds worth of derivatives products traded every day to insure companies, for example, against interest rate changes, currency fluctuations and inflation risk. Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, told the BBC that it was a question of control. ""I believe that there is an issue of sovereignty and security of European monetary markets and therefore the majority of the clearing houses cannot remain in London,"" he told me. ""There will be movement, there will be a displacement and actually many of the financial institutions are already preparing themselves towards that."" Many believe that if the trading moves, jobs will move as well. ""I don't see how it could be a good thing for the City,"" Mr Sapin said. ""The City will remain a large financial centre, will remain important for Europe as well as for the rest of the world. ""But the security of the monetary system is something that's of vital importance for any given country or any given groupings of countries - such as the case of the eurozone countries."" Hundreds of billions of pounds of trades will be at stake. At the moment, the two sides - the UK and the EU - appear a long way apart.

Reality Check: How much will Labour's NHS plans cost?,"Labour has begun setting out its plan for the NHS in England if the party wins in June. This includes a pay increase for staff, putting into law the mandatory minimum number of staff per patient and funding training for health professionals. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said the money for these pledges would be raised by increasing corporation tax. How much will need to be raised has not yet been confirmed. Corporation tax - the tax on companies' profits - has been cut from 28% in 2010 to 19%, and is due to come down to 17% by 2020. Labour usedofficial figures,externalto calculate that between 2016-17 and 2021-22, cuts to corporation tax would amount to Â£64bn less in the public purse. We are talking about the NHS in England only since health is a devolved matter and the other nations' administrations generally set their own policies. For example, although the recommendations of pay review bodies are UK-wide, nations get to choose whether to accept them. It is unlikely that the precise figures behind Labour's policies will be available until the party's manifesto is published, next month. Even then, we probably will not know exactly by how much pay will be increased and what level the minimum staffing will be set at, so it's difficult to say exactly how much this all going to cost. However, we can estimate how much various elements of the pledge might cost. Labour said it would  increase pay to a ""sustainable level"" and lift the pay cap currently in force that means NHS staff pay has not increased by more than 1% a year for the past six years, although many staff also get incremental pay-rises to reflect progression within their roles. We don't know exactly what a ""sustainable increase"" will be. Mr Ashworth said the decision would be taken by an independent pay review body. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, has estimated that every 1% pay rise would cost Â£500m a year. Labour's own estimates put it at Â£350m, but this excludes doctors. When the government cut funding for health students by replacing grants with loans, it calculated this would save the Treasury Â£800m, so we can reasonably say reversing this cut would cost the same amount. Labour also set out plans to introduce mandatory minimum staffing levels. Sir Robert Francis' report into the failings at the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust published in February 2013 found low levels of staffing were linked to poor care and recommended minimum safe staffing levels should be drawn up. The Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs responsible for overseeing government expenditure, estimated last year that the NHS was short-staffed by about 50,000. Employing this number of extra people could cost about Â£2-3bn depending on how many of them were nurses, doctors or in other roles. The NHS spends about Â£40bn a year on front-line staff. Another 50,000 staff would be about a 6% increase to the total number of NHS staff caring for patients, amounting to an extra Â£2.4bn on the pay bill. This is a very rough estimate. Mr Ashworth also pointed out that hiring more staff and raising their pay would help reduce the NHS's dependency on agency workers who cost the health service more than salaried employees. In 2015, agency nurses cost, on average, an estimated Â£39Â perÂ hour, compared with Â£27Â perÂ hour for NHS staff bank nurses. However, this is not the only way Labour has promised to spend the extra money from raising corporation tax. Since Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the party, in 2015, Labour has pledged to raise corporation tax to fund: British Steel the reintroduction of student maintenance grants the scrapping of university tuition fees the schools budget social care Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter,external Labour promises pay rises for NHS staff Reality Check: Is government giving away Â£70bn to the rich? 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Nurses consider strike action over low pay Is the NHS getting more than it wanted?

May and Corbyn's memorable clashes,"Theresa May takes on Jeremy Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions at midday for the final time before the general election - and possibly ever. Here are some of their more memorable clashes. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn questions Theresa May on jobs and she points to problems in his party Making her PMQs debut in July, Mrs May focused on unrest among Labour MPs, and likened Mr Corbyn to an ""unscrupulous boss"". The Labour leader was not impressed, saying Tories might find economic insecurity ""funny"" but millions of people did not. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn offers a new name for the PM, twisting a former moniker for Lady Thatcher. The May versus Corbyn clashes are unlikely to be remembered for their contribution to comedy. PMQs watchers were left groaning in September by Mrs May's attempts to shoehorn in train jokes after Mr Corbyn's tussle with Virgin Rail. In January, Mr Corbyn's suggestion of a new nickname for the PM generated a similar reaction. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn attacks schools 'vanity project' Things got personal over grammar schools in March, when Mrs May told MPs Mr Corbyn had sent his son to one, adding: ""Typical Labour, take the advantage and pull up the ladder behind you."" The Labour leader - who had been opposed to sending his child to a selective school - accused the prime minister of indulging in a ""vanity project"" over grammar schools. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks who the prime minister will listen to over warnings about NHS services One of Mr Corbyn's most regular PMQs themes has been the NHS, like in January when he accused Mrs May of being ""in denial"" over the state of the health service. This video can not be played  Donald Trump's proposed state visit to the UK was the hot topic in February, with Mr Corbyn urging the prime minister to ""listen"" to the 1.8 million people who had signed a petition calling for the invitation to be withdrawn. The PM hit back, adding: ""He can lead a protest, I'm leading a country."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reads out leaked texts about funding for Surrey County Council In February Mr Corbyn read out leaked text messages showing what he called a ""sweetheart deal"" to ensure a Tory-controlled council dropped plans to raise council tax by up to 15%. This video can not be played Theresa May laughs off claims of a Surrey council tax deal When Mr Corbyn returned to the subject the following month it provoked a very visible laugh from the PM. This video can not be played Labour deputy leader 'dabs' during PMQs Perhaps the strangest moment of the Corbyn and May tussles was one that did not involve either leader. Mr Corbyn's deputy, Tom Watson, appeared to ""dab"" (a dance craze that originated in the US) after a question from his boss.

What you need to know on election,"The UK will have a general election on 8 June. Here's what you need to know. Ask a questionâ¼ Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  A general election is how the British public decide who they want to represent them in Parliament and, ultimately, run the country. Everyone who is eligible - and registered (see below) - gets to vote for one candidate to represent their local area, which is known in Parliament as a constituency. The candidates standing for election aare usually drawn from political parties, but can also stand as independents. The person with the most votes in a constituency is elected as its MP, to represent that area in the House of Commons. The leader of the political party with the most MPs after the election is expected to be asked by the Queen to become prime minister and form a government to run the country. The leader of the political party with the second highest number of MPs normally becomes leader of the opposition. Once elected, MPs work both in your area - or their constituency - dealing with local matters, and in Parliament, where they vote and help shape law, alongside 649 other MPs. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called a general election on 8 June - three years earlier than scheduled. Mrs May's official reason for holding an election was to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations. She claimed Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems would try to destabilise and frustrate the process in Parliament. But Mrs May's Conservative Party has a big opinion poll lead over Labour so she will be hoping the election will see her getting a bigger majority in the House of Commons, tightening her grip on power. As things stand, it does not take many Conservative MPs to decide they don't like something the government is doing to get it derailed. Mrs May is also tied to the promises made by the Conservatives at the 2015 election, when David Cameron was prime minister. She has made a few changes - such as backing grammar schools and easing plans to reduce the deficit - but an election gives her the chance to set out her own vision for Britain. Find out the latest picture with theBBC's poll tracker. The latest polls have shown the Conservatives ahead, but that their longstanding lead over Labour has narrowed. The early signs that 2017 will be a tactical election The seats that could decide the election Election 2017 poll tracker: How the parties compare The Conservatives publishedtheir manifesto,externalon 18 May with Theresa May promising a ""mainstream government that will deliver for mainstream Britain"". Labour's manifesto,externalwas launched on 16 May - Jeremy Corbyn pledged to raise the income tax rate for earnings over Â£80,000 and Â£123,000. The Liberal Democrats launchedtheir manifesto,externalon 17 May with leader Tim Farron promising a second EU referendum. The SNP unveiledtheir manifestoon 30 May with a call for a Scottish referendum at the end of the Brexit process. Plaid Cymru promised to give Wales a ""strong voice"" in Brexit when it launchedits manifesto,externalon 16 May. UKIP launchedits manifestoon 25 May with a pledge to tackle radical Islam. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein publishedits manifesto on 22 Maysaying a ""new era"" was opening up in Irish politics and theSDLP published its pledgeson 30 May. TheDUP followed on 31 May, saying the union with the UK was ""by far"" the most important issue of the campaign. TheAlliance Party's manifestowas published the same day and theUUP's manifestocame on 1 June. You can read and compare all the parties' hand-on-heart pledges withour super simple manifesto guide. Basically, if you're aged 18 or over on election day, registered to vote and a British citizen you can vote. Citizens of the Republic of Ireland resident in the UK and citizens ofqualifying Commonwealth states,externalresident in the UK can also vote if they are over 18 and registered to vote. British citizens living abroad can vote if they have been registered to vote in the UK in the past 15 years, although the deadline to apply to register now passed, as has the postal vote application deadline. People who will be temporarily abroad can vote by post (although it's too late to apply for a postal vote) or byproxy,external, which means getting someone else to vote for you. It's too late to register to vote in the general election on 8 June. You can register to vote in future electionsonline,external. It's now too late to apply for a postal vote. If you have already applied, post your completed ballot paper and voting statement back as soon as possible so they arrive in time. Alternatively, forms can be handed into your local polling station by 22:00 BST on polling day. Students may be registered at both their home address, and at a university or college address. It all depends whether you spend an equal amount of time at each and, ultimately, the electoral registration officer will decide whether or not someone can register at both. At the general election, it is an offence to vote more than once. Anyone who has moved since they last voted, must register at their new address - paying council tax does not mean you are registered to vote. If you did not re-register in time, you may be able to still vote at the address you originally registered at. If this is too far away, you can always arrange a proxy vote. You can vote either by post or by proxy - which is where you appoint someone else to register your vote on your behalf. To do that you candownload the form here,external. Whoever you nominate must be eligible to vote in the election themselves.

Details of where to find your local registration officeare on this site,external. Theresa May had said she wanted to wait until 2020 for the next scheduled election but changed her mind, in a move that took everyone by surprise. Prime ministers used to be free to hold an election whenever they felt like it - but under the 2011 Fixed Term Parliaments Act, a general election is supposed to take place every five years on the first Thursday in May, which is why the next one was scheduled for May 2020. But an election can be called ahead of schedule for two reasons - if there is a vote of ""no confidence"" in the current government, or if MPs vote for an early election by a two-thirds majority. Mrs May chose the second option, which was overwhelmingly backed by MPs, by 522 votes to 13. You have to go back to 1966 and Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson for the last example of a government holding an election after a short time in power to increase its number of MPs. In 1974, there were two elections eight months apart - but that was under different circumstances because no party won a majority in the Commons in the first one. UK snap election: Five things you need to know A 2017 general election means that the subsequent election is now due in 2022. That's because the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, which decrees that elections take place every five years, is still in force. But an election could be held at any time if two-thirds of MPs vote for it, as they did this time. A future government could also decide to scrap the Fixed Term Parliaments Act - the Conservative manifesto includes plans to do so. Parliament broke up on 3 May to allow just over a month of full-pelt campaigning ahead of 8 June. The general election didn't stop voting taking place in 34 local council areas in England, all 32 councils in Scotland and all 22 councils in Wales on 4 May. The Conservatives gained control of 11 councils and Labour lost seven, with UKIP losing the 145 council seats it had been defending, and gaining just one. In addition, six areas in England voted for newly-created ""combined local authority mayors"". The Conservatives won four mayoral races and Labour two. The Manchester Gorton by-election, caused by the death of Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, had been due to take place on 4 May but will now be held at the same time as the general election on 8 June. Britain is still on course to officially leave the European Union on Friday 29 March 2019. Negotiations with other EU nations are not due to start until June, meaning the election will probably be over and a new government in place before any serious talking gets under way in Brussels. The Conservative Party says this is a ""one-off chance to hold an election while the European Union agrees its negotiating position"". If Mrs May wins by a big margin in the UK, she will see it as a vote of confidence in her strategy for leaving the EU. But if her slender House of Commons majority is cut further or she loses the election - with anti-Brexit parties such as the Liberal Democrats getting many more MPs - then the UK's current Brexit strategy will be up for grabs. There's a summary ofwhere Britain's parties stand on Brexit, if you'd like to read it. There are lots of opinion polls carried out in the run-up to a general election. Their methods vary but they usually survey the views of at least 1,000 people to find which political party is likely to get most votes. They give each party a percentage rating based on how many people said they would vote for them. A poll tracker amalgamates the results of several opinion polls to try to get as clear a picture as possible. TheBBC tracker, for example, takes the results of the latest seven opinion polls, on a rolling basis, and works out the median (middle) rating for each party. When you hear someone talking about one party having a poll lead over another - they are talking about the gap between the percentage ratings of the parties in the latest poll or set of polls. The opinion polls were wrong about the 2015 general election and the industry has yet to fully fix the problems that caused those inaccuracies. So they should be taken with a pinch of salt. But the gap between Labour and the Conservatives in the polls leading up to the 2015 election was between 0% and 6%, and in the end the Conservatives did better than polls suggested. The Conservatives have a bigger lead than that now, although it has narrowed recently. It's not a straightforward process to work it out. Many Labour MPs have ""safe"" seats - they got thousands more votes than their nearest rivals in 2015, meaning they could lose votes and still retain their place in the Commons. The Conservatives have fewer ""safe"" seats than Labour. They pulled off their surprise 2015 general election victory by winning seats just where they needed them, such as in previously Liberal Democrat-held constituencies in the south-west of England. The danger for Labour is that it piles up votes in seats it already holds - something that happened in 2015 - rather than in areas represented by rival parties. This makes it harder for it to suffer large-scale losses, but it also makes it relatively harder for it to make big gains. No. They were not due to be introduced until 2020.A public consultation is under waywith final proposals set to be made in 2018. The main parties faced a race against time to get candidates in place and some streamlined their normal selection procedures, with more candidates chosen centrally. Some 68 parties and 191 independent candidates contribute to a total of 3,304 people standing for Parliament this year - a decrease of 664 from 2015. Find your constituency and candidates A-Z constituency guide Oh yes - it's proved a good chance for people to get out, or try to return to, frontline politics. Some of the big names stepping down include former Conservative chancellor George Osborne - who is now editing the London Evening Standard newspaper - and ex-party chairman Sir Eric Pickles. Labour's Alan Johnson is retiring, and former health secretary Andy Burnham will not stand after becoming Mayor of Greater Manchester. Some former MPs are aiming to get back, though - including former Lib Dem ministers Sir Vince Cable and Ed Davey. And others are throwing their hat into the ring for the first time, including blogger Jack Monroe - who is campaigning over the NHS - while UKIP's Paul Nuttall is among his party's best known hopefuls. The Conservatives have 330 seats, Labour 229, the SNP 54, the Lib Dems nine and Plaid Cymru three. The Green Party has one MP. UKIP have no MPs after their sole representative left the party and became an independent. For Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party have eight MPs; Sinn Fein, who don't take up their seats, four; the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) three; and the Ulster Unionist Party two.

Was that Angus Robertson's last PMQs?,"This video can not be played The SNP's Angus Robertson clashed with Theresa May at the final PMQs before the election Angus Robertson has become perhaps the most high-profile SNP MP. He leads the third biggest group in parliament and gets to quiz the prime minister weekly. His questioning at PMQs has won him plaudits from commentators at Westminster. But the Conservatives are hoping he could be one of the biggest scalps on 8 June. Senior Tories tell meMoray- the constituency Mr Robertson has held since 2001 and his party since 1987 - is one of their top targets in Scotland. Polls suggest the Tories are on the up in Scotland. Although some are playing down the idea of the party winning as many as 12 seats - as one poll indicated - they are happy to entertain the idea they could take Moray. That's despite Mr Robertson winning by more than 9,000 votes last time. So, why is this a Tory target? Election campaign latest The Scottish battleground seats Well it's the area of Scotland which came closest to backing leave in the EU referendum (every counting area in Scotland voted remain, but in Moray the remain vote was 50.1% remain, by 49.9% leave). The Tories hope they can win over those leave voters with their Brexit plans. They'll be hoping too that their vocal opposition to a another independence referendum (which will be key to their Scottish campaign) appeals to the 57.5% of Moray voters who voted No in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The party also had an encouraging result here in the equivalent Holyrood seat. Last year (pre-EU referendum) at the Scottish Parliament elections,the Conservatives cut the SNP majority from almost 11,000 to under 3,000. The Tories have picked MSP Douglas Ross to contest the seat. Are the SNP worried? If so, they're not admitting it for now. They point out they've held the seat for 30 years and have no intention of letting that change. They also point out Mr Ross hasn't quit his Holyrood list seat yet,unlike his colleague John Lamontwho has said he'll leave Holyrood to contest Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk. If Mr Ross was confident, the SNP suggest, he would follow suit. And as for Mr Robertson himself, he was quick to respond to this piece on social media. Using his twitter feed he said: ""Don't mind disappointing the Tories, but I look forward to defeating their candidate for the third time in a row."" Nevertheless, expect the Tories to put a lot of time, money and effort into campaigning here, especially with local fishermen and those in the agricultural sector. Expect the SNP to put a lot into it too. It's a campaign and result we'll be watching closely.

Would visiting Parliament inspire you to vote?,"This video can not be played Can you convince people to vote in one day? With a general election weeks away, figures suggest voter apathy remains unchanged. Two women who don't like politics paid a visit to Parliament, but did it convince them to vote? ""I feel like politicians make decisions for people they don't know anything about,"" says LaTifah Atkinson, a 26-year-old woman from north London. She is a university graduate who runs her own business. She has never voted. ""I currently don't vote because I don't understand what I'm voting for,"" she says. Fellow businesswoman, Chiara Stone, a 36-year-old mother of two, is also disaffected by politics. She says MPs are not worth what they earn. ""I don't think we feel Parliament does represent us because we don't understand how it works,"" she says. Election questions, answered WATCH: How do I register to vote? Who won where you live, in 2015? Watch the full film on BBC iPlayer She is not alone. A third of people eligible to vote didn't cast a vote in the last general election. According to new parliamentary research, two-thirds of people aged 18 to 34 feel they know little or nothing about Parliament. Beyond the act of voting, the British public are ""no more politically engaged this year than last"" - despite last year's EU referendum - it suggests. So what can be done? The BBC'sVictoria Derbyshire programmetook LaTifah and Chiara to Parliament for a day. It turned out to be the day Theresa May sought to call a general election. Iain Duncan Smith said the Commons can be a ""bear pit"" First stop was the House of Commons, for a tour with veteran Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith and a seat to watch that day's debate. Both women said the infighting, the hustle and bustle, and even the way MPs addressed each other left them confused and alienated. ""You don't really have much faith in them when they are in the House of Commons having a debate and they look bored,"" she added. ""How am I supposed to be interested if you look obviously bored and you're scrolling through your Twitter feed in the debate?"" ""I think it is in Parliament's interests to get more people voting,"" Chiara added. ""And I think if you want to get more people voting then you need to make it accessible for them in this modern age. ""I think the problem is that so much of it is steeped in so much tradition and history, which is quite British, but then you also have to move with the times."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said politics mattered After that, the pair were able to sit down with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. ""Do you feel Parliament represents you?"" he asked. ""I suppose no, we don't really think it represents us,"" Chiara said. ""Politics affects lives,"" he added. He told LaTifah: ""You've had a housing issue, that's a political decision. It's a political decision to build council housing, or not. It's a political decision to regulate rents, or not. ""That's politics. Politics matters."" Mr Corbyn has been an MP for 34 years. But for new MPs, joining the Commons can be just as overwhelming as visiting on a day trip. The SNP's Hannah Bardell - one of Westminster's newest MPs who joined the Commons in 2015 - says even new MPs can be left in a daze by the workings of Parliament. ""It was quite intimidating and quite emotional. I spent a lot of time getting lost,"" she says of her first few days. ""This place is designed to intimidate you and I think a lot of us just thought, 'No, we're not going to be intimidated, we're here to do a job and do our best.'"" The SNP's Hannah Bardell is one of Parliament's newest MPs The final stop was a trip to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to hear business leaders give evidence about the impact of Brexit. ""We've had sessions talking about the film industry, to people in television and today we were talking to people in the fashion industry,"" Tory MP Damian Collins, who chairs the committee, says. ""We can hold inquiries or hold hearings on any issue that is related to the work of that government department. What we try to do is look at the issues and then decide as a group what is the right thing to do."" So did it work? ""It was better than I thought it would be,"" LaTifah says, with Big Ben looming behind her. ""I do know who I would vote for and being here today, I can say that I would confidently vote for the first time in 26 years."" ""It was massively different to how I thought it would be. I've come away now feeling that I have a good grasp of how politics works. But it is complex,"" Chiara added. But she says she is still baffled by the behaviour of MPs in the Commons. ""It is just really hard to follow, all the language and the traditions they use, it didn't really make much sense."" They both said they have a great appreciation of what the role of an MP entails. ""But I also feel that it is a two-way street,"" LaTifah says. ""It is not just about the politicians and what happens in Parliament, it is about the public and the people doing their part as well. ""If we don't challenge MPs, they can't make changes on our behalf."" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

City-based T20 competition gets go-ahead,"It is hoped the competition can rival the Indian Premier League which attracts star names like Chris Gayle A new city-based eight-team Twenty20 tournament has been given the go-ahead to start in 2020. The proposals were approved by 38 of the 41 England and Wales Cricket Board members, with 15 first-class counties in support of the competition. Essex and Middlesex were the only two counties to vote against the proposals, while Kentabstained from voting. ""I passionately believe that the game has chosen the right path,"" ECB chairman Colin Graves said. The ECB needed 31 members to vote in favour of the tournament which will be played alongside the existing T20 Blast. It is not yet known which cities will have sides and where the matches will be played. ""Each of our members will benefit and, critically, so will the whole game,"" Graves added. ""We can now move on with building an exciting new competition for a new audience to complement our existing competitions. ""Our clear ambition is that this new competition will sit alongside the IPL and Big Bash League as one of the world's major cricket tournaments."" Eight new teams playing 36 games over a 38-day summer window, with four home games per team All games televised, with significant free-to-air exposure No scheduling overlap with the existing T20 Blast competition An Indian Premier League-style play-off system to give more incentive for finishing higher up the league A players' draft, with squads of 15 including three overseas players Counties guaranteed at least Â£1.3m each per year The new tournament will run alongside the existing T20 Blast The ECB has said the competition will give cricket the chance to be part of ""mainstream conversation"" and believes the tournament can make the sport ""relevant to a whole new audience"". However,Essex are concernedit will ""exclude"" certain areas of the country, whileMiddlesex feel they will not benefit financiallyfrom Lord's being a likely base for one of the teams. But Graves said they would make sure it benefited all counties and it marked ""an exciting new era"" for cricket in England and Wales. ""The ECB executive and T20 development team will now continue to work with the game as we build the new competition, ensure it is positioned distinctively from our existing competitions and realise its full potential,"" he added. ""All decisions - including the creation and base of each team - will be made within the game, guided by our shared strategy and built on best practice, research and insight. ""The benefits it will bring can deliver a sustainable future for all 18 first-class counties and an exciting future for the game in England and Wales.""

The people who know what colour you'll like in 2019,"As director of colour at WGSN Jane Monnington Boddy's remit is to know what colours will be in demand in the future Korean retailers don't mind you taking lots of photos in their shops, says Jane Monnington Boddy. For Mrs Monnington Boddy that's a good thing. Before her trip to Asia last month she bought a new iPhone 7 with the biggest memory available. It wasn't so she could take loads of holiday snaps, but so that she could record the kind of things people on the other side of the world were buying, wearing, watching and doing. Mrs Monnington Boddy works at WGSN, a London-based company that offers information on current and future trends in fashion, interior design and lifestyle. ""Know what's next"" is its tagline. As director of colour Mrs Monnington Boddy's specific remit is to know precisely what colours will be in demand in the future. In her week-long work trip she attended Seoul Fashion Week, Hong Kong's Art Basel art fair, as well as several other exhibitions. All the time she was carefully gathering information: taking photos, recording videos and taking lots and lots of notes. It is these kind of regular trips and her industry experience that help the 45-year-old to work out the next big colours. ""I think about where colour has been, what's popular and take that into consideration when I think about where it will go in the future,"" she says. Pink has become hugely popular for both men and women Twice a year she takes part in the company's trend summit days where team members from across the world, including Brazil, the US and China, get together to share information. ""At the end of it you feel like your head's going to explode,"" she says. But it is these gatherings that form the basis of the firm's six-monthly predictions on the key upcoming trends. Currently she is working on the firm's colour forecasts for spring/summer 2019. These will be announced in June, giving firms enough time to fire up their production lines. One trend she's followed closely is that of pink. Once seen as a hue just for small girls, it has now become popular for both men and women. ""It takes a long time to become a colour that hits the masses and makes retailers a lot of money,"" she says. While working out what colour is going to be popular in future may seem like a niche pursuit, it's actually big business. Every industry around the world uses colour. Manufacturers of cars, vacuum cleaners, phones, toothbrushes, coffee machines and other household goods all have to choose a colour range for their products. Getting it right can help boost sales. Apple iPhones, KitchenAid mixers, Beats headphones, Kate Spade and The Cambridge Satchel Company have all used colour to make themselves stand out from competitors. Some companies have even trademarked the branding colour they use, protecting themselves from would be copycat rivals in the same industry. Manufacturing firm 3M's canary yellow post-it notes and Tiffany's egg blue box colour, for example, have all been trademarked. ""Every colour conveys its own message and meaning,"" says Pantone's Laurie Pressman ""To sell something you have to first get someone's attention. Colour helps to clarify a product's identity,"" says Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, which provides colour consulting services for brands and products, as well as trend forecasts. Popular colours often reflect what's happening culturally and socially, she says. The growth of the sharing economy, in which people rent beds, cars and other assets directly from one another, means lighter colours such as pale blues could come into fashion. ""Sharing means lightness, you don't want to be bogged down so you're not looking at a heavy palette."" Colours such as brown, which a couple of decades ago was linked to the earth and dirt but is now associated with coffee and chocolate, reflects the growth of those industries, she says. Pantone chose ""greenery"" as its 2017 colour of the year Pantone is best known for its colour standards which provide a unique identifying number for each shade. These numbers mean firms can clearly communicate the precise shade of the particular colour they want to their suppliers. Pantone also provides formulations for manufacturers to make sure the correct shade can be reproduced consistently in different materials. ""Making sure the colours are easily achievable is critically important,"" says Ms Pressman. What the colour is called also matters. ""Peasoup"" was almost chosen as the firm's 2017 colour of the year instead of ""greenery"", but Ms Pressman said it wouldn't have created the right feeling. ""Every colour conveys its own message and meaning,"" she says. But can colour really make you feel something? How a colour makes you feel can differ according to what country you're from Recent research found,externalthat ice hockey teams wearing darker-coloured tops were more likely to be penalised for aggressive fouls. One possible conclusion is that referees had an unconscious bias against darker colours, linking them to the idea of a ""black sheep"" and bad behaviour. Another study,externalfound wearing the colour red could increase the probability of winning sporting contests. But it's hard to find any large-scale scientific studies proving a direct link between colour and behaviour. This is because perceptions of colour are subjective, differing according to your own personal experiences and culture. In China, red is a happy or lucky colour, but in the UK it's typically linked to anger or power. Yet anecdotally at least certain colours are associated with particular feelings. Looking at a bright colour such as yellow can make us feel more cheerful, even if it's fleetingly, while blue is often seen as a calming, reassuring colour. Grey became popular in the aftermath of the financial crisis Mark Woodman, a product consultant and a former president of US-based colour forecasting trade body Color Marketing Group (CMG), says the money firms invest in getting the right colour for their products prove it is important. He has consulted on colour for paint manufacturers, a medical office equipment company, a porcelain manufacturer and even a company that makes the springy shred material used in gift bags and boxes. ""Colours have to connect with the zeitgeist of the times and that is what we work so hard at discerning,"" he says. He points out how the ""vast movement of grey"" began to emerge after the 2008 financial crisis. Similarly during the 2012 US presidential election, undecided and neutral states began to be identified as purple by the media - a blend of the Democratic blue and Republican red colours. The result was that the colour became more popular. ""Colours have to make sense to the living environment,"" he says.

New Paula Hawkins book puzzles critics,"The Girl on the Train was Paula Hawkins's first novel under her own name The only problem with writing a debut novel that sells 20 million copies and spawns a Hollywood film is - your follow-up has a lot to live up to. Paula Hawkins' 2015 debut The Girl on the Train was a publishing phenomenon, and the first reviews for her new book Into The Water are in. And most critics are not impressed. Reviewing it forThe Guardian,external, crime author Val McDermid predicted Hawkins' sales would be ""massive"" but ""her readers' enjoyment may be less so"". McDermid was puzzled by the 11 narrative voices used in Into The Water, which is released in the UK next week. She wrote: ""These characters are so similar in tone and register - even when some are in first person and others in third - that they are almost impossible to tell apart, which ends up being both monotonous and confusing."" She added: ""Hawkins had a mountain to climb after the success of The Girl on the Train and no doubt the sales of her second thriller will be massive. I suspect her readers' enjoyment may be less so."" Slate,external's Laura Miller declared that Into the Water ""isn't an impressive book"". She wrote: ""Its tone is uniformly lugubrious and maudlin, and Hawkins' characters seldom rise to the level of two dimensions, let alone three."" But Miller pointed out: ""None of this will necessarily prevent Into the Water from triumphing at the cash register. The book surely will become a best-seller, if only on the strength of residual name recognition for The Girl on the Train."" Janet Maslin wasn't much more enthusiastic inThe New York Times,external. ""If The Girl on the Train seemed overplotted and confusing to some readers, it is a model of clarity next to this latest effort. ""Her goal may be to build suspense, but all she achieves is confusion. Into the Water is jam-packed with minor characters and stories that go nowhere."" She asks: ""What happened to the Paula Hawkins who structured The Girl on the Train so ingeniously?"" However,The New Statesman,external's Leo Robson defended the book, writing: ""Most of the time, the novel is plausible and grimly gripping. ""Into the Water follows its predecessor in applying laser scrutiny to a small patch, but there are signs of growth and greater ambition."" He described Hawkins's writing as ""addictive"", adding that the novel ""is on a par with The Girl on a Train"". The film adaptation of The Girl on the Train was released last September The Evening Standard,external's David Sexton wrote: ""Unfortunately, Into the Water turns out to be hard work."" ""There's a ridiculous multiplication of narrators from the start, some first-person, others third, so that on first reading it is almost impossible to keep track of who's who and what relation they have to one another... several of the stories never really cohere."" Marcel Berlins inThe Times,externalsaid: ""This novel has its intriguing attributes. ""It does not follow the usual samey fashionable pattern of 'domestic noir' and psychological thrillers. For that Hawkins ought to be commended, even if the result is not a full success. ""She is let down by her overambitious structure and a lack of sufficient tension. Hawkins does not quite pass the second-book test."" Of course, reviews of any kind are unlikely to deter the millions who enjoyed The Girl on the Train. After all, criticsdidn't much likethe film adaptation of her previous book, starring Emily Blunt, but that didn't stop it being a box office success. The Girl on the Train was Hawkins' first book under her own name, but she had previously written a string of chick-lit novels under the pen name Amy Silver.

The real cost of the Southern rail row,"From the financial hit on drivers to the effect on house prices - here are seven facts you may not have known about the Southern rail strikes, which began a year ago. Throughout 2016,58,983Southern services were either fully or partly cancelled. Averaged out across the year, that was more than 160 every day. It was the worst disruption since the rail industry was privatised in 1994, when signal workers went on strike multiple times over changes to their pay. A series of 24 and 48-hour strikes virtually halted train services on 17 occasions over the summer. For more stories from the BBC England data unit follow our Pinterest board,external Southern put its performance down to staffing problems, including rosters for train crew and drivers, shortages of conductors and staff. Passengers on the busiest services found their journey times doubled or even tripled on the days their trains did not run - and even that was only if they had access to a car. Those who drove sat inhours of trafficwhile others told ofÂ£100 taxi faresor having towork from home. Heather Boxer and her three-year-old son Charlie should be able to reach the hospital where is treated for cystic fibrosis in about 90 minutes by train. Instead, because of the risk of strikes they drove from East Grinstead to the Royal Brompton Hospital twice a month. The mother of two said: ""Three hours each way, then the nightmare of trying to park in Chelsea. ""When Charlie was first diagnosed we were living in Redhill and we always used to use the train but then we moved to East Grinstead and the strikes had started, so we just decided we couldn't risk it."" The Government set asideÂ£15min compensation for passengers. And it is picking up the tab for a Â£38m fall in fare revenue as a result of services not running. This is because the Southern franchise, operated by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), involves the government paying a management fee for the company to run it, while the taxpayer bears the financial risk for revenue lost through compensation. More than 84,000 passengers are entitled to claim compensation. So far, 54,500 claims have been approved and Â£12.6m has been paid out. Southern said people would getone twelfth of the value,externalof their annual season ticket for 2016. Monthly season ticket holders are entitled to a month's refund and weekly ticket holders are eligible for four weeks' worth. The scheme is open until 30 April 2017. John Chew left his job rather than become an on-board supervisor There was a cost for drivers and conductors who took strike action. Those who walked out every time would have sacrificed thousands of pounds of pay. A fully qualified Southern driver is paid a basic salary ofÂ£49,001for a 35-hour, four day working week as well as Â£4,475 a year worth of contracted overtime. Conductors based in London are paidÂ£34,863a year, including Sunday working for a 35-hour, four-day week. Overtime can bring the total up to Â£37,000. Assuming a driver went on strike for all six days, they would have been docked an estimatedÂ£235.58a day. A conductor would have lost an estimatedÂ£167.61a day, excluding overtime. Conductor John Chew refused to sign his contract to switch from becoming a conductor to an on-board supervisor. He left his job after 17 years and is about to train to drive 7.5-tonne commercial vehicles. ""I saw some of my old colleagues from Southern a couple of weeks ago. In general the impression I get is that they are profoundly unhappy with what's happening. ""I was lucky as I had some savings but I know a number of them who have families, children, and mortgages, couldn't have taken the step I took."" Over the past year, an average of 11% of all trains were either cancelled or significantly late, meaning they got to their final destination over half an hour late. Across the rest of the industry, it was about 3%. Other GTR-run services, including the Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Southern Metro, were also among the most cancelled and late. In March 2017, the latest figures available, eight out of 10 GTR services (82.3%) arrived at their terminating station on time, the lowest in the country. The average for the rail industry was 91%. Professor Alfred Crossman, of the University of Sussex School of Business, Management and Economics, said the signal workers' strike in 1994 was bigger because it was nationwide, however the Southern strikes have gone on longer. And their ability to impact instantly upon thousands of people meant they were more disruptive even than thejunior doctors' strikeswere during 2016. Professor Crossman said: ""The impact was immediate [with Southern]. In the NHS, operations can be rescheduled. It's inconvenient, but the impact is less immediate, other than A&E which is usually covered by consultants when junior doctors are on strike."" Despite the noticeable disruption across the Southern network, transport workers made up only the third largest group to take industrial action, after people inhealthcareandeducation. House prices continued to rise even in areas affected by the strike Experts say they have not found a direct link between ""poorer"" performing house prices and the strikes, although they ""will not be helping"". House prices continued to rise, but their growth has beenslowing generally. The change has been put down to wages having failed to keep up with the rise in house prices, which seems to have curbed the demand for homes. Doug Shepherd, director of home.co.uk said: ""The fact is that both the London and south-east property markets have slowed markedly and the supply of homes for sale is still increasing."" And buying agent Henry Pryor said: ""I have warned buyers in the affected areas that this is going on, but I have not had anyone not proceed with a purchase on the basis of the strikes and neither have I heard of that from anyone else."" Southern said the impact on passengers was ""now minimal"". ""We're deeply sorry for the disruption passengers have faced, and the effect it has had on the local economy in the past year on Southern, due in the main to industrial action in one form or another,"" a spokesman said.  It has been meeting with the RMT (the conductors' union) and in discussions with Aslef to ""better understand"" why its offer to drivers was rejected. A spokesman for the RMT said: ""We take no pleasure in the fact that this dispute has lasted a year. We believe it could have been resolved right from the start. It's down to the intransigence of the company supported by the government that this has continued and the fact that it comes under a government management contract."" Drivers' union Aslef said: ""We are looking for a resolution which works for staff, passengers and the company."" Rail Minister Paul Maynard said: ""Performance has been consistently better since the new year, and our focus is on making sure passengers keep seeing the benefits of a reliable and efficient service.""

Is India losing Kashmir?,"Schoolgirls have participated in protests against Indian rule As India's most restive region stares down the abyss of what a commentator calls another ""hot summer of violence"", the doom-laden headline has returned with a vengeance: Is India losing Kashmir? Last summer was one of the bloodiest in the Muslim-dominated valley in recent years. Following the killing of influential militant Burhan Wani by Indian forces last July, more than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes during a four-month-long security lockdown in the valley. It's not looking very promising this summer. This month's parliamentary election in Srinagar wasscarred by violenceand a record-low turnout of voters. To add fuel to the fire,graphic social videossurfaced claiming to show abuses by security forces and young people who oppose Indian rule. A full-blown protest by students has now erupted on the streets; and, in a rare sight, evenschoolgirls are throwing stones,externaland hitting police vehicles. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, who leads an awkward ruling coalition with the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), rushed to Delhi on Monday to urge the federal government to ""announce a dialogue and show reconciliatory gestures"". The 'studious' 12-year-old victim of India's Kashmir problem Eight killed in Kashmir poll violence The election where no-one came to vote The teenager blinded by pellets in Kashmir Reports,externalsay Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh told her that they could not ""offer a dialogue with separatists and other restive groups in the valley"" while fierce violence and militant attacks continued. Former chief minister and leader of the regional National Conference party Farooq Abdullah warned India that it was""losing Kashmir"",external. What Mr Abdullah suggested was unexceptionable: the government should begin talking with the stakeholders - Pakistan, the separatists, mainstream parties, theminority Kashmiri Hindus- and start ""thinking of not a military solution, but a political way"". Political leaders say Kashmir needs a political and ""not a military solution"" With more than 500,000 security forces in the region, India is unlikely to lose territory in Kashmir. But Shekhar Gupta, a leading columnist, says that while Kashmir is ""territorially secure, we are fast losing it emotionally and psychologically"". The abysmal 7% turnout in the Srinagar poll proved that ""while your grip on the land is firm, you are losing its people"". So what is new about Kashmir that is worrying India and even provoking senior army officials to admit that the situation is fragile? For one, a more reckless and alienated younger generation of local youth is now leading the anti-India protests. More than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30. Many of them are angry and confused. India and Pakistan have disputed the territory for nearly 70 years - since independence from Britain Both countries claim the whole territory but control only parts of it Two out of three wars fought between India and Pakistan centred on Kashmir Since 1989 there has been an armed revolt in the Muslim-majority region against rule by India High unemployment and complaints of heavy-handed tactics by security forces battling street protesters and fighting insurgents have aggravated the problem Ajaz, a 19-year-old student in Budgam, told me that hope had evaporated for his generation ""in face of Indian oppression"" and he and his friends did not ""fear death"".  When I took him aside after a while to ask about his ambitions in life, he said he wanted to become a bureaucrat and serve Kashmir. ""It is wrong to say that the Kashmiri youth has become fearless. He just feels alienated, sidelined and humiliated. When he feels like that, fear takes a backseat, and he becomes reckless. This is irrational behaviour,"" National Conference leader Junaid Azim Mattoo told me. Secondly, the new younger militants are educated and come from relatively well-off families. Wani, the militant who was killed last July, headed a prominent rebel group and came from a  highly-educated upper-class Kashmiri family: his father is a government school teacher. Wani's younger brother, Khalid, who was killed by security forces in 2013, was a student of political science. The new commander of the rebel group, Zakir Rashid Bhat, studied engineering in the northern Indian city of Chandigarh. There have been clashes between protesters and security forces this summer Thirdly, the two-year-old ruling alliance, many say, has been unable to deliver on its promises. An alliance between a regional party which advocates soft separatism (PDP) and a federal Hindu nationalist party (BJP), they believe, makes for the strangest bedfellows, hobbled by two conflicting ideologies trying to work their way together in a contested, conflicted land. Fourthly, the government's message on Kashmir appears to be backfiring. When Mr Modi recently said the youth in Kashmir had tochoose between terrorism and tourism,,externalmany Kashmiris accused him of trivialising their ""protracted struggle"". When BJP general secretary Ram Madhav told a newspaper that his government""would have choked"",externalthe valley people if it was against them, many locals said it was proof of the government's arrogance. Fifth, the shrill anti-Muslim rhetoric by radical Hindu groups and incidents ofcow protection vigilantesattacking Muslim cattle traders in other parts of India could end up further polarising people in the valley. ""The danger,"" a prominent leader told me, ""is that the moderate Kashmiri Muslim is becoming sidelined, and he is being politically radicalised."" The security forces differ and say they are actually worried about rising ""religious radicalisation"" among the youth in the valley. A top army official in Kashmir, Lt-Gen JS Sadhu, told a newspaper that the ""public support to terrorists, their glorification andincreased radicalisation,externalare issues of concern"". The young people in Kashmir say they are angry and alienated One army official told me that religious radicalisation was a ""bigger challenge than stone pelting protesters"". He said some 3,000 Saudi-inspired Wahhabi sect mosques had sprung up in Kashmir in the past decade. Most Kashmiris say the government should be more worried about ""political radicalisation"" of the young, and that fears of religious radicalisation were exaggerated and overblown. Also, the low turnout in this month's elections has rattled the region's mainstream parties. ""If mainstream politics is delegitimised and people refuse to vote for them, the vacuum will be obviously filled up with a disorganised mob-led constituency,"" Mr Mattoo of the National Conference said. In his memoirs, Amarjit Singh Daulat, the former chief of India's spy agency RAW wrote that ""nothing is constant; least of all Kashmir"". But right now, the anomie and anger of the youth, and a worrying people's revolt against Indian rule, appear to be the only constants.

How did your MP vote on Brexit bill?,"MPs voted by 494 to 122 to back the Brexit bill in a second vote in the House of Commons. The bill now moves to the Lords. The bill gives Theresa May the go-ahead to formally tell the EU that the UK is leaving, by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Conservative and Labour MPs were again under orders to back the bill, while the SNP and Lib Dems were among parties whose leaders opposed it.

âWeâre all Labourââ¦ except now they may vote Tory,"This video can not be played Labour voters in Porthcawl weigh up their options She hardly cuts the jib of a radical. But despite warnings against complacency from the prime minister's own lips today, be in no doubt - the Tories are deadly serious about a potential reshaping of Britain at this election. Any day on the trail is precious campaigning time. Leaders only tend to turn up where they think they are in the game. So a Welsh visit, Theresa May's fifth in three months, is revealing. It shows the Conservatives are not just contemplating a bigger majority by scooping up traditional Tory-Labour marginal seats in England. But even if you ignore the polls, senior sources indicate they could possibly return to levels of support not seen in Wales for more than 30 years. And privately they expect gains in Scotland too. Theresa May hopes to make her claim there are no Tory no-go areas come true. The European referendum has redrawn the map. She wants to colour it blue. For that to happen here in Wales, that means overturning decades of support for Labour in many areas. Are voters ready to do that in high enough numbers? It's of course far too early to tell. Don't forget the Tories already improved their share of the vote significantly in 2015, winning 11 seats. But on the Porthcawl seafront in Bridgend, the backyard of the Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones, we met plenty of voters who are certainly ready to consider it. The Edwards, father and son, told me they'd both been Labour voters all their lives. But could they switch? Mark told me his 85-year-old father had already done so. He said ""she is wonderful, best we've had,"" when he started talking about Theresa May. Mr Edwards senior told me he had been 'life-long Labour' but that Jeremy Corbyn was ""30 or 40 years out of date - he wants to introduce a gimmick, communism"". He was plainly angry about what's happened to the Labour party in recent years, saying it had been led by ""conmen"". Mr Edwards parting shot was ""bye, bye Mr Corbyn"". Labour has held Bridgend for the past 30 years Another voter, Brian Holley presented his own dilemma, that could be shared by many voters in Wales, where overall, the vote was to leave the EU. Brian told me he'd voted to Leave but his local Labour MP had backed Remain. That was reason for him to be, as he expressed it, ""on the border"" between sticking with Labour and voting Tory for the first time. Sharing a morning cuppa with him was Eira Linehan, who said for the ""first time ever"" she was considering voting Tory because while she agreed with Jeremy Corbyn's ideas, they wouldn't work in the ""real world"". They said ""we're all Labour"" in their constituency, but they are likely to vote Tory because of Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, even though, ""my father will be spinning in his grave"". Conversations about voting intentions seven weeks out are absolutely no substitute for the final poll of course. And we are only at the early stages of this campaign. It's worth noting too there were warnings of Labour taking heavy fire in the Welsh Assembly elections last year. In the end, they remained the largest party, and Carwyn Jones kept his job as First Minister, albeit with the help of Plaid Cymru. Yet even the Welsh Labour leader was plain to the BBC today that Jeremy Corbyn still has to ""prove himself"", warning there is a ""mountain to climb"". In remarks that could become very significant after the election, Mr Jones was clear ""Jeremy is leading the campaign and Jeremy will take credit or responsibility"". He also called for a manifesto that has the ""widest buy-in possible from people"". But 'wide buy-in'? Support that Labour can truly bank on? Not a bit of it. Yet, as Theresa May left the community centre where she had talked to activists tonight, a small, but determined crowd had been waiting in the rain, if only for the chance to shout at her car as her convoy left at speed. As she swept away, the PM won't be in any doubt that winning Wales or any traditionally Labour territories won't be easy. And in the volatile world of 2017 politics, there is nowhere where she can be guaranteed of a universally warm welcome.

Could this be Angus Robertson's last PMQs?,"This video can not be played The SNP's Angus Robertson clashed with Theresa May at the final PMQs before the election Angus Robertson has become perhaps the most high-profile SNP MP. He leads the third biggest group in parliament and gets to quiz the prime minister weekly. His questioning at PMQs has won him plaudits from commentators at Westminster. But the Conservatives are hoping he could be one of the biggest scalps on 8 June. Senior Tories tell meMoray- the constituency Mr Robertson has held since 2001 and his party since 1987 - is one of their top targets in Scotland. Polls suggest the Tories are on the up in Scotland. Although some are playing down the idea of the party winning as many as 12 seats - as one poll indicated - they are happy to entertain the idea they could take Moray. That's despite Mr Robertson winning by more than 9,000 votes last time. So, why is this a Tory target? Election campaign latest The Scottish battleground seats Well it's the area of Scotland which came closest to backing leave in the EU referendum (every counting area in Scotland voted remain, but in Moray the remain vote was 50.1% remain, by 49.9% leave). The Tories hope they can win over those leave voters with their Brexit plans. They'll be hoping too that their vocal opposition to a another independence referendum (which will be key to their Scottish campaign) appeals to the 57.5% of Moray voters who voted No in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The party also had an encouraging result here in the equivalent Holyrood seat. Last year (pre-EU referendum) at the Scottish Parliament elections,the Conservatives cut the SNP majority from almost 11,000 to under 3,000. The Tories have picked MSP Douglas Ross to contest the seat. Are the SNP worried? If so, they're not admitting it for now. They point out they've held the seat for 30 years and have no intention of letting that change. They also point out Mr Ross hasn't quit his Holyrood list seat yet,unlike his colleague John Lamontwho has said he'll leave Holyrood to contest Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk. If Mr Ross was confident, the SNP suggest, he would follow suit. And as for Mr Robertson himself, he was quick to respond to this piece on social media. Using his twitter feed he said: ""Don't mind disappointing the Tories, but I look forward to defeating their candidate for the third time in a row."" Nevertheless, expect the Tories to put a lot of time, money and effort into campaigning here, especially with local fishermen and those in the agricultural sector. Expect the SNP to put a lot into it too. It's a campaign and result we'll be watching closely.

Fake news!," Friday 21st April 2017 Spoofs and tall tales are a staple of internet music discourse. Every now and then something appears online which may seem remarkable, and could well be true, but turns out to have been created as a prank to fool unsuspecting fans. It's a world away from the definition of fake news as is applied to current affairs in 2017, although as we'll see, there certainly have been fake music news stories that overlapped with international politics. Twitter: Daddy Lieb It's for the children 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info In 2014, there was a kerfuffle around a news story taken from Twitter, in which it appeared that doting new father Dan Lieberman had named his twin boysGhostfaceandRaekwonafter his favourite rappers inWu-Tang Clan. He even provided a picture as proof, which was thenInstagrammed by the real Raekwonwith the caption ""This is live, family named their twins Raekwon & ghostface!!! #wu4thebabies"" However, it later emerged that the form in question is not a binding legal document, and had been created by Dan as a joke. He posted on his Facebook page: ""I got the best Father's Day gift I could get yesterday, but this is a close second."" [LISTEN] Nirvana's manager talks about Kurt Cobain Derek Erdman is the receptionist at Sub Pop records, first musical home ofNirvana, and one day while bored at work, he decided to place a fake advert on Craigslist, using photos he found online, in which he posed as a former flatmate of Kurt Cobain's (and former member of a pretend grunge band called Gruntruck) with some of his possessions to offload. These included a Swatch phone, a video game called Kingman and a pair of skis, with the quote: ""He owed us rent and said he would get the box when he came back and gave us money but he never came back, then when he was famous he never really talked to any of us again."" The reaction was quick and feverish, with fans rushing to grab some unheard of Nirvana memorabilia. In a since-deleted interview with the music siteRevolt, Derek was asked if, seriously, anyone really wanted Kurt's skis, to which he replied, ""THEY WANT THEM BAD. They also want that video game. I've gotten a lot of replies from 'serious collectors' and people who will pay for shipping. Have you ever shipped skis? That sounds like it would be really difficult. Not too many people wrote about the Swatch phone, which was surprising."" Radiohead's working method is often to sit on songs until they've found the right way to perform them, which can mean that some can be overlooked or simply left behind. So it's not really that big of a surprise for fans to uncover a 'lost' song of this sort and post it online. And indeed, that's what happened, in a music forum. The song, uploaded and shared with feverish intensity, was supposedly entitled Putting Ketchup in the Fridge and sounds exactly like an outtake from The Bends, with Thom Yorke's quavery voice in full effect. The only problem is, it's not Thom Yorke's voice, but that of a Toronto singer-songwriter called Christopher Stopa. And the song is actually called Sit Still. It was released in 2001 to very little fanfare. Speaking toThe Vancouver Observer, Christopher said: ""I tried to push that song for 10 years, but if people are listening to it now, and like the song, it's an indication that I believed in it. There are lots of great songs on the internet. People who listened to my song weren't just looking for a great song, they were specifically looking for a song by Radiohead.""

Although this may seem to be the most feasible of the stories listed here, the rumour thatDrakeandRihannawere creating something together has a backstory that is just as plausible, and therefore just as suspect. In August 2016, fans were delighted to discover that a website had been registered with the URL drakeandrihanna.com, and a countdown clock. Surprise album releases being what they are, this did not seem beyond the realms of possibility, butTMZdiscovered that the site was actually set up by web celeb Joanne the Scammer (played by Branden Miller). It was an act of revenge, after Joanne had been turned down for a selfie with Drake at the VMA awards. Branden created the site as a prank, then when fans started to take it seriously, he issued a video explaining that it wasn't real, and why he did it. [WATCH] Eminem performes Stan in the Live Lounge 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info Marshall Mathers has been the subject of two internet news hoaxes that claim that he has died in violent circumstances. The first is thathe died in a car crash in the early 2000sand has been replaced by a near-identical replica - a yarn that has taken on similar characteristics to the conspiracy theory thatPaul McCartneydied in 1966, and will probably keep on popping up from time to time, whenever the (possibly not) real Slim Shady has a record out. But in 2013, a Facebook post was widely shared, with a grisly photo that purported to show him being attacked by a man with a knife. The link in the post then opened up a series of spam windows, but diligent journalists did check that all was well before exposing the hoax. A representative from theEminemcamp toldE! News: ""He remains unstabbed."" Kim Kardashian West: ""Did I juist hear Cher has passed away? Is this real? OMG"" 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info Twitter is very good at spreading breaking news and sharing emotional reactions, so the death of a beloved pop star is one of those moments in which the social media site is the perfect place to be. However, it's always a good idea to be sure of your facts before rushing to put fingertip to screen, as Kim Kardashian West found out in 2012. A tweet claiming to have re-tweeted a headline from CNNannounced thatCherhad died, and before long ""RIP Cher"" had become a worldwide trending topic, with news organisations scrambling to ascertain if this was true or not. Caught up in the moment, Kim tweeted ""Did I juist hear Cher has passed away? Is this real? OMG,"" and then: ""I hope this is a Twitter joke and not true. I don't see it on the news anywhere. I'm praying it's not true…"" It wasn't true, and she later tweeted: ""Can't believe people would make up a sick joke like Cher died. These people need to get a life! Thanks Twitter for clearing that up."" Twitter: Hoax Slayer: Justin Timberlake not moving to Roanoke 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info In July 2016, a report on a website called Kypo 6 flew across social media, claiming thatJustin Bieberhad told reporters that he was leaving Los Angeles and moving out to San Marcos, Texas. It quoted him as saying: ""I'm just tired of the LA lifestyle and I feel like, at this point in my life, I'd rather just live in a place full of real, genuine people."" Howerver, it was very similar to a story on a site called The Clancy Report, suggesting that Justin had fallen in love with Roanoke, a city in North Texas. And some digging by Texan local news siteChronreveals that this exact quote has also been attributed toJustin Timberlake, Eminem and Nicolas Cage, to illustrate false news stories about Hollywood stars moving to less celebrated locations, such as El Paso, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and Naperville, Illinois. Metallica - Atlas, Rise! live for BBC Radio 1 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info The most recent fake music news story to be passed around as truth concerned Lars Ulrich, motormouth drummer inMetallica. On Easter Sunday a story was posted on the metal news websiteThe Metal Denclaiming that Lars had announced his retirement from music, effective immediately, just as the band were about to head out on a world tour. He was quoted as saying, ""As we get older, there are phases of life that we enter into, and being a musician just isn't fun anymore,"" and suggested he'd be devoting his attention to other fields of creative endeavour. However, while several news outlets ran the story, it wasn't true, as was later confirmed by Metallica's management, to the siteMetalTalk. NME: Menswear platinum album revealed as prank 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info The Britpop bandMenswe@rnever sold a great many records, but they were very heavily featured in the music press of the time and their presence at the party cast a long shadow. So when their former guitarist Chris Gentry posted a picture of himself holding a platinum disc on Twitter claiming that their debut album Nuisance had finally sold more that 300,000 copies, there was an air of surprise, but not total shock. However, it turned out that all he had done is buy the disc on eBay and then insert the band's artwork. BBC 6 Music presenter and former Menswe@r drummer Matt Everitt toldNME: ""My annual royalty cheques (approximately £83) would suggest something is amiss here. However, I'm currently expecting our long-delayed Led Zeppelin style reunion at the O2 and 15 CD/DVD/Blu-ray boxset retrospective of our lengthy and critically acclaimed career to become a reality, just in time for Christmas."" The satirical news site Holy Moly ran a story that the band's singer Johnny Dean had been so taken in that he immediately started contacting his representatives to find out where his share of the money had gone. Chris Gentry has since deleted his Twitter account. [LISTEN] Elton John was not the first victim of a celebrity prank call In 2015, a Russian phone prankster named Vladimir Krasnov, or ""Vovan"",rang Elton Johnclaiming to be President Putin and wishing to discuss gay rights.Sir Elton, a critic of the Russian premier's ""isolating and prejudiced"" views, took the call and had what he felt was a decent stab at an opening debate on a subject close to his heart. Sadly, it was all a hoax, with parts of the recorded conversation ending up on Russian state TV. Krasnov told BBC News: ""It turned out that Elton John was really expecting that call, so he really believed he was talking to the people we said we were. He said, 'Thank you, you have made my day. This day and this conversation were the most wonderful of my life.'"" Had things been left at that, this would just be an audacious prank played on a pop star. But then something unexpected happened - the fake news became real. Both Elton John and Russian government sources have confirmed that an actual phone call took place shortly afterwards, with Elton telling theToday Programme: ""[Putin] was very affable, he was very apologetic, he was very sincere. As soon as I can get a date in my diary that coincides with him, then I will be going... to Moscow and I will meet him."" 10 long-awaited albums that will be the soundtrack of 2019 8 predictions for music in 2019 from expert pop forecasters 7 of the most scathing record reviews of the year 9 brilliant music videos that you may have missed in 2018 Test your knowledge of the year in music with our poptastic quiz 7 heartbreaking Christmas songs that might make you cry Check out the artists we're taking to SXSW! 5 things we learned from Bros' chat on Radio 2 How Bring Me the Horizon became one of the UKâs biggest bands Seven of the most outrageous bands ever  Sign into the BBC,orRegister"
