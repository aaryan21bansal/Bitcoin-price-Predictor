Church massacre survivors seek justice,"Men, women, children, even babies - were shot or hacked to death inside the church The Monrovia Church massacre in 1990 was the worst single atrocity of the Liberian civil war. About 600 civilians, including many children, were killed while taking refuge in a church. Now, four survivors are bringing a claim for damages against one of the men they believe was responsible, reports Elizabeth Blunt who was a BBC correspondent in Liberia at the time. It was July 1990, and rebel fighters were advancing on the capital, Monrovia. President Samuel Doe was holed up in his vast, gloomy Executive Mansion. After dark bands of soldiers roamed the streets, looting shops and warehouses and seeking out people from Nimba County, the area where the rebellion had started. They dragged the men from their homes, beating and often killing them. Hundreds of terrified families, looking for a safer place to sleep, took refuge in St Peter's Lutheran Church - a spacious building in a walled compound. Huge Red Cross flags flew at every corner. Bullet holes on church windows But on the night of 29 July, government soldiers came over the wall and started killing those inside. An estimated 600 people - men, women, children, even babies - were shot or hacked to death with machetes before the order was given to stop. A Guinean woman doctor, who was one of the first to reach the church the next day, described to me the scene of utter horror. Dead bodies were everywhere. The only sign of life was a baby crying. She describes having to walk over corpses to reach the child, but when she picked it up and tried to comfort it, she said she suddenly saw a flicker of movement, and then another. A few children had survived, protected by the bodies of their parents, but only when they saw her, a civilian and a woman taking care of the baby, did they dare to come out. One of the child survivors is among those now suing for damages. American missionary Bette McCrandall was there, too, that morning - she had lain awake the previous night, listening to everything that was happening from the Lutheran bishop's compound close by. She says those events have stayed with her, even all these years afterwards, as they have with all the survivors. ""The memories of that day and that night don't leave me,"" she says. St Peter's Lutheran Church has now been rebuilt This was the worst atrocity of the war, the event so shocking that it drove neighbouring countries to mount an armed intervention. Yet no-one has ever been prosecuted or held responsible. The man now being taken to court in the US is Moses Thomas, formerly a colonel in the much-feared Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (Satu), based at the Executive Mansion. Survivors have identified him as one of those giving orders that night. Now he lives in the US state of Pennsylvania. Like many Liberians, he was given what is known as ""temporary protected status"", because of the atrocities which were going on back home. Liberia has had a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and Mr Thomas was among those recommended for prosecution - but no cases have ever been brought. So now a movement has started to bring them to justice outside Liberia. Speaking to the BBC after being served court papers on Monday, Mr Thomas called the allegation ""nonsense"". ""I don't want to give any credence to the allegation,"" he said. ""No-one in my unit had anything to do with the attack on the church."" Hassan Bility, who heads the Global Justice and Research Project in Monrovia, said he was pleased with the latest development. ""For 27 years the survivors of this massacre have fought and laboured for justice without success, and nobody has been paying any attention - not the Liberian government, not anybody outside. So this is a small victory,"" he says. 1989:Charles Taylor starts rebellion against President Samuel Doe 1990:Doe horrifically killed by rebels 1997:Civil war ends after death of some 250,000 people. Taylor elected president 2012:Taylor convicted of war crimes in neighbouring Sierra Leone Liberia's key dates Is ex-warlord pulling election strings from UK prison? Ex-footballer George Weah faces his toughest challenge Ms McCrandall certainly sees it as important. ""For me,"" she says, ""it is a chance for him to own up to what he has done, and on whose orders. ""That person will have to live and die with the guilt of what he has done. And in my mind it is comforting to me that this issue has not been put to rest, that the case has not been dropped."" The snag is that for the moment this is only a civil suit, not a criminal case. A number of criminal prosecutions have started in Europe, where courts will hear cases for war crimes under so-called ""universal jurisdiction"". In the US that is more difficult, so campaigners against impunity have had to be ingenious.One Liberian warlord, known as ""Jungle Jabbah"", was recently prosecuted for immigration fraud,external, since he had falsely claimed on his application that he had never belonged to any armed group. Mr Thomas is being sued in a civil action by four of the survivors. If they win, he is unlikely to be able to afford much in damages. But campaigners hope that the evidence which comes out in court will make the American authorities question his ""protected"" status, opening the way for a criminal prosecution or deportation. But if he is deported back to Liberia, what then? Would he go on trial? Liberia never set up a special court and has never tried any war crimes cases. Many suspects still hold high positions. Campaigner Hassan Bility clings to the hope that now, with a new government now in place, things might be different. Current president George Weah was not involved in the conflict because he was playing football in Europe ""The current President, George Weah, was totally disconnected from the war,"" he says. ""He was not part of any faction; he was playing football in Europe... And he gets a lot of his support from poor people, the ones who really suffered in the war... We have the opportunity right now to do this"". Ex-footballer George Weah faces his toughest challenge Did Liberia's first female leader make a difference?

Britons killed in Grand Canyon crash named,"Becky Dobson and her boyfriend Stuart Hill died in the crash A couple are among three British tourists killed in a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon. Becky Dobson, 27, Stuart Hill, 30, and his brother Jason Hill, 32, died in Saturday's crash, Hualapai Police said. Three other Britons and the pilot were injured on the tour of the canyon but they were not rescued until some eight hours later on Sunday morning. Ms Dobson's father, Peter Dobson, told the Press Association his daughter was ""full of life"" and ""always happy"". The group were away celebrating Stuart's 30th birthday, Mr Dobson said. He added the couple were ""really happy together"" and ""just enjoyed being with each other"". ""The whole thing is just terrible."" Friends pay tribute to victims Britons Ellie Milward, 29, Jonathan Udall, 32, and Jennifer Barham, 39, were injured in the crash, along with pilot Scott Booth, 42, police said. Jonathan Udall and his wife Ellie Milward, both on left, were injured in the crash Witnesses told local reporters they had seen survivors running away from the crash site and shouting. It is not clear what caused the crash and witnesses say rescue efforts have been hampered by high winds. The helicopter crashed on Saturday evening and survivors were not rescued until the early hours of Sunday morning. The youngest of the victims, Ms Dobson, worked as a veterinary receptionist for Vets 4 Pets in Worthing, West Sussex. In her profile on the practice's website, she described her love for animals, as well as her dream of becoming a veterinary nurse. ""I also love to travel the world and explore what is out there beyond good old Worthing,"" she said. The practice paid tribute to Ms Dobson, saying her colleagues were ""devastated"" by her loss. Jason Hill worked as a corporate lawyer for Shoosmiths LLP in its Milton Keynes office. The firm's chief executive, Claire Rowe, said he was well respected and loved by all those who worked with him. ""He was hardworking, full of energy and enjoyable to work with, and we are greatly saddened by the news of his death and that of his brother Stuart,"" she added. Gabby Hart, a local news reporter for the station KSNV, said it had taken more than eight hours for the survivors to be removed from the site because of the terrain and high winds. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are told by witnesses and also by rescuers that people were trying to help once they saw this accident happen, they couldn't get down to the helicopter quick enough. ""They [the survivors] had to receive care there on site until emergency crews were able to remove them from the scene."" The chief of the local Hualapai Police, Francis Bradley, called the incident ""very tragic"" and described the terrain as ""extremely rugged"". He added rescue efforts had been hampered by severe weather conditions and gusts of up to 50mph. The helicopter came down, during a tour of the canyon, on Saturday evening In a statement, Brenda Halvorson, the chief executive of the helicopter company involved - Papillon Airways - said the company extended its heartfelt sympathy to the families of the dead and injured. On its website, Papillon calls itself ""the world's largest aerial sightseeing company"" and says it flies more than 600,000 people a year. The Grand Canyon, which is more than 1.6km (one mile) deep, is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the US. A UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are providing support to the families of six British visitors involved in a helicopter accident at the Grand Canyon on 10 February, and we are in close contact with the US emergency services.""

How will scandal affect donations?,"Accusations Oxfam concealed findings its staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011 have led members of the public to admit they are now doubtful about donating to any charity. The British organisation's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence has resigned in the wake of the revelations but further action is required to restore the faith of donors. ""Absolutely - to any charity,"" says IT security analyst Anil, 40, when asked if he has been put off donating. ""I feel bad saying that but I don't feel confident in what goes on behind the scenes. ""I know the majority of people who work there are very good at what they do but the management is shocking. That [recent allegations] is shocking."" The extent of the damage to public faith and donations is yet to be felt but for retail professional James, 52, the claims only add to his frustrations with the third sector. ""My wife has said she definitely will not give money to Oxfam now,"" he says. ""This has dented public opinion in a very detrimental way."" He adds: ""I think there are some issues with charities anyway. I have a bit of a problem, for example, with how much they pay their chief executives. ""I'm concerned about how much of the money I actually give makes it to the causes."" This video can not be played Michelle Russell, from Charity Commission, says the regulator is ""very angry"" ""It's an upsetting case,"" Daniel Fluskey, from the Institute of Fundraising, told BBC Radio 5 live. ""This will have an impact on public trust and confidence in Oxfam. ""I know they've taken a number of steps to get in touch with all of their supporters to tell them what they've done and that's going to have to continue."" Reality Check: How much money goes to Oxfam? Oxfam to meet government after Haiti claims Oxfam did not give watchdog 'full details' Last year, Oxfam had a total income of Â£409m - of which Â£176m came from the UK government and other public authorities. Of the rest, Â£108m came from donations and legacies and Â£91m from sales in its shops. Other international aid organisations have been quick to distance themselves from the story. The British Red Cross has reassured its supporters it has ""a zero tolerance policy to any form of sexual harassment and misconduct"". It said there had been ""no dismissals... for reasons relating to sexual harassment, abuse or paedophilia in at least the past five years"". For some members of the public, Oxfam's mistakes reflect badly on it alone. Account manager Laura, 39, insists the accusations would have no impact on her decision to donate to other organisations. ""No, not at all,"" she says. ""Definitely not."" ""I only really select a few charities to donate to and Oxfam isn't one of them,"" she adds. ""If it was a different charity then yes it would [affect my decision to donate to them]."" Aid organisations must now be seen to be making real strides to improve transparency as they bid restore the public's faith. ""I think all charities now need to subscribe to some sort of governance and compliance and it needs to be available to the public whenever they want to see it,"" Anil adds. ""Who gets what, what bonuses are there, where is the money allocated to? ""There should be internal auditing by an external company to see exactly where the money is going and what it is being spent on."" This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt: 'They did absolutely the wrong thing' The concern for many in the sector now is about the long-term effects of the story, and experts are warning against complacency. Conservative MP Paul Scully, who sits on the International Development Committee, said the scandal could have wider implications for international aid. ""The long term concern about this is the risk of people not wanting to donate to charities that do amazing work across the world and also to those people that it becomes another argument about why not to spend money on international development. ""There is a disincentive in the system [for charities to be more transparent] because charities are competing against one another for donations and so that means there is the fear that if something tarnishes their reputation it may affect their donations."" Mr Fluskey said charities need to think about public trust and confidence ""in all areas"" of their work. He said organisations need to make sure they are ""open and transparent"" and ""working to the right values"". ""We know that people care about causes and that they do want to give support to charities - we can't take that for granted, but we believe the British public will continue to support charities where they see them working according to the high standards they expect.""

How much money goes to Oxfam?,"Some newspapers have again questioned the amount spent on overseas aid by the UK afterallegations of sexual misconductby aid workers. International aid summits since the 1970s have been urging countries to spend 0.7% of their national income on overseas development assistance (ODA), popularly known as foreign aid. The UK government first did so in 2013, and approved legislation requiring it to do so in 2015. In 2016, that translated to a total spend of Â£13.4bn,according to the Department for International Development,external. Some of that money went to charities. Oxfam received Â£31.7m,externalfrom the UK government, which is about a quarter of a percent of what the government spends on foreign aid each year. But it is a sizeable chunk of Oxfam's funding. The charity had a total income of Â£409m last year, of which Â£176m came from government and other public authorities. Of the rest, Â£108m came from donations and legacies and Â£91m from sales in its shops. Its total income put it at number four on the list of UK charities, behind Cancer Research, the British Heart Foundation and Macmillan Cancer Support, according to the 2017Top 100 Charities Fundraising Spotlight.,external About 64% of UK foreign aid is bilateral aid, which is sent directly to the countries involved. Last year, the top three recipients were Pakistan, Syria and Ethiopia. The remaining 36% is multilateral aid, which is distributed by international organisations including charities. The top recipient of UK multilateral aid is the International Development Association, which is part of the World Bank. It received Â£1.1bn from the UK last year. The second item in the graph above was the part of the UK's contribution to the EU budget that may be counted as development aid. The EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future. Oxfam's Â£31.7m puts it just outside the top 20 recipients of multilateral aid.

Gay skaters make Winter Olympics history,"Canadian figure skater Eric Radford has said he ""might explode with pride"", after becoming the first openly gay male Winter Olympics champion. Radford took gold at the Pyeongchang Games in the team figure skating event, alongside his partner Meagan Duhamel. The pair performed a beautiful routine set to Adele's Hometown Glory. US skater Adam Rippon, the first openly gay athlete to reach the US Winter Olympics team, won bronze in the same event at the Gangneung Ice Arena. He skated to Coldplay's O, and Arrival of the Birds by Cinematic Orchestra. The team figure skating, which debuted four years ago, sees each nation compete in the men's, women's, pairs', and ice dance disciplines. The team with most points overall takes the gold medal. They join openly bisexual Dutch speed skater Ireen Wust - her nation's most successful Olympian with 10 medals, including golds from four consecutive Games. After his win, Radford, 33, wrote on Twitter: ""This is amazing! I literally feel like I might explode with pride."" Gold medalists (L-R) Patrick Chan, Gabrielle Daleman, Kaetlyn Osmond, Meagan Duhamel, Eric Radford, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Team Canada Later, he tweeted a smiling picture with Rippon, adding the hashtag ""#outandproud"". Fellow Canadian medallist and LGBT advocate Mark Tewksbury, who won a swimming gold in 1992, sent his congratulations. ""FINALLY in 2018 an openly gay man is on top of the podium,"" he said. ""No more isolation for LGBT sport men!!"" ""It's fantastic,"" said Angela Ruggiero, the head of the International Olympics Committee's Athletes Commission. ""[He's] paving the way to send a really positive message globally to say that everyone should be accepted and that everyone should be able to compete at the Olympic Games."" Allow Twitter content?

Decades before Radford and Rippon, gay British skater John Curry won a figure skating gold at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck.

Airport shut as WW2 bomb found in Thames,"Planes are grounded at the airport following the discovery of the device An operation to remove a 500kg World War Two bomb that has forced the closure of London City Airport will continue through the night. The airport has been shut all day and all flights cancelled, affecting up to 16,000 passengers, officials said. The bomb was found at George V Dock on Sunday during planned work at the east London airport. The Royal Navy said the bomb would be exploded underwater overnight and the airport should reopen on Tuesday. Police have confirmed families who were evacuated from around the site can return to their homes after the device was moved to another location in the dock. However, a new cordon area around some roads south-east of the airport will come into effect from 21:00 GMT as the ordnance is transported further. A tunnel used by some rail services from St Pancras International will also be closed around midnight. The airport says the operation to remove the bomb is ""proceeding well"" The Ministry of Defence says bomb disposal teams deal with about 60 German World War Two bombs a year The airport was shut at 22:00 GMT on Sunday when the bomb was discovered lying in a bed of silt 15m underwater. Lieutenant Commander Jonny Campbell, who is leading the bomb disposal diving unit, said the 1.5m-long device would be floated down the River Thames and ""high-grade military explosives"" would be attached to it. He said his team had ""a long night ahead"" before the bomb is finally destroyed underwater on Tuesday morning. The device was discovered during planned works at the airport According to the airport's website, a total of 261 arrivals and departures had been scheduled for Monday. ""All flights today are cancelled but some airlines have moved their flights to other airports - CityJet to Southend and Alitalia to Stansted"", the airport said. Passengers have been told not to travel to the airport as the terminal is closed andto contact their airline,external. Among passengers affected were Tottenham Hotspur fans heading to Italy for a Champions League game against Juventus. The north London club advised any fans flying to Milan to ""contact their airline as soon as possible"", ahead of the match in Turin on Tuesday. Passengers were turned away from the airport and all flights were stopped Spurs fan David, 52, was booked to fly to Milan on Monday before taking a connecting train to Turin ahead of the Champions League away match. British Airways has now booked him onto a new flight on Tuesday, he said, but he was disappointed he has lost a hotel night in Turin. ""There's no sense of 'you're out of pocket for a night in a hotel',"" he said. Robert Sinclair, CEO of the airport, apologised and said: ""The airport is cooperating fully with the Met Police and Royal Navy and working hard to safely remove the device and resolve the situation as quickly as possible."" The first stage of the operation was to free the bomb shell from the silt so it can be floated for removal The device has been moved to another location in the dock before it is floated further down the Thames Airlines using London City Airport include British Airways, Flybe, CityJet, KLM and Lufthansa, with flights to domestic and European city destinations. Police said a 214-metre exclusion zone had been set up and properties inside were evacuated. A rest centre was opened by Newham Council to provide bedding and refreshments for families affected.

May urges 'one final push' on Stormont dealThe UK and Irish prime ministers suggest a deal at Stormont has inched closer.3m3 minutes agoNorthern IrelandComments,"Theresa May said she had ""full and frank conversations with the main parties"" Prime Minister Theresa May has urged Northern Ireland's parties to make one final push towards an agreement to restore devolved government. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful that a deal would be struck this week. They were speaking after a series of meetings with the parties in Northern Ireland. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have said that a deal is possible following Monday's talks. DUP leader Arlene Foster says there ""isn't a deal yet"" Speaking afterwards, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""There isn't a deal yet, what there is, is very good progress."" Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the talks had reached ""a decisive phase"". Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide Tory-DUP deal: What you need to know Profile: Sinn FÃ©in's new leader Mary Lou McDonald Mrs May said that ""it was now at the point where it's time for local elected representatives to find a way to work together"". She said she had ""full and frank conversations with the main parties"" and that while ""some differences remain, I believe it is possible to see the basis of an agreement here"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful that the two parties could ""come to an agreement this week"". Asked why the DUP did not meet the Irish government at Stormont today a party source told the BBC they were focussing on internal Northern Ireland matters. The source added there were also logistical difficulties. Leo Varadkar said he believes a deal could be struck within days ""The soundings from Arlene Foster and Mary Lou McDonald were positive,"" he added. Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©incollapsed in January last year. The then deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of the coalition after a series of disagreements with the final straw being the DUP's handling ofa scandal over green energy scheme. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald (left) says the talks have reached ""a decisive phase"" Mrs Foster said her party wanted a deal that was ""sustainable into the future"". Ms McDonald said:  ""What is required now is the political will to make it happen."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called on the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in to ""stop messing about"". Leo Varadkar tweeted a photo of the intergovernmental talks at Stormont ""We still don't know the colour of this deal,"" he said. Prior to arriving at Stormont, Mrs May visited Bombardier's plant in Belfast. Theresa May toured the Bombardier aerospace plant in east Belfast She met factory floor workers and was shown the capabilities of the multi-million pound plant which is the main production site for wings for the C-Series. Her visit came just over two weeks afterBombardier's victory in a trade dispute with rival aerospace firm Boeing. The US International Trade Commission (ITC) overturned a decision to impose damaging tariffs on US imports of its C-Series aircraft, which would have placed jobs in the Belfast factory at risk. Mrs May met Bombardier staff and management Several previous rounds of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have, so far, failed to break the political deadlock. Earlier, a DUP source told the BBC a deal ""is not likely"" on Monday. Mrs May last visited Northern Ireland in May when she toured the Balmoral Show ahead of a snap general election. Since then, she has struck a parliamentary deal with the DUP and has faced criticism for adopting a hands-off approach to the deadlock at Stormont. Among the issues that have divided the parties is Sinn FÃ©in's demand for an Irish language act. The talks are taking place in Stormont House By BBC News NI political correspondent Mark Devenport The Irish language act has been a major stumbling block, with DUP leader Arlene Foster promising previously that it wouldn't happen on her watch. What I am led to believe is that there could possibly be a very strange, legislative fudge which would see the creation of three separate bills, one for the Irish language, one dealing with Ulster Scots and one for wider cultural issues. The suggestion is that these three bills would end up merging together as one act in an attempt to spare blushes on all sides. On marriage equality, I am not exactly sure how they are going to sort that one out, but one option that has been discussed is the possibility of bringing a private member's bill on the issue or deferring responsibility to Westminster. At least three or four DUP MLAs would be pretty hostile to the notion, but equally there are some who would support it, or at least not object A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister would remind the parties of the many pressing issues facing Northern Ireland and make clear her belief that a fully functioning executive is the best way to serve the interests of the whole community. Secretary of State Karen Bradley welcomed Mrs May to Stormont House ""The (Irish) government has consistently said that the restoration of the institutions is essential in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and that it will continue to work very closely with the British government to support the northern parties to achieve this outcome,"" he said. At the weekend, Sinn FÃ©in's vice president Michelle O'Neill predicted that the Stormont talks would conclude this week. Her comment strengthened speculation that a compromise between her party and the DUP could soon be unveiled.

Man punched toddler in blackmail bid,"Deividas Subacius was jailed for 17 years A man who punched a toddler in the face in a bid to blackmail the child's grandparents has been jailed. Deividas Subacius sent a video to the grandparents of himself hitting the 18-month-old girl demanding Â£130 or he would continue to hurt the child. Subacius, 29, of Badgeney Road, March, Cambridgeshire, was jailed for 17 years after admitting actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm and blackmail. Police said the girl had no ""significant lasting injuries"". At Cambridge Crown Court on Friday, Judge Gareth Hawksworth extended Subacius's sentence from 13 years to 17 because of the seriousness of the crimes. Det Con Clemie Yaxley, from Cambridgeshire Police, said: ""This is the worst case of physical abuse in a child that I have had to deal with in my entire career. ""Had it not been for the grandparents acting in a protective manner the outcome would have been very different."" Subacius was arrested after the grandparents immediately alerted police, who seized his phone which contained the messages asking for Â£130.

Bitcoin gobbling Iceland energy supplies,"Nearly 100% of energy in Iceland comes from renewable sources Iceland is facing an ""exponential"" rise in Bitcoin mining that is gobbling up power resources, a spokesman for Icelandic energy firm HS Orka has said. This year, electricity use at Bitcoin mining data centres is likely to exceed that of all Iceland's homes, according to Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson. He said many potential customers were keen to get in on the act. ""If all these projects are realised, we won't have enough energy for it,"" he told the BBC. Mr Sigurbergsson's calculations were first reported by the Associated Press. Iceland has a small population, of around 340,000 people. But in recent years it has seen a marked increase in the number of new data centres, often built by firms wishing to tout green credentials. Nearly 100% of energy in Iceland comes from renewable sources. Bitcoin mining refers to the work done by computers connected to the global Bitcoin network. These computers solve complex mathematical problems - a process that in turn validates transactions between users of the crypto-currency. The computers that do this validation work receive small Bitcoin rewards for their trouble, making it a lucrative exercise, especially when done at a large scale. ""What we're seeing now is... you can almost call it exponential growth, I think, in the [energy] consumption of data centres,"" said Mr Sigurbergsson. He added that he expects Bitcoin mining operations will use around 840 gigawatt hours of electricity to supply data centre computers and cooling systems, for example.

ANC deciding President Zuma's fate,"Many in the ANC hope that removing Mr Zuma will boost the party's chances in the 2019 elections Leaders of South Africa's ruling ANC party are meeting to decide the future of President Jacob Zuma, who is under intense pressure to quit. Reports quoting party insiders say the National Executive Committee (NEC) has given him two days to step down. ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa was seen leaving the Pretoria talks, reportedly for Mr Zuma's nearby residence, before returning to the venue late on Monday. Mr Zuma, 75, has been battling corruption allegations. He has resisted increasing pressure to quit since December, when Mr Ramaphosa replaced him as leader of the ANC. Speaking to supporters in Cape Town on Sunday, Mr Ramaphosa said: ""We know you want closure. Our people want this matter to be finalised."" He acknowledged the ANC was going through ""a period of difficulty, disunity and discord"", and said he was seeking ""a new beginning"". He pledged to tackle the corruption that has marred Mr Zuma's nine years in office. Mr Ramaphosa urged South Africans to restore the values embodied by Nelson Mandela - the country's first black president, also known as Madiba - and said those who had stolen state assets would be brought to justice. ""We must work together as Madiba taught us to push back the frontiers of poverty, unemployment and inequality,"" he said. An NEC meeting was called off last week following direct talks between Mr Zuma and Mr Ramaphosa, who is the deputy president as well as the new leader of the party. Mr Zuma's presidency has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption. This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes In recent years his links to the wealthy India-born Gupta family, who are alleged to have influenced the government, have caused his popularity to plummet. Both Mr Zuma and the Guptas deny the allegations. Six reasons why Zuma is under pressure The many trials of Jacob Zuma By Lebo Diseko, BBC News, Johannesburg It is worth noting that Mr Zuma has not actually been found guilty of any of the accusations against him. The allegations that there is a corrupt relationship between Mr Zuma and the Gupta family are just that, allegations. And 18 corruption charges, stemming from a 1990s arms deal, were dropped before he became president and have not been reinstated. On top of this, Mr Zuma is still very popular, particularly in rural areas and his home region of KwaZulu-Natal. Mr Ramaphosa may want to make sure Mr Zuma's supporters do not feel he has been treated badly - especially as an election is coming up next year. Correspondents say that if the NEC agreed to recall Mr Zuma, it would be very difficult for him to resist. But he is not legally obliged to step down if they ask him to. If he so wishes, Mr Zuma could carry on as president of South Africa even if the NEC asked him to step down. However, he would then be expected to face a confidence vote in parliament. The date for this has already been set - 22 February. Mr Zuma has survived other such votes, but he would not be expected to pull it off again. A confidence vote would be considered a humiliating process for him and the party. South African media is calling President Zuma's seemingly inevitable exit ""Zexit"". South Africa's previous president, Thabo Mbeki, resigned in 2008. He also had a power struggle with his deputy. The deputy in question was Jacob Zuma, who took over the presidency the following year.

Seaplane crash family members 'drowned',"Richard Cousins, Emma Bowden, Will Cousins, Gareth Morgan, Heather Bowden, Ed Cousins (clockwise from top left) all died A family from the UK who were killed in a seaplane crash near Sydney died from a combination of multiple injuries and drowning, an inquest heard. Richard Cousins, 58, sons, Edward, 23 and William, 25, as well as Emma Bowden and her daughter Heather, 11, died when the plane crashed into a river. At Reading Coroner's Court, senior coroner Peter Bedford said the crash on New Year's Eve was a ""tragic incident"". A full inquest has been suspended pending an investigation in Australia. Mr Cousins, chief executive of Compass Group - one of the world's largest catering companies - was travelling back to Sydney with his family reportedly from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay. This video can not be played The crash in December 2017 killed six people The crash, which also killed Sydney-based pilot Gareth Morgan, 44, happened in Hawkesbury River, near the suburb of Cowan. Australian authorities recovered most of the wreckage of the plane in January. The De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver - including its fuselage, floats and a wing - was retrieved from the river about 50km (30 miles) north of Sydney. The crash involved a single-engine DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane The coroner adjourned the inquests pending the investigation by New South Wales police. Mr Bedford added he was taking on jurisdiction of the inquest because Mr Cousins' brother, and two of his children, now live in Bracknell, Berkshire. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) investigators have said they will release a preliminary report into the crash later this month. Officials also said a crash involving the same plane in 1996 would form part of their wide-ranging investigation. Tributes paid to seaplane crash family Seaplane wreckage recovered in Sydney.

How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam?,"Accusations Oxfam concealed findings its staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011 have led members of the public to admit they are now doubtful about donating to any charity. The British organisation's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence has resigned in the wake of the revelations but further action is required to restore the faith of donors. ""Absolutely - to any charity,"" says IT security analyst Anil, 40, when asked if he has been put off donating. ""I feel bad saying that but I don't feel confident in what goes on behind the scenes. ""I know the majority of people who work there are very good at what they do but the management is shocking. That [recent allegations] is shocking."" The extent of the damage to public faith and donations is yet to be felt but for retail professional James, 52, the claims only add to his frustrations with the third sector. ""My wife has said she definitely will not give money to Oxfam now,"" he says. ""This has dented public opinion in a very detrimental way."" He adds: ""I think there are some issues with charities anyway. I have a bit of a problem, for example, with how much they pay their chief executives. ""I'm concerned about how much of the money I actually give makes it to the causes."" This video can not be played Michelle Russell, from Charity Commission, says the regulator is ""very angry"" ""It's an upsetting case,"" Daniel Fluskey, from the Institute of Fundraising, told BBC Radio 5 live. ""This will have an impact on public trust and confidence in Oxfam. ""I know they've taken a number of steps to get in touch with all of their supporters to tell them what they've done and that's going to have to continue."" Reality Check: How much money goes to Oxfam? Oxfam to meet government after Haiti claims Oxfam did not give watchdog 'full details' Last year, Oxfam had a total income of Â£409m - of which Â£176m came from the UK government and other public authorities. Of the rest, Â£108m came from donations and legacies and Â£91m from sales in its shops. Other international aid organisations have been quick to distance themselves from the story. The British Red Cross has reassured its supporters it has ""a zero tolerance policy to any form of sexual harassment and misconduct"". It said there had been ""no dismissals... for reasons relating to sexual harassment, abuse or paedophilia in at least the past five years"". For some members of the public, Oxfam's mistakes reflect badly on it alone. Account manager Laura, 39, insists the accusations would have no impact on her decision to donate to other organisations. ""No, not at all,"" she says. ""Definitely not."" ""I only really select a few charities to donate to and Oxfam isn't one of them,"" she adds. ""If it was a different charity then yes it would [affect my decision to donate to them]."" Aid organisations must now be seen to be making real strides to improve transparency as they bid restore the public's faith. ""I think all charities now need to subscribe to some sort of governance and compliance and it needs to be available to the public whenever they want to see it,"" Anil adds. ""Who gets what, what bonuses are there, where is the money allocated to? ""There should be internal auditing by an external company to see exactly where the money is going and what it is being spent on."" This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt: 'They did absolutely the wrong thing' The concern for many in the sector now is about the long-term effects of the story, and experts are warning against complacency. Conservative MP Paul Scully, who sits on the International Development Committee, said the scandal could have wider implications for international aid. ""The long term concern about this is the risk of people not wanting to donate to charities that do amazing work across the world and also to those people that it becomes another argument about why not to spend money on international development. ""There is a disincentive in the system [for charities to be more transparent] because charities are competing against one another for donations and so that means there is the fear that if something tarnishes their reputation it may affect their donations."" Mr Fluskey said charities need to think about public trust and confidence ""in all areas"" of their work. He said organisations need to make sure they are ""open and transparent"" and ""working to the right values"". ""We know that people care about causes and that they do want to give support to charities - we can't take that for granted, but we believe the British public will continue to support charities where they see them working according to the high standards they expect.""

No shared leave for shared leave ministerAndrew Griffiths wants more dads to use the scheme - but says he is not allowed to himself.1han hour agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Government minister promotes a policy he canât use himself The government minister in charge of persuading more couples to share their parental leave says he is not allowed to take up the scheme. Business Minister Andrew Griffiths, who is due to become a dad in April, said that as an ""office holder rather than an employee"" he was ineligible. He was speaking on BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett Show as he launched a new campaign to boost take-up. This ""could be as low as 2%"", the business department says. Its Â£1.5m ""share the joy""campaign,externalaims to better inform parents about the policy. New publicity drive for shared parental leave 'I campaigned with a newborn' Mr Griffiths said he planned to be the first minister responsible for parental leave to take their full two weeks of paternity leave - but was unable to take up the policy he is championing. ""Unfortunately, as a minister, I'm not allowed,"" he said. ""Ministers are not allowed to take shared parental leave."" He added: ""The reality is I've discussed with my wife about whether she'd like to take shared parental leave, even if it was available to me - each family has to make the decision that suits them."" Quizzed on the rules affecting ministers, he promised to ""take it away and think about it"". Shared parental leave (SPL) was introduced in April 2015 It allows parents to share 50 weeks of leave - with 37 paid - after they have a baby Parents can take time off separately or can be at home together for up to six months SPL is paid at Â£140.98 per week or 90% of your average earnings, whichever is lower Shared parental leave explained As ""office holders"" rather than employees, usual rules of parental leave do not apply to MPs, the House of Commons said, with arrangements made privately between members and their parties. It said specific arrangements affecting ministers would be the responsibility of the Cabinet Office. Several ministers have taken maternity leave - Labour's Yvette Cooper became the first to do so in 2001. MPs recently voted in favour of allowing members who have a baby to vote by proxy, with Parliament's procedure committee now considering how that could work in practice.

Oxfam resignation over Haiti sex claims,"Penny Lawrence says she took ""full responsibility"" for the behaviour of staff in Chad and Haiti Oxfam's deputy chief executive has resigned over the handling of a sex scandal involving aid workers. The British charity is accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011. Penny Lawrence said she was ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility. The Charity Commission has launched a statutory inquiry into Oxfam - which denies a cover-up - but details of its scope have not yet been released. The watchdog says it has concerns the charity may not have ""fully and frankly"" disclosed everything it knew about the claims despite previous assurances from Oxfam. Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the commission, said if details had been known it would have dealt with the situation ""very differently"". This video can not be played Former Oxfam employee Widza Bryant: ""I was told my many locals there were... sexual relations"" It comes after an earlier meeting with the International Development Secretary in an effort to protect Oxfam's funding from being cut. Ms Lawrence joined Oxfam GB in 2006 as international programmes director, leading teams across 60 countries, according to the charity's website. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' ""Concerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon,"" she said in a statement. ""It is now clear that these allegations - involving the use of prostitutes and which related to the behaviour of both the country director and members of his team in Chad - were raised before he moved to Haiti."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale A statutory inquiry is the most serious action the Charity Commission can take. It gives the regulator new powers to investigate, demand information, suspend trustees and even freeze bank accounts. So this shows how seriously the Commission is taking the sexual misconduct claims about Oxfam staff in Haiti.  It also shows how unhappy the Commission is at not being given the full facts about what went on. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is being equally tough on Oxfam, threatening to withdraw funding unless it gets its house in order and shows some moral leadership. But like the Charity Commission, Ms Mordaunt is also keen to show that she is acting, by promising a new unit in her department to establish a global register of aid workers that might be able to stop predatory individuals being re-employed by charities. She knows she will face tough questioning from MPs on the international development committee next week about what her department knew and what she has done since. Reputations are on the line here and no organisation wants to be found wanting. The allegations emerged inThe Times,externalon Friday, which said Oxfam's country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. Oxfam said allegations that underage girls may have been involved were unproven. BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant said senior government sources feared the abuse allegations could be ""the tip of the iceberg"" and that all aid agencies operating in Haiti as well as Oxfam would be investigated. He added locals expressed ""real anger"" at what they say is impunity by international aid agencies for the way they have behaved. Widza Bryant, who worked in HR for Oxfam in Haiti from 2009 for three years, said she shared ""ongoing rumours"" about locals being exploited with management ""on many occasions"". She told BBC News: ""There were a lot of rumours on the ground about management and leaders exploiting the locals sexually and in other ways to get jobs and to have good standing."" This video can not be played Oxfam Chief Executive: ""We apologise to the British public and the Haitian public"" Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, admitted the charity had failed to act on complaints highlighting the failure to allow Mr van Hauwermeiren to move onto another post after allegations were revealed. He said the use of prostitutes was ""not explicitly contrary"" to Oxfam's code of conduct at the time, but bringing Oxfam into disrepute in any way and abusing people who may have been beneficiaries was. Mr Goldring added: ""There was an exploration of how should the organisation respond but we didn't act on it."" The European Commission has said it expects full clarity and maximum transparency from Oxfam, adding that it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"". The charity's programme in Haiti received â¬1.7m in EU funds in 2011. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said Oxfam had apologised for its ""appalling"" behaviour and that the government had not been told at the time the allegations involved sexual misconduct or beneficiaries. Oxfam has been told to tell the Department for International Development by the end of the week how it will handle any future allegations around safeguarding or it faces losing government funding. Ms Mordaunt also called for clearer whistle-blowing policies across the charitable sector and launched an urgent review into safeguarding and aid providers. The Innocent drinks company - one of Oxfam's corporate sponsors which donates around Â£100,000 per year- said it wants to see a clear plan ""for how this could not ever happen again"". The charity has since postponed a ""Fashion Fighting Poverty"" event, which had been due to take place as part of London Fashion Week on Thursday, saying it was not the ""right time"" at present. This video can not be played BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant says locals believe aid agencies have enjoyed ""impunity"" Oxfam's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. Oxfam has faced growing criticism of the way it handled the allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti, where they were working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake that devastated the country in 2010. Haiti's ambassador in London Bocchit Edmond called the revelations ""shocking"", ""shameful"", and ""unacceptable"". On Sunday, Ms Mordaunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr the charity did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting details of the allegations and that no organisation could be a government partner if it did not ""have the moral leadership to do the right thing"". Ahead of the government meeting, Oxfamannounced new measures,externalfor handling of sexual abuse cases, saying it would introduce tougher vetting of staff and mandatory safeguarding training for new recruits. Oxfam's chairman of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the charity's board had appointed a consultant earlier this year to review its culture and working practices, which would now be extended.

Barclays Bank charged over Qatar loans,"The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has charged Barclays Bank PLC with ""unlawful financial assistance"" related to billions of pounds raised from Qatar in 2008. The same charges were bought against Barclays PLC in June last year. The move to charge Barclays Bank as well is significant because it holds the banking licence that allows it to operate in different countries. So, if Barclays was found guilty, it could lose that crucial licence. In 2008, to avoid a government bailout, Barclays took a Â£12bn loan from Qatar Holdings, which is owned by the state of Qatar. Under that deal Barclays loaned Â£2.3bn back to Qatar Holdings. The SFO alleges,externalthat loan was used either directly, or indirectly, to buy shares in Barclays, which the SFO says is ""unlawful financial assistance"". In response, Barclays said:,external""Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC intend to defend the respective charges brought against them. ""Barclays does not expect there to be an impact on its ability to serve its customers and clients as a consequence of the charge having been brought."" Other than the charge, the SFO has released very little information about its investigation. But a top lawyer said the case is likely to revolve around whether the directors knew what the loan was being used for. ""The SFO may have to establish the precise intention of the directors when making the loan which is the subject of the investigation and it might be difficult to prove to a criminal standard that they had an unlawful intention,"" said Philip Marshall QC at Serle Court Chambers. It was always odd the SFO charged the parent company Barclays PLC and not Barclays Bank as it was the bank that lent $3 billion to Qatar which it's alleged was used to buy shares in Barclays. At the time it was interpreted by some as sparing a strategically important bank for the UK from the harm of potentially losing the ability to operate in important markets (like the US) - a possible consequence if convicted. So today's decision to charge the bank itself is significant. The fact the shares are unmoved suggest markets agree with Barclays insiders who say the following: Being charged in itself isn't a problem, this incident was ten years and four management teams ago, it was done in order to save the bank (and the taxpayer billions). Even if convicted there are banks (UBS, BNP, Credit Suisse) who have been convicted and continued operating. The emergency funds from Qatar allowed Barclays to avoid a government bailout in 2008 at a time when rivals Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were forced to rely on a taxpayer rescue. Following a five-year investigation into the deal with Qatar Holdings, the SFO in June charged Barclays PLC and several former executives with conspiracy to commit fraud. Former chief executive John Varley, former senior investment banker Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris, a former chief executive of Barclays' wealth division, and Richard Boath, the ex-European head of financial institutions, were all charged in relation to that investigation. The bank and its former bosses will face trial in 2019. Barclays is the first British bank to face a criminal trial related to its conduct during the financial crisis.

Cambodia deports tourists for 'pornography',"Cambodian police had published picture of the 10 foreigners Cambodia has deported seven of the ten foreign tourists charged with producing pornography. The group was arrested in January afterimages emerged of people appearing to imitate sex acts at a partyin Siem Reap in the country's north-west. Seven of them, from the UK, New Zealand and Canada, were granted bail last week and have now left the country. Three others - from the UK, Norway and the Netherlands - will face trial for allegedly organising the party. All 10 deny the allegations against them, saying they had not been nude and did not produce any pornographic material. The seven people that have been deported were ordered to leave Cambodia as part of the bail decision and not return, although the charges against them have not been dropped, reports said. A police handout picture of people appearing to imitate sex acts at a party Images of the event posted on an expat-run website showed several couples clothed or in swim wear on the floor of a villa, apparently acting out sexual positions. The town of Siem Reap is the gateway to the ruins of Angkor Wat, Cambodia's main tourist attraction. Popular with backpackers, the city's nightlife scene has rapidly grown over the past few years and sometimes placed tourists at odds with Cambodia's socially conservative culture.

Apology over Peter Rabbit allergy scene,"The scene in the new Peter Rabbit film involving blackberries led to calls for a boycott The makers of the new film Peter Rabbit have apologised after facing a backlash over their depiction of a character's allergy. A scene in the film shows a character who suffers a blackberry allergy being pelted with them by a gang of bunnies. In a joint statement, Sony Pictures and the filmmakers said they ""should not have made light"" of the issue. Campaigners condemned the scene and some Twitter users adopted the hashtag #boycottpeterrabbit.

Barclays Bank charged over Qatar loansThe Serious Fraud Office adds to the pressure on Barclays over a rescue deal with Qatar in 2008.4h4 hours agoBusiness,"The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has charged Barclays Bank PLC with ""unlawful financial assistance"" related to billions of pounds raised from Qatar in 2008. The same charges were bought against Barclays PLC in June last year. The move to charge Barclays Bank as well is significant because it holds the banking licence that allows it to operate in different countries. So, if Barclays was found guilty, it could lose that crucial licence. In 2008, to avoid a government bailout, Barclays took a Â£12bn loan from Qatar Holdings, which is owned by the state of Qatar. Under that deal Barclays loaned Â£2.3bn back to Qatar Holdings. The SFO alleges,externalthat loan was used either directly, or indirectly, to buy shares in Barclays, which the SFO says is ""unlawful financial assistance"". In response, Barclays said:,external""Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC intend to defend the respective charges brought against them. ""Barclays does not expect there to be an impact on its ability to serve its customers and clients as a consequence of the charge having been brought."" Other than the charge, the SFO has released very little information about its investigation. But a top lawyer said the case is likely to revolve around whether the directors knew what the loan was being used for. ""The SFO may have to establish the precise intention of the directors when making the loan which is the subject of the investigation and it might be difficult to prove to a criminal standard that they had an unlawful intention,"" said Philip Marshall QC at Serle Court Chambers. It was always odd the SFO charged the parent company Barclays PLC and not Barclays Bank as it was the bank that lent $3 billion to Qatar which it's alleged was used to buy shares in Barclays. At the time it was interpreted by some as sparing a strategically important bank for the UK from the harm of potentially losing the ability to operate in important markets (like the US) - a possible consequence if convicted. So today's decision to charge the bank itself is significant. The fact the shares are unmoved suggest markets agree with Barclays insiders who say the following: Being charged in itself isn't a problem, this incident was ten years and four management teams ago, it was done in order to save the bank (and the taxpayer billions). Even if convicted there are banks (UBS, BNP, Credit Suisse) who have been convicted and continued operating. The emergency funds from Qatar allowed Barclays to avoid a government bailout in 2008 at a time when rivals Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were forced to rely on a taxpayer rescue. Following a five-year investigation into the deal with Qatar Holdings, the SFO in June charged Barclays PLC and several former executives with conspiracy to commit fraud. Former chief executive John Varley, former senior investment banker Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris, a former chief executive of Barclays' wealth division, and Richard Boath, the ex-European head of financial institutions, were all charged in relation to that investigation. The bank and its former bosses will face trial in 2019. Barclays is the first British bank to face a criminal trial related to its conduct during the financial crisis.

New York state sues Weinstein CompanyThe lawsuit alleges the studio failed to protect staff from abuse by Harvey Weinstein.4h4 hours agoUS & Canada,"Harvey Weinstein is facing dozens of accusations of abuse New York prosecutors have filed a lawsuit against The Weinstein Company, alleging that the studio failed to protect staff from Harvey Weinstein. The film producer is facing dozens of allegations of sexual abuse, including rape, but denies non-consensual sex. The lawsuit alleges Mr Weinstein abused female employees and made verbal threats to kill staff members. A lawyer for Mr Weinstein said a ""fair investigation"" would show that many of the allegations were without merit. The Weinstein Company's board of directors said it was ""disappointed"" by the lawsuit. In a statement toDeadline,external, the board said: ""Many of the allegations relating to the board are inaccurate and the board looks forward to bringing the facts to light as part of its ongoing commitment to resolve this difficult situation in the most appropriate way."" Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Sunday that he had filed the suit against The Weinstein Company, as well as Mr Weinstein and his brother Robert, who co-founded the studio. He is seeking an unspecified sum to cover damages, plus penalties, for victims of alleged abuse by Harvey Weinstein, 65. The document alleges that Mr Weinstein sexually harassed and abused women employed by the studio for years. It accuses senior executives at the company, including Robert Weinstein, of failing to prevent the mistreatment of staff despite being presented with evidence. The lawsuit follows a four-month investigation and cites multiple examples of alleged misconduct by Mr Weinstein,external, including: Verbal threats, such as telling employees ""I will kill you"" or ""I will kill your family"" Employing female staff as ""wing women"" to ""accompany [Mr Weinstein] to events and facilitate [his] sexual conquests"" Demanding sexual favours in return for career promotion at the studio Requiring his drivers to ""keep condoms and erectile dysfunction injections in the car at all times"" The requirement for his assistants to schedule ""personals for sexual activity"" both during office hours and after work Belittling female members of staff with insults about their periods, and shouting at one member of staff that she should leave the company and make babies as that was all she was good for. The company is also accused of failing employees by: Not investigating complaints or treating them confidentially, with one assistant saying she saw her email detailing Mr Weinstein's misconduct allegations had been forwarded directly to him Creating a contract for Mr Weinstein which allegedly contained the proviso that mistreatment claims would result in a financial penalty, rather than be prohibited, which ""effectively monetised"" sexual harassment. In response, Mr Weinstein's lawyer Ben Brafman said while his client's behaviour ""was not without fault"", there was ""no criminality"". ""At the end of the inquiry it will be clear that Harvey Weinstein promoted more women to key executive positions than any other industry leader and there was zero discrimination at either Miramax or [the Weinstein Company],"" he said. The suit casts doubt over the sale of The Weinstein Company, which has been battling bankruptcy and is in talks with investors. Harvey Weinstein and his brother Robert, known as Bob (left), pictured in the 1980s Mr Schneiderman said his investigation was continuing, but he had brought the suit out of concern that a possible sale would leave alleged victims without adequate compensation, and could benefit ""perpetrators or enablers"". Who has accused Weinstein of what? Weinstein 'derailed my career' Hayek: He threatened to kill me It is reported that businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet has led talks to buy the studio for $500m (Â£362m). But after news of the suit emerged, negotiations are now said to be on hold. Investors baulked at the prospect of the lawsuit adding conditions to the sale,,externalVariety reported. In October last year, The New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Weinstein. Since then more than 50 women, among them some of the biggest names in Hollywood, have accused the film producer of sexual assault, harassment, abuse and rape. This video can not be played Ashley Judd: I was not frightened of Harvey Weinstein In the wake of the allegations, Mr Weinstein was sacked by the board of his company. He is under investigation by UK and US police but no charges have been brought. Mr Weinstein, who was once among the most powerful men in Hollywood, has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"".

"Fathers failing to 'share the joy'Take-up of shared parental leave may be as low as 2%, prompting a government campaign to promote it.13h13 hours agoBusinessComments","A new publicity drive is aiming to encourage higher take-up of shared parental leave. Around 285,000 couples are eligible every year for shared parental leave, but take-up ""could be as low as 2%"", the Department for Business said. Around half of the general public are still unaware the option exists, nearly three years after it was introduced, the government said. It now plans to spend Â£1.5m to better inform parents about the policy. Experts say that as well as a lack of understanding of what is on offer, cultural barriers and financial penalties are deterring some parents from sharing parental leave. The government'scampaign,externalwill encourage parents to ""share the joy"" through online advertising, social media and on billboards. Business minister Andrew Griffiths said the policy meant dads didn't have to miss out on ""their baby's first step, word or giggle"". ""Employers can reap the benefits too. We know that flexibility in work is proven to create happier, more loyal and more productive workforces,"" he said. Shared parental leave (SPL) was introduced in April 2015 It allows parents to share 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay after they have a baby Parents can take time off separately or can be at home together for up to six months SPL is paid at Â£140.98 per week or 90% of your average earnings, whichever is lower Shared parental leave explained Tom Markwell and Leila Reyburn, who work in the charity sector in London, said shared parental leave offered them greater flexibility. After they had their daughter, Pearl, in 2016, Leila took the first 10 months off work to care for her. Tom then spent two months at home. They say it gave Tom the chance to bond more closely with Pearl, while Leila was able to take up the opportunity for a promotion at work. Firm offers paid leave for all parents What's it like being a stay-at-home dad? New Zealand PM's partner will be full-time dad The government originally predicted between 2% and 8% of eligible couples would take SPL during the first few years of the new policy and says it still expects take-up to be within that range. But a survey by Working Families, a charity that campaigns on work-life balance issues, said a survey it conducted last year suggested raising awareness was only part of the solution. Working Families chief executive Sarah Jackson said some families could not afford for fathers to take parental leave. ""Of those fathers who said they wouldn't use the scheme, more than a third said this was because they couldn't afford to,"" she said. ""Those employers that can afford to should go beyond the minimum pay for SPL."" Many fathers had not been in their jobs long enough to qualify for SPL, she added. ""If the Government is serious about equality at work and tackling the gender pay gap, it should consider also introducing a properly paid, standalone period of extended paternity leave for fathers."" Research conducted by law firm EMW last year,external, based on a Freedom of Information request, suggested only 8,700 couples took advantage of the scheme between April 2016 and March 2017. EMW calculated that was 1% of eligible couples while the Department for Business said it was around 3% of those eligible. EMW suggested low take-up was partly due to the cultural stigma for men of taking time off work and concerns that they might come across as less committed to their job if they ask for leave. The Department for Business said it was normal for the policy to take some time to bed in and that the scheme would be formally evaluated later this year. What's it like being a stay-at-home dad?

"Bitcoin gobbling Iceland energy suppliesData centres mining the crypto-currency will use more electricity than homes this year, an energy firm says.","Nearly 100% of energy in Iceland comes from renewable sources Iceland is facing an ""exponential"" rise in Bitcoin mining that is gobbling up power resources, a spokesman for Icelandic energy firm HS Orka has said. This year, electricity use at Bitcoin mining data centres is likely to exceed that of all Iceland's homes, according to Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson. He said many potential customers were keen to get in on the act. ""If all these projects are realised, we won't have enough energy for it,"" he told the BBC. Mr Sigurbergsson's calculations were first reported by the Associated Press. Iceland has a small population, of around 340,000 people. But in recent years it has seen a marked increase in the number of new data centres, often built by firms wishing to tout green credentials. Nearly 100% of energy in Iceland comes from renewable sources. Bitcoin mining refers to the work done by computers connected to the global Bitcoin network. These computers solve complex mathematical problems - a process that in turn validates transactions between users of the crypto-currency. The computers that do this validation work receive small Bitcoin rewards for their trouble, making it a lucrative exercise, especially when done at a large scale. ""What we're seeing now is... you can almost call it exponential growth, I think, in the [energy] consumption of data centres,"" said Mr Sigurbergsson. He added that he expects Bitcoin mining operations will use around 840 gigawatt hours of electricity to supply data centre computers and cooling systems, for example. He estimated that the county's homes, in contrast, use around 700 gigawatt hours every year. ""I don't see it stopping quite yet,"" added Mr Sigurbergsson, referring to data centre projects. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? ""I'm getting a lot of calls, visits from potential investors or companies wanting to build data centres in Iceland."" He also said that there are so many proposed data centres that it wouldn't be possible to supply all of them. He added that his firm was mostly interested in dealing with companies that were willing to commit to long-term contracts of a few years or more. If Iceland took on all of the proposed Bitcoin mining ventures, there simply wouldn't be enough electricity to supply them all, he added. Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson says there is so much demand for Bitcoin mining data centres in Iceland that the country wouldn't have enough electricity to supply them all were they to be built The crypto-currency mining industry in Iceland was recently given a boost thanks to thelaunch of The Moonlite Project,external- a large data centre where various crypto-currencies, including Bitcoin, will be mined. It is set to open later this year and will have an initial capacity of 15 megawatts, though this is expected to increase in the future. Some have questioned how beneficial the rise of the crypto-currency mining will be to Iceland. Smari McCarthy, a member of the Icelandic parliament for the Pirate Party,tweeted:,external""Cryptocurrency mining requires almost no staff, very little in capital investments, and mostly leaves no taxes either. ""The value to Iceland... is virtually zero."" He also clarified previous reports that quoted him as saying he was keen to tax Bitcoin mining firms. Allow Twitter content?

'Take sick children to pharmacies first',"This video can not be played Dr Bruce Warner, deputy chief pharmaceutical officer for NHS England Parents of young children with minor illnesses should take them to pharmacies rather than GPs or A&E, a new NHS England campaign says. It follows a survey which found just 6% of parents with under-fives would go to a pharmacist first. NHS England said visits to GPs and A&E for these ""self-treatable"" conditions, like stomach ache, cost Â£850m a year. But parents should not be put off seeing a doctor, a patients' group said. GPs' leaders said parents of children with a very high temperature that doesn't go away should still seek help from a medical expert. NHS England's Stay Well Pharmacy campaign is urging people to visit their local pharmacist first to help save the service money and free up time for the sickest patients. It said each year there were about 18 million GP appointments and 2.1 million visits to A&E for so-called self-treatable conditions - costing the service the equivalent of more than 220,000 hip replacements or 880,000 cataract operations. Its survey of more than 2,000 people in England found 35% of parents of children under five would go to a GP if their child had a minor illness, such as earache, diarrhoea or stomach ache, while 5% would go directly to A&E. The NHS survey also found that only 16% of adults would go to a pharmacist first if they were similarly unwell. There are some 2.1 million visits a year to A&E for self-treatable conditions, the NHS says Dr Bruce Warner, deputy chief pharmaceutical officer for NHS England, said: ""Pharmacists are highly trained NHS health professionals who are able to offer clinical advice and effective treatments for a wide range of minor health concerns right there and then. ""They can assess symptoms and recommend the best course of treatment or simply provide reassurance, for instance when a minor illness will get better on its own with a few days' rest. ""However, if symptoms suggest it's something more serious, they have the right clinical training to ensure people get the help they need."" Advise on the safe use of prescription and over-the-counter medicines Some can manage repeat prescriptions Give advice about a range of common conditions and minor injuries, such as sore throat, coughs, colds and flu Advise on whether you need to see a GP Offer healthy lifestyle advice Some offer the NHS Health Check for people aged 40-74, which is designed to spot early signs of stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia However, the Patients Association said it was important parents did not feel put off from seeing a doctor if they thought something more serious was wrong. The charity's chief executive, Rachel Power, said: ""For common childhood illnesses, a pharmacist will often be a sensible first port of call, so we welcome efforts to raise awareness of the support they can offer. ""Equally, we wouldn't want to see parents put off taking their children to see a doctor if they have any suspicion that something more serious could be wrong. ""While this campaign has its merits, the timing is not a coincidence. The pressures facing the NHS after years of underfunding and mismanagement of its workforce create a huge incentive to discourage people from using GPs or A&E. ""Often people will be right to use alternatives, but we don't want to hear of more cases where someone has stayed away and subsequently come to serious harm because they were in fact seriously ill."" The Royal College of GPs said patients can help to ease the ""intense pressure"" on GPs by seeking advice from a pharmacist, who they said were ""highly-skilled medical professionals"". ""But of course, they are not GPs and in an emergency or situation where genuinely unsure, patients should always seek expert medical assistance, particularly if parents see potentially serious symptoms in their child such as a very high temperature that doesn't respond to simple measures, features of dehydration or lethargy, "" said chairwoman Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard.

Fathers failing to 'share the joy',"A new publicity drive is aiming to encourage higher take-up of shared parental leave. Around 285,000 couples are eligible every year for shared parental leave, but take-up ""could be as low as 2%"", the Department for Business said. Around half of the general public are still unaware the option exists, nearly three years after it was introduced, the government said. It now plans to spend Â£1.5m to better inform parents about the policy. Experts say that as well as a lack of understanding of what is on offer, cultural barriers and financial penalties are deterring some parents from sharing parental leave. The government'scampaign,externalwill encourage parents to ""share the joy"" through online advertising, social media and on billboards. Business minister Andrew Griffiths said the policy meant dads didn't have to miss out on ""their baby's first step, word or giggle"". ""Employers can reap the benefits too. We know that flexibility in work is proven to create happier, more loyal and more productive workforces,"" he said. Shared parental leave (SPL) was introduced in April 2015 It allows parents to share 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay after they have a baby Parents can take time off separately or can be at home together for up to six months SPL is paid at Â£140.98 per week or 90% of your average earnings, whichever is lower Shared parental leave explained Tom Markwell and Leila Reyburn, who work in the charity sector in London, said shared parental leave offered them greater flexibility. After they had their daughter, Pearl, in 2016, Leila took the first 10 months off work to care for her. Tom then spent two months at home. They say it gave Tom the chance to bond more closely with Pearl, while Leila was able to take up the opportunity for a promotion at work. Firm offers paid leave for all parents What's it like being a stay-at-home dad? New Zealand PM's partner will be full-time dad The government originally predicted between 2% and 8% of eligible couples would take SPL during the first few years of the new policy and says it still expects take-up to be within that range. But a survey by Working Families, a charity that campaigns on work-life balance issues, said a survey it conducted last year suggested raising awareness was only part of the solution. Working Families chief executive Sarah Jackson said some families could not afford for fathers to take parental leave. ""Of those fathers who said they wouldn't use the scheme, more than a third said this was because they couldn't afford to,"" she said. ""Those employers that can afford to should go beyond the minimum pay for SPL."" Many fathers had not been in their jobs long enough to qualify for SPL, she added. ""If the Government is serious about equality at work and tackling the gender pay gap, it should consider also introducing a properly paid, standalone period of extended paternity leave for fathers."" Research conducted by law firm EMW last year,external, based on a Freedom of Information request, suggested only 8,700 couples took advantage of the scheme between April 2016 and March 2017. EMW calculated that was 1% of eligible couples while the Department for Business said it was around 3% of those eligible. EMW suggested low take-up was partly due to the cultural stigma for men of taking time off work and concerns that they might come across as less committed to their job if they ask for leave. The Department for Business said it was normal for the policy to take some time to bed in and that the scheme would be formally evaluated later this year. What's it like being a stay-at-home dad?

New York state sues Weinstein Company,"Harvey Weinstein is facing dozens of accusations of abuse New York prosecutors have filed a lawsuit against The Weinstein Company, alleging that the studio failed to protect staff from Harvey Weinstein. The film producer is facing dozens of allegations of sexual abuse, including rape, but denies non-consensual sex. The lawsuit alleges Mr Weinstein abused female employees and made verbal threats to kill staff members. A lawyer for Mr Weinstein said a ""fair investigation"" would show that many of the allegations were without merit. The Weinstein Company's board of directors said it was ""disappointed"" by the lawsuit. In a statement toDeadline,external, the board said: ""Many of the allegations relating to the board are inaccurate and the board looks forward to bringing the facts to light as part of its ongoing commitment to resolve this difficult situation in the most appropriate way."" Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Sunday that he had filed the suit against The Weinstein Company, as well as Mr Weinstein and his brother Robert, who co-founded the studio. He is seeking an unspecified sum to cover damages, plus penalties, for victims of alleged abuse by Harvey Weinstein, 65. The document alleges that Mr Weinstein sexually harassed and abused women employed by the studio for years. It accuses senior executives at the company, including Robert Weinstein, of failing to prevent the mistreatment of staff despite being presented with evidence. The lawsuit follows a four-month investigation and cites multiple examples of alleged misconduct by Mr Weinstein,external, including: Verbal threats, such as telling employees ""I will kill you"" or ""I will kill your family"" Employing female staff as ""wing women"" to ""accompany [Mr Weinstein] to events and facilitate [his] sexual conquests"" Demanding sexual favours in return for career promotion at the studio Requiring his drivers to ""keep condoms and erectile dysfunction injections in the car at all times"" The requirement for his assistants to schedule ""personals for sexual activity"" both during office hours and after work Belittling female members of staff with insults about their periods, and shouting at one member of staff that she should leave the company and make babies as that was all she was good for. The company is also accused of failing employees by: Not investigating complaints or treating them confidentially, with one assistant saying she saw her email detailing Mr Weinstein's misconduct allegations had been forwarded directly to him Creating a contract for Mr Weinstein which allegedly contained the proviso that mistreatment claims would result in a financial penalty, rather than be prohibited, which ""effectively monetised"" sexual harassment. In response, Mr Weinstein's lawyer Ben Brafman said while his client's behaviour ""was not without fault"", there was ""no criminality"". ""At the end of the inquiry it will be clear that Harvey Weinstein promoted more women to key executive positions than any other industry leader and there was zero discrimination at either Miramax or [the Weinstein Company],"" he said. The suit casts doubt over the sale of The Weinstein Company, which has been battling bankruptcy and is in talks with investors. Harvey Weinstein and his brother Robert, known as Bob (left), pictured in the 1980s Mr Schneiderman said his investigation was continuing, but he had brought the suit out of concern that a possible sale would leave alleged victims without adequate compensation, and could benefit ""perpetrators or enablers"". Who has accused Weinstein of what? Weinstein 'derailed my career' Hayek: He threatened to kill me It is reported that businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet has led talks to buy the studio for $500m (Â£362m). But after news of the suit emerged, negotiations are now said to be on hold. Investors baulked at the prospect of the lawsuit adding conditions to the sale,,externalVariety reported. In October last year, The New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Weinstein. Since then more than 50 women, among them some of the biggest names in Hollywood, have accused the film producer of sexual assault, harassment, abuse and rape. This video can not be played Ashley Judd: I was not frightened of Harvey Weinstein In the wake of the allegations, Mr Weinstein was sacked by the board of his company. He is under investigation by UK and US police but no charges have been brought. Mr Weinstein, who was once among the most powerful men in Hollywood, has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"".

Prior to arriving at Stormont, Mrs May visited Bombardier's plant in Belfast. Theresa May toured the Bombardier aerospace plant in east Belfast She met factory floor workers and was shown the capabilities of the multi-million pound plant which is the main production site for wings for the C-Series. Her visit came just over two weeks afterBombardier's victory in a trade dispute with rival aerospace firm Boeing. The US International Trade Commission (ITC) overturned a decision to impose damaging tariffs on US imports of its C-Series aircraft, which would have placed jobs in the Belfast factory at risk. Mrs May met Bombardier staff and management Several previous rounds of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have, so far, failed to break the political deadlock. Earlier, a DUP source told the BBC a deal ""is not likely"" on Monday. Mrs May last visited Northern Ireland in May when she toured the Balmoral Show ahead of a snap general election. Since then, she has struck a parliamentary deal with the DUP and has faced criticism for adopting a hands-off approach to the deadlock at Stormont. Among the issues that have divided the parties is Sinn FÃ©in's demand for an Irish language act. The talks are taking place in Stormont House By BBC News NI political correspondent Mark Devenport The Irish language act has been a major stumbling block, with DUP leader Arlene Foster promising previously that it wouldn't happen on her watch. What I am led to believe is that there could possibly be a very strange, legislative fudge which would see the creation of three separate bills, one for the Irish language, one dealing with Ulster Scots and one for wider cultural issues. The suggestion is that these three bills would end up merging together as one act in an attempt to spare blushes on all sides. On marriage equality, I am not exactly sure how they are going to sort that one out, but one option that has been discussed is the possibility of bringing a private member's bill on the issue or deferring responsibility to Westminster. At least three or four DUP MLAs would be pretty hostile to the notion, but equally there are some who would support it, or at least not object A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister would remind the parties of the many pressing issues facing Northern Ireland and make clear her belief that a fully functioning executive is the best way to serve the interests of the whole community.

"Aldi named top supermarket by surveyWaitrose is no longer number one for customer satisfaction, according to an annual survey.8h8 hours agoBusiness","Aldi has been rated the UK's best supermarket, nudging previously top-ranked Waitrose down to fourth place. Customers criticised Aldi stores for being ""untidy"" and for a lack of staff availability, but rated them highly for offering value for money, according to consumer group Which?. Marks and Spencer was second, winning marks for store appearance and product quality. Lidl ranked third. The large supermarkets fared worst, with Sainsbury's ranked last of nine. The survey, conducted last October, asked customers to rate their supermarket shopping experiences in the past six months.  The chains are scored on customer satisfaction and whether they would recommend the store to a friend. Waitrose, Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's lost marks over value-for-money compared to the discount chains. Which? said respondents praised the ease of finding items on shelves at Aldi. But both Lidl and Aldi scored poorly for queuing time, staff availability and for the range of products on offer. But they were marked up for the quality of their fresh and own-label products. Aldi 74% Marks and Spencer 73% Lidl 69% Waitrose 68% Iceland 65% Tesco 64% Asda 63% Morrisons 63% Sainsbury's 62% While Aldi accounts for only 7% of the UK grocery market and Lidl 5%, the discount chains have seen strong sales growth over the last few years. ""With food costs rising it seems as though shoppers have felt the pinch and are voting with their feet and wallets,"" said Alex Neill, managing director of Which? home products and services. ""Aldi and Lidl have won over their customers with value for money, knocking Waitrose off the top spot."" Newspaper reports suggest Tesco is considering launching its own budget supermarket chain. The Sunday Times reported that the country's largest supermarket has ""secret plans"" to take on the discounters at their own game, by opening stores offering a limited range of own-brand products. A spokesperson Tesco declined to comment. Do the better off really use discounters? The man driving Aldi's remarkable growth The changing face of retail The supermarkets were also rated for their online services. Iceland retained the top ranking for the third year running, but shared the spot with Ocado for the first time.

Oxfam crisis talks over Haiti sex claims,"Penny Lawrence says she took ""full responsibility"" for the behaviour of staff in Chad and Haiti Oxfam's deputy chief executive has resigned over the handling of a sex scandal involving aid workers. The British charity is accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011. Penny Lawrence said she was ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility. The Charity Commission has launched a statutory inquiry into Oxfam - which denies a cover-up - but details of its scope have not yet been released. The watchdog says it has concerns the charity may not have ""fully and frankly"" disclosed everything it knew about the claims despite previous assurances from Oxfam. Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the commission, said if details had been known it would have dealt with the situation ""very differently"". This video can not be played Former Oxfam employee Widza Bryant: ""I was told my many locals there were... sexual relations"" It comes after an earlier meeting with the International Development Secretary in an effort to protect Oxfam's funding from being cut. Ms Lawrence joined Oxfam GB in 2006 as international programmes director, leading teams across 60 countries, according to the charity's website. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' ""Concerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon,"" she said in a statement. ""It is now clear that these allegations - involving the use of prostitutes and which related to the behaviour of both the country director and members of his team in Chad - were raised before he moved to Haiti."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale A statutory inquiry is the most serious action the Charity Commission can take. It gives the regulator new powers to investigate, demand information, suspend trustees and even freeze bank accounts. So this shows how seriously the Commission is taking the sexual misconduct claims about Oxfam staff in Haiti.  It also shows how unhappy the Commission is at not being given the full facts about what went on. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is being equally tough on Oxfam, threatening to withdraw funding unless it gets its house in order and shows some moral leadership. But like the Charity Commission, Ms Mordaunt is also keen to show that she is acting, by promising a new unit in her department to establish a global register of aid workers that might be able to stop predatory individuals being re-employed by charities. She knows she will face tough questioning from MPs on the international development committee next week about what her department knew and what she has done since. Reputations are on the line here and no organisation wants to be found wanting. The allegations emerged inThe Times,externalon Friday, which said Oxfam's country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. Oxfam said allegations that underage girls may have been involved were unproven. BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant said senior government sources feared the abuse allegations could be ""the tip of the iceberg"" and that all aid agencies operating in Haiti as well as Oxfam would be investigated. He added locals expressed ""real anger"" at what they say is impunity by international aid agencies for the way they have behaved. Widza Bryant, who worked in HR for Oxfam in Haiti from 2009 for three years, said she shared ""ongoing rumours"" about locals being exploited with management ""on many occasions"". She told BBC News: ""There were a lot of rumours on the ground about management and leaders exploiting the locals sexually and in other ways to get jobs and to have good standing."" This video can not be played Oxfam Chief Executive: ""We apologise to the British public and the Haitian public"" Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, admitted the charity had failed to act on complaints highlighting the failure to allow Mr van Hauwermeiren to move onto another post after allegations were revealed. He said the use of prostitutes was ""not explicitly contrary"" to Oxfam's code of conduct at the time, but bringing Oxfam into disrepute in any way and abusing people who may have been beneficiaries was. Mr Goldring added: ""There was an exploration of how should the organisation respond but we didn't act on it."" The European Commission has said it expects full clarity and maximum transparency from Oxfam, adding that it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"". The charity's programme in Haiti received â¬1.7m in EU funds in 2011. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said Oxfam had apologised for its ""appalling"" behaviour and that the government had not been told at the time the allegations involved sexual misconduct or beneficiaries. Oxfam has been told to tell the Department for International Development by the end of the week how it will handle any future allegations around safeguarding or it faces losing government funding. Ms Mordaunt also called for clearer whistle-blowing policies across the charitable sector and launched an urgent review into safeguarding and aid providers. The Innocent drinks company - one of Oxfam's corporate sponsors which donates around Â£100,000 per year- said it wants to see a clear plan ""for how this could not ever happen again"". The charity has since postponed a ""Fashion Fighting Poverty"" event, which had been due to take place as part of London Fashion Week on Thursday, saying it was not the ""right time"" at present. This video can not be played BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant says locals believe aid agencies have enjoyed ""impunity"" Oxfam's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. Oxfam has faced growing criticism of the way it handled the allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti, where they were working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake that devastated the country in 2010. Haiti's ambassador in London Bocchit Edmond called the revelations ""shocking"", ""shameful"", and ""unacceptable"". On Sunday, Ms Mordaunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr the charity did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting details of the allegations and that no organisation could be a government partner if it did not ""have the moral leadership to do the right thing"". Ahead of the government meeting, Oxfamannounced new measures,externalfor handling of sexual abuse cases, saying it would introduce tougher vetting of staff and mandatory safeguarding training for new recruits. Oxfam's chairman of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the charity's board had appointed a consultant earlier this year to review its culture and working practices, which would now be extended.

British tourists killed in Grand Canyon crash,"Becky Dobson and her boyfriend Stuart Hill died in the crash A couple are among three British tourists killed in a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon. Becky Dobson, 27, Stuart Hill, 30, and his brother Jason Hill, 32, died in Saturday's crash, Hualapai Police said. Three other Britons and the pilot were injured on the tour of the canyon but they were not rescued until some eight hours later on Sunday morning. Ms Dobson's father, Peter Dobson, told the Press Association his daughter was ""full of life"" and ""always happy"". The group were away celebrating Stuart's 30th birthday, Mr Dobson said. He added the couple were ""really happy together"" and ""just enjoyed being with each other"". ""The whole thing is just terrible."" Friends pay tribute to victims Britons Ellie Milward, 29, Jonathan Udall, 32, and Jennifer Barham, 39, were injured in the crash, along with pilot Scott Booth, 42, police said. Jonathan Udall and his wife Ellie Milward, both on left, were injured in the crash Witnesses told local reporters they had seen survivors running away from the crash site and shouting. It is not clear what caused the crash and witnesses say rescue efforts have been hampered by high winds. The helicopter crashed on Saturday evening and survivors were not rescued until the early hours of Sunday morning. The youngest of the victims, Ms Dobson, worked as a veterinary receptionist for Vets 4 Pets in Worthing, West Sussex. In her profile on the practice's website, she described her love for animals, as well as her dream of becoming a veterinary nurse. ""I also love to travel the world and explore what is out there beyond good old Worthing,"" she said. The practice paid tribute to Ms Dobson, saying her colleagues were ""devastated"" by her loss. Jason Hill worked as a corporate lawyer for Shoosmiths LLP in its Milton Keynes office. The firm's chief executive, Claire Rowe, said he was well respected and loved by all those who worked with him. ""He was hardworking, full of energy and enjoyable to work with, and we are greatly saddened by the news of his death and that of his brother Stuart,"" she added. Gabby Hart, a local news reporter for the station KSNV, said it had taken more than eight hours for the survivors to be removed from the site because of the terrain and high winds. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are told by witnesses and also by rescuers that people were trying to help once they saw this accident happen, they couldn't get down to the helicopter quick enough. ""They [the survivors] had to receive care there on site until emergency crews were able to remove them from the scene."" The chief of the local Hualapai Police, Francis Bradley, called the incident ""very tragic"" and described the terrain as ""extremely rugged"". He added rescue efforts had been hampered by severe weather conditions and gusts of up to 50mph. The helicopter came down, during a tour of the canyon, on Saturday evening In a statement, Brenda Halvorson, the chief executive of the helicopter company involved - Papillon Airways - said the company extended its heartfelt sympathy to the families of the dead and injured. On its website, Papillon calls itself ""the world's largest aerial sightseeing company"" and says it flies more than 600,000 people a year. The Grand Canyon, which is more than 1.6km (one mile) deep, is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the US. A UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are providing support to the families of six British visitors involved in a helicopter accident at the Grand Canyon on 10 February, and we are in close contact with the US emergency services.""

May and Varadkar join Stormont talks,"Theresa May said she had ""full and frank conversations with the main parties"" Prime Minister Theresa May has urged Northern Ireland's parties to make one final push towards an agreement to restore devolved government. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful that a deal would be struck this week. They were speaking after a series of meetings with the parties in Northern Ireland. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have said that a deal is possible following Monday's talks. DUP leader Arlene Foster says there ""isn't a deal yet"" Speaking afterwards, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""There isn't a deal yet, what there is, is very good progress."" Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the talks had reached ""a decisive phase"". Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide Tory-DUP deal: What you need to know Profile: Sinn FÃ©in's new leader Mary Lou McDonald Mrs May said that ""it was now at the point where it's time for local elected representatives to find a way to work together"". She said she had ""full and frank conversations with the main parties"" and that while ""some differences remain, I believe it is possible to see the basis of an agreement here"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful that the two parties could ""come to an agreement this week"". Asked why the DUP did not meet the Irish government at Stormont today a party source told the BBC they were focussing on internal Northern Ireland matters. The source added there were also logistical difficulties. Leo Varadkar said he believes a deal could be struck within days ""The soundings from Arlene Foster and Mary Lou McDonald were positive,"" he added. Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©incollapsed in January last year. The then deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of the coalition after a series of disagreements with the final straw being the DUP's handling ofa scandal over green energy scheme. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald (left) says the talks have reached ""a decisive phase"" Mrs Foster said her party wanted a deal that was ""sustainable into the future"". Ms McDonald said:  ""What is required now is the political will to make it happen."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called on the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in to ""stop messing about"". Leo Varadkar tweeted a photo of the intergovernmental talks at Stormont ""We still don't know the colour of this deal,"" he said. Prior to arriving at Stormont, Mrs May visited Bombardier's plant in Belfast. Theresa May toured the Bombardier aerospace plant in east Belfast She met factory floor workers and was shown the capabilities of the multi-million pound plant which is the main production site for wings for the C-Series. Her visit came just over two weeks afterBombardier's victory in a trade dispute with rival aerospace firm Boeing. The US International Trade Commission (ITC) overturned a decision to impose damaging tariffs on US imports of its C-Series aircraft, which would have placed jobs in the Belfast factory at risk. Mrs May met Bombardier staff and management Several previous rounds of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have, so far, failed to break the political deadlock. Earlier, a DUP source told the BBC a deal ""is not likely"" on Monday. Mrs May last visited Northern Ireland in May when she toured the Balmoral Show ahead of a snap general election. Since then, she has struck a parliamentary deal with the DUP and has faced criticism for adopting a hands-off approach to the deadlock at Stormont. Among the issues that have divided the parties is Sinn FÃ©in's demand for an Irish language act. The talks are taking place in Stormont House By BBC News NI political correspondent Mark Devenport The Irish language act has been a major stumbling block, with DUP leader Arlene Foster promising previously that it wouldn't happen on her watch. What I am led to believe is that there could possibly be a very strange, legislative fudge which would see the creation of three separate bills, one for the Irish language, one dealing with Ulster Scots and one for wider cultural issues. The suggestion is that these three bills would end up merging together as one act in an attempt to spare blushes on all sides. On marriage equality, I am not exactly sure how they are going to sort that one out, but one option that has been discussed is the possibility of bringing a private member's bill on the issue or deferring responsibility to Westminster. At least three or four DUP MLAs would be pretty hostile to the notion, but equally there are some who would support it, or at least not object A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister would remind the parties of the many pressing issues facing Northern Ireland and make clear her belief that a fully functioning executive is the best way to serve the interests of the whole community. Secretary of State Karen Bradley welcomed Mrs May to Stormont House ""The (Irish) government has consistently said that the restoration of the institutions is essential in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and that it will continue to work very closely with the British government to support the northern parties to achieve this outcome,"" he said. At the weekend, Sinn FÃ©in's vice president Michelle O'Neill predicted that the Stormont talks would conclude this week. Her comment strengthened speculation that a compromise between her party and the DUP could soon be unveiled.

"Fathers failing to 'share the joy'Take-up of shared parental leave may be as low as 2%, prompting a government campaign to promote it.","A new publicity drive is aiming to encourage higher take-up of shared parental leave. Around 285,000 couples are eligible every year for shared parental leave, but take-up ""could be as low as 2%"", the Department for Business said. Around half of the general public are still unaware the option exists, nearly three years after it was introduced, the government said. It now plans to spend Â£1.5m to better inform parents about the policy. Experts say that as well as a lack of understanding of what is on offer, cultural barriers and financial penalties are deterring some parents from sharing parental leave. The government'scampaign,externalwill encourage parents to ""share the joy"" through online advertising, social media and on billboards. Business minister Andrew Griffiths said the policy meant dads didn't have to miss out on ""their baby's first step, word or giggle"". ""Employers can reap the benefits too. We know that flexibility in work is proven to create happier, more loyal and more productive workforces,"" he said. Shared parental leave (SPL) was introduced in April 2015 It allows parents to share 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay after they have a baby Parents can take time off separately or can be at home together for up to six months SPL is paid at Â£140.98 per week or 90% of your average earnings, whichever is lower Shared parental leave explained Tom Markwell and Leila Reyburn, who work in the charity sector in London, said shared parental leave offered them greater flexibility. After they had their daughter, Pearl, in 2016, Leila took the first 10 months off work to care for her. Tom then spent two months at home. They say it gave Tom the chance to bond more closely with Pearl, while Leila was able to take up the opportunity for a promotion at work. Firm offers paid leave for all parents What's it like being a stay-at-home dad? New Zealand PM's partner will be full-time dad The government originally predicted between 2% and 8% of eligible couples would take SPL during the first few years of the new policy and says it still expects take-up to be within that range. But a survey by Working Families, a charity that campaigns on work-life balance issues, said a survey it conducted last year suggested raising awareness was only part of the solution. Working Families chief executive Sarah Jackson said some families could not afford for fathers to take parental leave. ""Of those fathers who said they wouldn't use the scheme, more than a third said this was because they couldn't afford to,"" she said. ""Those employers that can afford to should go beyond the minimum pay for SPL."" Many fathers had not been in their jobs long enough to qualify for SPL, she added. ""If the Government is serious about equality at work and tackling the gender pay gap, it should consider also introducing a properly paid, standalone period of extended paternity leave for fathers."" Research conducted by law firm EMW last year,external, based on a Freedom of Information request, suggested only 8,700 couples took advantage of the scheme between April 2016 and March 2017. EMW calculated that was 1% of eligible couples while the Department for Business said it was around 3% of those eligible. EMW suggested low take-up was partly due to the cultural stigma for men of taking time off work and concerns that they might come across as less committed to their job if they ask for leave. The Department for Business said it was normal for the policy to take some time to bed in and that the scheme would be formally evaluated later this year. What's it like being a stay-at-home dad?

The 65 passengers and six crew died when the Saratov Airlines jet went down minutes after take-off from Moscow's Domodedovo airport on Sunday. Bad weather, human error or technical failure are seen as possible causes. Officials do not see terrorism as a likely cause. According to Russia's Investigative Committee, ""when the plane crashed it was intact, there was no fire, and the explosion happened on impact"". Earlier some eyewitnesses had reported seeing the jet ablaze as it plummeted. The search for debris and body parts is hard - in deep snow across a huge area This is the first commercial passenger jet crash for more than a year. Who were the victims of the Russia crash? 2017 safest year for air travel as fatalities fall Air disasters timeline The Antonov An-148 was en route to Orsk in the Ural mountains. It crashed near the village of Argunovo, about 80km (50 miles) south-east of Moscow. Wreckage and body parts are strewn over a large area - about 30 hectares (74 acres). More than 700 people are involved in the search operation, struggling through deep snow, but aided by snowmobiles and nine drones. Russia's health minister said recovery of all of the victims' remains could take up to a week. So far more than 200 body fragments have been recovered. The emergencies ministry is collecting DNA samples from victims' relatives - specialists have flown to Orsk to do that. The official list of passengers and crew has been published,external(in Russian) by the ministry. A child and two teenagers were among the passengers, most of whom were from the Orenburg region where Orsk is located. The list is still being updated. Among those killed was a man from Switzerland and another from Azerbaijan. At least 11 passengers were living in or near Moscow. Three were from the St Petersburg area. At least eight passengers were from other parts of Russia, and four of the crew were from Saratov. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Details of some of the victims have emerged. They include Darya Tolmasova, 22, who was the girlfriend of an ice hockey player - Sergei Ilyin, of the Admiral team. Tributes to her were posted on Instagram. President Vladimir Putin has expressed his condolences to the victims' families. Both the US and the UK governments said they were ""deeply saddened"" by the tragedy. This is the first commercial passenger jet crash for more than a year -2017 was the safest year on record for air travel. The plane had been in service for about seven years The plane took off at 14:27 (11:27 GMT) on Sunday. Contact was lost minutes later. Flight-tracking site Flightradar24 said it then descended at the rate of 1,000m (3,300ft) per minute. No emergency call came from the plane, which was reportedly seven years old. The jet was being flown by an experienced pilot who had 5,000 hours of flight time, the airline told Ria-Novosti news agency. A criminal inquiry has been launched for ""violation of the rules for the operation of air transport"". On Monday, emergency workers confirmed they had recovered the jet's second flight recorder. This video can not be played BBC Russian's Sergei Goryashko: ""It's really very difficult... The road is blocked."" In 2015 the regional airline was banned from operating international flights, after inspectors found someone other than the flight crew in a cockpit. The airline appealed and changed its policy before resuming international charter flights in 2016. Antonov aircraft were first developed in Ukraine, but are also made in Russia. The twin-engine model involved in Sunday's crash had its first flight in 2004. In 2011, one broke up mid-flight during a training flight in the Belgorod region in southern Russia, killing all six crew members on board. The country has suffered two major plane crashes since 2015: A Tu-154 military airliner crashed into the Black Seawith the loss of all 92 people aboard on 25 December 2016, with the disaster blamed on pilot error A Russian Airbus A321 carrying tourists crashed in Sinai, Egypt, with the loss of all 224 people aboard on 31 October 2015; the Islamic State group said it had placed a bomb aboard.

Discount chain steals top supermarket spot,"Aldi has been rated the UK's best supermarket, nudging previously top-ranked Waitrose down to fourth place. Customers criticised Aldi stores for being ""untidy"" and for a lack of staff availability, but rated them highly for offering value for money, according to consumer group Which?. Marks and Spencer was second, winning marks for store appearance and product quality. Lidl ranked third. The large supermarkets fared worst, with Sainsbury's ranked last of nine. The survey, conducted last October, asked customers to rate their supermarket shopping experiences in the past six months.  The chains are scored on customer satisfaction and whether they would recommend the store to a friend. Waitrose, Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's lost marks over value-for-money compared to the discount chains. Which? said respondents praised the ease of finding items on shelves at Aldi. But both Lidl and Aldi scored poorly for queuing time, staff availability and for the range of products on offer. But they were marked up for the quality of their fresh and own-label products. Aldi 74% Marks and Spencer 73% Lidl 69% Waitrose 68% Iceland 65% Tesco 64% Asda 63% Morrisons 63% Sainsbury's 62% While Aldi accounts for only 7% of the UK grocery market and Lidl 5%, the discount chains have seen strong sales growth over the last few years. ""With food costs rising it seems as though shoppers have felt the pinch and are voting with their feet and wallets,"" said Alex Neill, managing director of Which? home products and services. ""Aldi and Lidl have won over their customers with value for money, knocking Waitrose off the top spot."" Newspaper reports suggest Tesco is considering launching its own budget supermarket chain. The Sunday Times reported that the country's largest supermarket has ""secret plans"" to take on the discounters at their own game, by opening stores offering a limited range of own-brand products. A spokesperson Tesco declined to comment. Do the better off really use discounters? The man driving Aldi's remarkable growth The changing face of retail The supermarkets were also rated for their online services. Iceland retained the top ranking for the third year running, but shared the spot with Ocado for the first time. Asda remained at the bottom of the table for online deliveries where it has been for more than a decade. Amazon Fresh, which only launched in 2016 and is only available in the south east of England, came in fifth position. Do the better off really use discounters?

Inquiry into Stagecoach East Coast deal,"The decision to end the East Coast Mainline rail franchise early is to come under scrutiny from MPs. The Department for Transport has saidStagecoach and Virgin will withdraw from running the servicewithin months after running into difficulties. Now the House of Commons transport committee has announced that it will hold an inquiry into the matter. Rail Minister Jo Johnson acknowledged the companies overbid for the right to run the service. He told the BBC's Today programme: ""They overbid, it's very simple and the department is  looking very carefully into the bidding process to ensure there aren't any incentives for bidders to overbid."" However, he said it was not possible to remove the element of risk entirely: ""With any private enterprise there is an element of risk. It is unrealistic to expect government to eliminate that altogether."" Lilian Greenwood, who chairs the transport committee, said: ""There are serious questions to be asked of the train operator, Network Rail and ministers and the transport committee intends to ask them. ""The failure of the East Coast franchise has wider implications for rail franchising and the competitiveness of the current system. Lessons need to be learned by all concerned. ""In the meantime, the Department for Transport must take the right steps to protect passengers and taxpayers. Safeguards must be put in place to restore public confidence in the sustainability of our railways."" The inside track on the East Coast mainline East Coast decision investigated by watchdog 'Indefensible' deal over East Coast rail Plan to fix 'creaking' railways unveiled by government The East Coast Mainline franchise was taken into public ownership in 2009 after being run by National Express. It was re-privatised when Stagecoach and Virgin signed a deal to run the East Coast line from 2015 to 2023, promising to pay the government Â£3.3bn to run the service. Stagecoach owns 90% of the joint venture and Virgin owns the remaining 10%. Last week, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Stagecoach had ""got its numbers wrong"" and would continue running the London to Edinburgh line only for ""a small number of months and no more"". He said the government might step in to run the service, adding that the day-to-day operation of the line would be unaffected. The National Audit Office has already announced it will investigate the government's handling of the franchise. Chris Grayling is considering two solutions to the issue A Stagecoach Group spokesman said: ""Virgin Trains East Coast is a well-run, profitable railway and we are continuing to meet our contractual commitments, as we have done throughout the past 21 years in operating train services on behalf of the government."" He added that customer satisfaction with the route was high and that it was ""delivering 30% higher payments to the taxpayer than when the route was in public ownership"". And Mr Johnson told the BBC that passenger journeys had doubled since the line had been run as a franchise in the 1990s. Mr Grayling has said he is considering two approaches. One option is to allow Stagecoach to continue operating the franchise on a short-term and not-for-profit basis until a new contract is awarded in 2020. Alternatively, East Coast Mainline could be brought back under government control and be run by the Department for Transport through an operator of last resort.

Digital cash hack hits government websites,"The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) took down its website after a warning that hackers were taking control of visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency. Security researcher Scott Helme said more than 4,000 websites, including many government ones, were affected. He said the affected code had now been disabled and visitors were no longer at risk. The ICO said: ""We are aware of the issue and are working to resolve it."" Mr Helme said he was alerted by a friend who had received a malware warning when he visited the ICO website. He traced the problem to a website plug-in called Browsealoud, used to help blind and partially sighted people access the web. Texthelp, the company which makes the plug-in, confirmed that the product was affected for four hours by malicious code designed to generate cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency involved was Monero - a rival to Bitcoin that is designed to make transactions in it ""untraceable"" back to the senders and recipients involved. The plug-in had been tampered with to add a program, Coinhive, which ""mines"" for Monero by running processor-intensive calculations on visitors' computers. Once the plug-in was infected, it affected thousands of other websites in addition to the ICO's, which used it. Generating crypto-currencies involves lots of computer hardware By Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent The surge in value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hasn't escaped the attention of hackers looking to make a quick buck. Mining, the process where new digital coins are created by solving complex mathematical problems, uses increasing amounts of computer processing power and that means big electricity bills. All the better then if you can get other people's computers to do the job. The hackers do this by inserting software into websites which then means that, unbeknown to them, visitors' computers are put to work mining cryptocurrencies. It seems that the Information Commissioner's site along with others run by the government were infected by crypto-mining code injected into some accessibility software they all use. This kind of attack is becoming increasingly common and while it appears not to cause data loss or damage to systems, it does mean computers can run much more slowly. What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin boom prompts mining malware growth Starbucks wi-fi made computers mine cash Mr Helme said: ""It's a very lucrative proposal. They infect one website and it infects close to 5,000. ""This was a very serious breach. They could have extracted personal data, stolen information or installed malware. It was only limited by the hackers' imaginations."" As well as the ICO website, the hacked script was found running on the site of the Student Loans Company, Barnsley Hospital and other websites in the UK and worldwide. Martin McKay, chief technical officer of TextHelp, said: ""In light of other recent cyber-attacks all over the world, we have been preparing for such an incident for the last year and our data security action plan was actioned straight away."" The company is commissioning a security review by an independent consultancy following the attack, he said. Because the malware only runs while someone is actively visiting an infected site, there is no further risk to users' computers, Mr Helme added. A National Cyber Security Centre spokesman said: ""NCSC technical experts are examining data involving incidents of malware being used to illegally mine cryptocurrency. ""The affected service has been taken offline, largely mitigating the issue. Government websites continue to operate securely. ""At this stage there is nothing to suggest that members of the public are at risk.""

Oxfam 'failed in moral leadership',"This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt: 'They did absolutely the wrong thing' Ministers could cut off funding for Oxfam if it cannot account for the way it handled claims of sexual misconduct by aid workers, the international development secretary has warned. Penny Mordaunt will meet the charity on Monday to hear more about claims staff used prostitutes in Haiti in 2011. She said Oxfam had failed in its ""moral leadership"" over the ""scandal"". Meanwhile, Oxfam hasannounced new measures,externalfor the prevention and handling of sexual abuse cases. Ms Mordaunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr she had written to other organisations funded by Department for International Development (DfID) urging them to report any safeguarding issues, past or present, and pledged they would all be followed up. Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' Oxfam denies cover-up over 'Haiti prostitutes' Head of Oxfam in Haiti resigns amid inquiry Oxfam has faced growing criticism for the way it handled the allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti, where they were working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake that devastated they country in 2010. The charity's own investigation into the allegations led to four people being sacked and three others resigning - among them its country director, Roland van Hauwermeiren. Ms Mordaunt said the allegations were ""a complete betrayal of both the people Oxfam were there to help and also the people that sent them there to do that job"". She said Oxfam did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting the detail of the allegations and that no organisation could be a government partner if it did not ""have the moral leadership to do the right thing"". Anime fans 'sobbing' at Olympic ice skating French Muslim quits talent show amid row Sex and the City stars feud over death She said she was considering whether Oxfam should receive any more funding from the government - which gave it Â£32m ($44m) in the last financial year. The Oxfam staff had been in Haiti as part of the relief effort following the 2010 earthquake Oxfam's chairman of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the reports in the Times newspaper had led to other staff coming forward with concerns about how employees were recruited and vetted. She said the charity's board had appointed a consultant earlier this year to review its culture and working practices, which would now be extended. ""If that review brings about a safer environment for all, then the publicity of the last few days, painful as it has been, will also have been valuable,"" she said. ""It is not sufficient to be appalled by the behaviour of our former staff - we must and will learn from it and use it as a spur to improvement."" The charity will also introduce tougher vetting of staff and mandatory safeguarding training for new recruits and work with the rest of the aid sector to make it easier to share intelligence about people who have been found guilty of sexual misconduct. This will be in addition to measures designed to prevent sexual abuse and misconduct and improve the handling of allegations which Oxfam says it introduced in the wake of the Haiti case in 2011. Meanwhile, Oxfam is facing further allegations,reported in the Observer,external, that staff on its mission in Chad - also led by Mr van Hauwermeiren - used prostitutes in 2006. Oxfam said it could not corroborate the latest claims. The Sunday Times has also reported new allegations,external, saying more than 120 workers from UK charities were accused of sexual abuse in the past year. Ms Mordaunt's predecessor Priti Patel said she was aware of a wider issue of sexual abuse and child exploitation from when she was at DfID. She told Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics there was ""a culture of denial in the aid sector about the exploitation and sexual abuse that has taken place historically for decades"" and called for a database for ""predatory paedophiles"" who she claimed could be infiltrating the organisations. Ms Mordaunt said she suspected there were paedophiles targeting the sector to carry out predatory activities, making it important that aid organisations reported offences. The allegations of misconduct by Oxfam staff in Haiti date from 2011 but came to lightin a report in the Times on Friday,external, which said the charity's country director for Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, was alleged to have used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Oxfam knew about the allegations at the time and launched an internal investigation, as a result of which four members of staff were dismissed. Three others, including Mr Van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to resign before the end of the investigation. Mr Van Hauwermeiren went on to work elsewhere in the sector, but Oxfam said it would not have provided a positive reference. The charity says it made a report public at the time which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti and issued a press release - but did not give details of the allegations. It told the Charity Commission it was investigating inappropriate sexual behaviour, bullying, harassment and staff intimidation but did again not reveal the exact details. The regulator took no further action at the time, but has since saidit would have acted differently had it known all the facts. Oxfam has denied any cover-up. Its chief executive, Mark Goldring, told the BBC that describing details of the behaviour at the time could have drawn ""extreme attention"" to it, which he said would have been in no-one's best interest.

Oxfam to meet government over Haiti sex claims,"Penny Lawrence says she took ""full responsibility"" for the behaviour of staff in Chad and Haiti Oxfam's deputy chief executive has resigned over the handling of a sex scandal involving aid workers. The British charity is accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011. Penny Lawrence said she was ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility. The Charity Commission has launched a statutory inquiry into Oxfam - which denies a cover-up - but details of its scope have not yet been released. The watchdog says it has concerns the charity may not have ""fully and frankly"" disclosed everything it knew about the claims despite previous assurances from Oxfam. Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the commission, said if details had been known it would have dealt with the situation ""very differently"". This video can not be played Former Oxfam employee Widza Bryant: ""I was told my many locals there were... sexual relations"" It comes after an earlier meeting with the International Development Secretary in an effort to protect Oxfam's funding from being cut. Ms Lawrence joined Oxfam GB in 2006 as international programmes director, leading teams across 60 countries, according to the charity's website. Reality check: How much money goes to Oxfam? How will the Haiti scandal affect Oxfam? Oxfam boss says charity is ashamed Oxfam did not disclose 'full Haiti details' ""Concerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon,"" she said in a statement. ""It is now clear that these allegations - involving the use of prostitutes and which related to the behaviour of both the country director and members of his team in Chad - were raised before he moved to Haiti."" By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale A statutory inquiry is the most serious action the Charity Commission can take. It gives the regulator new powers to investigate, demand information, suspend trustees and even freeze bank accounts. So this shows how seriously the Commission is taking the sexual misconduct claims about Oxfam staff in Haiti.  It also shows how unhappy the Commission is at not being given the full facts about what went on. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt is being equally tough on Oxfam, threatening to withdraw funding unless it gets its house in order and shows some moral leadership. But like the Charity Commission, Ms Mordaunt is also keen to show that she is acting, by promising a new unit in her department to establish a global register of aid workers that might be able to stop predatory individuals being re-employed by charities. She knows she will face tough questioning from MPs on the international development committee next week about what her department knew and what she has done since. Reputations are on the line here and no organisation wants to be found wanting. The allegations emerged inThe Times,externalon Friday, which said Oxfam's country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti. Oxfam said allegations that underage girls may have been involved were unproven. BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant said senior government sources feared the abuse allegations could be ""the tip of the iceberg"" and that all aid agencies operating in Haiti as well as Oxfam would be investigated. He added locals expressed ""real anger"" at what they say is impunity by international aid agencies for the way they have behaved. Widza Bryant, who worked in HR for Oxfam in Haiti from 2009 for three years, said she shared ""ongoing rumours"" about locals being exploited with management ""on many occasions"". She told BBC News: ""There were a lot of rumours on the ground about management and leaders exploiting the locals sexually and in other ways to get jobs and to have good standing."" This video can not be played Oxfam Chief Executive: ""We apologise to the British public and the Haitian public"" Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, admitted the charity had failed to act on complaints highlighting the failure to allow Mr van Hauwermeiren to move onto another post after allegations were revealed. He said the use of prostitutes was ""not explicitly contrary"" to Oxfam's code of conduct at the time, but bringing Oxfam into disrepute in any way and abusing people who may have been beneficiaries was. Mr Goldring added: ""There was an exploration of how should the organisation respond but we didn't act on it."" The European Commission has said it expects full clarity and maximum transparency from Oxfam, adding that it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"". The charity's programme in Haiti received â¬1.7m in EU funds in 2011. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said Oxfam had apologised for its ""appalling"" behaviour and that the government had not been told at the time the allegations involved sexual misconduct or beneficiaries. Oxfam has been told to tell the Department for International Development by the end of the week how it will handle any future allegations around safeguarding or it faces losing government funding. Ms Mordaunt also called for clearer whistle-blowing policies across the charitable sector and launched an urgent review into safeguarding and aid providers. The Innocent drinks company - one of Oxfam's corporate sponsors which donates around Â£100,000 per year- said it wants to see a clear plan ""for how this could not ever happen again"". The charity has since postponed a ""Fashion Fighting Poverty"" event, which had been due to take place as part of London Fashion Week on Thursday, saying it was not the ""right time"" at present. This video can not be played BBC world affairs correspondent Will Grant says locals believe aid agencies have enjoyed ""impunity"" Oxfam's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren. It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations. Oxfam has faced growing criticism of the way it handled the allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti, where they were working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake that devastated the country in 2010. Haiti's ambassador in London Bocchit Edmond called the revelations ""shocking"", ""shameful"", and ""unacceptable"". On Sunday, Ms Mordaunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr the charity did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting details of the allegations and that no organisation could be a government partner if it did not ""have the moral leadership to do the right thing"". Ahead of the government meeting, Oxfamannounced new measures,externalfor handling of sexual abuse cases, saying it would introduce tougher vetting of staff and mandatory safeguarding training for new recruits. Oxfam's chairman of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the charity's board had appointed a consultant earlier this year to review its culture and working practices, which would now be extended.

"Fathers failing to 'share the joy'Take-up of shared parental leave may be as low as 2%, prompting a campaign to promote the policy.","A new publicity drive is aiming to encourage higher take-up of shared parental leave. Around 285,000 couples are eligible every year for shared parental leave, but take-up ""could be as low as 2%"", the Department for Business said. Around half of the general public are still unaware the option exists, nearly three years after it was introduced, the government said. It now plans to spend Â£1.5m to better inform parents about the policy. Experts say that as well as a lack of understanding of what is on offer, cultural barriers and financial penalties are deterring some parents from sharing parental leave. The government'scampaign,externalwill encourage parents to ""share the joy"" through online advertising, social media and on billboards. Business minister Andrew Griffiths said the policy meant dads didn't have to miss out on ""their baby's first step, word or giggle"". ""Employers can reap the benefits too. We know that flexibility in work is proven to create happier, more loyal and more productive workforces,"" he said. Shared parental leave (SPL) was introduced in April 2015 It allows parents to share 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay after they have a baby Parents can take time off separately or can be at home together for up to six months SPL is paid at Â£140.98 per week or 90% of your average earnings, whichever is lower Shared parental leave explained Tom Markwell and Leila Reyburn, who work in the charity sector in London, said shared parental leave offered them greater flexibility. After they had their daughter, Pearl, in 2016, Leila took the first 10 months off work to care for her. Tom then spent two months at home. They say it gave Tom the chance to bond more closely with Pearl, while Leila was able to take up the opportunity for a promotion at work. Firm offers paid leave for all parents What's it like being a stay-at-home dad? New Zealand PM's partner will be full-time dad The government originally predicted between 2% and 8% of eligible couples would take SPL during the first few years of the new policy and says it still expects take-up to be within that range. But a survey by Working Families, a charity that campaigns on work-life balance issues, said a survey it conducted last year suggested raising awareness was only part of the solution. Working Families chief executive Sarah Jackson said some families could not afford for fathers to take parental leave. ""Of those fathers who said they wouldn't use the scheme, more than a third said this was because they couldn't afford to,"" she said. ""Those employers that can afford to should go beyond the minimum pay for SPL."" Many fathers had not been in their jobs long enough to qualify for SPL, she added. ""If the Government is serious about equality at work and tackling the gender pay gap, it should consider also introducing a properly paid, standalone period of extended paternity leave for fathers."" Research conducted by law firm EMW last year,external, based on a Freedom of Information request, suggested only 8,700 couples took advantage of the scheme between April 2016 and March 2017. EMW calculated that was 1% of eligible couples while the Department for Business said it was around 3% of those eligible. EMW suggested low take-up was partly due to the cultural stigma for men of taking time off work and concerns that they might come across as less committed to their job if they ask for leave. The Department for Business said it was normal for the policy to take some time to bed in and that the scheme would be formally evaluated later this year. What's it like being a stay-at-home dad?

May and Varadkar head to Stormont for talks,"Theresa May said she had ""full and frank conversations with the main parties"" Prime Minister Theresa May has urged Northern Ireland's parties to make one final push towards an agreement to restore devolved government. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful that a deal would be struck this week. They were speaking after a series of meetings with the parties in Northern Ireland. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have said that a deal is possible following Monday's talks. DUP leader Arlene Foster says there ""isn't a deal yet"" Speaking afterwards, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""There isn't a deal yet, what there is, is very good progress."" Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the talks had reached ""a decisive phase"". Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide Tory-DUP deal: What you need to know Profile: Sinn FÃ©in's new leader Mary Lou McDonald Mrs May said that ""it was now at the point where it's time for local elected representatives to find a way to work together"". She said she had ""full and frank conversations with the main parties"" and that while ""some differences remain, I believe it is possible to see the basis of an agreement here"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful that the two parties could ""come to an agreement this week"". Asked why the DUP did not meet the Irish government at Stormont today a party source told the BBC they were focussing on internal Northern Ireland matters. The source added there were also logistical difficulties. Leo Varadkar said he believes a deal could be struck within days ""The soundings from Arlene Foster and Mary Lou McDonald were positive,"" he added. Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn FÃ©incollapsed in January last year. The then deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of the coalition after a series of disagreements with the final straw being the DUP's handling ofa scandal over green energy scheme. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald (left) says the talks have reached ""a decisive phase"" Mrs Foster said her party wanted a deal that was ""sustainable into the future"". Ms McDonald said:  ""What is required now is the political will to make it happen."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called on the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in to ""stop messing about"". Leo Varadkar tweeted a photo of the intergovernmental talks at Stormont ""We still don't know the colour of this deal,"" he said. Prior to arriving at Stormont, Mrs May visited Bombardier's plant in Belfast. Theresa May toured the Bombardier aerospace plant in east Belfast She met factory floor workers and was shown the capabilities of the multi-million pound plant which is the main production site for wings for the C-Series. Her visit came just over two weeks afterBombardier's victory in a trade dispute with rival aerospace firm Boeing. The US International Trade Commission (ITC) overturned a decision to impose damaging tariffs on US imports of its C-Series aircraft, which would have placed jobs in the Belfast factory at risk. Mrs May met Bombardier staff and management Several previous rounds of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have, so far, failed to break the political deadlock. Earlier, a DUP source told the BBC a deal ""is not likely"" on Monday. Mrs May last visited Northern Ireland in May when she toured the Balmoral Show ahead of a snap general election. Since then, she has struck a parliamentary deal with the DUP and has faced criticism for adopting a hands-off approach to the deadlock at Stormont. Among the issues that have divided the parties is Sinn FÃ©in's demand for an Irish language act. The talks are taking place in Stormont House By BBC News NI political correspondent Mark Devenport The Irish language act has been a major stumbling block, with DUP leader Arlene Foster promising previously that it wouldn't happen on her watch. What I am led to believe is that there could possibly be a very strange, legislative fudge which would see the creation of three separate bills, one for the Irish language, one dealing with Ulster Scots and one for wider cultural issues. The suggestion is that these three bills would end up merging together as one act in an attempt to spare blushes on all sides. On marriage equality, I am not exactly sure how they are going to sort that one out, but one option that has been discussed is the possibility of bringing a private member's bill on the issue or deferring responsibility to Westminster. At least three or four DUP MLAs would be pretty hostile to the notion, but equally there are some who would support it, or at least not object A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister would remind the parties of the many pressing issues facing Northern Ireland and make clear her belief that a fully functioning executive is the best way to serve the interests of the whole community. Secretary of State Karen Bradley welcomed Mrs May to Stormont House ""The (Irish) government has consistently said that the restoration of the institutions is essential in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and that it will continue to work very closely with the British government to support the northern parties to achieve this outcome,"" he said. At the weekend, Sinn FÃ©in's vice president Michelle O'Neill predicted that the Stormont talks would conclude this week. Her comment strengthened speculation that a compromise between her party and the DUP could soon be unveiled.
