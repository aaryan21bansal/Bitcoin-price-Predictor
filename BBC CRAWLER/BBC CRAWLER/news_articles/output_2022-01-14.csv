US warns of Russian 'false-flag' Ukraine operation,"There are fears in Ukraine that Russia is planning an invasion Russia is plotting to stage acts of provocation to create a pretext to invade Ukraine, a US official has said. A Pentagon spokesman said Russian operatives were planning a ""false-flag"" operation, to allow Moscow to accuse Ukraine of preparing an attack. Russia has dismissed the claims. It comes after a week of US-Russian talks aimed at defusing tensions. Ukraine on Friday accused Russia of being behind a cyber-attack on dozens of official websites. Beforethe sites went offline,a message appeared warning Ukrainians to ""prepare for the worst"". Access to most of the sites was restored within hours. The US and Nato condemned the attack and have offered support to Ukraine. Russia has not commented on the hack. Russia and West talk all week but war risk remains Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Friday about what he said were Russia's plans. ""It has pre-positioned a group of operatives to conduct what we call a false-flag operation, an operation designed to look like an attack on them or Russian speaking people in Ukraine as an excuse to go in,"" he said. The operatives were trained in urban warfare and using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against pro-Russian rebels, US officials said. Ukraine's Defence Ministry said similar acts were being prepared against Russian troops stationed in the breakaway Transdnistria region of Moldova. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded by describing the reports as unsubstantiated and ""confirmed by nothing"". It is unusual for the US to go public with such specific intelligence determinations. But the Biden administration has clearly decided to try to pre-empt any Russian claims of Ukrainian belligerence by exposing an alleged strategy of sabotage and disinformation. The Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the US wanted the world to know how an invasion could play out, because this scenario was from the same playbook the Russians used in Crimea. It's a dramatic move after a week of intense diplomacy that produced proposals but no agreement on how to resolve the crisis. Mr Kirby said the administration still thinks there is time and space for diplomacy. And that it does not believe President Vladimir Putin has made a final decision about whether to further invade Ukraine. The Russians deny they have any such intention. But the US is not staying quiet while it waits for Mr Putin's next move. And it has threatened financial sanctions and other consequences if he does push deeper into Ukraine The US official's remarks follow an earlier statement by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who told reporters about intelligence that Russia was laying the groundwork to try to fabricate a pretext for invading Ukraine. He said it was the same playbook Russia used when it occupied Crimea in 2014. Russia has amassed weaponry along with tens of thousands of troops on the border with Ukraine, prompting invasion fears. US and Russian officials have been in talks for the past week in an attempt to reduce tensions over Ukraine, but little agreement appears to have been reached. Russia denies it is planning to invade Ukraine but is seeking guarantees against Nato's eastward expansion, something that Western countries say they are unable to give.

MrBeast tops YouTube rich list for first time,"MrBeast uses stunts and pranks to delight his audience Jimmy Donaldson, the 23-year-old American better known as MrBeast, was YouTube's highest-earning content creator in 2021, according to Forbes. His elaborate stunts have generated more than 10 billion views on the platform and earned him $54m (Â£39m). He has overtaken 10-year-old toy reviewer Ryan Kaji, who has topped theannual list,externalfor the past two years. Together, the 10 best-paid YouTubers made a combined $300m (Â£218m) in 2021, the US magazine estimated. Jake Paul is in second place, his first appearance in the top 10 since 2018, and his brother Logan also returns after being absent since 2017. Minecraft player Nathan Graham, known as Unspeakable, makes the list for the first time in fifth place. Jake Paul's high-profile boxing fights have earned him a spot back on the list YouTube trends expert Chris Stokel-Walker said this year's list is interesting because it shows ""how stale"" YouTube has become. ""It strikes me how white and male this whole list is,"" he said. ""If you take any of the names and look at previous years' lists, you'll probably find them on there as well, just in a different order."" During the pandemic, lots of traditional entertainment media had a difficult time adjusting. Movies were delayed, soap opera schedules were altered and video game releases were postponed. For YouTube, however, it was a time of boom. Research suggests that in 2021, the platform had 2.3 billion users worldwide. YouTube says one billion hours of video content is consumed on the platform every day. Ryan Kaji ranked in seventh position this year Stokel-Walker said: ""YouTube was developed as something that would shake up the media industry and get rid of gatekeepers. It was going to democratise how our society and entertainment industry looks. ""This list suggests that it's become more like TV than it would prefer to be. The arrival of money on the platform means content is very high stakes - and we see this in what MrBeast is making. ""It's not really similar to anything else on YouTube. It's more like big-budget TV."" Stokel-Walker suggested the high production values of YouTube today are creating a barrier to entry, meaning you need to ""pay to play and be successful"". Seven-year-old Nastya is the only female in the top 10 The top earners as identified by Forbes are not necessarily those with the most views, but rather those who have been able to successfully earn money through brand partnerships, sponsorship deals and merchandise sales. Although it's estimated that two-thirds of YouTube content is not in the English language, it seems that English-speaking creators are most able to financially capitalise on their popularity. YouTube, like many other modern media platforms, is dealing withissues of misinformationand harmful content - however this doesn't seem to have affected its creators' abilities to attract advertisers and sponsors to their channels. Here is the full top 10. Preston Arsement grew his community largely thanks to videos centred around Minecraft, although he runs several channels on the website. A regular on this list, he earned an estimated $16m (Â£11m) in 2021 - down a little from the year before, when he placed sixth. The controversial boxer and vlogger was last in the top 10 in 2017. He earned $18m (Â£13m) in 2021. Comedy pranksters Dude Perfect was number three on the list in 2020. They made $20m (Â£14m) last year. The world's most famous toy reviewer has dropped from the top of the tree to number seven. In 2021, his blend of toy reviews, educational videos and family vlogs helped him earn $27m (Â£19m). The seven-year-old Russian has nearly 90 million subscribers on YouTube. She started as a toy unboxer but now her vlogs and music videos are growing in popularity and her earnings have risen to $28m (Â£20m) in 2021. A new entry, the Minecraft player has been uploading to YouTube for a decade. He sold the rights to his back catalogue to the business Spotter last year, which contributed to his earnings of $28.5m (Â£20m). A staple of the YouTube highest earning list, the hosts of geek chat show Good Mythical Morning earned $30m (Â£22m) in 2021. Another regular gaming creator, Markiplier has used his business acumen to make a successful brand of merchandise, earning $38m (Â£27m) last year. Bybranching out into boxing, Jake Paul has found himself back in the top 10. His high-profile fights against UFC stars helped him earn $45m (Â£32m) in 2021. It's some turnaround for the creator who was criticised alongside his bother for some of their vlogs in 2017, which many found to be in poor taste. With more boxing plans in the pipeline for 2022, it would be no surprise to see him keep his place among YouTube's elite on next year's list. YouTube's top earner is a creator who uses stunts and pranks to delight his audience. Last year, he recreated elements of Netflix hit Squid Game on his channel, played hide and seek in an 80,000-seater stadium and was buried underground. His 10 billion views, alongside the MrBeast burger franchise, meant Jimmy Donaldson almost doubled his income in 2021 after ranking second on this list the previous year.

Babies in hospital with Omicron as a precaution,"More babies are going to hospital with Covid during this latest Omicron wave but they are not very sick with the virus, say UK experts - based on the available data since December. Doctors say early findings are ""incredibly"" encouraging -  Covid remains very low-risk. They say parents can be reassured, and the NHS has space if babies need care. While many of the babies had a fever with or without a cough, few needed treatment such as oxygen. The rise in Covid-related paediatric admissions which hospitals have been seeing is largely for under-fives, and particularly children under the age of one. NHS England conducted a very rapid evaluation of around 50 admissions of babies with Omicron across around 33 hospitals. It continues to gather more evidence as new cases occur. Meanwhile, early data has also been released by theScientific Advisory Group for Emergencies,external(Sage) comparing around 171 child admissions with Omicron to those earlier in the pandemic. With more of the virus circulating at the moment, there is a greater chance that children will catch Covid. Around 4.3 million, or one in every 15 people, are thought to be infected with Covid at the moment. People aged 20 to 29 have the highest rates, and the over-80s the lowest. As with earlier in the pandemic, most children and babies who catch Covid will not become ill, but a small proportion will. Some may be in hospital for other reasons, but test positive for the virus while there. Prof Calum Semple, who advises the Government as part of Sage, said: ""Our study has shown that there has been an increased proportion of children being admitted in the last four weeks associated with the onset of Omicron and this has been particularly driven by children under the age of one. ""The striking feature is that we're now seeing essentially 42% of the children are under the age of one, whereas previously it was around about 30%."" Prof Russell Viner, who is an expert in child health at University College London, said Covid was behaving like normal winter viruses in children: ""Clinically, this picture is incredibly reassuring. Half were in for observation only. The average length of stay was low...around two days."" Even babies with other serious medical complications do not appear to be getting very ill with the virus. When babies and infants do get Covid symptoms, they tend to be a raised temperature and a slight cough. A fever is something parents or carers should consider seeking medical advice about. When to seek help if your young child is ill,external And women who are pregnant can help protect themselves and their baby by getting vaccinated against Covid. Unvaccinated mums-to-be who catch the virus near the end of pregnancy are at higher risk of birth-related complications, including premature births and stillbirths. Pregnant women urged not to delay getting jab Ideally, use a digital thermometer to get a fast, accurate reading A fever is a temperature of 38C or above and can be a sign of an infection such as Covid You can contact your GP or call 111 for advice if your baby has a temperature Some can be managed at home Source:NHS,external The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) says children's wards are experiencing a busy winter, as is usual for this time of year. While paediatricians are seeing lots of babies and young children with fever and respiratory conditions, very few with Omicron are needing paediatric intensive care. RCPCH President Dr Camilla Kingdon said: ""We need to watch this space but the picture is a reassuring one.""

E.On apologises for sending socks to customersIt is the second energy supplier in a week to admit to a marketing gaffe as customers face rocketing bills.,"E.On says its socks ""should have been stopped"" Energy supplier E.On has said it is ""incredibly sorry"" for sending socks to customers in a bid to encourage them to turn the heating down. It is the second major supplier to admit to a marketing gaffe when customers are facing a cost of living squeeze driven by energy prices. Earlier in the week, Ovo's founder said he was ""really embarrassed"" about energy saving advice including ""doing a few star jumps"" and cuddling pets. Energy bills are set to soar in April. A new price cap looks set to add about Â£600 to the annual gas and electricity bill of a household with typical energy usage. Energy boss blames bad day for âridiculousâ advice E.On compensates customers after Christmas blunder The socks were sent out by E.On Next - an arm of the energy giant which sells and promotes renewable electricity. The footwear came with a message encouraging people to leave ""lighter footprints"" by turning heating down and lowering carbon emissions. However, some customers reacted with anger and perplexity - especially when they were sent to elderly relatives. Now, the company has apologised. Writing on Twitter, it said: ""If you recently received a pair of socks from us, we would like to say we are incredibly sorry for how we have made some people feel. ""In light of the seriousness of current challenges that many people are facing, this mailing should have been stopped and we are sorry."" As first reported in the Daily Mail,external, the company said it sent the socks to 30,000 customers who responded to an energy saving campaign last year. In a subsequent statement, a spokesman for the company said: ""This activity was in no way designed to detract from the seriousness of the current energy crisis ""This campaign originally went ahead last year and was intended as a fun way to encourage people to think about 'lightening your carbon footprint' and isn't meant to be anything to do with the current challenges many people are facing."" He said E.On had invested billions of pounds into better insulation, efficient heating, and advice to customers. E.On is the UK's second biggest energy supplier, after British Gas. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of the third-largest, Ovo, said earlier in the week that ""someone had a bad day"" when a link was sent to customers directing them to a blog encouraging them to save energy by hugging pets. The latest gaffe comes on the day an alliance of charities called on the government for urgent action to tackle the energy bill crisis. The 25 charities, including Save the Children, Age UK, End Fuel Poverty Coalition, WWF, Green Alliance and Greenpeace, said emergency funding was needed to support the most vulnerable.

Ex-supermarket boss Lord Sainsbury dies aged 94,"Lord Sainsbury hosted a visit by the Queen to celebrate the supermarket's 150th anniversary The former chairman and chief executive of supermarket chain Sainsbury's, Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, has died aged 94, the company has announced. During his 40-year career with the firm he covered several roles, becoming a director in 1958 before being promoted to lead the business in 1969. Lord Sainsbury retired from the company in 1992, becoming its life president. Sainsbury's current CEO Simon Roberts described him as ""one of the great retailers of his time"". He added he was ""a shopkeeper to his core"" and ""was ambitious for the company and led Sainsbury's through an unprecedented period of growth; he was a truly inspirational man"". Martin Scicluna, chairman of Sainsbury's, said he would be ""greatly missed"" by all his friends and colleagues. John Sainsbury photographed in 1973 as the company went on the London Stock Exchange John Davan Sainsbury started working in his family's business in 1950, after national service and university, initially taking on a role in the grocery department. His time at Sainsbury's saw the company grow from a regional, middle-sized grocery chain, to a national household name. Lord Sainsbury became biscuit buyer in 1951 and bacon buyer from 1956, according toThe Sainsbury's Archive.,external A visit to Canada inspired a new method of producing bacon for the new self-service market which he developed and piloted at the abattoir at Haverhill, the archive said. He was also heavily involved in the development of Sainsbury's own range of products, personally approving every packaging design, it said. Lord Sainsbury led the company through other significant changes, including conversion to scanning, the introduction of debit and credit cards, and energy management, it added. John Sainsbury, centre left, at a celebration of the company's centenary on 15 April 1969 In 1980 he was knighted by the Queen for services to the food retailing industry and with his brothers Simon and Timothy helped transform Sainsbury's. In 1991, former managing director Sir Roy Griffiths said no senior member of a family ever cherished the family traditions more closely than Lord Sainsbury. He added: ""No chairman has ever looked after the corporate values so committedly, and nothing has been too much, no generosity too great for people who serve the customer, and by definition the company well.""

Wales Covid rules relaxed as cases drop rapidly,"This video can not be played Covid: How will Wales' restrictions change in the coming weeks? Most restrictions in Wales will be scrapped over the next two weeks if Covid cases continue to fall, the first minister has confirmed. Measures, brought in to tackle the Omicron variant, will be liftedas Wales moves to alert level zero. Opposition parties had called for an exit plan, with Conservative Andrew RT Daviessaying ""Labour got it wrong"",external. Mark Drakeford said Omicron cases had fallen ""rapidly"" and the rules could now be relaxed ""gradually"". What are the rules in Wales now? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Self isolation period in Wales cut by three days The Welsh government also pointed to the success of the booster campaign in enabling it to lift restrictions, with 1.8 million people having received an extra vaccine dose. There will be a four stage process to lifting the current alert level two restrictions in Wales, depending on cases remaining low: Saturday: Numbers allowed to attend an outdoor event will rise from 50 to 500 Friday 21 January: Crowds allowed to return to sporting events, paving the way for rugby Six Nations full houses in Cardiff, and no limits on those attending outdoor events Friday 28 January: Nightclubs can reopen and hospitality allowed to operate normally, although Covid passes will still be required for large events, plus cinemas, nightclubs and theatres. Working from home no longer a legal requirement Thursday 10 February: Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero ""The actions we have taken together have helped us to weather the Omicron storm. The latest data suggests some positive signs that the peak may have passed,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""We can now look more confidently to the future and plan to start gradually removing the alert level two restrictions, starting with the outdoors measures. ""But the pandemic is not over. We will closely monitor the public health situation - this is a fast-moving and volatile variant, which could change suddenly. I urge everyone to continue to follow the rules and have your vaccines to keep Wales safe."" Wales,along with Scotland and Northern Irelandall brought in new Covid restrictions over Christmas because of a rapid rise in cases driven by the Omicron variant. England was the only UK nation thatdid not announce further rules. In Wales, it meant that from 26 December, sports fixtures were forced behind closed doors without spectators, andvolunteer Parkrun events were cancelled. Nightclubs were closed, and events were limited to a maximum of 50 people outdoors and 30 people indoors. Pubs and restaurants were also restricted to table service, with the rule of six in place, while workplaces and shops were required to impose social distancing measures. Both the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru had called for a roadmap out of restrictions, while the Welsh Rugby Union had been considering moving home fixtures for the Six Nations out of Wales. Speaking onBBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford denied the move to relax restrictions was a ""U-turn"", adding: ""Not at all. It's really the opposite of that. ""What we do in Wales is we follow the science, we follow the data. We make difficult decisions when that is necessary."" He added: ""What we are seeing is a very rapid decline of the number of cases in Wales. Last Friday in Wales it was 2,300 cases per 100,000 of the Welsh population, today, only a week later, it is only 1,200."" Mark Drakeford has rejected any suggestions of a U-turn in his approach to these restrictions - he insists the scientific advice he received suggested four weeks of tougher restrictions and he says today's announcement is in line with that time period. He also points out that the Covid numbers have dropped rapidly in the last week. The report from the Welsh government's Technical Advisory Cell before Christmas did talk about four weeks of restrictions, and numbers have plummeted, but it's also the case that we've seen an abrupt change in approach from Welsh ministers over the last couple of days. On Tuesday in the Senedd, in response to Welsh Tory demands for a plan out of alert level two, the first minister quoted modelling saying that ""the peak of the Omicron coronavirus wave has yet to be reached in Wales"", he talked about the number of people suffering from Omicron ""going up not coming down"" and he raised only a heavily caveated possibility of beginning to lift restrictions at the end of next week. At this time, the stats were showing a drop in cases, though Mr Drakeford said the change in the rules over testing meant it was difficult to know whether these were ""genuine falls"" or simply a result of fewer people getting PCR tests. By Thursday, the health minister was striking a much more optimistic note talking about ""very positive signs"" that Wales was ""possibly turning the corner"" on this wave and restrictions will now begin to be lifted this weekend. Today, the cautious tone remains, as you'd expect, but the dogmatism of last Friday's review - where those calling for an easing of restrictions were  described as ""fundamentally wrong"" - has been abandoned as has the pessimism of Tuesday's position. Wales' case rate has fallen to its lowest level since 26 December - 1,274.2 per 100,000 people over seven days. This decline is sooner - and deeper - than a modelled scenario presented only a week ago. Hospital numbers have fallen for two days in a row, although there are still on average a third more patients with confirmed Covid than the week before. It has also emerged that more than half of these patients were in hospital being treated for another primary condition. Numbers of Covid patients in critical care remain stable though and at 21% below the peak seen a year ago. The move to relax restrictions on pubs and restaurants has been welcomed, but there have been warnings that some businesses will struggle to recover after losing trade over the festive period. ""Every day of trading counts because everyone wants to trade their way to recover,"" said chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association Emma McClarkin. She saidon average pubs have lost about Â£16,000 during current restrictionsthat ""they won't recover"". Ms McClarkin said a lot of damage has been done in the period of closure over Christmas The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU)said it was ""delighted"" fans would be allowed for Wales' three Six Nations home gamesin February and March. Parkrun boss, Tom Williams, said he did not think his business should have been impacted in the last round of restrictions. He said: ""We have known since the beginning of the pandemic that physical activity and health are incredibly important when dealing with the Covid infection, and we have known for a while that outdoor environments are incredibly safe."" Meanwhile,Chester FC also fell foul of the restrictions on crowds at sports fixtures, with the four stands of the English club's Deva Stadium actually in Flintshire. Its Vice Chairman Jim Green said he was pleased the club's fans would be able to go to the next home game, but believed this should always have been the case. ""We're still determined to find a long-term solution,"" he said. Parkrun's Tom Williams did not think his business should have been affected in the last round of restrictions Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""I'm pleased they've finally listened to calls from the Welsh Conservatives. ""Despite the detailed scientific evidence from South Africa, Labour ministers clearly overreacted to Omicron, and that has caused significant pain and anguish for families and businesses in Wales. The move comes despite Mr Drakeford saying last Tuesday that Wales was ""in the teeth of the Omicron storm"". Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""If, as it seems, we are indeed at the peak, the right thing to do is see how we can safely respond. ""Raising the limit on outdoor sporting events would be an obvious place to start, moving as swiftly as the continuing improved picture allows in coming days, to lifting other restrictions such as those in hospitality."" Wales has now reached 81% of those eligible for boosters in the Covid vaccination programme, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales. A total of 1,817,842 boosters were given out by 13 January.

Grassroots Tories vote against PM,"Simon Ward was among Conservative leaders who voted to withdraw support from the PM A Conservative association in a safe Tory seat in the West Midlands has voted unanimously to withdraw its support from Boris Johnson. The prime minister is facing calls to resign from the opposition and some Tory MPs afteradmitting attending drinksin the Downing Street garden. Simon Ward, from the Royal Sutton Coldfield Conservative Association, said ""the culture starts at the top"". Mr Johnson has urged MPs to wait for the outcome of an investigation. Conservative leader of the town council, Mr Ward, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We were asking people all over our country to make massive sacrifices... over the last two years. ""I think we have the right to expect everybody in government and in those positions of leadership to follow those same rules and guidelines as well."" Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell attended the meeting but did not vote The vote asking the PM to stand down happened at a meeting on Thursday night, where the area's Conservative MP, Andrew Mitchell was present, but did not take part. He retained the seat in the 2019 election with a majority of more than 19,000. Sutton Coldfield is Conservative through and through. For many years it was the only Conservative seat in the second city, so if Tories here are not supporting the PM, you have to ask how long will his support hold up elsewhere? This vote took place even before the headlines in today's Telegraph detailing parties on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral.  A story guaranteed to play badly in The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield. Like Andrew Mitchell, many Conservative MPs I have been in contact with say they are waiting for the findings of Sue Gray's report, but pressure on them will grow if other associations make similar moves. The councillor said the move to withdraw support from the prime minister reflected ""local views at the very grassroots levels"" and was about ""the standards of leadership we expect"". ""This is about what the right thing is for politics, what the right thing is for our leaders, how this reflects on our country as well, and it's just massively disappointing and it reflects very, very poorly on us as a nation,"" he added. The interim chair of Wyre Forest Conservative Association, Julian Phillips, echoed these sentiments, calling on the prime minister to resign. Mr Johnson, for whom he didn't vote for as leader, had always been a ""controversial character,"" he said, but the latest revelation ""stings a lot more"" than any of his previous controversies. He confirmed his views were shared with the wider party in Wyre Forest. ""I don't think anyone is now of the mindset to defend the Prime Minister. There's a great deal of anger, a great deal of embarrassment. It's not great for any of us."" Two more parties,first revealed by the Daily Telegraph have been referred to Sue Gray as part of acivil service probeinto alleged Covid rule breaking in Downing Street and government departments.

Film tells how Jurassic Park premiere saved cinema,"This video can not be played Jurassic Park premiered at Carmarthen's Lyric as part of Liz Evans's fight to save the theatre A film about a hairdresser who helped bring Hollywood to west Wales to save a local theatre is hitting cinemas. Liz Evans, played by Samantha Morton, led a campaign that convinced Steven Spielberg to stage a premiere of blockbuster Jurassic Park in Carmarthen's Lyric theatre in 1993. Save the Cinema's stars also include Sir Jonathan Pryce and Rhod Gilbert. Liz's real-life son, tenor and Go Compare star Wynne Evans, plays himself and found reliving that time emotional. He said he was about 13 years old when his mother took on the herculean fight to save the Lyric from demolition to make way for a shopping centre. Jurassic Park was one of the blockbuster films of the 1990s ""I've got mixed emotions about the time if I'm honest... she just moved into the theatre,"" Evans said. He said his mother lived by the maxim ""do it now and apologise later"". ""If I wanted to see my parents I'd have to go to the theatre, and so it was very difficult to have to share your mother and your father with an entire town... it was quite a difficult time if I'm honest. ""I lost out on having a constant mum and dad there to help me with my school work or to take interest in things that I would do outside of the youth opera or outside of the theatre."" Liz Evans' son, the tenor Wynne Evans, is more accustomed to playing his alter-ego Gio Compario in the Go Compare adverts Evans, who also presents a show for BBC Radio Wales, said revisiting his childhood had been ""very emotional and changed my opinion of my parents hugely"". He remembers his mother as a strong and driven women with an gift of getting people in authority round to her way of thinking. ""I've never seen anybody walk into a council meeting and manage to turn the room around like my mother could... they just couldn't say no to her."" The real Liz Evans speaking to BBC Wales Today in 1991 Evans has not yet seen the finished film, but is looking forward to seeing his mother portrayed on the big screen. ""If you showed a realistic version of my mother it wouldn't be a PG, that's for sure,"" he joked. For Oscar-nominated British actress Samantha Morton, the role of Liz was irresistible Samantha Morton was able to learn about Liz Evans through documentary footage and speaking to those who knew her ""I just wanted to be part of it,"" she said. ""Liz was incredibly inspiring to young people, and she had their backs. ""No matter who you were, once you were in the youth opera, you were in. And she was a tough teacher as well, which I quite like, in that she treated everybody the same."" Liz died in 2004, but Morton was able to watch her in documentaries and speak to people who knew her. Jurassic Park: When dinosaurs saved a Carmarthen cinema Samantha Morton: 'Abused women aren't allowed to be angry' Jonathan Pryce: Netflix's The Crown casts its final Prince Philip ""Everybody had a Liz story,"" she said. She also had help perfecting Liz's accent. ""I had documentary footage of her talking, but I also had a wonderful voice coach who really helped me with the Carmarthen accent,"" she said. ""Even for the younger people from Carmarthen, the accent is quite different to what it was in the early nineties, so I was well supported in navigating how to play her."" Morton also wanted to take on the role because of the film's wider message about the importance of local independent theatres and cinemas. ""The arts have taken such a crushing blow, both with Brexit and with the pandemic, that I feel that this film is very poignant, and quite on-point really, in reminding people what's important in life,"" she said. Sir Jonathan Pryce also stars in the film Flintshire-born Hollywood star and fellow Oscar nomineeSir Jonathan Pryceplays Mr Morgan, a retired school master and projectionist, who joins the fight to save the cinema. ""I'm from north Wales and it's always very nice to go back home in a way, even though it's down to south Wales, which isn't quite as good as north Wales but there you go, you can't have everything,"" he joked. ""I hope people take from it the sense of the enjoyment of seeing a community again because we're very broken up, pandemic or no pandemic. ""Seeing people coming together with a common aim with a sense of humour and sense of joy, with a song in your heart kind of stuff."" Director Sara Sugarman says the film's cast and crew ""fell in love with west Wales"" Director Sara Sugarman, who was born in Rhyl, Denbighshire, said she was immediately taken by the warmth of the story. ""I love old-fashioned, feel good films and I'm not going to apologise, not at my age now,"" she said. ""I don't want to be cool, I want to sing unsung songs about local heroes, that's what I do, and Liz was this. ""Despite my funky hair I'm actually quite conventional."" She said despite the challenges of making a film during the pandemic, being on location in Carmarthenshire, including Carmarthen, Ammanford, Laugharne and Llandeilo, had been a joy. The film will be shown at the Lyric from Friday ""Everybody fell in love with west Wales to be honest, we had a great time,"" she said. ""The Welsh people are an amazing talent, I'm really, really proud to be Welsh, we've just got so much to give. ""If you go up the club at the end of the road in the valleys, everybody's up on the stage with voices that could be in the West End. ""When I come to Wales my heart sings."" Rhod Gilbert also stars in the film Covid restrictions meant the crew had to take PCR tests every third day and they could have a maximum of 20 supporting artists, which made making the Lyric look full with 300 people a challenge. ""We had 20 [people] and a few dummies, it did have its challenges but we had a great team and we made it work."" She said she wanted to see more stories from Wales being told in cinema. ""We need to keep pushing forward and telling Welsh stories that people can connect to all over the world,"" she said. ""I made [the film] with hiraeth in my heart and I'm very privileged to be telling Liz's story. ""That woman is one in a million. I expect in Wales there's quite a few like that."" Carmarthenshire council said the film had boosted the local economy by about Â£750,000 and more economic benefit was expected in the coming months. Decades on from Liz Evans' fight the Lyric is still going strong Carmarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said hosting the production had been a delight. ""Attracting national and international productions such as this has a major impact on the growth of our economy and ensures that our communities reap the benefits,"" he said. The film will be shown on Sky Cinema and at various cinemas in Wales and the rest of the UK, including The Lyric, from 14 January. Mr Dole added: ""To screen it in the place where it was filmed is just the icing on the cake.""

Prince Andrew accuser welcomes legal case decision,"Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre) and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 The woman who has accused the Duke of York of sexually abusing her has welcomed a US judge's decision to allow her legal case to continue. Prince Andrew faces a civil case in the US after Virginia Giuffre sued him, claiming he abused her in 2001. He has consistently denied the claims. Ms Giuffre said she was ""pleased"" with the rulingthe case can continue, after the prince tried to have it dismissed. She said she is glad to have a ""chance to continue to expose the truth"". As part of her case, Ms Giuffre claims she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, alleging she was trafficked to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17. Who is Prince Andrew and what titles is he losing? Giuffre unlikely to just want money, says lawyer Maitlis: Prince's jaw-dropping TV interview now critical What's next for Prince Andrew? Writing on Twitter, Ms Giuffre thanked her ""extraordinary"" legal team and said: ""Their determination helps me seek justice from those who hurt me and so many others. ""My goal has always been to show that the rich and powerful are not above the law & must be held accountable. I do not walk this path alone, but alongside countless other survivors of sexual abuse & trafficking."" On Thursday it was revealed the prince's military titles and royal patronages had beenreturned to the Queenand he will stop using the style His Royal Highness in an official capacity, a royal source said. Like Harry and Meghan, Prince Andrew retains his title HRH but will not use it in any official capacity. A source close to the prince has said he will ""continue to defend himself"" against the case brought in New York by Ms Giuffre. The ruling on Wednesday that the civil action could proceed was ""not a judgement on the merits of Ms Giuffre's allegations"", the source added. This video can not be played Watch: Prince Charles is asked about his brother Andrew Buckingham Palace said in a statement: ""With the Queen's approval and agreement, the Duke of York's military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen. ""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen."" All Prince Andrew's roles have been returned with immediate effect, and will be redistributed to other members of the Royal Family, a source said. A letter - released by anti-monarchy pressure group Republic - had been signed by more than 150 Royal Navy, RAF and Army veterans asking the Queen to strip Prince Andrew of his eight British military titles. The prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, and served as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War. The palace announcement means he has lost military titles including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards - one of the most senior infantry regiments in the Army, alongside nine other British military titles and several overseas honorary roles. But he will retain his service rank of vice-admiral, the palace confirmed. This video can not be played Watch: Why Prince Andrew's military titles and royal patronages meant so much Several other charities and organisations had cut their ties with the prince, but he continued to hold dozens of royal patronages - including being a patron or member of prestigious golf clubs, schools and cultural trusts. There is no setdefinition of the role of a patronin charity law, according to the Charity Commission - which registers and regulates charities in England and Wales. However, the main role of a royal patron is generally considered to gather publicity for and raising the profile of charities or other organisations, with more than 3,000 listing a member of the Royal Family as their patron or president. On Friday, a senior Liberal Democrat councillor from City of York Council launched acampaign to strip the prince of his Duke of York title, a call which was echoed by a local Labour MP. Cllr Darryl Smalley said even though the prince ""remains innocent until proven guilty"", Buckingham Palace and the government ""must consider the implications of these troubling allegations"". MP for York Central Rachael Maskell agreed, tweeting: ""It's untenable for the Duke of York to cling onto his title another day longer; this association with York must end."" Ms Giuffre claims late billionaire financier Epstein trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17 On Thursday, Ms Giuffre's lawyer David Boies told the BBCa financial settlement alone would not be enoughfor his client and that she wishes to be vindicated. Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued her case should be dismissed, citing a 2009 deal she signed with Epstein. But in a 46-page decision, Judge Lewis A Kaplan dismissed the prince's claim that the case against him was ""legally insufficient"" and could not go on to be heard at a future trial. Ms Giuffre, now 38, filed a civil case in New York in August 2021 under the state's Child Victims Act, which allows survivors of childhood sexual abuse to pursue a case which otherwise would have been barred because too much time had passed. In court documents filed as part of her civil case, Ms Giuffre also alleges the prince abused her on three occasions - both in the UK and the US - when she was a minor under US law. In an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Prince Andrew said he had no memory of ever meeting Ms Giuffre, and her account of them having sex ""didn't happen"". He withdrew from public life shortly after the interview - which he used to repeat his denials of her allegations, as well explain his one-time friendship with Epstein, whodied in prison in 2019, and the late financier's girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. Last month, Maxwell was found guilty of recruiting and trafficking underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. What's next for Prince Andrew? Giuffre 'unlikely to just want money' Maitlis: Prince's jaw-dropping TV interview now critical What are the accusations against Andrew? What do charities get from having a royal patron?

Climate activists thank jury for clearing them,"Protesters climbed to the top of a train carriage at Shadwell station Two climate change activists who sat on the roof of a rush-hour train in east London have been cleared of obstructing a carriage on the railway. The Rev Sue Parfitt, 79, and Fr Martin Newell, 54, climbed on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) carriage at Shadwell station on 17 October 2019. A third activist, Philip Kingston, 85, superglued his hand to the train. Speaking outside Inner London Crown Court, Ms Parfitt said: ""It's wonderful that the jury saw the bigger picture"". Christians' train climate protest went too far Mike Schwarz, solicitor at the law firm Hodge Jones and Allen which represented the defendants, described the verdict as being part of an ""escalating pattern"". He said: ""There is mounting evidence from the courts and in particular from juries that the public is taking the climate crisis and the increasingly urgent need to focus on it far more seriously than government and business."" The verdict comes after four people were recentlycleared of criminal damageover toppling the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol and throwing it in the harbour. Fr Martin Newell, from Birmingham, and the Rev Sue Parfitt, from Bristol, praised the jury Speaking outside the court, Fr Newell was asked if he was planning to disrupt public transport again. He replied: ""I'm not sure that disrupting public transport is the right thing to do at this point, but in terms of would I risk going to prison? Absolutely."" Ms Parfitt, 79, said she felt the verdict showed that the protest had been ""the right thing to do"". She said: ""It's wonderful that the jury saw the bigger picture, that the court has vindicated our action and we hope it in some small way inspires others to feel that there may be sacrifices to be made, perhaps particularly by people of faith."" Last month,the Anglican priest admittedshe was ""surprised"" to avoid jail for blocking the M25. She was one of seven members of Insulate Britain who were handed suspended sentences for breaching an injunction and being in contempt of court. Two others were jailed. During this trial the jury had heard that the trio were strongly motivated by their Christian faith while Mr Kingston's grandchildren also influenced his participation. The ex-university lecturer, from South Gloucestershire, said he had been trying ""to put others first"" during the protest which disrupted services for 77 minutes and led to 15 trains being delayed or cancelled. Philip Kingston's stunt disrupted services for more than an hour The jury heard that some passengers told the environmentalists that the train they had targeted was an electric train - one of the greenest modes of transport - and should therefore not be the focus of the protest. The court heard the DLR service, which was travelling from Lewisham to Bank shortly before 07:00 BST, had been at about 70% capacity. In what they said was an attempt to appeal to the public and the government about the dangers of climate change and the financial institutions whose actions damage the planet, the defendants targeted a train one stop away from Bank, in the City of London's financial district. This was partly because, according to the activists, they had planned the demonstration to ensure there was no risk to public safety, by taking measures including targeting a station above ground and having 10 Extinction Rebellion activists on the platform to ensure violence did not break out. Fr Newell said: ""I'm very grateful to the jury to acting on their conscience and hearing the issues that we wanted to raise in the original action two and a half years ago. ""The climate emergency is the biggest issue facing the human race in our time and nothing is more important with dealing with that and despite the words that many governments have said about being more urgent, they're just not doing it."" Protester glued himself to train for grandchildren Priest says faith behind train-halt climate protest Christians' train climate protest went too far HM Courts Two convicted over stabbing of man in Hounslow Search for second Briton missing in the Dolomites called off for day Assembly member: 'I was under police investigation but I've been cleared' Patients at Kingâs College Hospital waiting four days for a bed as it reaches 96.4% bed capacity â the second highest in London Imperial War Museum celebrates 25 years since end of LGBT military ban 'Prolific' Harold Hill shoplifter BANNED from entering busy roads for two years Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

LiveLiveDjokovic to be detained in Australia but not yet deported30 minutes ago,"Australia has again revoked the visa of unvaccinated tennis star Novak Djokovic, this time on ""health and good order grounds"" The worldâs number one men's tennis player faces deportation and a three-year ban on obtaining a new visa He will be detained on Saturday morning at 08:00 local time (21:00 Friday GMT) But his lawyers are lodging appeals and at a late-night court hearing, Australia agrees not to deport him yet The tennis player's team say his visa was cancelled not on health grounds but because Djokovic might ""excite"" anti-vax sentiment Nine-time Australian Open winner Djokovic is scheduled to play in the tournament on Monday night The Serb had his visa first revoked on 6 January amid questions over a vaccine exemption he'd received Edited by Claudia Allen We're now pausing our coverage of Novak Djokovic's battle to stay in Australia and defend his Australian Open title. Thanks for following developments with us. Here's a
reminder of what's just happened. We've just heard that the next step in Djokovic's legal journey is a hearing, in front of Australia's Federal Court, at 10:15 Saturday morning local time (that's 23:15 Friday GMT). The judge in Friday's hearing ruled that the tennis star's case should be transferred to the federal court. At that hearing which concluded just a couple of hours ago it was agreed that Djokovic would be taken into immigration detention once more on Saturday morning at 08:00 local time. Here are the documents from Friday's hearing,external. Djokovic's side want the case to move as quickly as possible as they are hoping for a successful challenge to the visa cancellation before play starts in the Australian Open on Monday.

Some strong words just in from Serbia, where our correspondent in Belgrade, Guy De Launey, has been speaking to a senior official in the foreign ministry. Nemanja Starovic told the BBC that Serbia has the impression ""Djokovic was treated like a criminal - but he is not"". He says the government have been giving their ""full support"" to Djokovic and his legal team but the player was not given ""fair treatment"" ""We have seen other tennis players who didn't respect their mandatory isolation but they havenât received the same treatment as Novak,"" he says. He also says that there was an impression across the media that Djokovic was a ""spoilt brat"", but this was ""detached from reality"". Starovic says that the Serbian government is asking Australia not to  hold Djokovic in a detention centre again, saying ""he doesnât deserve that. Heâs not an illegal migrant"". ""Relations between our two countries have always been friendly and public opinion about Australia was always strong here in Serbia. ""Unfortunately he was treated like a criminal,  so this could potentially damaged the relations between two countries,"" Starovic says. Novak Djokovic has not been immediately sent back to the immigration detention hotel where he spent five nights when his visa was first revoked. But it may well be where he ends up after he is detained by immigration officials on Saturday morning. Refugees and asylum seekers have long complained of the poor conditions at the Park Hotel in Melbourne. Kurdish refugee Mostafa ""Moz"" Azimitabar, who spent more than a year in immigration hotels including two months at the Park Hotel, described his room there as a ""coffin"". He said he spent about 23 hours a day inside the room he shared with one other person, where the window was tinted and sealed shut. ""A hotel is a place for people who want to be comfortable and enjoy their time, but when they lock the place, that place becomes a prison, not a hotel,"" he said. Read more about the situation there. BBC Radio 5 Live Nicky Campbell has been askingRadio 5 Livelisteners if they think Australian leaders have made the right decision over Djokovic's visa. Jenny in Norwich hasn't been granted a visa to visit her 96-year-old mother, who lives just outside Melbourne, since the start of the pandemic. She believes Djokovic shouldn't be allowed into Australia for three years and says allowing sportspeople in is ""all about money and politics"". Karen in Glasgow disagrees and says revoking Djokovic's visa seems ""petty and revengeful"". She says as the tennis star has been allowed freedom of movement for the past week, there can't possibly be any further concerns about him endangering public health. Meanwhile Michael from Sydney was stuck in the UK last year, unable to return to his four children and job in Australia after flying to be with his 96-year-old mother during the first lockdown. He has since managed to get back home after paying for an Â£8,000 business class ticket. He says sports professionals have ""waltzed in on their private jets, [broken] the systems, lied on their forms and expected to be treated differently"". For now, Djokovic remains in the Australian Open draw ashis visa saga drags on. Earlier on Friday - before the decision from an Australian minister to cancel his visa once more - the world number one was photographed taking part in practice sessions at the Melbourne Park sports venue where the Grand Slam tournament will be played. Djokovic has already won the Australian Open nine times and he remains hopeful of defending his title next week. If - and it's a big if - he gets to compete, a win would make him the most successful male tennis player in history with a record 21 Grand Slam titles. The Serb, 34, is currently tied with Rafael Nadal (35) and Roger Federer (40) as all three have won 20 titles. Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Melbourne Park More now from Britain's former world number one Andy Murray - who's reiterated his belief that the Djokovic saga is ""not good for anyone"". Murray, 34, has known the Serb since they were children and, following the Scot's win at a pre-Open tournament in Sydney a short time ago, was asked for his take on the situation. ""I'm not going to sit here and start kicking Novak whilst he's down. I said it the other day, it's not a good situation for anyone. ""It's unfortunate that it's ended up in this sort of situation. I just want it to get resolved.  I think it would be good for everyone if that was the case. ""It just seems like it's dragged on for quite a long time now and not great for the tennis, not great for the Australian Open, not great for Novak. ""Obviously a lot of people have criticised the government here, as well.  It's not been good."" Read more tennis reaction to the Djokovic visa sagahere. Kayleen DevlinBBC Monitoring disinformation team A protest against vaccine mandates in Sydney, Australia Novak Djokovicâs lawyer
claims that the tennis champion's visa was cancelled because authorities were
worried that allowing him to play would ""excite"" Australiaâs anti-vax movement. And it is fair to say the case has certainly attracted the attention of the hard core
anti-vaccine minority. Today, in one of the most popular Australian anti-vax channels on the messaging app Telegram, the unvaccinated Djokovic is being held up as an international symbol against what activists call âvirus tyrannyâ. Other similar groups are repeating debunked claims linking the vaccine to heart problems in athletes. And earlier in the week there were calls by anti-vaxxers to boycott the Australian Open, and multiple posts across social media declaring support for the tennis star - who, it should be said, has never publicly expressed support for the most outlandish anti-vax conspiracy theories. These are of course small groups. More than 92% of Australia's over-16s are already vaccinated against Covid. However, these small groups are vocal - and at times their online discussions spill out into the streets in protests and other actions. It's getting very late in Melbourne and we aren't expecting any major developments until Djokovic is detained on Saturday morning. But if you remember the expletive-laden
video of two Australian newsreaders privately talking about the Djokovic saga which was leaked earlier this week, we have an update on that. The staffer who allegedly leaked the clip has been fired, according to their former employer. The
video, which went viral,shows Channel 7 journalists Mike Amor and Rebecca Maddern talking candidlyabout the tennis star as they prepare to read the
evening news. Maddern
says Djokovic is ""lying"" and ""sneaky"", while Amor says the
athlete has ""fallen over his own [expletive] lies"". The
newsreaders were reacting to an earlier twist in the saga, when Djokovic successfully challenged his first visa cancellation. That feels like a long time ago, but was earlier this week. Ai-Media Technologies, which provides captioning services, said an ""employee working remotely"" was ""responsible for the unauthorised distribution of the content"". The late-night hearing has now concluded. Here's what was decided: One of the key developments from the hearing was that lawyers for Novak Djokovic gave their understanding of
why the Australian government cancelled the tennis player's visa. They said that Immigration Minister Alex Hawke believed letting
Djokovic stay in the country would excite anti-vaccination sentiment. The
lawyers argued that this was ""patently irrational"". It's the first time we've heard this as a reason for the
cancellation, but it should be said that it has been made public by Djokovic's lawyers, not by
the government. The earlier statement from the immigration minister was less specific, saying only that the decision was made on ""health and good order grounds"". Although Djokovic is not vaccinated, he has not actively promoted anti-vax disinformation. However, Australian anti-vaxxers have been using the hashtag #IStandWithDjokovic on social media. Australia's vaccination campaign started slowly, and was hampered by fears of very rare side effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine, which made up the bulk of Australia's vaccine supply early in the campaign. However, more than 90% of Australia's eligible population is now fully vaccinated. That was quicker than expected - that's all from the court. Lawyers representing the two sides agreed Djokovic could be taken into custody at an unknown location to avoid the ""media circus"" that his lawyers are concerned about. The hearing is now over and the judge says he will publish his reasons on Saturday morning. Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Melbourne Park The Australian Open has just announced the top half of the men's singles draw - which includes Djokovic - will be played on Monday. It means if the Serb is again able to overturn the decision to cancel his visa on Sunday he will start his title defence the following day. And we are back under way again... Stick with us - we are waiting for the court hearing on the next steps to resume. In the meantime here's how Australian TV networks covered today's news that the immigration minister was cancelling Novak Djokovic's visa: This video can not be played How Australian broadcasters reported latest Djokovic decision Just before the judge called an adjournment, lawyers for the tennis player said they had real concerns about a ""media circus"" taking place when Djokovic is taken back into detention. They also said they had security concerns if the location of Djokovic's detention becomes publicly known. Judge Kelly replied by saying ""on mature reflection the obviousness of that circus might have occurred to everyone before 10.55pm on Friday"". He then paused proceedings.  Judge Kelly orders another five minute adjournment after he finds that the two sides are not in agreement. It's very late at night in Melbourne - nearly 2300 - and the judge's patience is being tried, it seems. The judge says that Djokovic should attend the interview with immigration officials at 08:00 on Saturday local time (21:00 on Friday GMT). He should then be able to take part in meetings at his solicitors' office on Saturday from 10:00 - 14:00, and again on Sunday morning for the court hearing. This attendance should be supervised by Australian Border Force officers. This means that Djokovic will be taken into immigration detention on Saturday morning. Judge Kelly also orders that the proceedings should be transferred to the Federal Court of Australia. The court hearing to decide on the next steps is back under way after a short adjournment. It's being live-streamed on YouTube, although court rules forbid us from bringing you the pictures live. About 20,000 people are currently watching the stream, which unfortunately for those of us following it closely is slightly intermittent. We'll be bringing you all the latest developments from the late-night hearing.  Here's a quick look at how events unfolded: 1 January- Novak Djokovic submits travel declaration to Australian Government department of Home Affairs. He receives a government response saying his declaration had been assessed and he met requirements for quarantine-free travel into Australia 2 January- Issued a border travel permit from the Victoria state government 5 January- Djokovic arrives at Melbourne Airport at 2300 local time on a  flight from Spain via Dubai 6 January- He gets notice of his visa cancellation at 4:30 local time. An hour and a half later at 6:00 local time, he faces a visa interview. Then at 7:42 local time, his visa is cancelled and he is taken into detention 6-10 January- Djokovic is held in immigration detention at the Park Hotel in Melbourne 10 January- The player mounts a legal challenge to overturn his visa cancellation in the Federal Circuit Court. He wins the case after the government withdraws and the court orders his release at 17:42 local time 14 January- Immigration Minister Alex Hawke revokes visa Â© 2025 BBC.

UK economy above pre-Covid levels in November,"The UK economy surpassed pre-Covid levels for the first time in November after recording stronger-than-expected growth. The Office for National Statistics saidgross domestic product(GDP) expanded by 0.9% between October and November. That was higher than economists' expectations and meant the economy was 0.7% larger than in February 2020. But there is concern growth slowed again after the spread of Omicron and the introduction of Plan B measures. ""The economy grew strongly in the month before Omicron struck, with architects, retailers, couriers and accountants having a bumper month,"" said ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner. ""Construction also recovered from several weak months as many raw materials became easier to get hold of."" Analysts at Capital Economics said the economy was boosted by 3.5% growth in the construction sector, adding ""the unusually dry weather probably helped"". It also said manufacturing output also improved and the professional sector also picked up, ""apparently due to architectural and engineering activities being brought forward from December"". GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. GDP allows businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and for government to work out how much to tax and spend. Rising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises. If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. The Covid pandemic caused the most severe recession seen in over 300 years, hurting business and employment, and forcing government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy. Read more about GDP here Economists had been expecting GDP to expand by 0.4% in November. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the stronger growth was ""a testament to the grit and determination of the British people"". But Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""GDP almost certainly dropped in December, as households hunkered down in response to the Omicron variant."" The Omicron variant emerged at the end of November and Plan B measures were introduced on 8 December. Mr Tombs said data such as restaurant diner numbers, transport usage and cinema revenues ""point to a pullback in consumer services expenditure"" last month, while ""Omicron also depressed labour supply"". However, he added: ""Omicron looks set to fade almost as quickly as it arrived, thanks partly to the rapid rollout of booster jabs. As a result, we expect the government to allow Plan B rules to automatically expire on 26 January and for GDP to bounce back in February."" These figures show that the reopening and recovery of the UK economy was motoring just before Omicron struck. The economy had for the first time regained, on a monthly basis, all the very heavy losses during the pandemic lockdowns. Business had been returning to something approaching normality after the government's decision to axe restrictions since the summer. Monthly figures are quite volatile though and usually not provided by other countries. It is possible that the Omicron-linked hit to the economy in December could undo the impressive growth in November on the key fourth quarter figure. Using this more usual and internationally comparable quarterly basis, it is still not certain if the UK economy has recovered these losses. The bigger question is about the impact of Omicron. With hopes that the rapidly-spreading variant has peaked, economists are now confident it will have far less of a hit than previous Covid waves. Retailers' results over the festive period have been very encouraging. But the response of the public and its attitude to going out and spending is the big economic unknown. And while Omicron concern fades, the hits to disposable income from rising prices are very real. So while the chancellor called today's GDP milestone ""amazing"" it's probably not the moment for celebration. The ONS said that, on a quarterly basis, in the final three months of 2021 the UK economy will reach or surpass pre-Covid levels seen in the last quarter of 2019 if GDP grows by at least 0.2% in December and there are no downward revisions to figures for October and November. However, several economists pointed to a bumpy road for growth in the first months of this year. ""We expect growth to slow in 2022 as it will no longer be able to simply rely on the [Covid] rebound effect to propel it,"" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. ""In addition, rising taxes and borrowing costs, as well as elevated inflation, will squeeze households' purchasing power, while the lingering effects of supply chain bottlenecks together with a persistent shortage of labour could constrain production this year."" Inflation is expected to hit 6% by spring, according to the Bank of England which raised its key interest rate in December and is forecast to lift borrowing costs again this year. The government willraise the National Living Wage by 6.6%for over 23 year-olds in April but that is the same month when energy regulator Ofgem will implement the new price cap on household gas and electricity bills. Ofgem is widely expected to lift the price cap following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices last year which forced around 20 smaller energy companies out of business. Also from April, employers, workers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance.

E.On apologises for sending socks to customersIt is the second energy supplier in a week to admit a marketing gaffe as customers face rocketing bills.,"E.On says its socks ""should have been stopped"" Energy supplier E.On has said it is ""incredibly sorry"" for sending socks to customers in a bid to encourage them to turn the heating down. It is the second major supplier to admit to a marketing gaffe when customers are facing a cost of living squeeze driven by energy prices. Earlier in the week, Ovo's founder said he was ""really embarrassed"" about energy saving advice including ""doing a few star jumps"" and cuddling pets. Energy bills are set to soar in April. A new price cap looks set to add about Â£600 to the annual gas and electricity bill of a household with typical energy usage. Energy boss blames bad day for âridiculousâ advice E.On compensates customers after Christmas blunder The socks were sent out by E.On Next - an arm of the energy giant which sells and promotes renewable electricity. The footwear came with a message encouraging people to leave ""lighter footprints"" by turning heating down and lowering carbon emissions. However, some customers reacted with anger and perplexity - especially when they were sent to elderly relatives. Now, the company has apologised. Writing on Twitter, it said: ""If you recently received a pair of socks from us, we would like to say we are incredibly sorry for how we have made some people feel. ""In light of the seriousness of current challenges that many people are facing, this mailing should have been stopped and we are sorry."" As first reported in the Daily Mail,external, the company said it sent the socks to 30,000 customers who responded to an energy saving campaign last year. In a subsequent statement, a spokesman for the company said: ""This activity was in no way designed to detract from the seriousness of the current energy crisis ""This campaign originally went ahead last year and was intended as a fun way to encourage people to think about 'lightening your carbon footprint' and isn't meant to be anything to do with the current challenges many people are facing."" He said E.On had invested billions of pounds into better insulation, efficient heating, and advice to customers. E.On is the UK's second biggest energy supplier, after British Gas. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the founder of the third-largest, Ovo, said earlier in the week that ""someone had a bad day"" when a link was sent to customers directing them to a blog encouraging them to save energy by hugging pets. The latest gaffe comes on the day an alliance of charities called on the government for urgent action to tackle the energy bill crisis. The 25 charities, including Save the Children, Age UK, End Fuel Poverty Coalition, WWF, Green Alliance and Greenpeace, said emergency funding was needed to support the most vulnerable.

Wales Covid rules relaxed as cases drop 'rapidly',"This video can not be played Covid: How will Wales' restrictions change in the coming weeks? Most restrictions in Wales will be scrapped over the next two weeks if Covid cases continue to fall, the first minister has confirmed. Measures, brought in to tackle the Omicron variant, will be liftedas Wales moves to alert level zero. Opposition parties had called for an exit plan, with Conservative Andrew RT Daviessaying ""Labour got it wrong"",external. Mark Drakeford said Omicron cases had fallen ""rapidly"" and the rules could now be relaxed ""gradually"". What are the rules in Wales now? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Self isolation period in Wales cut by three days The Welsh government also pointed to the success of the booster campaign in enabling it to lift restrictions, with 1.8 million people having received an extra vaccine dose. There will be a four stage process to lifting the current alert level two restrictions in Wales, depending on cases remaining low: Saturday: Numbers allowed to attend an outdoor event will rise from 50 to 500 Friday 21 January: Crowds allowed to return to sporting events, paving the way for rugby Six Nations full houses in Cardiff, and no limits on those attending outdoor events Friday 28 January: Nightclubs can reopen and hospitality allowed to operate normally, although Covid passes will still be required for large events, plus cinemas, nightclubs and theatres. Working from home no longer a legal requirement Thursday 10 February: Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero ""The actions we have taken together have helped us to weather the Omicron storm. The latest data suggests some positive signs that the peak may have passed,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""We can now look more confidently to the future and plan to start gradually removing the alert level two restrictions, starting with the outdoors measures. ""But the pandemic is not over. We will closely monitor the public health situation - this is a fast-moving and volatile variant, which could change suddenly. I urge everyone to continue to follow the rules and have your vaccines to keep Wales safe."" Wales,along with Scotland and Northern Irelandall brought in new Covid restrictions over Christmas because of a rapid rise in cases driven by the Omicron variant. England was the only UK nation thatdid not announce further rules. In Wales, it meant that from 26 December, sports fixtures were forced behind closed doors without spectators, andvolunteer Parkrun events were cancelled. Nightclubs were closed, and events were limited to a maximum of 50 people outdoors and 30 people indoors. Pubs and restaurants were also restricted to table service, with the rule of six in place, while workplaces and shops were required to impose social distancing measures. Both the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru had called for a roadmap out of restrictions, while the Welsh Rugby Union had been considering moving home fixtures for the Six Nations out of Wales. Speaking onBBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford denied the move to relax restrictions was a ""U-turn"", adding: ""Not at all. It's really the opposite of that. ""What we do in Wales is we follow the science, we follow the data. We make difficult decisions when that is necessary."" He added: ""What we are seeing is a very rapid decline of the number of cases in Wales. Last Friday in Wales it was 2,300 cases per 100,000 of the Welsh population, today, only a week later, it is only 1,200."" Mark Drakeford has rejected any suggestions of a U-turn in his approach to these restrictions - he insists the scientific advice he received suggested four weeks of tougher restrictions and he says today's announcement is in line with that time period. He also points out that the Covid numbers have dropped rapidly in the last week. The report from the Welsh government's Technical Advisory Cell before Christmas did talk about four weeks of restrictions, and numbers have plummeted, but it's also the case that we've seen an abrupt change in approach from Welsh ministers over the last couple of days. On Tuesday in the Senedd, in response to Welsh Tory demands for a plan out of alert level two, the first minister quoted modelling saying that ""the peak of the Omicron coronavirus wave has yet to be reached in Wales"", he talked about the number of people suffering from Omicron ""going up not coming down"" and he raised only a heavily caveated possibility of beginning to lift restrictions at the end of next week. At this time, the stats were showing a drop in cases, though Mr Drakeford said the change in the rules over testing meant it was difficult to know whether these were ""genuine falls"" or simply a result of fewer people getting PCR tests. By Thursday, the health minister was striking a much more optimistic note talking about ""very positive signs"" that Wales was ""possibly turning the corner"" on this wave and restrictions will now begin to be lifted this weekend. Today, the cautious tone remains, as you'd expect, but the dogmatism of last Friday's review - where those calling for an easing of restrictions were  described as ""fundamentally wrong"" - has been abandoned as has the pessimism of Tuesday's position. Wales' case rate has fallen to its lowest level since 26 December - 1,274.2 per 100,000 people over seven days. This decline is sooner - and deeper - than a modelled scenario presented only a week ago. Hospital numbers have fallen for two days in a row, although there are still on average a third more patients with confirmed Covid than the week before. It has also emerged that more than half of these patients were in hospital being treated for another primary condition. Numbers of Covid patients in critical care remain stable though and at 21% below the peak seen a year ago. The move to relax restrictions on pubs and restaurants has been welcomed, but there have been warnings that some businesses will struggle to recover after losing trade over the festive period. ""Every day of trading counts because everyone wants to trade their way to recover,"" said chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association Emma McClarkin. She saidon average pubs have lost about Â£16,000 during current restrictionsthat ""they won't recover"". Ms McClarkin said a lot of damage has been done in the period of closure over Christmas The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU)said it was ""delighted"" fans would be allowed for Wales' three Six Nations home gamesin February and March. Parkrun boss, Tom Williams, said he did not think his business should have been impacted in the last round of restrictions. He said: ""We have known since the beginning of the pandemic that physical activity and health are incredibly important when dealing with the Covid infection, and we have known for a while that outdoor environments are incredibly safe."" Meanwhile,Chester FC also fell foul of the restrictions on crowds at sports fixtures, with the four stands of the English club's Deva Stadium actually in Flintshire. Its Vice Chairman Jim Green said he was pleased the club's fans would be able to go to the next home game, but believed this should always have been the case. ""We're still determined to find a long-term solution,"" he said. Parkrun's Tom Williams did not think his business should have been affected in the last round of restrictions Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""I'm pleased they've finally listened to calls from the Welsh Conservatives. ""Despite the detailed scientific evidence from South Africa, Labour ministers clearly overreacted to Omicron, and that has caused significant pain and anguish for families and businesses in Wales. The move comes despite Mr Drakeford saying last Tuesday that Wales was ""in the teeth of the Omicron storm"". Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""If, as it seems, we are indeed at the peak, the right thing to do is see how we can safely respond. ""Raising the limit on outdoor sporting events would be an obvious place to start, moving as swiftly as the continuing improved picture allows in coming days, to lifting other restrictions such as those in hospitality."" Wales has now reached 81% of those eligible for boosters in the Covid vaccination programme, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales. A total of 1,817,842 boosters were given out by 13 January.

Australia agrees to delay deporting Djokovic,"Australia has again revoked the visa of unvaccinated tennis star Novak Djokovic, this time on ""health and good order grounds"" The worldâs number one men's tennis player faces deportation and a three-year ban on obtaining a new visa He will be detained on Saturday morning at 08:00 local time (21:00 Friday GMT) But his lawyers are lodging appeals and at a late-night court hearing, Australia agrees not to deport him yet The tennis player's team say his visa was cancelled not on health grounds but because Djokovic might ""excite"" anti-vax sentiment Nine-time Australian Open winner Djokovic is scheduled to play in the tournament on Monday night The Serb had his visa first revoked on 6 January amid questions over a vaccine exemption he'd received Edited by Claudia Allen We're now pausing our coverage of Novak Djokovic's battle to stay in Australia and defend his Australian Open title. Thanks for following developments with us. Here's a
reminder of what's just happened. We've just heard that the next step in Djokovic's legal journey is a hearing, in front of Australia's Federal Court, at 10:15 Saturday morning local time (that's 23:15 Friday GMT). The judge in Friday's hearing ruled that the tennis star's case should be transferred to the federal court. At that hearing which concluded just a couple of hours ago it was agreed that Djokovic would be taken into immigration detention once more on Saturday morning at 08:00 local time. Here are the documents from Friday's hearing,external. Djokovic's side want the case to move as quickly as possible as they are hoping for a successful challenge to the visa cancellation before play starts in the Australian Open on Monday.

Some strong words just in from Serbia, where our correspondent in Belgrade, Guy De Launey, has been speaking to a senior official in the foreign ministry. Nemanja Starovic told the BBC that Serbia has the impression ""Djokovic was treated like a criminal - but he is not"". He says the government have been giving their ""full support"" to Djokovic and his legal team but the player was not given ""fair treatment"" ""We have seen other tennis players who didn't respect their mandatory isolation but they havenât received the same treatment as Novak,"" he says. He also says that there was an impression across the media that Djokovic was a ""spoilt brat"", but this was ""detached from reality"". Starovic says that the Serbian government is asking Australia not to  hold Djokovic in a detention centre again, saying ""he doesnât deserve that. Heâs not an illegal migrant"". ""Relations between our two countries have always been friendly and public opinion about Australia was always strong here in Serbia. ""Unfortunately he was treated like a criminal,  so this could potentially damaged the relations between two countries,"" Starovic says. Novak Djokovic has not been immediately sent back to the immigration detention hotel where he spent five nights when his visa was first revoked. But it may well be where he ends up after he is detained by immigration officials on Saturday morning. Refugees and asylum seekers have long complained of the poor conditions at the Park Hotel in Melbourne. Kurdish refugee Mostafa ""Moz"" Azimitabar, who spent more than a year in immigration hotels including two months at the Park Hotel, described his room there as a ""coffin"". He said he spent about 23 hours a day inside the room he shared with one other person, where the window was tinted and sealed shut. ""A hotel is a place for people who want to be comfortable and enjoy their time, but when they lock the place, that place becomes a prison, not a hotel,"" he said. Read more about the situation there. BBC Radio 5 Live Nicky Campbell has been askingRadio 5 Livelisteners if they think Australian leaders have made the right decision over Djokovic's visa. Jenny in Norwich hasn't been granted a visa to visit her 96-year-old mother, who lives just outside Melbourne, since the start of the pandemic. She believes Djokovic shouldn't be allowed into Australia for three years and says allowing sportspeople in is ""all about money and politics"". Karen in Glasgow disagrees and says revoking Djokovic's visa seems ""petty and revengeful"". She says as the tennis star has been allowed freedom of movement for the past week, there can't possibly be any further concerns about him endangering public health. Meanwhile Michael from Sydney was stuck in the UK last year, unable to return to his four children and job in Australia after flying to be with his 96-year-old mother during the first lockdown. He has since managed to get back home after paying for an Â£8,000 business class ticket. He says sports professionals have ""waltzed in on their private jets, [broken] the systems, lied on their forms and expected to be treated differently"". For now, Djokovic remains in the Australian Open draw ashis visa saga drags on. Earlier on Friday - before the decision from an Australian minister to cancel his visa once more - the world number one was photographed taking part in practice sessions at the Melbourne Park sports venue where the Grand Slam tournament will be played. Djokovic has already won the Australian Open nine times and he remains hopeful of defending his title next week. If - and it's a big if - he gets to compete, a win would make him the most successful male tennis player in history with a record 21 Grand Slam titles. The Serb, 34, is currently tied with Rafael Nadal (35) and Roger Federer (40) as all three have won 20 titles. Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Melbourne Park More now from Britain's former world number one Andy Murray - who's reiterated his belief that the Djokovic saga is ""not good for anyone"". Murray, 34, has known the Serb since they were children and, following the Scot's win at a pre-Open tournament in Sydney a short time ago, was asked for his take on the situation. ""I'm not going to sit here and start kicking Novak whilst he's down. I said it the other day, it's not a good situation for anyone. ""It's unfortunate that it's ended up in this sort of situation. I just want it to get resolved.  I think it would be good for everyone if that was the case. ""It just seems like it's dragged on for quite a long time now and not great for the tennis, not great for the Australian Open, not great for Novak. ""Obviously a lot of people have criticised the government here, as well.  It's not been good."" Read more tennis reaction to the Djokovic visa sagahere. Kayleen DevlinBBC Monitoring disinformation team A protest against vaccine mandates in Sydney, Australia Novak Djokovicâs lawyer
claims that the tennis champion's visa was cancelled because authorities were
worried that allowing him to play would ""excite"" Australiaâs anti-vax movement. And it is fair to say the case has certainly attracted the attention of the hard core
anti-vaccine minority. Today, in one of the most popular Australian anti-vax channels on the messaging app Telegram, the unvaccinated Djokovic is being held up as an international symbol against what activists call âvirus tyrannyâ. Other similar groups are repeating debunked claims linking the vaccine to heart problems in athletes. And earlier in the week there were calls by anti-vaxxers to boycott the Australian Open, and multiple posts across social media declaring support for the tennis star - who, it should be said, has never publicly expressed support for the most outlandish anti-vax conspiracy theories. These are of course small groups. More than 92% of Australia's over-16s are already vaccinated against Covid. However, these small groups are vocal - and at times their online discussions spill out into the streets in protests and other actions. It's getting very late in Melbourne and we aren't expecting any major developments until Djokovic is detained on Saturday morning. But if you remember the expletive-laden
video of two Australian newsreaders privately talking about the Djokovic saga which was leaked earlier this week, we have an update on that. The staffer who allegedly leaked the clip has been fired, according to their former employer. The
video, which went viral,shows Channel 7 journalists Mike Amor and Rebecca Maddern talking candidlyabout the tennis star as they prepare to read the
evening news. Maddern
says Djokovic is ""lying"" and ""sneaky"", while Amor says the
athlete has ""fallen over his own [expletive] lies"". The
newsreaders were reacting to an earlier twist in the saga, when Djokovic successfully challenged his first visa cancellation. That feels like a long time ago, but was earlier this week. Ai-Media Technologies, which provides captioning services, said an ""employee working remotely"" was ""responsible for the unauthorised distribution of the content"". The late-night hearing has now concluded. Here's what was decided: One of the key developments from the hearing was that lawyers for Novak Djokovic gave their understanding of
why the Australian government cancelled the tennis player's visa. They said that Immigration Minister Alex Hawke believed letting
Djokovic stay in the country would excite anti-vaccination sentiment. The
lawyers argued that this was ""patently irrational"". It's the first time we've heard this as a reason for the
cancellation, but it should be said that it has been made public by Djokovic's lawyers, not by
the government. The earlier statement from the immigration minister was less specific, saying only that the decision was made on ""health and good order grounds"". Although Djokovic is not vaccinated, he has not actively promoted anti-vax disinformation. However, Australian anti-vaxxers have been using the hashtag #IStandWithDjokovic on social media. Australia's vaccination campaign started slowly, and was hampered by fears of very rare side effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine, which made up the bulk of Australia's vaccine supply early in the campaign. However, more than 90% of Australia's eligible population is now fully vaccinated. That was quicker than expected - that's all from the court. Lawyers representing the two sides agreed Djokovic could be taken into custody at an unknown location to avoid the ""media circus"" that his lawyers are concerned about. The hearing is now over and the judge says he will publish his reasons on Saturday morning. Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Melbourne Park The Australian Open has just announced the top half of the men's singles draw - which includes Djokovic - will be played on Monday. It means if the Serb is again able to overturn the decision to cancel his visa on Sunday he will start his title defence the following day. And we are back under way again... Stick with us - we are waiting for the court hearing on the next steps to resume. In the meantime here's how Australian TV networks covered today's news that the immigration minister was cancelling Novak Djokovic's visa: This video can not be played How Australian broadcasters reported latest Djokovic decision Just before the judge called an adjournment, lawyers for the tennis player said they had real concerns about a ""media circus"" taking place when Djokovic is taken back into detention. They also said they had security concerns if the location of Djokovic's detention becomes publicly known. Judge Kelly replied by saying ""on mature reflection the obviousness of that circus might have occurred to everyone before 10.55pm on Friday"". He then paused proceedings.  Judge Kelly orders another five minute adjournment after he finds that the two sides are not in agreement. It's very late at night in Melbourne - nearly 2300 - and the judge's patience is being tried, it seems. The judge says that Djokovic should attend the interview with immigration officials at 08:00 on Saturday local time (21:00 on Friday GMT). He should then be able to take part in meetings at his solicitors' office on Saturday from 10:00 - 14:00, and again on Sunday morning for the court hearing. This attendance should be supervised by Australian Border Force officers. This means that Djokovic will be taken into immigration detention on Saturday morning. Judge Kelly also orders that the proceedings should be transferred to the Federal Court of Australia. The court hearing to decide on the next steps is back under way after a short adjournment. It's being live-streamed on YouTube, although court rules forbid us from bringing you the pictures live. About 20,000 people are currently watching the stream, which unfortunately for those of us following it closely is slightly intermittent. We'll be bringing you all the latest developments from the late-night hearing.  Here's a quick look at how events unfolded: 1 January- Novak Djokovic submits travel declaration to Australian Government department of Home Affairs. He receives a government response saying his declaration had been assessed and he met requirements for quarantine-free travel into Australia 2 January- Issued a border travel permit from the Victoria state government 5 January- Djokovic arrives at Melbourne Airport at 2300 local time on a  flight from Spain via Dubai 6 January- He gets notice of his visa cancellation at 4:30 local time. An hour and a half later at 6:00 local time, he faces a visa interview. Then at 7:42 local time, his visa is cancelled and he is taken into detention 6-10 January- Djokovic is held in immigration detention at the Park Hotel in Melbourne 10 January- The player mounts a legal challenge to overturn his visa cancellation in the Federal Circuit Court. He wins the case after the government withdraws and the court orders his release at 17:42 local time 14 January- Immigration Minister Alex Hawke revokes visa Â© 2025 BBC.

Djokovic to be detained but not yet deported,"Australia has again revoked the visa of unvaccinated tennis star Novak Djokovic, this time on ""health and good order grounds"" The worldâs number one men's tennis player faces deportation and a three-year ban on obtaining a new visa He will be detained on Saturday morning at 08:00 local time (21:00 Friday GMT) But his lawyers are lodging appeals and at a late-night court hearing, Australia agrees not to deport him yet The tennis player's team say his visa was cancelled not on health grounds but because Djokovic might ""excite"" anti-vax sentiment Nine-time Australian Open winner Djokovic is scheduled to play in the tournament on Monday night The Serb had his visa first revoked on 6 January amid questions over a vaccine exemption he'd received Edited by Claudia Allen We're now pausing our coverage of Novak Djokovic's battle to stay in Australia and defend his Australian Open title. Thanks for following developments with us. Here's a
reminder of what's just happened. We've just heard that the next step in Djokovic's legal journey is a hearing, in front of Australia's Federal Court, at 10:15 Saturday morning local time (that's 23:15 Friday GMT). The judge in Friday's hearing ruled that the tennis star's case should be transferred to the federal court. At that hearing which concluded just a couple of hours ago it was agreed that Djokovic would be taken into immigration detention once more on Saturday morning at 08:00 local time. Here are the documents from Friday's hearing,external. Djokovic's side want the case to move as quickly as possible as they are hoping for a successful challenge to the visa cancellation before play starts in the Australian Open on Monday.

Some strong words just in from Serbia, where our correspondent in Belgrade, Guy De Launey, has been speaking to a senior official in the foreign ministry. Nemanja Starovic told the BBC that Serbia has the impression ""Djokovic was treated like a criminal - but he is not"". He says the government have been giving their ""full support"" to Djokovic and his legal team but the player was not given ""fair treatment"" ""We have seen other tennis players who didn't respect their mandatory isolation but they havenât received the same treatment as Novak,"" he says. He also says that there was an impression across the media that Djokovic was a ""spoilt brat"", but this was ""detached from reality"". Starovic says that the Serbian government is asking Australia not to  hold Djokovic in a detention centre again, saying ""he doesnât deserve that. Heâs not an illegal migrant"". ""Relations between our two countries have always been friendly and public opinion about Australia was always strong here in Serbia. ""Unfortunately he was treated like a criminal,  so this could potentially damaged the relations between two countries,"" Starovic says. Novak Djokovic has not been immediately sent back to the immigration detention hotel where he spent five nights when his visa was first revoked. But it may well be where he ends up after he is detained by immigration officials on Saturday morning. Refugees and asylum seekers have long complained of the poor conditions at the Park Hotel in Melbourne. Kurdish refugee Mostafa ""Moz"" Azimitabar, who spent more than a year in immigration hotels including two months at the Park Hotel, described his room there as a ""coffin"". He said he spent about 23 hours a day inside the room he shared with one other person, where the window was tinted and sealed shut. ""A hotel is a place for people who want to be comfortable and enjoy their time, but when they lock the place, that place becomes a prison, not a hotel,"" he said. Read more about the situation there. BBC Radio 5 Live Nicky Campbell has been askingRadio 5 Livelisteners if they think Australian leaders have made the right decision over Djokovic's visa. Jenny in Norwich hasn't been granted a visa to visit her 96-year-old mother, who lives just outside Melbourne, since the start of the pandemic. She believes Djokovic shouldn't be allowed into Australia for three years and says allowing sportspeople in is ""all about money and politics"".

Google backs office work with Â£730m investment,"Google is purchasing the Central Saint Giles site Google is backing a return to the office with an investment that will expand its UK capacity by 50% and ""reinvigorate"" the work environment. The search giant is spending Â£730m ($1bn) and expects headcount to rise from 6,400 to 10,000. It is buying one of the London sites, Central Saint Giles, in which it is currently a tenant. Google's UK boss Ronan Harris told the BBC the investment reflected the firm's faith in the office as a place of work. ""We want to reinvigorate the work environment. We're making this commitment to rebuild. We're buying these buildings and we're keen to see everybody come back in and see a vibrant workspace again,"" Mr Harris said. As well as purchasing the Central Saint Giles site, Google said it would be undertaking a multi-million pound refurbishment of its offices there to ensure they were on a par with those in its new King's Cross development currently under construction. That will provide more space so offices can be less densely populated, and will include collaboration spaces and ""inclusive meeting rooms for hybrid working"" as well as covered outdoor workspaces, the firm said. Google is trialling hybrid meeting spaces in its US offices Current government guidance remains to work from home where possible, but that - along with other government restrictions - will be reviewed on 26 January. Eventually, Google wants the vast majority of its workforce to return to the office for three days a week. But employers are feeling their way as the country emerges from two years of pandemic-enforced changes, during which many people adapted to completely different ways of working. ""I think the next two [years] will be an experiment where we try and figure out what hybrid and flexible actually mean,"" said Mr Harris. ""And I think it will differ from company to company and from role to role. I think it'll be a lot of trial and error over the next two years."" Outdoor workspaces are also being piloted in the US Chancellor Rishi Sunak welcomed Google's investment, describing it as ""a big vote of confidence in the UK as a world-leading tech hub"". The employers group the CBI said a return to the workplace was vital for economic recovery, particularly for the UK's town and city centres.

Retail and hospitality businesses especially are eager for office staff to return to old habits, picking up coffees, sandwiches and shopping during the day and going out after work in the evening. However, many employees don't want to return full time to the office and the number of days that employers require their staff to attend in person is emerging as a key point of difference in the recruitment process. Neil Carberry from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation told the BBC: ""Pay used to be the main lever employers could use in negotiations.

"Cricket must tackle racism or lose funding, says report","This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire The government should limit public funding for cricket unless there is ""continuous, demonstrable progress"" on eradicating ""deep-seated racism"", a parliamentary report has recommended. Azeem Rafiq gave emotional testimony last year to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee aboutracism he experiencedat Yorkshire. The committee's report was published on Friday, with chair Julian Knight MP describing Rafiq's story as ""typical of an endemic problem across the whole of cricket"". Yorkshire have been widely criticised for their handling of Rafiq's allegations. Former chairman Roger Hutton and chief executive Mark Arthur have resigned and 16 members of staff have been sacked. The committee said changes made by Lord Patel, who replaced Hutton in November, were a positive step but they alone ""could not eradicate racism"". ""This is a watershed for cricket,"" Knight said. ""Those who love and support the game are part of the solution and must play their part."" This video can not be played Racism in cricket: Azeem Rafiq 'encouraged' by parliamentary report Rafiq welcomed the report, adding that it also made clear the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) responsibilities in tackling racism in the sport. He said: ""The committee has listened and taken sensible action. It is absolutely brilliant that Julian Knight and his colleagues on the committee are going to hold the ECB to account. ""This shows just how seriously politicians are taking an issue that too many people in cricket ignored for so long. The committee understands how important it is to clean up the game. ""I'm glad that MPs will monitor any progress, so that the reforms needed to make the sport inclusive to all youngsters can happen soon."" Yorkshire face 'financial crisis' if international ban remains Listen to Around the Wicket - Yorkshire's Asian Cricket Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here TMS podcast: ECB chief Harrison reacts to DCMS report Responding to the report on Friday, ECB chief executiveTom Harrison saidhe welcomed the ""scrutiny""- and that he was ""very confident"" cricket would be able to ""demonstrate massive progress in this space"". Harrison agreed that a link between showing change and government funding was ""right and proper"". ""I'm very confident that in the not-so-distant future we can become an exemplar of the kind of behaviours that promote social integration and understanding,"" Harrison told BBC Sport. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Rafiq said Yorkshire should not be given Test cricket back ""indefinitely"" and should be ""kept under review for a good four or five years at least"". He said: ""There's two times the game's acted [on racism]. One is when their pockets have been hit or they've been embarrassed. So it's really important that we keep an eye on what's happening."" Rafiq described the start of his campaign for change as ""just a broken man speaking about his experiences"" and said: ""I just woke up and I just tried to keep fighting because I knew that if I didn't carry on doing that people forget it very quickly. ""I think there needs to now be a little bit of a shift into love and compassion. And if people are willing to change, then we need to support them."" Rafiq told the select committee in November that English cricket is ""institutionally racist"" and racist language was ""constantly"" used during his time as a player at Yorkshire. Knight said the MPs had been ""shocked"" by language used in correspondence they had received following the hearing. The report also made reference to stories in the media run to ""discredit"" Rafiq. ""It further established that eradicating racism from the game will be a long and difficult road,"" the report said. ""It does not matter if a whistleblower is of perfect moral character but whether the issue raised is valid. ""It is evident to us that there is a deep-seated issue of racism in cricket."" Knight again praised Rafiq's courage in speaking out about racism. MPs also heard from Hutton and representatives from the ECB, including chief executive Tom Harrison, during November's session. Harrison said English cricket wasnearing an emergencyover its failure to address racism, with the governing bodysubsequently publishing a five-point planto tackle the issue. ""Public funding for cricket must depend on real leadership and progress by the ECB to tackle abhorrent behaviour,"" Knight said. ""The government must make future funding conditional on the game cleaning up its act. ""We put the ECB on notice that we expect regular updates delivered to this committee on progress being made."" MPs recommended the ECB develop a set of ""key indicators"" to measure progress and then report back to the committee. They will also invite Yorkshire and the ECB to give evidence on their progress early in 2022. Knight told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that the long-term viability of the ECB itself could be questioned if they did not tackle racism. ""Any grants from Sport England or any form of governmental grant should be dependent upon the ECB showing that it has not just established these targets but is actively looking to achieve them,"" he added. ""If that also doesn't happen, we could potentially look at an option down the line of establishing an independent regulator. ""This is a key test of whether or not that should still remain the case."" Responding to the report,Lord Patelcalled Rafiq's testimony ""a watershed moment for the sport as a whole"" and added that Yorkshire were ""committed to ensuring that no-one endures the unacceptable experience that he did"". ADCMS spokespersonadded: ""We thank the select committee for its report into the disgraceful treatment of Azeem Rafiq by Yorkshire County Cricket Club and racism in the sport. ""We will now consider the report's recommendations and take further action if necessary."" Barry O'Brien, interim ECB chair, said: ""We welcome the committee's recommendations and we also embrace the ongoing scrutiny of the committee. We are determined to root out racism - and other forms of discrimination - from our sport. ""We had already taken important steps to make cricket more inclusive in recent years. We are deeply sorry for the pain people have suffered and recognise the courage it has taken to speak out. We are determined to make cricket a stronger, more welcoming sport."" Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of Sport England, said: ""The DCMS select committee's report highlights the powerful need for the ECB, the counties, and other cricketing stakeholders to reform and take action to end structural racism in the sport. ""Sport England's funding is explicitly linked to the development and implementation of robust diversity and inclusion policies and plans. We have made that clear to the ECB, who have responded positively and constructively. ""Azeem Rafiq's powerful and personal testimony to the committee shows us that ultimately, the litmus test of progress will be the lived experiences of diverse communities and their involvement in the game. Until experiences like Azeem's are eradicated, the work to defeat racism in sport must continue."" Off-spinner Rafiq, who had two stints at Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, initially went public with his experiences in September 2020. Yorkshire launched a formal investigation the same month and received the findings in August 2021. However, the club did not release the report, despite being asked to by the ECB. They instead released a statemen admitting Rafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" - something he said was downplaying racism - and offered him their ""profound apologies"". Following further criticism, Yorkshire received a summary of the findings, which said seven of Rafiq's 43 allegations had been upheld.

In December, 16 members of staff, including director of cricket Martyn Moxon and first-team coach Andrew Gale, were sacked. Former Yorkshire and England pace bowler Darren Gough has since been appointed director of cricket until the end of the 2022 season, while former England bowlers Ryan Sidebottom and Steve Harmison have joined the coaching staff on an interim basis.

Patel told BBC Sport on Wednesday he was confident the ban on hosting England matches would be lifted, while Rafiq has also said Yorkshire ""deserve"" to have games at Headingley.

Prince Andrew accuser praises legal case decision,"Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre) and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 The woman who has accused the Duke of York of sexually abusing her has welcomed a US judge's decision to allow her legal case to continue. Prince Andrew faces a civil case in the US after Virginia Giuffre sued him, claiming he abused her in 2001. He has consistently denied the claims. Ms Giuffre said she was ""pleased"" with the rulingthe case can continue, after the prince tried to have it dismissed. She said she is glad to have a ""chance to continue to expose the truth"". As part of her case, Ms Giuffre claims she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, alleging she was trafficked to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17. Who is Prince Andrew and what titles is he losing? Giuffre unlikely to just want money, says lawyer Maitlis: Prince's jaw-dropping TV interview now critical What's next for Prince Andrew? Writing on Twitter, Ms Giuffre thanked her ""extraordinary"" legal team and said: ""Their determination helps me seek justice from those who hurt me and so many others. ""My goal has always been to show that the rich and powerful are not above the law & must be held accountable. I do not walk this path alone, but alongside countless other survivors of sexual abuse & trafficking."" On Thursday it was revealed the prince's military titles and royal patronages had beenreturned to the Queenand he will stop using the style His Royal Highness in an official capacity, a royal source said. Like Harry and Meghan, Prince Andrew retains his title HRH but will not use it in any official capacity. A source close to the prince has said he will ""continue to defend himself"" against the case brought in New York by Ms Giuffre. The ruling on Wednesday that the civil action could proceed was ""not a judgement on the merits of Ms Giuffre's allegations"", the source added. This video can not be played Watch: Prince Charles is asked about his brother Andrew Buckingham Palace said in a statement: ""With the Queen's approval and agreement, the Duke of York's military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen. ""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen."" All Prince Andrew's roles have been returned with immediate effect, and will be redistributed to other members of the Royal Family, a source said. A letter - released by anti-monarchy pressure group Republic - had been signed by more than 150 Royal Navy, RAF and Army veterans asking the Queen to strip Prince Andrew of his eight British military titles. The prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, and served as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War. The palace announcement means he has lost military titles including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards - one of the most senior infantry regiments in the Army, alongside nine other British military titles and several overseas honorary roles. But he will retain his service rank of vice-admiral, the palace confirmed. This video can not be played Watch: Why Prince Andrew's military titles and royal patronages meant so much Several other charities and organisations had cut their ties with the prince, but he continued to hold dozens of royal patronages - including being a patron or member of prestigious golf clubs, schools and cultural trusts. There is no setdefinition of the role of a patronin charity law, according to the Charity Commission - which registers and regulates charities in England and Wales. However, the main role of a royal patron is generally considered to gather publicity for and raising the profile of charities or other organisations, with more than 3,000 listing a member of the Royal Family as their patron or president. On Friday, a senior Liberal Democrat councillor from City of York Council launched acampaign to strip the prince of his Duke of York title, a call which was echoed by a local Labour MP. Cllr Darryl Smalley said even though the prince ""remains innocent until proven guilty"", Buckingham Palace and the government ""must consider the implications of these troubling allegations"". MP for York Central Rachael Maskell agreed, tweeting: ""It's untenable for the Duke of York to cling onto his title another day longer; this association with York must end."" Ms Giuffre claims late billionaire financier Epstein trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17 On Thursday, Ms Giuffre's lawyer David Boies told the BBCa financial settlement alone would not be enoughfor his client and that she wishes to be vindicated. Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued her case should be dismissed, citing a 2009 deal she signed with Epstein. But in a 46-page decision, Judge Lewis A Kaplan dismissed the prince's claim that the case against him was ""legally insufficient"" and could not go on to be heard at a future trial. Ms Giuffre, now 38, filed a civil case in New York in August 2021 under the state's Child Victims Act, which allows survivors of childhood sexual abuse to pursue a case which otherwise would have been barred because too much time had passed. In court documents filed as part of her civil case, Ms Giuffre also alleges the prince abused her on three occasions - both in the UK and the US - when she was a minor under US law. In an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Prince Andrew said he had no memory of ever meeting Ms Giuffre, and her account of them having sex ""didn't happen"". He withdrew from public life shortly after the interview - which he used to repeat his denials of her allegations, as well explain his one-time friendship with Epstein, whodied in prison in 2019, and the late financier's girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. Last month, Maxwell was found guilty of recruiting and trafficking underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. What's next for Prince Andrew?

"Don't use refund firms for tax claims, says Which?The consumer group says people are paying third party firms hundreds of pounds unnecessarily.","Using a company to help you claim a tax rebate could end up costing you hundreds of pounds extra according to consumer group Which? Dozens of firms online offer to help customers claim back tax they're owed by HM Revenue & Customs, for example, for the Marriage Allowance. But these third-party firms charge fees and take a percentage of the tax claim. Which? says most people are much better off going straight to HMRC themselves to avoid ""unnecessary bills"". Tax rebates are free to claim via HMRC, and the process is ""relatively simple"", but some firms are charging between a quarter and half of the final tax payment received in return for their services, Which? said. The consumer rights group has identified 208 firms with ""tax reclaim"", ""tax refund"", ""tax claim"" and ""tax rebate"" in their names. It found the term ""tax rebate"" gets more than 40,000 Google searches a month. Some of these third-party firms use similar branding and language to the HMRC, Which? said. Jenny Ross, Which? money editor, said their research showed huge numbers of people were coming into contact with firms hoping to persuade them to use their services to claim rebates, costing people ""potentially hundreds of pounds"". ""For most people with a rebate to claim, HMRC is the best port of call. Go to its website directly to ensure you aren't left footing any unnecessary bills,"" she said. HMRC waives fines again for late self-assessment Warning benefits will not keep up with rising prices One of the most common tax claims is for Marriage Allowance, Which? said, which allows one spouse to transfer 10% of their tax-free personal allowance to their partner if their partner earns less than the current personal allowance, and it can be backdated up to a total of Â£1,220. While firms are permitted to charge a ""reasonable amount"" for such services, Which? said it found one firm, Tax Credits Ltd, was charging a service fee of 48%. Tax Credits said: 'We spend a significant amount on marketing and providing access to this potential tax relief. In many cases it's our advertising, not HMRC's, that makes a person aware of it. ""We then present the claimant with a simple mechanism to access the potential overpayment of tax. Our remuneration is contingent on a repayment being secured, and the amount we retain is reflective of this,"" it added. Which? said customers who have been misled by websites into thinking they were dealing with the tax authority directly should make a complaint to the Citizens Advice Consumer Service.

"Cricket must tackle racism or lose funding, says reportPublic money for the sport must be limited unless progress is made in fighting racism, a report says.BBC Sport","This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire The government should limit public funding for cricket unless there is ""continuous, demonstrable progress"" on eradicating ""deep-seated racism"", a parliamentary report has recommended. Azeem Rafiq gave emotional testimony last year to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee aboutracism he experiencedat Yorkshire. The committee's report was published on Friday, with chair Julian Knight MP describing Rafiq's story as ""typical of an endemic problem across the whole of cricket"". Yorkshire have been widely criticised for their handling of Rafiq's allegations. Former chairman Roger Hutton and chief executive Mark Arthur have resigned and 16 members of staff have been sacked. The committee said changes made by Lord Patel, who replaced Hutton in November, were a positive step but they alone ""could not eradicate racism"". ""This is a watershed for cricket,"" Knight said. ""Those who love and support the game are part of the solution and must play their part."" This video can not be played Racism in cricket: Azeem Rafiq 'encouraged' by parliamentary report Rafiq welcomed the report, adding that it also made clear the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) responsibilities in tackling racism in the sport. He said: ""The committee has listened and taken sensible action. It is absolutely brilliant that Julian Knight and his colleagues on the committee are going to hold the ECB to account. ""This shows just how seriously politicians are taking an issue that too many people in cricket ignored for so long. The committee understands how important it is to clean up the game. ""I'm glad that MPs will monitor any progress, so that the reforms needed to make the sport inclusive to all youngsters can happen soon."" Yorkshire face 'financial crisis' if international ban remains Listen to Around the Wicket - Yorkshire's Asian Cricket Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here TMS podcast: ECB chief Harrison reacts to DCMS report Responding to the report on Friday, ECB chief executiveTom Harrison saidhe welcomed the ""scrutiny""- and that he was ""very confident"" cricket would be able to ""demonstrate massive progress in this space"". Harrison agreed that a link between showing change and government funding was ""right and proper"". ""I'm very confident that in the not-so-distant future we can become an exemplar of the kind of behaviours that promote social integration and understanding,"" Harrison told BBC Sport. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Rafiq said Yorkshire should not be given Test cricket back ""indefinitely"" and should be ""kept under review for a good four or five years at least"". He said: ""There's two times the game's acted [on racism]. One is when their pockets have been hit or they've been embarrassed. So it's really important that we keep an eye on what's happening."" Rafiq described the start of his campaign for change as ""just a broken man speaking about his experiences"" and said: ""I just woke up and I just tried to keep fighting because I knew that if I didn't carry on doing that people forget it very quickly. ""I think there needs to now be a little bit of a shift into love and compassion. And if people are willing to change, then we need to support them."" Rafiq told the select committee in November that English cricket is ""institutionally racist"" and racist language was ""constantly"" used during his time as a player at Yorkshire. Knight said the MPs had been ""shocked"" by language used in correspondence they had received following the hearing. The report also made reference to stories in the media run to ""discredit"" Rafiq. ""It further established that eradicating racism from the game will be a long and difficult road,"" the report said. ""It does not matter if a whistleblower is of perfect moral character but whether the issue raised is valid. ""It is evident to us that there is a deep-seated issue of racism in cricket."" Knight again praised Rafiq's courage in speaking out about racism. MPs also heard from Hutton and representatives from the ECB, including chief executive Tom Harrison, during November's session. Harrison said English cricket wasnearing an emergencyover its failure to address racism, with the governing bodysubsequently publishing a five-point planto tackle the issue. ""Public funding for cricket must depend on real leadership and progress by the ECB to tackle abhorrent behaviour,"" Knight said. ""The government must make future funding conditional on the game cleaning up its act. ""We put the ECB on notice that we expect regular updates delivered to this committee on progress being made."" MPs recommended the ECB develop a set of ""key indicators"" to measure progress and then report back to the committee. They will also invite Yorkshire and the ECB to give evidence on their progress early in 2022. Knight told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that the long-term viability of the ECB itself could be questioned if they did not tackle racism. ""Any grants from Sport England or any form of governmental grant should be dependent upon the ECB showing that it has not just established these targets but is actively looking to achieve them,"" he added. ""If that also doesn't happen, we could potentially look at an option down the line of establishing an independent regulator. ""This is a key test of whether or not that should still remain the case."" Responding to the report,Lord Patelcalled Rafiq's testimony ""a watershed moment for the sport as a whole"" and added that Yorkshire were ""committed to ensuring that no-one endures the unacceptable experience that he did"". ADCMS spokespersonadded: ""We thank the select committee for its report into the disgraceful treatment of Azeem Rafiq by Yorkshire County Cricket Club and racism in the sport. ""We will now consider the report's recommendations and take further action if necessary."" Barry O'Brien, interim ECB chair, said: ""We welcome the committee's recommendations and we also embrace the ongoing scrutiny of the committee. We are determined to root out racism - and other forms of discrimination - from our sport. ""We had already taken important steps to make cricket more inclusive in recent years. We are deeply sorry for the pain people have suffered and recognise the courage it has taken to speak out. We are determined to make cricket a stronger, more welcoming sport."" Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of Sport England, said: ""The DCMS select committee's report highlights the powerful need for the ECB, the counties, and other cricketing stakeholders to reform and take action to end structural racism in the sport. ""Sport England's funding is explicitly linked to the development and implementation of robust diversity and inclusion policies and plans. We have made that clear to the ECB, who have responded positively and constructively. ""Azeem Rafiq's powerful and personal testimony to the committee shows us that ultimately, the litmus test of progress will be the lived experiences of diverse communities and their involvement in the game. Until experiences like Azeem's are eradicated, the work to defeat racism in sport must continue."" Off-spinner Rafiq, who had two stints at Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, initially went public with his experiences in September 2020. Yorkshire launched a formal investigation the same month and received the findings in August 2021. However, the club did not release the report, despite being asked to by the ECB.

Dutch king retires golden coach amid slavery rowCritics say the carriage depicts an image that celebrates the Netherlands' slave-owning past.,"Dutch monarchs, including King Willem-Alexander, have traditionally travelled in the carriage to the state opening of parliament The Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander has announced that Dutch royals will cease using a historic golden carriage amid a debate over slavery links. Critics say that one side of the horse-drawn carriage, called De Gouden Koets, is decorated with an image that glorifies the country's colonial past. Out of use since 2015, the carriage has traditionally been used to carry Dutch monarchs to the opening of parliament. The move comes amid an ongoing debate in the country over its history. The controversial image featured on the vehicle is called Tribute from the Colonies, and depicts black and Asian people - one of whom is kneeling - offering goods including cocoa and sugarcane to a seated young white woman who symbolises the Netherlands. Seated next to her is a man offering a book to a young boy, which the work's painter, Nicolaas van der Waay, said in 1896 was intended to portray the Netherlands' gift of ""civilisation"" to its colonies. In an official video announcing the move, King Willem-Alexander accepted that the carriage was offensive to a large number of people and called on the country to face the legacy of its colonial history together. ""There is no point in condemning and disqualifying what has happened through the lens of our time,"" he said. ""Simply banning historical objects and symbols is certainly not a solution either. Instead, a concerted effort is needed that goes deeper and takes longer. An effort that unites us instead of divides us. ""As long as there are people living in the Netherlands who feel the pain of discrimination on a daily basis, the past will still cast its shadow over our time,"" he added. The carriage has been out of use for several years and has resided at the Amsterdam Museum since a lengthy restoration project concluded last year. Anti-racism campaigners in the Netherlands have welcomed the move, but have called on the king to take further action to face up to the legacy of colonialism. ""He says the past should not be looked at from the perspective and values of the present,"" said Mitchell Esajas, co-founder of The Black Archives in Amsterdam. ""I think that's a fallacy because also in the historical context slavery can be seen as a crime against humanity and a violent system."" In recent years, many Dutch people have been urging the country to have a reckoning with its colonial past. During the 17th Century the Netherlands conquered large swathes of territory in regions now known as Indonesia, South Africa, CuraÃ§ao and West Papua, and became a key player in the transatlantic slave trade. Last year, the mayor of Amsterdam, Femke Halsema,formally apologised for the city's role in the slave trade. The move put her at odds with Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who has rejected calls for a formal state apology.

Thanks for following developments with us. Here's a
reminder of what's just happened. We've just heard that the next step in Djokovic's legal journey is a hearing, in front of Australia's Federal Court, at 10:15 Saturday morning local time (that's 23:15 Friday GMT). The judge in Friday's hearing ruled that the tennis star's case should be transferred to the federal court. At that hearing which concluded just a couple of hours ago it was agreed that Djokovic would be taken into immigration detention once more on Saturday morning at 08:00 local time. Here are the documents from Friday's hearing,external. Djokovic's side want the case to move as quickly as possible as they are hoping for a successful challenge to the visa cancellation before play starts in the Australian Open on Monday.

Some strong words just in from Serbia, where our correspondent in Belgrade, Guy De Launey, has been speaking to a senior official in the foreign ministry. Nemanja Starovic told the BBC that Serbia has the impression ""Djokovic was treated like a criminal - but he is not"". He says the government have been giving their ""full support"" to Djokovic and his legal team but the player was not given ""fair treatment"" ""We have seen other tennis players who didn't respect their mandatory isolation but they havenât received the same treatment as Novak,"" he says. He also says that there was an impression across the media that Djokovic was a ""spoilt brat"", but this was ""detached from reality"". Starovic says that the Serbian government is asking Australia not to  hold Djokovic in a detention centre again, saying ""he doesnât deserve that. Heâs not an illegal migrant"". ""Relations between our two countries have always been friendly and public opinion about Australia was always strong here in Serbia. ""Unfortunately he was treated like a criminal,  so this could potentially damaged the relations between two countries,"" Starovic says. Novak Djokovic has not been immediately sent back to the immigration detention hotel where he spent five nights when his visa was first revoked. But it may well be where he ends up after he is detained by immigration officials on Saturday morning. Refugees and asylum seekers have long complained of the poor conditions at the Park Hotel in Melbourne. Kurdish refugee Mostafa ""Moz"" Azimitabar, who spent more than a year in immigration hotels including two months at the Park Hotel, described his room there as a ""coffin"". He said he spent about 23 hours a day inside the room he shared with one other person, where the window was tinted and sealed shut. ""A hotel is a place for people who want to be comfortable and enjoy their time, but when they lock the place, that place becomes a prison, not a hotel,"" he said. Read more about the situation there. BBC Radio 5 Live Nicky Campbell has been askingRadio 5 Livelisteners if they think Australian leaders have made the right decision over Djokovic's visa. Jenny in Norwich hasn't been granted a visa to visit her 96-year-old mother, who lives just outside Melbourne, since the start of the pandemic. She believes Djokovic shouldn't be allowed into Australia for three years and says allowing sportspeople in is ""all about money and politics"". Karen in Glasgow disagrees and says revoking Djokovic's visa seems ""petty and revengeful"". She says as the tennis star has been allowed freedom of movement for the past week, there can't possibly be any further concerns about him endangering public health. Meanwhile Michael from Sydney was stuck in the UK last year, unable to return to his four children and job in Australia after flying to be with his 96-year-old mother during the first lockdown. He has since managed to get back home after paying for an Â£8,000 business class ticket. He says sports professionals have ""waltzed in on their private jets, [broken] the systems, lied on their forms and expected to be treated differently"". For now, Djokovic remains in the Australian Open draw ashis visa saga drags on. Earlier on Friday - before the decision from an Australian minister to cancel his visa once more - the world number one was photographed taking part in practice sessions at the Melbourne Park sports venue where the Grand Slam tournament will be played. Djokovic has already won the Australian Open nine times and he remains hopeful of defending his title next week. If - and it's a big if - he gets to compete, a win would make him the most successful male tennis player in history with a record 21 Grand Slam titles. The Serb, 34, is currently tied with Rafael Nadal (35) and Roger Federer (40) as all three have won 20 titles. Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Melbourne Park More now from Britain's former world number one Andy Murray - who's reiterated his belief that the Djokovic saga is ""not good for anyone"". Murray, 34, has known the Serb since they were children and, following the Scot's win at a pre-Open tournament in Sydney a short time ago, was asked for his take on the situation. ""I'm not going to sit here and start kicking Novak whilst he's down. I said it the other day, it's not a good situation for anyone. ""It's unfortunate that it's ended up in this sort of situation. I just want it to get resolved.  I think it would be good for everyone if that was the case. ""It just seems like it's dragged on for quite a long time now and not great for the tennis, not great for the Australian Open, not great for Novak. ""Obviously a lot of people have criticised the government here, as well.  It's not been good."" Read more tennis reaction to the Djokovic visa sagahere. Kayleen DevlinBBC Monitoring disinformation team A protest against vaccine mandates in Sydney, Australia Novak Djokovicâs lawyer
claims that the tennis champion's visa was cancelled because authorities were
worried that allowing him to play would ""excite"" Australiaâs anti-vax movement. And it is fair to say the case has certainly attracted the attention of the hard core
anti-vaccine minority. Today, in one of the most popular Australian anti-vax channels on the messaging app Telegram, the unvaccinated Djokovic is being held up as an international symbol against what activists call âvirus tyrannyâ. Other similar groups are repeating debunked claims linking the vaccine to heart problems in athletes. And earlier in the week there were calls by anti-vaxxers to boycott the Australian Open, and multiple posts across social media declaring support for the tennis star - who, it should be said, has never publicly expressed support for the most outlandish anti-vax conspiracy theories. These are of course small groups. More than 92% of Australia's over-16s are already vaccinated against Covid. However, these small groups are vocal - and at times their online discussions spill out into the streets in protests and other actions. It's getting very late in Melbourne and we aren't expecting any major developments until Djokovic is detained on Saturday morning. But if you remember the expletive-laden
video of two Australian newsreaders privately talking about the Djokovic saga which was leaked earlier this week, we have an update on that. The staffer who allegedly leaked the clip has been fired, according to their former employer. The
video, which went viral,shows Channel 7 journalists Mike Amor and Rebecca Maddern talking candidlyabout the tennis star as they prepare to read the
evening news. Maddern
says Djokovic is ""lying"" and ""sneaky"", while Amor says the
athlete has ""fallen over his own [expletive] lies"". The
newsreaders were reacting to an earlier twist in the saga, when Djokovic successfully challenged his first visa cancellation. That feels like a long time ago, but was earlier this week. Ai-Media Technologies, which provides captioning services, said an ""employee working remotely"" was ""responsible for the unauthorised distribution of the content"". The late-night hearing has now concluded. Here's what was decided: One of the key developments from the hearing was that lawyers for Novak Djokovic gave their understanding of
why the Australian government cancelled the tennis player's visa. They said that Immigration Minister Alex Hawke believed letting
Djokovic stay in the country would excite anti-vaccination sentiment. The
lawyers argued that this was ""patently irrational"". It's the first time we've heard this as a reason for the
cancellation, but it should be said that it has been made public by Djokovic's lawyers, not by
the government. The earlier statement from the immigration minister was less specific, saying only that the decision was made on ""health and good order grounds"". Although Djokovic is not vaccinated, he has not actively promoted anti-vax disinformation. However, Australian anti-vaxxers have been using the hashtag #IStandWithDjokovic on social media. Australia's vaccination campaign started slowly, and was hampered by fears of very rare side effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine, which made up the bulk of Australia's vaccine supply early in the campaign. However, more than 90% of Australia's eligible population is now fully vaccinated. That was quicker than expected - that's all from the court. Lawyers representing the two sides agreed Djokovic could be taken into custody at an unknown location to avoid the ""media circus"" that his lawyers are concerned about. The hearing is now over and the judge says he will publish his reasons on Saturday morning. Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Melbourne Park The Australian Open has just announced the top half of the men's singles draw - which includes Djokovic - will be played on Monday. It means if the Serb is again able to overturn the decision to cancel his visa on Sunday he will start his title defence the following day. And we are back under way again... Stick with us - we are waiting for the court hearing on the next steps to resume. In the meantime here's how Australian TV networks covered today's news that the immigration minister was cancelling Novak Djokovic's visa: This video can not be played How Australian broadcasters reported latest Djokovic decision Just before the judge called an adjournment, lawyers for the tennis player said they had real concerns about a ""media circus"" taking place when Djokovic is taken back into detention. They also said they had security concerns if the location of Djokovic's detention becomes publicly known. Judge Kelly replied by saying ""on mature reflection the obviousness of that circus might have occurred to everyone before 10.55pm on Friday"". He then paused proceedings.  Judge Kelly orders another five minute adjournment after he finds that the two sides are not in agreement. It's very late at night in Melbourne - nearly 2300 - and the judge's patience is being tried, it seems. The judge says that Djokovic should attend the interview with immigration officials at 08:00 on Saturday local time (21:00 on Friday GMT). He should then be able to take part in meetings at his solicitors' office on Saturday from 10:00 - 14:00, and again on Sunday morning for the court hearing. This attendance should be supervised by Australian Border Force officers. This means that Djokovic will be taken into immigration detention on Saturday morning. Judge Kelly also orders that the proceedings should be transferred to the Federal Court of Australia. The court hearing to decide on the next steps is back under way after a short adjournment. It's being live-streamed on YouTube, although court rules forbid us from bringing you the pictures live. About 20,000 people are currently watching the stream, which unfortunately for those of us following it closely is slightly intermittent. We'll be bringing you all the latest developments from the late-night hearing.  Here's a quick look at how events unfolded: 1 January- Novak Djokovic submits travel declaration to Australian Government department of Home Affairs. He receives a government response saying his declaration had been assessed and he met requirements for quarantine-free travel into Australia 2 January- Issued a border travel permit from the Victoria state government 5 January- Djokovic arrives at Melbourne Airport at 2300 local time on a  flight from Spain via Dubai 6 January- He gets notice of his visa cancellation at 4:30 local time. An hour and a half later at 6:00 local time, he faces a visa interview. Then at 7:42 local time, his visa is cancelled and he is taken into detention 6-10 January- Djokovic is held in immigration detention at the Park Hotel in Melbourne 10 January- The player mounts a legal challenge to overturn his visa cancellation in the Federal Circuit Court. He wins the case after the government withdraws and the court orders his release at 17:42 local time 14 January- Immigration Minister Alex Hawke revokes visa Â© 2025 BBC.

N Korea hackers stole $400m crypto in 2021 - reportBlockchain research firm Chainalysis says the value extracted from the hacks grew by 40% year-on-year.Business,"North Korean hackers stole almost $400m (Â£291m) worth of digital assets in at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms last year, a report claims. Blockchain analysis company Chainalysis said it was one of most successful years on record for cyber-criminals in the closed east Asian state. The attacks mainly targeted investment firms and centralised exchanges. North Korea has routinely denied being involved in hack attacks attributed to them. ""From 2020 to 2021, the number of North Korean-linked hacks jumped from four to seven, and the value extracted from these hacks grew by 40%,""Chainalysis said in a report,external. The hackers used a number of techniques, including phishing lures, code exploits and malware to siphon funds from the organisations' ""hot"" wallets and then moved them into North Korea-controlled addresses, the company said. Cryptocurrency hot wallets are connected to the internet and cryptocurrency network and so are vulnerable to hacking. They are used to send and receive cryptocurrency, and allow users to view how many tokens they have. Many experts recommend moving large amounts of cryptocurrency not needed day-to-day to ""cold"" wallets, which are disconnected from the wider internet. Chainalysis said it is likely that many of last year's attacks were conducted by the so-called Lazarus Group, a hacking group which the US has applied sanctions against. The group is believed to be controlled by North Korea's primary intelligence bureau, the Reconnaissance General Bureau.

Some strong words just in from Serbia, where our correspondent in Belgrade, Guy De Launey, has been speaking to a senior official in the foreign ministry. Nemanja Starovic told the BBC that Serbia has the impression ""Djokovic was treated like a criminal - but he is not"". He says the government have been giving their ""full support"" to Djokovic and his legal team but the player was not given ""fair treatment"" ""We have seen other tennis players who didn't respect their mandatory isolation but they havenât received the same treatment as Novak,"" he says. He also says that there was an impression across the media that Djokovic was a ""spoilt brat"", but this was ""detached from reality"". Starovic says that the Serbian government is asking Australia not to  hold Djokovic in a detention centre again, saying ""he doesnât deserve that. Heâs not an illegal migrant"". ""Relations between our two countries have always been friendly and public opinion about Australia was always strong here in Serbia. ""Unfortunately he was treated like a criminal,  so this could potentially damaged the relations between two countries,"" Starovic says. Novak Djokovic has not been immediately sent back to the immigration detention hotel where he spent five nights when his visa was first revoked. But it may well be where he ends up after he is detained by immigration officials on Saturday morning. Refugees and asylum seekers have long complained of the poor conditions at the Park Hotel in Melbourne. Kurdish refugee Mostafa ""Moz"" Azimitabar, who spent more than a year in immigration hotels including two months at the Park Hotel, described his room there as a ""coffin"". He said he spent about 23 hours a day inside the room he shared with one other person, where the window was tinted and sealed shut. ""A hotel is a place for people who want to be comfortable and enjoy their time, but when they lock the place, that place becomes a prison, not a hotel,"" he said.

Film tells how Hollywood premiere saved a cinema,"This video can not be played Jurassic Park premiered at Carmarthen's Lyric as part of Liz Evans's fight to save the theatre A film about a hairdresser who helped bring Hollywood to west Wales to save a local theatre is hitting cinemas. Liz Evans, played by Samantha Morton, led a campaign that convinced Steven Spielberg to stage a premiere of blockbuster Jurassic Park in Carmarthen's Lyric theatre in 1993. Save the Cinema's stars also include Sir Jonathan Pryce and Rhod Gilbert. Liz's real-life son, tenor and Go Compare star Wynne Evans, plays himself and found reliving that time emotional. He said he was about 13 years old when his mother took on the herculean fight to save the Lyric from demolition to make way for a shopping centre. Jurassic Park was one of the blockbuster films of the 1990s ""I've got mixed emotions about the time if I'm honest... she just moved into the theatre,"" Evans said. He said his mother lived by the maxim ""do it now and apologise later"". ""If I wanted to see my parents I'd have to go to the theatre, and so it was very difficult to have to share your mother and your father with an entire town... it was quite a difficult time if I'm honest. ""I lost out on having a constant mum and dad there to help me with my school work or to take interest in things that I would do outside of the youth opera or outside of the theatre."" Liz Evans' son, the tenor Wynne Evans, is more accustomed to playing his alter-ego Gio Compario in the Go Compare adverts Evans, who also presents a show for BBC Radio Wales, said revisiting his childhood had been ""very emotional and changed my opinion of my parents hugely"". He remembers his mother as a strong and driven women with an gift of getting people in authority round to her way of thinking. ""I've never seen anybody walk into a council meeting and manage to turn the room around like my mother could... they just couldn't say no to her."" The real Liz Evans speaking to BBC Wales Today in 1991 Evans has not yet seen the finished film, but is looking forward to seeing his mother portrayed on the big screen. ""If you showed a realistic version of my mother it wouldn't be a PG, that's for sure,"" he joked. For Oscar-nominated British actress Samantha Morton, the role of Liz was irresistible Samantha Morton was able to learn about Liz Evans through documentary footage and speaking to those who knew her ""I just wanted to be part of it,"" she said. ""Liz was incredibly inspiring to young people, and she had their backs. ""No matter who you were, once you were in the youth opera, you were in.

Film tells how Hollywood premiere saved a cinemaA town's fight to save its theatre is turned into a film with Samantha Morton and Jonathan Pryce.Wales,"This video can not be played Jurassic Park premiered at Carmarthen's Lyric as part of Liz Evans's fight to save the theatre A film about a hairdresser who helped bring Hollywood to west Wales to save a local theatre is hitting cinemas. Liz Evans, played by Samantha Morton, led a campaign that convinced Steven Spielberg to stage a premiere of blockbuster Jurassic Park in Carmarthen's Lyric theatre in 1993. Save the Cinema's stars also include Sir Jonathan Pryce and Rhod Gilbert. Liz's real-life son, tenor and Go Compare star Wynne Evans, plays himself and found reliving that time emotional. He said he was about 13 years old when his mother took on the herculean fight to save the Lyric from demolition to make way for a shopping centre. Jurassic Park was one of the blockbuster films of the 1990s ""I've got mixed emotions about the time if I'm honest... she just moved into the theatre,"" Evans said. He said his mother lived by the maxim ""do it now and apologise later"". ""If I wanted to see my parents I'd have to go to the theatre, and so it was very difficult to have to share your mother and your father with an entire town... it was quite a difficult time if I'm honest. ""I lost out on having a constant mum and dad there to help me with my school work or to take interest in things that I would do outside of the youth opera or outside of the theatre."" Liz Evans' son, the tenor Wynne Evans, is more accustomed to playing his alter-ego Gio Compario in the Go Compare adverts Evans, who also presents a show for BBC Radio Wales, said revisiting his childhood had been ""very emotional and changed my opinion of my parents hugely"". He remembers his mother as a strong and driven women with an gift of getting people in authority round to her way of thinking. ""I've never seen anybody walk into a council meeting and manage to turn the room around like my mother could... they just couldn't say no to her."" The real Liz Evans speaking to BBC Wales Today in 1991 Evans has not yet seen the finished film, but is looking forward to seeing his mother portrayed on the big screen. ""If you showed a realistic version of my mother it wouldn't be a PG, that's for sure,"" he joked. For Oscar-nominated British actress Samantha Morton, the role of Liz was irresistible Samantha Morton was able to learn about Liz Evans through documentary footage and speaking to those who knew her ""I just wanted to be part of it,"" she said. ""Liz was incredibly inspiring to young people, and she had their backs. ""No matter who you were, once you were in the youth opera, you were in. And she was a tough teacher as well, which I quite like, in that she treated everybody the same.""

"London 'hitman' on trial over plot to kill activistMuhammad Gohir Khan is accused of agreeing to kill a Pakistani military critic for Â£100,000.UK","Waqass Goraya left Pakistan for the Netherlands where he became a prominent critic of the Pakistani military A man has gone on trial in London, accused of plotting to kill a Pakistani blogger living in the Netherlands. A court heard that 31-year-old Muhammad Gohir Khan was hired as a ""hitman"" by figures said to be based in Pakistan. He was arrested last June and pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to murder. Lawyers said the intended victim, Ahmad Waqass Goraya, had set up a blog on Facebook making fun of the Pakistani military and detailing alleged human rights violations. Kingston Crown Court heard that Mr Goraya, who was living in Rotterdam at the time, ""was known for speaking out against the activities of the Pakistani government and appears to have been targeted for that reason"". The jury was told that Mr Khan, a supermarket worker from East London, was heavily in debt - with the prosecution alleging he reacted ""enthusiastically"" to a proposal by a man named only as ""MudZ"" to kill the Pakistani political activist in exchange for Â£100,000. Leading the prosecution, Alison Morgan QC, said in December 2018 Mr Goraya had received information from the FBI that he was on a ""kill list"" and that he had received threats online and in person, some of which he believed ""were being orchestrated by ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)"", Pakistan's intelligence agency. The court was shown alleged Whatsapp messages between the defendant Mr Khan and a middle-man named as ""MudZ"" appearing to discuss the murder allegedly using a code referencing fishing, with the target on one occasion described as ""a little fish"" as opposed to a ""shark"" and that a ""little knifeâ¦ hook"" would suffice for the job. Another figure mentioned in the messages in relation to the alleged plot was referred to as ""Big Boss"". The prosecution said the defendant had been sent Mr Goraya's home address and photograph, and had travelled to Rotterdam where he purchased a knife, but that he had been unable to locate Mr Goraya and so returned to the UK where he was arrested. Prosecuting lawyer, Ms Morgan QC, told the court Mr Khan accepts sending and receiving all the messages in question and travelling to Rotterdam, but maintains he intended to keep the money and not carry out the murder. The prosecution alleges he did intend on killing Mr Goraya. The trial is set to last around two weeks.

Mark Drakeford to ease Wales' Covid rulesThe first minister is to set out a two-week plan with rules on outdoor activities to be lifted first.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Covid: How will Wales' restrictions change in the coming weeks? Most restrictions in Wales will be scrapped over the next two weeks if Covid cases continue to fall, the first minister has confirmed. Measures, brought in to tackle the Omicron variant, will be liftedas Wales moves to alert level zero. Opposition parties had called for an exit plan, with Conservative Andrew RT Daviessaying ""Labour got it wrong"",external. Mark Drakeford said Omicron cases had fallen ""rapidly"" and the rules could now be relaxed ""gradually"". What are the rules in Wales now? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Self isolation period in Wales cut by three days The Welsh government also pointed to the success of the booster campaign in enabling it to lift restrictions, with 1.8 million people having received an extra vaccine dose. There will be a four stage process to lifting the current alert level two restrictions in Wales, depending on cases remaining low: Saturday: Numbers allowed to attend an outdoor event will rise from 50 to 500 Friday 21 January: Crowds allowed to return to sporting events, paving the way for rugby Six Nations full houses in Cardiff, and no limits on those attending outdoor events Friday 28 January: Nightclubs can reopen and hospitality allowed to operate normally, although Covid passes will still be required for large events, plus cinemas, nightclubs and theatres. Working from home no longer a legal requirement Thursday 10 February: Wales returns to a three-week review cycle as the country is at alert level zero ""The actions we have taken together have helped us to weather the Omicron storm. The latest data suggests some positive signs that the peak may have passed,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""We can now look more confidently to the future and plan to start gradually removing the alert level two restrictions, starting with the outdoors measures. ""But the pandemic is not over. We will closely monitor the public health situation - this is a fast-moving and volatile variant, which could change suddenly. I urge everyone to continue to follow the rules and have your vaccines to keep Wales safe."" Wales,along with Scotland and Northern Irelandall brought in new Covid restrictions over Christmas because of a rapid rise in cases driven by the Omicron variant. England was the only UK nation thatdid not announce further rules. In Wales, it meant that from 26 December, sports fixtures were forced behind closed doors without spectators, andvolunteer Parkrun events were cancelled. Nightclubs were closed, and events were limited to a maximum of 50 people outdoors and 30 people indoors. Pubs and restaurants were also restricted to table service, with the rule of six in place, while workplaces and shops were required to impose social distancing measures. Both the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru had called for a roadmap out of restrictions, while the Welsh Rugby Union had been considering moving home fixtures for the Six Nations out of Wales. Speaking onBBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford denied the move to relax restrictions was a ""U-turn"", adding: ""Not at all. It's really the opposite of that. ""What we do in Wales is we follow the science, we follow the data. We make difficult decisions when that is necessary."" He added: ""What we are seeing is a very rapid decline of the number of cases in Wales. Last Friday in Wales it was 2,300 cases per 100,000 of the Welsh population, today, only a week later, it is only 1,200."" Mark Drakeford has rejected any suggestions of a U-turn in his approach to these restrictions - he insists the scientific advice he received suggested four weeks of tougher restrictions and he says today's announcement is in line with that time period. He also points out that the Covid numbers have dropped rapidly in the last week. The report from the Welsh government's Technical Advisory Cell before Christmas did talk about four weeks of restrictions, and numbers have plummeted, but it's also the case that we've seen an abrupt change in approach from Welsh ministers over the last couple of days. On Tuesday in the Senedd, in response to Welsh Tory demands for a plan out of alert level two, the first minister quoted modelling saying that ""the peak of the Omicron coronavirus wave has yet to be reached in Wales"", he talked about the number of people suffering from Omicron ""going up not coming down"" and he raised only a heavily caveated possibility of beginning to lift restrictions at the end of next week. At this time, the stats were showing a drop in cases, though Mr Drakeford said the change in the rules over testing meant it was difficult to know whether these were ""genuine falls"" or simply a result of fewer people getting PCR tests. By Thursday, the health minister was striking a much more optimistic note talking about ""very positive signs"" that Wales was ""possibly turning the corner"" on this wave and restrictions will now begin to be lifted this weekend. Today, the cautious tone remains, as you'd expect, but the dogmatism of last Friday's review - where those calling for an easing of restrictions were  described as ""fundamentally wrong"" - has been abandoned as has the pessimism of Tuesday's position. Wales' case rate has fallen to its lowest level since 26 December - 1,274.2 per 100,000 people over seven days. This decline is sooner - and deeper - than a modelled scenario presented only a week ago. Hospital numbers have fallen for two days in a row, although there are still on average a third more patients with confirmed Covid than the week before. It has also emerged that more than half of these patients were in hospital being treated for another primary condition. Numbers of Covid patients in critical care remain stable though and at 21% below the peak seen a year ago. The move to relax restrictions on pubs and restaurants has been welcomed, but there have been warnings that some businesses will struggle to recover after losing trade over the festive period. ""Every day of trading counts because everyone wants to trade their way to recover,"" said chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association Emma McClarkin. She saidon average pubs have lost about Â£16,000 during current restrictionsthat ""they won't recover"". Ms McClarkin said a lot of damage has been done in the period of closure over Christmas The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU)said it was ""delighted"" fans would be allowed for Wales' three Six Nations home gamesin February and March. Parkrun boss, Tom Williams, said he did not think his business should have been impacted in the last round of restrictions. He said: ""We have known since the beginning of the pandemic that physical activity and health are incredibly important when dealing with the Covid infection, and we have known for a while that outdoor environments are incredibly safe."" Meanwhile,Chester FC also fell foul of the restrictions on crowds at sports fixtures, with the four stands of the English club's Deva Stadium actually in Flintshire. Its Vice Chairman Jim Green said he was pleased the club's fans would be able to go to the next home game, but believed this should always have been the case. ""We're still determined to find a long-term solution,"" he said. Parkrun's Tom Williams did not think his business should have been affected in the last round of restrictions Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""I'm pleased they've finally listened to calls from the Welsh Conservatives. ""Despite the detailed scientific evidence from South Africa, Labour ministers clearly overreacted to Omicron, and that has caused significant pain and anguish for families and businesses in Wales. The move comes despite Mr Drakeford saying last Tuesday that Wales was ""in the teeth of the Omicron storm"". Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""If, as it seems, we are indeed at the peak, the right thing to do is see how we can safely respond. ""Raising the limit on outdoor sporting events would be an obvious place to start, moving as swiftly as the continuing improved picture allows in coming days, to lifting other restrictions such as those in hospitality."" Wales has now reached 81% of those eligible for boosters in the Covid vaccination programme, according to the latest figures from Public Health Wales. A total of 1,817,842 boosters were given out by 13 January.

N Korea hackers stole $400m crypto in 2021 - report,"North Korean hackers stole almost $400m (Â£291m) worth of digital assets in at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms last year, a report claims. Blockchain analysis company Chainalysis said it was one of most successful years on record for cyber-criminals in the closed east Asian state. The attacks mainly targeted investment firms and centralised exchanges. North Korea has routinely denied being involved in hack attacks attributed to them. ""From 2020 to 2021, the number of North Korean-linked hacks jumped from four to seven, and the value extracted from these hacks grew by 40%,""Chainalysis said in a report,external. The hackers used a number of techniques, including phishing lures, code exploits and malware to siphon funds from the organisations' ""hot"" wallets and then moved them into North Korea-controlled addresses, the company said. Cryptocurrency hot wallets are connected to the internet and cryptocurrency network and so are vulnerable to hacking. They are used to send and receive cryptocurrency, and allow users to view how many tokens they have. Many experts recommend moving large amounts of cryptocurrency not needed day-to-day to ""cold"" wallets, which are disconnected from the wider internet. Chainalysis said it is likely that many of last year's attacks were conducted by the so-called Lazarus Group, a hacking group which the US has applied sanctions against. The group is believed to be controlled by North Korea's primary intelligence bureau, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The Lazarus Group has previously been accused of involvement in the ""WannaCry"" ransomware attacks, the hacking of international banks and customer accounts and cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014. Massive cyber-attack hits 99 countries Sony Pictures computer system hacked The Lazarus heist: How hackers tried to steal $1bn ""Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out,"" the report on last year's cyber attacks added. A United Nations panel that monitors sanctions on North Korea has accused Pyongyang of using stolen funds to support its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes as a way to avoid international sanctions. Separately, in February last year, the US charged three North Korean computer programmers with a massive hacking spree aimed at stealing more than $1.3bn in money and cryptocurrency.

"Don't use refund firms for tax claims, says Which?","Using a company to help you claim a tax rebate could end up costing you hundreds of pounds extra according to consumer group Which? Dozens of firms online offer to help customers claim back tax they're owed by HM Revenue & Customs, for example, for the Marriage Allowance. But these third-party firms charge fees and take a percentage of the tax claim. Which? says most people are much better off going straight to HMRC themselves to avoid ""unnecessary bills"". Tax rebates are free to claim via HMRC, and the process is ""relatively simple"", but some firms are charging between a quarter and half of the final tax payment received in return for their services, Which? said. The consumer rights group has identified 208 firms with ""tax reclaim"", ""tax refund"", ""tax claim"" and ""tax rebate"" in their names. It found the term ""tax rebate"" gets more than 40,000 Google searches a month. Some of these third-party firms use similar branding and language to the HMRC, Which? said. Jenny Ross, Which? money editor, said their research showed huge numbers of people were coming into contact with firms hoping to persuade them to use their services to claim rebates, costing people ""potentially hundreds of pounds"". ""For most people with a rebate to claim, HMRC is the best port of call. Go to its website directly to ensure you aren't left footing any unnecessary bills,"" she said. HMRC waives fines again for late self-assessment Warning benefits will not keep up with rising prices One of the most common tax claims is for Marriage Allowance, Which? said, which allows one spouse to transfer 10% of their tax-free personal allowance to their partner if their partner earns less than the current personal allowance, and it can be backdated up to a total of Â£1,220. While firms are permitted to charge a ""reasonable amount"" for such services, Which? said it found one firm, Tax Credits Ltd, was charging a service fee of 48%. Tax Credits said: 'We spend a significant amount on marketing and providing access to this potential tax relief. In many cases it's our advertising, not HMRC's, that makes a person aware of it. ""We then present the claimant with a simple mechanism to access the potential overpayment of tax. Our remuneration is contingent on a repayment being secured, and the amount we retain is reflective of this,"" it added. Which? said customers who have been misled by websites into thinking they were dealing with the tax authority directly should make a complaint to the Citizens Advice Consumer Service.

Cricket must tackle racism 'or lose funding',"This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire The government should limit public funding for cricket unless there is ""continuous, demonstrable progress"" on eradicating ""deep-seated racism"", a parliamentary report has recommended. Azeem Rafiq gave emotional testimony last year to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee aboutracism he experiencedat Yorkshire. The committee's report was published on Friday, with chair Julian Knight MP describing Rafiq's story as ""typical of an endemic problem across the whole of cricket"". Yorkshire have been widely criticised for their handling of Rafiq's allegations. Former chairman Roger Hutton and chief executive Mark Arthur have resigned and 16 members of staff have been sacked. The committee said changes made by Lord Patel, who replaced Hutton in November, were a positive step but they alone ""could not eradicate racism"". ""This is a watershed for cricket,"" Knight said. ""Those who love and support the game are part of the solution and must play their part."" This video can not be played Racism in cricket: Azeem Rafiq 'encouraged' by parliamentary report Rafiq welcomed the report, adding that it also made clear the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) responsibilities in tackling racism in the sport. He said: ""The committee has listened and taken sensible action. It is absolutely brilliant that Julian Knight and his colleagues on the committee are going to hold the ECB to account. ""This shows just how seriously politicians are taking an issue that too many people in cricket ignored for so long. The committee understands how important it is to clean up the game. ""I'm glad that MPs will monitor any progress, so that the reforms needed to make the sport inclusive to all youngsters can happen soon."" Yorkshire face 'financial crisis' if international ban remains Listen to Around the Wicket - Yorkshire's Asian Cricket Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here TMS podcast: ECB chief Harrison reacts to DCMS report Responding to the report on Friday, ECB chief executiveTom Harrison saidhe welcomed the ""scrutiny""- and that he was ""very confident"" cricket would be able to ""demonstrate massive progress in this space"". Harrison agreed that a link between showing change and government funding was ""right and proper"". ""I'm very confident that in the not-so-distant future we can become an exemplar of the kind of behaviours that promote social integration and understanding,"" Harrison told BBC Sport. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Rafiq said Yorkshire should not be given Test cricket back ""indefinitely"" and should be ""kept under review for a good four or five years at least"". He said: ""There's two times the game's acted [on racism]. One is when their pockets have been hit or they've been embarrassed. So it's really important that we keep an eye on what's happening."" Rafiq described the start of his campaign for change as ""just a broken man speaking about his experiences"" and said: ""I just woke up and I just tried to keep fighting because I knew that if I didn't carry on doing that people forget it very quickly. ""I think there needs to now be a little bit of a shift into love and compassion. And if people are willing to change, then we need to support them."" Rafiq told the select committee in November that English cricket is ""institutionally racist"" and racist language was ""constantly"" used during his time as a player at Yorkshire. Knight said the MPs had been ""shocked"" by language used in correspondence they had received following the hearing. The report also made reference to stories in the media run to ""discredit"" Rafiq. ""It further established that eradicating racism from the game will be a long and difficult road,"" the report said. ""It does not matter if a whistleblower is of perfect moral character but whether the issue raised is valid. ""It is evident to us that there is a deep-seated issue of racism in cricket."" Knight again praised Rafiq's courage in speaking out about racism. MPs also heard from Hutton and representatives from the ECB, including chief executive Tom Harrison, during November's session. Harrison said English cricket wasnearing an emergencyover its failure to address racism, with the governing bodysubsequently publishing a five-point planto tackle the issue. ""Public funding for cricket must depend on real leadership and progress by the ECB to tackle abhorrent behaviour,"" Knight said. ""The government must make future funding conditional on the game cleaning up its act. ""We put the ECB on notice that we expect regular updates delivered to this committee on progress being made."" MPs recommended the ECB develop a set of ""key indicators"" to measure progress and then report back to the committee. They will also invite Yorkshire and the ECB to give evidence on their progress early in 2022. Knight told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that the long-term viability of the ECB itself could be questioned if they did not tackle racism. ""Any grants from Sport England or any form of governmental grant should be dependent upon the ECB showing that it has not just established these targets but is actively looking to achieve them,"" he added. ""If that also doesn't happen, we could potentially look at an option down the line of establishing an independent regulator. ""This is a key test of whether or not that should still remain the case."" Responding to the report,Lord Patelcalled Rafiq's testimony ""a watershed moment for the sport as a whole"" and added that Yorkshire were ""committed to ensuring that no-one endures the unacceptable experience that he did"". ADCMS spokespersonadded: ""We thank the select committee for its report into the disgraceful treatment of Azeem Rafiq by Yorkshire County Cricket Club and racism in the sport. ""We will now consider the report's recommendations and take further action if necessary."" Barry O'Brien, interim ECB chair, said: ""We welcome the committee's recommendations and we also embrace the ongoing scrutiny of the committee. We are determined to root out racism - and other forms of discrimination - from our sport. ""We had already taken important steps to make cricket more inclusive in recent years. We are deeply sorry for the pain people have suffered and recognise the courage it has taken to speak out. We are determined to make cricket a stronger, more welcoming sport."" Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of Sport England, said: ""The DCMS select committee's report highlights the powerful need for the ECB, the counties, and other cricketing stakeholders to reform and take action to end structural racism in the sport. ""Sport England's funding is explicitly linked to the development and implementation of robust diversity and inclusion policies and plans. We have made that clear to the ECB, who have responded positively and constructively. ""Azeem Rafiq's powerful and personal testimony to the committee shows us that ultimately, the litmus test of progress will be the lived experiences of diverse communities and their involvement in the game. Until experiences like Azeem's are eradicated, the work to defeat racism in sport must continue."" Off-spinner Rafiq, who had two stints at Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, initially went public with his experiences in September 2020. Yorkshire launched a formal investigation the same month and received the findings in August 2021. However, the club did not release the report, despite being asked to by the ECB. They instead released a statemen admitting Rafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" - something he said was downplaying racism - and offered him their ""profound apologies"". Following further criticism, Yorkshire received a summary of the findings, which said seven of Rafiq's 43 allegations had been upheld. They concluded no-one at Yorkshire would face disciplinary action but the club were heavily criticised by pundits and MPs, with a number of sponsors withdrawing from their deals. Rafiq and other individuals were then asked to speak to the DCMS committee in November. This video can not be played Yorkshire chairman 'very confident' ban on hosting England games will be lifted Patel has made a number of changes since taking over at Yorkshire, including setting up a whistleblowing hotline - which Knight said had received around 50 complaints - reviewing procedures and policies at the club and settling an employment tribunal with Rafiq. In December, 16 members of staff, including director of cricket Martyn Moxon and first-team coach Andrew Gale, were sacked. Former Yorkshire and England pace bowler Darren Gough has since been appointed director of cricket until the end of the 2022 season, while former England bowlers Ryan Sidebottom and Steve Harmison have joined the coaching staff on an interim basis. However, the club are still banned from hosting England matches by the ECB. Patel told BBC Sport on Wednesday he was confident the ban on hosting England matches would be lifted, while Rafiq has also said Yorkshire ""deserve"" to have games at Headingley. ""In the last two months, Yorkshire have made significant progress in our efforts to rebuild, and I am heartened that the committee considers that there is room for optimism in what we have achieved,"" Patel said in a statement on Friday. ""We share that optimism and have made some real improvements, but we are only at the start of this long and important journey. ""Azeem Rafiq's testimony was a watershed moment for the sport as a whole, and we are committed to ensuring that no-one endures the unacceptable experience that he did.""

N Korea hackers stole $400m crypto in 2021: Report,"North Korean hackers stole almost $400m (Â£291m) worth of digital assets in at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms last year, a report claims. Blockchain analysis company Chainalysis said it was one of most successful years on record for cyber-criminals in the closed east Asian state. The attacks mainly targeted investment firms and centralised exchanges. North Korea has routinely denied being involved in hack attacks attributed to them. ""From 2020 to 2021, the number of North Korean-linked hacks jumped from four to seven, and the value extracted from these hacks grew by 40%,""Chainalysis said in a report,external. The hackers used a number of techniques, including phishing lures, code exploits and malware to siphon funds from the organisations' ""hot"" wallets and then moved them into North Korea-controlled addresses, the company said. Cryptocurrency hot wallets are connected to the internet and cryptocurrency network and so are vulnerable to hacking. They are used to send and receive cryptocurrency, and allow users to view how many tokens they have. Many experts recommend moving large amounts of cryptocurrency not needed day-to-day to ""cold"" wallets, which are disconnected from the wider internet. Chainalysis said it is likely that many of last year's attacks were conducted by the so-called Lazarus Group, a hacking group which the US has applied sanctions against. The group is believed to be controlled by North Korea's primary intelligence bureau, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The Lazarus Group has previously been accused of involvement in the ""WannaCry"" ransomware attacks, the hacking of international banks and customer accounts and cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures in 2014. Massive cyber-attack hits 99 countries Sony Pictures computer system hacked The Lazarus heist: How hackers tried to steal $1bn ""Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out,"" the report on last year's cyber attacks added. A United Nations panel that monitors sanctions on North Korea has accused Pyongyang of using stolen funds to support its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes as a way to avoid international sanctions. Separately, in February last year, the US charged three North Korean computer programmers with a massive hacking spree aimed at stealing more than $1.3bn in money and cryptocurrency.
