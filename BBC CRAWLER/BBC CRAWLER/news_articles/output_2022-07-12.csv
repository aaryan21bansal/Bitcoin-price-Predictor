Sir Mo 'relieved' Home Office won't take action,"This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo responds to the Home Office's response not to take action Sir Mo Farah has said he is relieved that the Home Office will not take action against him after he revealed he was trafficked into the UK. The Olympic star disclosed on Monday that his real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin, but he got British citizenship under the name Mohamed Farah. Mohamed Farah was the name given to him by the people who brought him into the UK illegally. The Home Office told BBC News it would not investigate Sir Mo. ""It makes me relieved,"" he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is my country. If it wasn't for [my PE teacher] Alan and the people who supported me throughout my childhood then maybe I wouldn't even have the courage to do this. ""There's a lot of people that I owe my life to - particularly my wife, who has been very supportive throughout my career, and who gave me the strength to come and talk about it, telling me it's okay to do this."" Sir Mo has received supportive messages from people across the world and he said the reaction to the revelations has been ""incredible"". ""It was always my story,"" he told Today. ""I wasn't even comfortable enough to talk about it with my family. I couldn't talk about it publicly. It has taken me a long time to come to this, but I'm glad I've made this documentary to show people the reality of what really happened to me as a child."" The Real Mo Farah Mo Farah reveals the truth about his childhood, the journey he made to the UK as a young boy, and the subsequent years that led to him winning two gold medals at the 2012 Olympics. Watch now on BBC iPlayer The Metropolitan Police said specialist officers were assessing the available information about what had happened to Sir Mo. In a statement, the force said ""at this time"" it had received no specific reports. The Met added that it believed there were victims of modern slavery, including children, ""in every borough across London"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo Farah describes calling his mother after years of separation Sir Mo's wife Tania said she experienced a ""whole range of emotions"" after hearing about his true background. ""My first reaction was heartbreak and sadness for him. I just immediately pictured nine-year-old Mo, and being so helpless and vulnerable. And then equally I felt angry at the people that did that to him, that put him through that,"" she said. She said Sir Mo is ""now finally giving himself permission to feel those feelings of hurt and painâ¦. this documentary has helped him to deal with that... It's got to be a good thing. It's a form of therapy."" Sir Mo Farah reveals he was trafficked to UK as child Sir Mo praised for trafficking disclosure Sir Mo describes being reunited with his mum Legally, the government can remove a person's British nationality if their citizenship was obtained through fraud. But a Home Office official told BBC News it would not take action over Sir Mo's nationality, as it is assumed children are not complicit when their citizenship is gained by deception. Speaking about other victims of child trafficking, Sir Mo - a four-time Olympic champion for Team GB - told BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Amol Rajan: ""No child wants to be in that situation. I had the choice made for me, and so young. I'm just grateful for every chance I've got in Britain to embrace my country, and I'm proud to represent my country the way I did. ""That's all I could do within my control - I had no control when I was younger over where I went. That decision was made for me and taken away from me."" Sir Mo told the story of being trafficked in a documentary from BBC and Red Bull Studios, which airs on Wednesday but has been seen by BBC News. Confiding in teacher Alan Watkinson about his plight was a key moment in Sir Mo's life As a teenager Sir Mo said he confided in his PE teacher, who helped him to be fostered by another family. The teacher also helped him to obtain British citizenship and a passport so that Sir Mo could compete in international athletics competitions. After receiving widespread praise for speaking out, Sir Mo told the Today programme: ""I'm just happy to share what I've gone through and [has] made me the man I am today."" Sir Mo told the documentary that he wanted to tell his story to challenge public perceptions of trafficking and slavery. ""I had no idea there was so many people who are going through exactly the same thing that I did. It just shows how lucky I was,"" he says. ""What really saved me, what made me different, was that I could run."" The woman who brought Sir Mo to London has been approached by the BBC for comment, but has not responded. Asked by Today if he was in touch with the woman or had heard from her, Sir Mo said: ""The [documentary's] production team contacted the lady and she didn't want to say anything, and that's all I know. I'm not in touch with her and I don't want to be."" You can watch The Real Mo Farah on BBC One at 21:00 BST oron BBC iPlayerat 06:00 BST on Wednesday 13 July (UK only).

"Generations of children exploited, inquiry finds","The report found agencies dismissed reports of child exploitation as ""child prostitution"". Obvious evidence of child sex crimes in Telford was ignored for generations leading to more than 1,000 girls being abused, an inquiry has found. Agencies blamed children for the abuse they suffered, not the perpetrators, and exploitation was not investigated because of ""nervousness about race"". The inquiry was set up after theSunday Mirror revealed gangs had been abusing girls in the town since the 1980s,external. Chairman Tom Crowther QC said the abuse had thrived unchecked for decades. His report makes 47 recommendations for improvement by agencies involved. West Mercia Police has apologised ""unequivocally"" for past events as has Telford & Wrekin Council. Street pastors have reported seeing men in cars approaching girls as they left pubs and nightclubs. The report found agencies dismissed reports of child exploitation as ""child prostitution"". Mr Crowther said: ""The overwhelming theme of the evidence has been the appalling suffering of generations of children caused by the utter cruelty of those who committed child sexual exploitation. ""Victims and survivors repeatedly told the inquiry how, when they were children, adult men worked to gain their trust before ruthlessly betraying that trust, treating them as sexual objects or commodities. This video can not be played Telford inquiry: Survivor says her abusers 'hold no power' ""Countless children were sexually assaulted and raped. They were deliberately humiliated and degraded. They were shared and trafficked. They were subjected to violence and their families were threatened. ""They lived in fear and their lives were forever changed. They have asked, over the years: how was this allowed to happen?"" Other key report findings include: Teachers and social workers being discouraged from reporting abuse Offenders becoming ""emboldened"" by the absence of police action, with abuse continuing for years without concerted response Exploitation was not investigated because of nervousness about race, that investigating concerns against Asian men, in particular, would inflame ""racial tensions"" Even after an investigation leading to seven men being jailed for child sex crimes West Mercia Police and Telford & Wrekin Council scaled down their specialist teams ""to virtual zero"" in order to save money Seven men were jailed in 2012 following Operation Chalice, an investigation into child sexual exploitation The investigation was known as Operation Chalice and saw two Telford brothers among those jailed. A court heard the brothers sexually abused, trafficked and prostituted, or tried to prostitute, four teenagers between March 2008 and December 2009. The report found the most common way children were exploited was through a ""boyfriend"" model, where a child would meet a man, who would persuade them to become his girlfriend. Perpetrators, it said, sought out ""vulnerable"" children and would begin giving them lifts, buying them food, alcohol or cigarettes which led to the children becoming involved in sexual activity with the men as a ""favour"" as payment for the gifts. 'There were lots of adults, nobody asked questions' Telford child abuse inquiry: What do we know? Telford to commission child abuse probe Most of those responsible for the abuse did not use contraception and ""pregnancies were expected to be (and in many cases were) terminated."" Some of those abused went on to bear the perpetrator's children. In several cases, victims received death threats against them or their families if they tried to end the abuse. Lucy Lowe was 14 when she became pregnant by taxi driver Azhar Ali Mehmood The report references the case ofLucy Lowe, 16,who died along with her 17-year-old sister and mother in a house fire started by Azhar Ali Mehmood, 26, the father of her daughter. She had become pregnant at 14 to Mehmood. The report continued to say children were often abused in nightclubs and takeaways with witnesses also describing a ""rape house"" in Wellington, Telford, to which young people were taken. Within schools, it said, there was a ""reluctance"" to report concerning activity without ""concrete proof"" which was an ""overly cautious approach"", while ""obvious"" indicators like absences and changes in behaviour went unremarked by school staff. The report said, in the most recent figures from the first six months of 2020, police received 172 referrals related to child exploitation. The ""dreadful, life altering crime has not gone away - in Telford or elsewhere,"" the report said. It also outlines recent police evidence of ""an unacceptable, and quite frankly offensive attitude"", towards child abuse victims, with ""disparaging language being used"". The report said the crime ""has not gone away - in Telford or elsewhere"" In his statement, Mr Crowther said he looked back as far as 1989 to draw his conclusions, but had heard from victims exploited as long ago as the 1970s. ""I saw references to exploitation being 'generational'; having come to be regarded as 'normal' by perpetrators and inevitable by victims and survivors some of whose parents had been through similar experiences,"" he said. He urged agencies to accept the recommendations made in the report and hoped the report ""goes some way"" to giving a voice to the survivors. If you have been affected by anything in this report, support is available through theBBC's Action Line. Mr Crowther recommended the formation of a joint review team to publish an annual report on child abuse in Telford. Following the inquiry's publication, survivor Joanne Phillips, who gave evidence said: ""Victims were being identified as child prostitutes. Once you have been convicted that label will never leave you. ""Prosecutions are damaging to your life. ""Some children went to prison for not paying the fines. Convictions should be completely expunged. ""Today I feel incredibly proud of the girls in Telford....I cannot express enough how proud I am for seeing this through and their resilience and bravery."" Lucy Allan MP described the report as ""damning and devastating"" Lucy Allan, the MP for Telford, who has been campaigning on the issue since 2016, said: ""Today is a very important day for victims and survivors of CSE, not just in Telford but right across the country because this report is damning, it is devastating. ""There are clear patterns that existed well before this report was commissioned that people knew about CSE, we had had high profile court cases in Telford and we should have taken learnings from that and we quite clearly didn't. ""The saddest thing is that victims and survivors, their voices weren't heard, they weren't taken seriously and that should never have happened."" The report's recommendations should be adopted by local authorities around the country, she said. Telford & Wrekin Council said it has made 'significant improvement' in recent years Telford and Wrekin Council has said it ""apologises wholeheartedly"" to the victims. ""Child sexual exploitation is a vile crime that disgusts us and all right thinking people. ""The independent inquiry acknowledges we have made significant improvements in recent years."" It said it was working to provide support for victims and it was already carrying out many of the inquiry's recommendations. West Mercia Police issued an apology to survivors Assistant Chief Constable Richard Cooper, of West Mercia Police, said he would like to say sorry to the survivors and all those affected in Telford. ""While there were no findings of corruption, our actions fell far short of the help and protection you should have had from us, it was unacceptable, we let you down. It is important we now take time to reflect critically and carefully on the content of the report and the recommendations that have been made,"" he said. He said the force now has teams dedicated to preventing and tackling child exploitation and works better together with organisations to safeguard children. The Inquiry was set up three years ago after several criminal prosecutions brought the problems to light. The chairman, Tom Crowther QC, heard evidence from dozens of survivors of abuse. Countless children were sexually assaulted and raped. They were deliberately humiliated and degraded. They were shared and trafficked. They were subjected to violence and their families were threatened. They lived in fear and their lives were forever changed. They have asked, over the years: how was this allowed to happen?"" The answer, Mr Crowther believes, is the authorities had ignored obvious signs of child exploitation; had blamed the children and not the perpetrators, and in many cases wouldn't investigate cases because of ""nervousness about race"". West Mercia Police and the council scaled down their specialist child sexual exploitation teams to virtually zero - to save money. By 2015 the provision from both had in some ways gone back almost a decade. Two police investigations - Operation Chalice in 2012 and Operation Vapour in 2019 - led to 10 men of south Asian descent being convicted of sexual offences against young girls . But the inquiry has spoken to victims of exploitation from many more communities. West Mercia Police and Crime Commissioner, John Campion, said victims and survivors had been let down. ""I cannot say with absolute certainty, just because lessons have been learnt, that it will never happen again. ""However, my drive as PCC remains resolute to ensure the system, that is there to keep people safe, continues building on the progress that has been made."" Shropshire Council, which neighbours Telford & Wrekin said these crimes are ""happening right across the country"". It said awareness of the crime is now ""far greater"" and it has ""safeguards"" in place to help people living in the area. The Rev Keith Osmund-Smith, is part of the Street Pastors in Telford, a group of volunteers who work to help keep people safe while out at night. While working as West Mercia Police's chaplain, he went on sabbatical after he told a national newspaper he doubted if information passed to West Mercia Police officers about child sex exploitation was always acted on. He waslater reinstated. Keith Osmund-Smith says abuse is still going on He said he was glad matters raised had been addressed after being concerned police and local authority were not seeing young people as ""victims"". ""At ground level police officers were very concerned about what was going on but there was almost a cost-cutting exercise in the councilâ¦and also in the police where it became too expensive,"" he said. ""It is still happening and there is still no room for complacency, I think we are much better equipped to deal with it."" Mark Berry reported concerns seen at a night time cafe in Wellington Mark Berry formerly ran a project which operated a night cafe from a Methodist church in Wellington and street teams operating around nightclubs, supporting vulnerable people, including young girls. ""They would come into the cafe or we would talk to them outside and we began to hear stories about why they felt vulnerable, particularly on the streets, that there were groups of guys who were, what we would call now, grooming them, offering them gifts, wanting to take them to parties, things like that,"" he said. He said the staff would see men in cars approaching girls as they left pubs and nightclubs. ""These guys weren't going into the clubs, they weren't part of the normal night time life, the entertainment life, it felt like they were specifically there for this purpose,"" he said. He said girls would tell them how they felt ""vulnerable"", ""hassled"" and ""harassed"", which they reported to the police officers who they now know were heading up the Operation Chalice inquiry. Mr Berry said Telford had ""pulled together"" in the wake of investigations into exploitation Mr Berry said the town had ""pulled together"" in the wake of the investigation and added the inquiry was ""crucial"" for understanding what had happened. ""There needs to be justice and there needs to be resolution for the victims and for the wider community and people want that to happen,"" he said.

Twitter sues Elon Musk over $44bn purchase deal,"Twitter is suing billionaire Elon Musk to try to force him to buy the social media firm, setting up a legal battle with the world's richest man. It comes after Mr Musk announced he waswalking away from his proposed $44bn (Â£37bn) takeoverof Twitter on Friday. He claimed Twitter had not given information about the number of fake and spam accounts on the platform. Now Twitter has asked a Delaware court to order Mr Musk to complete the merger at the agreed $54.20 per Twitter share. ""Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, [Mr] Musk apparently believes that he - unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law - is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away,"" said the lawsuit. The lawsuit went on to accuse Mr Musk of ""a long list"" of violations of the merger agreement that ""have cast a pall over Twitter and its business"". Twitter chairman Bret Taylortweeted,externalthat the microblogging site wanted ""to hold Elon Musk accountable to his contractual obligations"". Mr Musktweeted,externalon Tuesday: ""Oh the irony lol [laughing out loud]."" The lawsuit said Mr Musk, who is also boss of electric car company Tesla, had backed out of the deal because it ""no longer serves his personal interests"". The lawsuit said that after Mr Musk agreed to the deal, the stock market fell, along with Tesla shares. ""The value of Mr Musk's stake in Tesla, the anchor of his personal wealth, has declined by more than $100bn from its November 2021 peak. So [Mr] Musk wants out,"" it said. ""Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, [Mr] Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders,"" it added. Who is Elon Musk? Why did Musk get cold feet on Twitter? Twitter's share price has fallen more than 8% in the past month, and in May tumbled from highs of more than $50 per share, as Mr Musk questioned the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter and said the deal was ""temporarily on hold"". On Friday, Mr Musk said he was pulling out of the deal, claiming a lack of information about spam accounts and inaccurate representations amounted to a ""material adverse event"". He also said Twitter sacking executives meant it was not living up to its obligations. In response, Twitter said it planned to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement, saying it was ""committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr Musk"". The original merger agreement includes a $1bn break-up fee. Elon Musk is a man who is being dragged, reluctantly, up the aisle. The lawsuit uses the word ""consummation"" 55 times. Mr Musk says he no longer wants to buy the company. But in contract law, that's easier said than done. In reality he has already entered into a legally binding agreement with Twitter which may be difficult to unpick. And this lawsuit confirms that Twitter is hellbent on forcing the marriage to go ahead. The price Mr Musk agreed to pay for the company is considerably more than its current valuation. It's now down to Mr Musk to prove that Twitter is in breach of contract - a tough ask. The world's richest person is now faced with the bizarre prospect of having to buy a company he doesn't want to acquire. There are other possible outcomes here too. Mr Musk could of course win, which would be a devastating blow for the social media firm. But this could also be the first move in a game of chess, an analogy that Elon Musk seeminglyreferenced in a tweet last week,external. Twitter could be pushing for a settlement, a lump sum for them to agree to walk away. Mr Musk could also be looking for a revised, better price for Twitter. But whatever happens Elon Musk, by getting a little too close to Twitter, has tied himself in legal knots. Mr Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist"", had pledged to loosen Twitter's content moderation rules once the company was under his ownership. He has been a vocal critic of Twitter banning some accounts, such as that of former US President Donald Trump. Mr Musk has also called for more transparency over how the platform presents tweets to users - a system that currently allows some to be promoted and given wider audiences. Twitter shares rose by more than 4% in New York on Tuesday and added 1% in after-hours trade. However the shares are still around $20 lower than Mr Musk's offer price of $54.20.

Boohoo starts charging shoppers for returns,"Fashion firm Boohoo has become the latest retailer to charge shoppers who return items. Customers must now pay Â£1.99 to return products, with the cost deducted from their refund. The move,first reported by Retail Week,external, came into effect on 4 July. Boohoo blamed the move on the rising cost of shipping. High Street firms such as Uniqlo, Next and Zara already charge for online returns. Online shopping boomed in the pandemic, but customers are more likely to return items bought online than in store, raising costs for retailers. Analysts said other retailers were likely to follow suit in charging for returns. 'Iâll buy five items and only keep one of them' Boohoo hit as shoppers return more clothes Asos shoppers return more as rising prices hit ""Shoppers have had an easy ride, but that's changing now - they will increasingly find there's a price to pay for returns,"" said Catherine Shuttleworth, retail expert and founder of Savvy Marketing. ""The costs, both financially and environmentally, have been stacking up for retailers... So retailers have been tightening up their returns policy by reducing the number of days a shopper can keep an item before expecting a return and in some cases charging a return fee,"" she added. ""We can expect to see this trend continuing and [now] we've seen Boohoo quietly introduce it. If you buy something for Â£10 at Boohoo, it's a real disincentive to return it if you lose Â£2, 20% of your investment to send it back."" Online shopping gained a lot of ground during the pandemic, with a big increase in the number of items being sent back. For fashion retailers, returns can be costly. Not only do retailers often cover the costs of online returns as a way of winning customers from rivals, but it also takes longer for warehouse staff to process returned stock. Many shoppers are also becoming more aware of the environmental impact of deliveries and returns. In May, Boohoo said soaring returns werepartly to blame for a slump in its annual profits. It said customers had returned items faster than expected in the second half of the year, with the rate higher than it was before the pandemic. Boohoo's brands include BoohooMan, Karen Millen, Nasty Gal, PrettyLittleThing, Coast, Misspap, Oasis, Warehouse, Burton, Wallis, Dorothy Perkins and Debenhams. A spokesperson from Boohoo said: ""As the cost of shipping has increased, we've had to look at where we can adapt without compromising what our customers love most, the convenience of shopping with us and the great value that our brands offer. ""This has meant that we will be applying a charge of Â£1.99 to returns so that we can continue to offer great prices and products and do this in a more sustainable way.""

'Unhinged' White House meeting in 6 Jan spotlight,"A committee investigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol has resumed in Washington The hearing has focused on a tweet from former President Trump sent in December in which he promised the 6 January protest would be ""wild"" On that day, supporters of the former president stormed the Capitol building in a bid to thwart the certification of Joe Biden's election victory The tweet followed what was described as an âunhingedâ meeting among Trump allies who pushed baseless election claims A former White House lawyer said one plan discussed was to seize voting machines to overturn the 2020 election Tuesday's hearing is seeking to make a link between extremist groups such as the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys and Donald Trump's associates Trump has previously called the Democrat-led committee âillegally-constitutedâ and a âkangaroo court"" Edited by Gareth Evans Our live coverage from the seventh public hearing of the Capitol riot committee has come to a close. Here are some of the highlights:  Follow updates to this story here. This live page was brought to you by Sam Cabral, Bernd Debusmann, Nadine Yousif - with Gareth Evans editing. Once the committee ends its public hearings, many expect that the Department of Justice (DOJ) will take up the legislative mantle and prosecute those responsible for planning and promoting the Capitol attack. Susan Corke, director at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, says the committee has forged ""a blueprint"" to do just that. The Intelligence Project has provided testimony to the Committee, and it's also closely tracked the activities of far-right groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. Speaking to the BBC's The Context programme, Corke said Tuesday's hearing had âprovided the public with very clear linksâ
between the Trump campaign, Trumpâs tweets, and the riot. ""I think it could be
reasonably assumed that he understood that by calling people to DC - and
knowing they had weapons - that it was a call to violence,"" she said. ""I certainly don't think it's something [the DOJ] can ignore."" ""I've heard the
criticism that the Department of Justice is not moving quickly enough, but I
would note that this is a very complex case,"" she added. ""The committee did an
excellent job of showing the steps that led up to January 6."" Tara McKelveyIn the hearing room Stephen Ayres, a former Trump supporter who
pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for his actions on 6 January, stunned people
in the hearing room when he approached two of the officers who were injured in
the riot. One of the officers, Harry Dunn, described their exchange. âIt
wasnât a hug,â Dunn tells me. âHe touched my shoulder. He
apologised.â Dunn shook his head several
times and looked uncertain, if not downright sceptical. âIâm trying to
process it,â he says. For Ayres, the effort to make amends seemed to be a
heartfelt gesture and a step towards healing. For Dunn, the outpouring of
emotion was a surprise, and perhaps not one that was entirely welcome, at least
in that moment. Barbara Plett Usherin Washington Witness  - and former Trump supporter - Stephen Ayres told the
committee he left the Capitol riot when the president finally posted
a tweet asking his supporters to go home. I saw the impact of that tweet myself on the day. I was standing on a low wall in front of the Capitol building next
to a young man in combat fatigues who was broadcasting Trump's
video message to the crowd on a megaphone. When it finished he shouted into the megaphone: ""You
heard him! Trump is your commander in chief! He says go home! So Go
Home!"" Mike WendlingBBC anti-disinformation unit Proud Boys Enrique Tarrio (L) and Joe Biggs (R) at a December 2020 protest in Washington Todayâs hearing also highlighted the key role of a group of ultra-nationalists known as the Proud Boys. Formed in 2016 by Canadian-British far-right activist Gavin
McInnes, they bill themselves as a fraternal organisation. But that description
leaves out the groupâs rather crucial role in American political violence. From their inception, Proud Boys regularly went to battle
against far-left antifa activists in cities including Portland, Berkeley and
New York. Theyâre pro-gun, anti-immigration and the âBoysâ is literal
â no women need apply. After McInnes stepped down, the group was led by Enrique
Tarrio, a businessman and former law enforcement informant from Florida. Tarrio wasnât at the 6 January riot, having been arrested
two days earlier for burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a church.
But the Proud Boys were out in force on the day, and Mr Tarrio and four other
Proud Boys have been charged with seditious conspiracy. The hearing has now ended. In closing, today's lead questioner Jamie Raskin says the committee has revealed that Donald Trump's true legacy is ""American carnage"". ""The Watergate break-in was like a cub scout meeting compared to these events,"" he adds. Committee vice-chair Liz Cheney says the final hearings next week will reveal how - as the attack on the Capitol was under way - Trump did not use the power at his disposal to call off the mob of rioters. She adds that a witness, who she did not name and who is yet to speak at the hearings, had been contacted by Trump. ""This committee has supplied that information to the Justice Department,"" says Cheney, who has raised concerns of witness tampering over the course of the hearings. âWe will take any effort to influence witness testimony very seriously.â Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter Itâs been a central argument of the 6 January committee that Donald
Trump knowingly set the stage for the violence when he told his supporters to
march to the Capitol and that his silence as it unfolded help the situation to
spiral out of control. In Tuesdayâs hearing, the committee presented evidence on both counts.
Committee member Stephanie Murphy explained that Trump ad-libbed key lines
in his 6 January speech at a rally near the White House. He added specific
condemnations of Vice-President Mike Pence and told his supporters to be
strong, to fight like hell and to march to the Capitol. That last part was not
in his scripted speech, but the committee showed text indicating rally-goers,
including militants, knew he was going to say that days in advance. Trumpâs speech, Democratic Representative Stephanie Murphy said, was âbuilt on a foundation of liesâ. âHe lied to his supporters that the election was stolen,â the
congresswoman from Florida continued. âHe stoked their anger. He called for
them to fight for him. He directed them to the US Capitol. He told them he
would join them. And his supporters believed him and many headed towards the
Capitol. As a result, people died, people were injured, many of his supportersâ
lives will never be the same.â One of those supporters was a man named Stephen Ayers, who testified to
the committee that he entered the Capitol because Trump told him to and only
exited because Trump, after hours of violence, told his supporters to leave. If he had spoken out earlier, he said, âmaybe we wouldnât be in
this bad of a situationâ. Chairman Bennie Thompson says today's live witnesses exemplify the crowd that rioted at the Capitol on 6 January: ""Both far-right extremists and ordinary Trump supporters swept up in the madness."" Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesman for the Oath Keepers, describes the group as violent, dismissive of the rule of law, and capable of swaying people through lies and deceit. He says the group - which he left before the Capitol attack - viewed themselves as a paramilitary outfit. ""We got exceedingly lucky that we did not have more bloodshed,"" Tatenhove testifies. Stephen Ayres, who was charged with disorderly conduct for entering the Capitol, calls himself ""a family man"" who fell ""hardcore into social media"" and grew upset over Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election. ""I felt like I needed to be down here,"" he says, adding that ""everybody"" around him believed the president would join them in their march to the Capitol. After Trump ""riled"" people up with his rally speech, Ayres says: ""We basically just followed what he said."" The committee hears that Ayres - who lost his job and sold his home after his arrest - no longer supports Trump or believes the election was stolen, and is ""mad"" the ex-president continues to lie. Stewart Rhodes in early 2021 The Oath Keepers, one of the extremist groups that participated in the 6 January riot, are a far-right, extremist organisation founded in 2009 by Stewart Rhodes, a Harvard-educated lawyer and former US Army paratrooper. The US-based Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has characterised the group as ""a large but loosely organised collection of right-wing anti-government extremists"" united in the belief that the US government has been ""co-opted by a shadowy conspiracy that is trying to strip American citizens of their rights"". The group is believed to largely focus on former members of the US military and ex-police officers. While the organisation has existed for years, it became particularly prominent in 2020 when it repeatedly clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters in various parts of the country. ""While there is a formal national leadership, on the local level many Oath Keepers are essentially selfâorganised, and form official, semiâofficial or informal groupings of Oath Keepers,"" the ADL notes on its website. In January, Rhodes was among 11 people charged with seditious conspiracy in relation to the 6 January riot. The committee has revealed evidence it claims ties those close to ex-President Trump with those who stormed the Capitol. Photos show members of the far-right Oath Keepers militia apparently on the security details of, or accompanying, Trump advisers Michael Flynn and Roger Stone. Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes is shown calling publicly for the president to institute martial law, and for members of the group to protest in their state capitals if they could not come to Washington. And in a private communication, rally organiser Ali Alexander says: ""Trump is supposed to order us to the Capitol at the end of his speech."" Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is shown the day prior to the attack, telling listeners on his show to ""strap in"" because ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow"". Trump spoke with Bannon twice on the day of the riots, White House logs shown by the committee reveal. Tara McKelveyIn the hearing room A note for Capitol Police at the hearings On a day focused on violent extremism, people in
the hearing room, many of whom were at the Capitol on 6 January, listened with
solemn expressions. Threatening messages flashed on a screen as part of the hearing - some calling for
blood. Officers in the back of the room had stony faces, and one woman crossed her arms
tightly and leaned back as if to protect herself. For many here, memories of
the siege are recent and searing. Here's some of what we've learned in the first hour of testimony: Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter Trump supporters near the Capitol on 6 January 2021 The members of the 6 January committee are facing the same challenge
House impeachment managers confronted in Donald Trumpâs February 2021
impeachment trial. How do they draw a conclusive line between the former
president and the rioters who breached the Capitol? Back then, the House managers cited Trumpâs overheated rhetoric at
the rally near the White House earlier that day. They pointed to his
months-long efforts to undermine the 2020 election results and to stir up his
baseâs anger about the results. They detailed his apparent inaction as the
attack was unfolding, culminating with the video in which he told his
supporters to go home, but added âwe love you; youâre very specialâ and the
ominous tweet warning that âthese are the things and events that happenâ when
âgreat patriotsâ have been treated badly and unfairly. The 6 January committee has added to this record, revealing that members
of the presidentâs inner circle were concerned about the potential for violence
days before the Capitol was breached. In her headline-grabbing testimony,
former White House aide Cassidy Hutchison recounted how Trump knew some of
his supporters on 6 January were armed and equipped with military gear â and
didnât care. Not caring about the potential for violence, however, is different than
being directly engaged in its planning or execution, at least when it comes to
criminal culpability. And while the 6 January committee may still be gathering
evidence, there has been no proof of the latter so far. The committee is attempting to draw a direct line between a Donald Trump tweet from December 2020 in which he called, for the first time, for a rally to coincide with the day Congress would meet to certify the election results. ""Be there, will be wild,"" it read. Committee member Jamie Raskin notes that one rally organiser would soon register the website domain wildprotest.com as part of his planning efforts. Prominent right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is seen on video rallying supporters that ""the time for games is over, the time for action is now"". Another right-wing personality says the rally on 6 January will be a ""red wedding"" - a pop culture reference to a scene of mass slaughter in HBO's Game of Thrones drama. The committee has just returned from a brief recess. It is now expected to turn its attention to the actions of extremist groups in the days leading up to, and on, the day of the Capitol riot. The panel will hear from Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesman for the far-right Oath Keepers. The group's leader Stewart Rhodes and 10 other members have been charged with seditious conspiracy - a US civil war-era charge that carries up to 20 years in prison - over their roles in the Capitol attack. Also testifying today will be Stephen
Ayres, a Trump supporter from Warren, Ohio who pleaded guilty last month to disorderly and
disruptive conduct for entering the Capitol that day. Barbara Plett Usherin Washington The description of a ""surprise, unhinged"" meeting at the White House on 18 December is just the latest window into the chaos in
Trumpâs post-election orbit revealed by these hearings. Last week, we
heard about Trump throwing his lunch against the wall and a White House aide
wiping up the dripping ketchup. Today we heard
about a screaming match between Trumpâs White House advisors and some of his
personal lawyers whoâd managed to get into the Oval Office and were proposing
outlandish schemes to âproveâ election fraud. ""They
were attacking me verbally and I was just asking a simple question, where is
the evidence?"" said Pat Cipollone. âThere were people shouting at each other, hurling insults at each
other,â said Derek Lyons, former White House staff secretary, ânot just people
sitting on a couch chit chatting.â Pat Cipollone's testimony is filling in the details of a meeting in mid-December 2020, in which ex-President Trump discussed strategies to overturn the election. In the Oval Office with Trump were informal advisers pushing unfounded theories about a stolen election, he says. Cipollone and another White House counsel Eric Herschmann interrupted the meeting and joined the discussion in order to push the trio to provide evidence for their claims. They ""forcefully [attacked] me verbally"", Cipollone says. Tara McKelveyin the hearing room When the
subject of Patrick Byrne, a former CEO of Overstock.com, comes up, one woman,
dressed in a pink scarf and holding a notebook in the back of the hearing room,
shakes her head in dismay: âMm-hmm,â she mutters disapprovingly. Like others in
the hearing room, she believes it was unwise for Trump to be meeting with
Byrne, a controversial figure who had a romantic relationship with a woman
accused of being a Russian spy. And when a former White House lawyer said on
videotape that he was appalled to see Byrne in the Oval Office, recalling how
he asked Byrne: âWho are you?â, the woman listening to his testimony and
several others in the back of the room laughed outright. The story of the
presidentâs actions, at least in this version, is so outlandish, they seemed to
say, all they could do is laugh. In a series of Twitter posts as the hearing began, the Republicans in the US House of Representatives repeatedly criticised the work of the committee, characterising it as a political ""witch-hunt"". In one post, the House Republicans linked to a CNN video showing interviews with US voters, along with the caption: ""The American people are not concerned with [Democratic House] Speaker Pelosi's illegitimate political witch-hunt."" ""They see it for what it truly is,"" the post added. ""A distraction"". A second post referred to the committee as a ""kangaroo court"". Another tweet, posted earlier on Tuesday, noted that session leader Jamie Raskin had previously objected to certifying the results of the 2016 election that saw Donald Trump come to power.

Sri Lanka's president flees country on military jet,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled Sri Lanka ahead of his expected resignation as president President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled Sri Lanka on a military jet, amid mass protests over the island's economic crisis. The country's air force confirmed the 73-year-old flew to the Maldives with his wife and two security officials. The president has pledged to resign by Wednesday, but an official resignation letter is yet to be received. In the president's absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as acting president. Mr Wickremesinghe declared a state of emergency and told the military to restore order as protesters stormed his office and demanded that he also resign. Mr Rajapaksa's departure ends a family dynasty that has dominated Sri Lanka's politics for the past two decades. The president had been in hiding after crowds stormed his residence on Saturday, andhad pledged to resign on Wednesday. His arrival in the Maldives, an island chain south-west of Sri Lanka, led to protests there too, with some urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing president. A source told the BBC that Mr Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also left Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? How Sri Lanka's dramatic day unfolded Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? As Sri Lankans awoke to the news of Mr Rajapaksa's departure, thousands of people took to the streets of the capital, Colombo. Many gathered at Galle Face Green, the city's main protest site. Some listened to fiery speeches at a makeshift stage set up for ordinary people to take the mic. Punctuated by cries of ""Victory to the struggle"", the rallying cry of the protest movement, speakers railed against a government and the leaders they feel have failed them. Police fired tear gas to disperse a group of protesters near the prime minister's office, but they managed to storm the office and other state buildings. In an earlier televised address, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he had ordered the military to do ""whatever is necessary to restore order"". ""We can't tear up our constitution. We can't allow fascists to take over. We must end this fascist threat to democracy,"" he said. But many protesters say they will continue their demonstrations until both leaders have resigned from government. Some demonstrators were furious about Mr Rajapaksa's departure, seeing a lack of accountability. ""We don't like it. We want to keep him. We want our money back! And we want to put all the Rajapaksas in an open prison where they can do farm work,"" said protester GP Nimal. But 23-year-old university student Reshani Samarakoon told the BBC that the former president's exile offered ""hope that in the future we can eventually become a developed country, economically and socially"". One of the demonstrators in Colombo delivers a speech to the crowd Sri Lankans blame President Rajapaksa's administration for their worst economic crisis in decades. For months they have been struggling with daily power cuts and shortages of basics like fuel, food and medicines. The leader, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, is believed to have wanted to flee abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new administration. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters storm Sri Lankan president's palace in Colombo, swam in the pool and set the PM's house on fire Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo What a fall from grace for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa - for so long such a major figure in Sri Lanka. Few expected that matters would ultimately go this way. As the former defence chief he oversaw the military operations in the controversial war against the Tamil Tiger rebels that ended in 2009. He is accused of human rights abuses during the war and also targeting those who dissented, but he has always denied those accusations. The Rajapaksa family has dominated Sri Lankan politics for two decades, and with strong backing from the Sinhala Buddhist majority, Gotabaya became president in 2019. His departure is a remarkable victory for the protesters who came to the streets to express their anger against the mismanagement of the economy and the escalating cost of living. The president's departure threatens a potential power vacuum in Sri Lanka, which needs a functioning government to help start digging it out of financial ruin. Politicians from other parties have been talking about forming a new unity government but there is no sign they are near agreement yet. It's also not clear if the public would accept what they come up with. Under the constitution, it's Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who should act in the president's stead if the latter resigns. The prime minister is considered the president's deputy in parliament. However, Mr Wickremesinghe is also deeply unpopular. Protesters set fire to his private residence on Saturday - he and his family were not inside - and he said he would resign to make way for a unity government, but gave no date. That leaves the parliament's speaker as the next most likely to step in as caretaker president, constitutional experts say. But Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena is an ally of the Rajapaksas, and it is unclear whether the public would accept his authority. Whoever does become acting president has 30 days to hold an election for a new president from among members of parliament. The winner of that vote could then see out the remainder of Mr Rajapaksa's term until late 2024. Inside the presidential palace now full of Sri Lankans The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' On Monday, the main opposition leader SajithPremadasa told the BBC he would be tilting for the presidency. But he also lacks public support and there is deep public suspicion of politicians in general. The protest movement which has brought Sri Lanka to the brink of change also does not have an obvious contender for the country's leadership.

"Ukraine claims arms depot attack with US rocketsKyiv hails another strike by the Himars system, but Russian-backed officials say civilians were involved.Europe","Russian reports said several people were killed in the attack and that dozens of people had been left homeless Ukraine's military says it has destroyed a Russian ammunition depot in the southern city of Nova Kakhovka, killing dozens of soldiers, in an attack apparently involving US-supplied missiles. However, Russian occupation officials say homes and warehouses were hit, leaving seven dead and up to 80 hurt. It was not possible to verify the extent of damage or casualties. Unconfirmed footage of several powerful explosions was shared on social media. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak attributed the attack to the US-supplied Himars multiple rocket launcher and spoke of a ""reality collision"" for the world's ""second army"". A Russian-installed official in the southern Kherson region, Katerina Gubareva, accused Ukraine of bombing ""peaceful cities with American weapons"". Himars is far more accurate than Russia's equivalent systems and is already being credited with a string of recent attacks deep into Russian-held territory. Large areas of the Kherson region were seized by the Russians in the first weeks of the invasion, but Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive while Russia has focused on its military push into Ukrainian territory in the east. Kyiv has urged residents to leave the area to escape the counter-attack. Russian-appointed officials made no mention of an arms depot being hit but said instead that warehouses containing the mineral fertiliser saltpetre had exploded - a claim ridiculed by Ukrainian officials. Russian reports said warehouses for aid or mineral fertiliser were hit, disputing Ukrainian accounts Vladimir Leontyev, who was put in charge of the Kherson region, told the Russian Tass news agency that dozens of residents had been left homeless and the city significantly damaged. Another Russian-backed official, Kirill Stremousov, said seven people were still listed as missing. Details of who was caught up in the explosions were unclear, but Ukrainian military officials said more than 50 Russian soldiers were killed and military hardware destroyed. A spokesman in Odesa, Serhiy Bratchuk, said Nova Kakhovka was now ""minus"" its ammunition depot. While Russian claims of damage to civilian buildings could not be confirmed, both sides agreed a Himars launcher had played a part in the attack. The first M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) arrived in Ukraine at the end of June and were immediately linked to explosions at Russian ammunition depots and command centres as far as 70km from the front line. Russian TV said Monday night's attack was so powerful that windows within a 2km-radius (1.25 miles) had blown out, flats had been destroyed, and hospitals and a market damaged. Russia has regularly accused Ukraine of targeting its own civilians. The Russian Ria Novosti agency published footage of what it said was damaged warehouses from a humanitarian aid centre. Ukrainian local official Serhiy Khlan rejected as propaganda Russian claims that a hospital and residential buildings had been destroyed. Mr Khlan appealed to residents to avoid the areas under attack, asserting that those whose windows had been blown out were happy as they realised Ukrainian forces were close. Allow Twitter content?

Nine people have been rescued from the rubble. The southern city of Mykolaiv was hit early on Tuesday morning, leaving 12 people wounded. Residential buildings in Mykolaiv were damaged and officials said 12 people were wounded BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford said windows had been blown out in the main hospital building in the city as well as nearby flats.

Breaking|Breaking newsTwitter sues Elon Musk over $44bn purchase dealTwitter sues billionaire Elon Musk in an attempt to force through his $44bn deal to buy the social media giant.Business,"Twitter is suing billionaire Elon Musk to try to force him to buy the social media firm, setting up a legal battle with the world's richest man. It comes after Mr Musk announced he waswalking away from his proposed $44bn (Â£37bn) takeoverof Twitter on Friday. He claimed Twitter had not given information about the number of fake and spam accounts on the platform. Now Twitter has asked a Delaware court to order Mr Musk to complete the merger at the agreed $54.20 per Twitter share. ""Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, [Mr] Musk apparently believes that he - unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law - is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away,"" said the lawsuit. The lawsuit went on to accuse Mr Musk of ""a long list"" of violations of the merger agreement that ""have cast a pall over Twitter and its business"". Twitter chairman Bret Taylortweeted,externalthat the microblogging site wanted ""to hold Elon Musk accountable to his contractual obligations"". Mr Musktweeted,externalon Tuesday: ""Oh the irony lol [laughing out loud]."" The lawsuit said Mr Musk, who is also boss of electric car company Tesla, had backed out of the deal because it ""no longer serves his personal interests"". The lawsuit said that after Mr Musk agreed to the deal, the stock market fell, along with Tesla shares. ""The value of Mr Musk's stake in Tesla, the anchor of his personal wealth, has declined by more than $100bn from its November 2021 peak. So [Mr] Musk wants out,"" it said. ""Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, [Mr] Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders,"" it added. Who is Elon Musk? Why did Musk get cold feet on Twitter? Twitter's share price has fallen more than 8% in the past month, and in May tumbled from highs of more than $50 per share, as Mr Musk questioned the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter and said the deal was ""temporarily on hold"". On Friday, Mr Musk said he was pulling out of the deal, claiming a lack of information about spam accounts and inaccurate representations amounted to a ""material adverse event"". He also said Twitter sacking executives meant it was not living up to its obligations. In response, Twitter said it planned to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement, saying it was ""committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr Musk"". The original merger agreement includes a $1bn break-up fee. Elon Musk is a man who is being dragged, reluctantly, up the aisle. The lawsuit uses the word ""consummation"" 55 times. Mr Musk says he no longer wants to buy the company. But in contract law, that's easier said than done. In reality he has already entered into a legally binding agreement with Twitter which may be difficult to unpick. And this lawsuit confirms that Twitter is hellbent on forcing the marriage to go ahead. The price Mr Musk agreed to pay for the company is considerably more than its current valuation. It's now down to Mr Musk to prove that Twitter is in breach of contract - a tough ask. The world's richest person is now faced with the bizarre prospect of having to buy a company he doesn't want to acquire. There are other possible outcomes here too. Mr Musk could of course win, which would be a devastating blow for the social media firm. But this could also be the first move in a game of chess, an analogy that Elon Musk seeminglyreferenced in a tweet last week,external. Twitter could be pushing for a settlement, a lump sum for them to agree to walk away. Mr Musk could also be looking for a revised, better price for Twitter. But whatever happens Elon Musk, by getting a little too close to Twitter, has tied himself in legal knots. Mr Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist"", had pledged to loosen Twitter's content moderation rules once the company was under his ownership. He has been a vocal critic of Twitter banning some accounts, such as that of former US President Donald Trump. Mr Musk has also called for more transparency over how the platform presents tweets to users - a system that currently allows some to be promoted and given wider audiences. Twitter shares rose by more than 4% in New York on Tuesday and added 1% in after-hours trade. However the shares are still around $20 lower than Mr Musk's offer price of $54.20.

Himars is far more accurate than Russia's equivalent systems and is already being credited with a string of recent attacks deep into Russian-held territory. Large areas of the Kherson region were seized by the Russians in the first weeks of the invasion, but Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive while Russia has focused on its military push into Ukrainian territory in the east. Kyiv has urged residents to leave the area to escape the counter-attack. Russian-appointed officials made no mention of an arms depot being hit but said instead that warehouses containing the mineral fertiliser saltpetre had exploded - a claim ridiculed by Ukrainian officials. Russian reports said warehouses for aid or mineral fertiliser were hit, disputing Ukrainian accounts Vladimir Leontyev, who was put in charge of the Kherson region, told the Russian Tass news agency that dozens of residents had been left homeless and the city significantly damaged. Another Russian-backed official, Kirill Stremousov, said seven people were still listed as missing. Details of who was caught up in the explosions were unclear, but Ukrainian military officials said more than 50 Russian soldiers were killed and military hardware destroyed. A spokesman in Odesa, Serhiy Bratchuk, said Nova Kakhovka was now ""minus"" its ammunition depot. While Russian claims of damage to civilian buildings could not be confirmed, both sides agreed a Himars launcher had played a part in the attack. The first M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) arrived in Ukraine at the end of June and were immediately linked to explosions at Russian ammunition depots and command centres as far as 70km from the front line. Russian TV said Monday night's attack was so powerful that windows within a 2km-radius (1.25 miles) had blown out, flats had been destroyed, and hospitals and a market damaged. Russia has regularly accused Ukraine of targeting its own civilians. The Russian Ria Novosti agency published footage of what it said was damaged warehouses from a humanitarian aid centre. Ukrainian local official Serhiy Khlan rejected as propaganda Russian claims that a hospital and residential buildings had been destroyed. Mr Khlan appealed to residents to avoid the areas under attack, asserting that those whose windows had been blown out were happy as they realised Ukrainian forces were close. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, Russia's bombardment of Ukrainian cities has claimed further lives. The number killed in Saturday's attack on a five-storey block of flats in the eastern town of Chasiv Yar has risen to 45, including one child, local officials say. Nine people have been rescued from the rubble. The southern city of Mykolaiv was hit early on Tuesday morning, leaving 12 people wounded. Residential buildings in Mykolaiv were damaged and officials said 12 people were wounded BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford said windows had been blown out in the main hospital building in the city as well as nearby flats. There were multiple holes in the ground and shrapnel damage at the scene, she said, from what looked like cluster bombs: ""People tell me it was the heaviest night of shelling they remember.""

Sir Mo 'relieved' Home Office won't take actionIt comes after Sir Mo Farah revealed he was trafficked to the UK as a child.UK,"This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo responds to the Home Office's response not to take action Sir Mo Farah has said he is relieved that the Home Office will not take action against him after he revealed he was trafficked into the UK. The Olympic star disclosed on Monday that his real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin, but he got British citizenship under the name Mohamed Farah. Mohamed Farah was the name given to him by the people who brought him into the UK illegally. The Home Office told BBC News it would not investigate Sir Mo. ""It makes me relieved,"" he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is my country. If it wasn't for [my PE teacher] Alan and the people who supported me throughout my childhood then maybe I wouldn't even have the courage to do this. ""There's a lot of people that I owe my life to - particularly my wife, who has been very supportive throughout my career, and who gave me the strength to come and talk about it, telling me it's okay to do this."" Sir Mo has received supportive messages from people across the world and he said the reaction to the revelations has been ""incredible"". ""It was always my story,"" he told Today. ""I wasn't even comfortable enough to talk about it with my family. I couldn't talk about it publicly. It has taken me a long time to come to this, but I'm glad I've made this documentary to show people the reality of what really happened to me as a child."" The Real Mo Farah Mo Farah reveals the truth about his childhood, the journey he made to the UK as a young boy, and the subsequent years that led to him winning two gold medals at the 2012 Olympics. Watch now on BBC iPlayer The Metropolitan Police said specialist officers were assessing the available information about what had happened to Sir Mo. In a statement, the force said ""at this time"" it had received no specific reports. The Met added that it believed there were victims of modern slavery, including children, ""in every borough across London"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo Farah describes calling his mother after years of separation Sir Mo's wife Tania said she experienced a ""whole range of emotions"" after hearing about his true background. ""My first reaction was heartbreak and sadness for him. I just immediately pictured nine-year-old Mo, and being so helpless and vulnerable. And then equally I felt angry at the people that did that to him, that put him through that,"" she said. She said Sir Mo is ""now finally giving himself permission to feel those feelings of hurt and painâ¦. this documentary has helped him to deal with that... It's got to be a good thing. It's a form of therapy."" Sir Mo Farah reveals he was trafficked to UK as child Sir Mo praised for trafficking disclosure Sir Mo describes being reunited with his mum Legally, the government can remove a person's British nationality if their citizenship was obtained through fraud. But a Home Office official told BBC News it would not take action over Sir Mo's nationality, as it is assumed children are not complicit when their citizenship is gained by deception. Speaking about other victims of child trafficking, Sir Mo - a four-time Olympic champion for Team GB - told BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Amol Rajan: ""No child wants to be in that situation. I had the choice made for me, and so young. I'm just grateful for every chance I've got in Britain to embrace my country, and I'm proud to represent my country the way I did. ""That's all I could do within my control - I had no control when I was younger over where I went. That decision was made for me and taken away from me."" Sir Mo told the story of being trafficked in a documentary from BBC and Red Bull Studios, which airs on Wednesday but has been seen by BBC News. Confiding in teacher Alan Watkinson about his plight was a key moment in Sir Mo's life As a teenager Sir Mo said he confided in his PE teacher, who helped him to be fostered by another family. The teacher also helped him to obtain British citizenship and a passport so that Sir Mo could compete in international athletics competitions. After receiving widespread praise for speaking out, Sir Mo told the Today programme: ""I'm just happy to share what I've gone through and [has] made me the man I am today."" Sir Mo told the documentary that he wanted to tell his story to challenge public perceptions of trafficking and slavery. ""I had no idea there was so many people who are going through exactly the same thing that I did. It just shows how lucky I was,"" he says. ""What really saved me, what made me different, was that I could run."" The woman who brought Sir Mo to London has been approached by the BBC for comment, but has not responded. Asked by Today if he was in touch with the woman or had heard from her, Sir Mo said: ""The [documentary's] production team contacted the lady and she didn't want to say anything, and that's all I know.

Breaking|Breaking newsSri Lanka's president flees the countryGotabaya Rajapaksa's departure follows mass protests in his country amid the island's worsening economic crisis.Asia,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled Sri Lanka ahead of his expected resignation as president President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled Sri Lanka on a military jet, amid mass protests over the island's economic crisis. The country's air force confirmed the 73-year-old flew to the Maldives with his wife and two security officials. The president has pledged to resign by Wednesday, but an official resignation letter is yet to be received. In the president's absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as acting president. Mr Wickremesinghe declared a state of emergency and told the military to restore order as protesters stormed his office and demanded that he also resign. Mr Rajapaksa's departure ends a family dynasty that has dominated Sri Lanka's politics for the past two decades. The president had been in hiding after crowds stormed his residence on Saturday, andhad pledged to resign on Wednesday. His arrival in the Maldives, an island chain south-west of Sri Lanka, led to protests there too, with some urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing president. A source told the BBC that Mr Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also left Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? How Sri Lanka's dramatic day unfolded Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? As Sri Lankans awoke to the news of Mr Rajapaksa's departure, thousands of people took to the streets of the capital, Colombo. Many gathered at Galle Face Green, the city's main protest site. Some listened to fiery speeches at a makeshift stage set up for ordinary people to take the mic. Punctuated by cries of ""Victory to the struggle"", the rallying cry of the protest movement, speakers railed against a government and the leaders they feel have failed them. Police fired tear gas to disperse a group of protesters near the prime minister's office, but they managed to storm the office and other state buildings. In an earlier televised address, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he had ordered the military to do ""whatever is necessary to restore order"". ""We can't tear up our constitution. We can't allow fascists to take over. We must end this fascist threat to democracy,"" he said. But many protesters say they will continue their demonstrations until both leaders have resigned from government. Some demonstrators were furious about Mr Rajapaksa's departure, seeing a lack of accountability. ""We don't like it. We want to keep him. We want our money back! And we want to put all the Rajapaksas in an open prison where they can do farm work,"" said protester GP Nimal. But 23-year-old university student Reshani Samarakoon told the BBC that the former president's exile offered ""hope that in the future we can eventually become a developed country, economically and socially"". One of the demonstrators in Colombo delivers a speech to the crowd Sri Lankans blame President Rajapaksa's administration for their worst economic crisis in decades. For months they have been struggling with daily power cuts and shortages of basics like fuel, food and medicines. The leader, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, is believed to have wanted to flee abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new administration. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters storm Sri Lankan president's palace in Colombo, swam in the pool and set the PM's house on fire Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo What a fall from grace for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa - for so long such a major figure in Sri Lanka. Few expected that matters would ultimately go this way. As the former defence chief he oversaw the military operations in the controversial war against the Tamil Tiger rebels that ended in 2009. He is accused of human rights abuses during the war and also targeting those who dissented, but he has always denied those accusations. The Rajapaksa family has dominated Sri Lankan politics for two decades, and with strong backing from the Sinhala Buddhist majority, Gotabaya became president in 2019. His departure is a remarkable victory for the protesters who came to the streets to express their anger against the mismanagement of the economy and the escalating cost of living. The president's departure threatens a potential power vacuum in Sri Lanka, which needs a functioning government to help start digging it out of financial ruin. Politicians from other parties have been talking about forming a new unity government but there is no sign they are near agreement yet. It's also not clear if the public would accept what they come up with. Under the constitution, it's Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who should act in the president's stead if the latter resigns. The prime minister is considered the president's deputy in parliament. However, Mr Wickremesinghe is also deeply unpopular. Protesters set fire to his private residence on Saturday - he and his family were not inside - and he said he would resign to make way for a unity government, but gave no date. That leaves the parliament's speaker as the next most likely to step in as caretaker president, constitutional experts say. But Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena is an ally of the Rajapaksas, and it is unclear whether the public would accept his authority. Whoever does become acting president has 30 days to hold an election for a new president from among members of parliament. The winner of that vote could then see out the remainder of Mr Rajapaksa's term until late 2024. Inside the presidential palace now full of Sri Lankans The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' On Monday, the main opposition leader SajithPremadasa told the BBC he would be tilting for the presidency. But he also lacks public support and there is deep public suspicion of politicians in general. The protest movement which has brought Sri Lanka to the brink of change also does not have an obvious contender for the country's leadership. Additional reporting by the BBC's Frances Mao, Yaroslav Lukov, Simon Fraser, Emily McGarvey and Alys Davies.

What taxes would rivals cut?,"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about."" So, what are the tax cuts being promised? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak row over recession warning in latest TV clash Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What has she pledged and how much would it cost? scrap April's National Insurance rise:Â£13bn a year cancel planned corporation tax rise:Â£17bn a year temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills (she claims this would knock ""around Â£150"" off energy bills):Â£8.5bn a year Total estimated cost:Â£38.5bn a year National Insurance(NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age. It is also paid by employers. Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? Reversing the NI rise would cost about Â£13bn a year,according to,externalthe IFS. Corporation taxis a tax on the profits of businesses. The tax rate is currently 19% but it is due to increase to 25% in April 2023. The government estimates that cancelling this rise would cost Â£17bn a year. However, the IFS points out that doesn't take into account whether lowering tax could lead to increased investment by companies. ""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"". Ms Truss hopes that extra investment would stimulate growth, although that would be difficult because the Bank of England says there is not currently much spare capacity in the economy, which means there is not a lot of scope for the production of more goods and services. Green levies The government makes energy companies add an environmental and social element on to energy bills. This pays for things like schemes to help fund renewable energy and provide grants for insulation. They make up about Â£153 of an average dual fuel bill, according to Ofgem. In 2020-21, the levies raised Â£12.2bn, of which about 70% (Â£8.5bn) went on environmental programmes. Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism. Why did Liz Truss U-turn over public sector pay? BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Paul Johnson said: ""I think we're going to struggle to avoid a recession and certainly you're not going to avoid a recession by doing what she seems to be suggesting, which is big tax cuts. That's more likely to stimulate inflation and create a bigger recession later on."" What has he pledged and how much would it cost? Reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero:Â£4.3bn a year Cut 3p off income tax by late 2029: aboutÂ£19bn a year Mr Sunak was chancellor until 5 July (when he resigned), so announcing wholesale changes to his own policies could be seen as politically problematic. He launched his leadership bid saying: ""Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."" The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s. Mr Sunak has promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero for one year from October, if average bills rise above Â£3,000 a year. At the moment, VAT costs Â£94 of an average bill. Mr Sunak claim his measure will save an average household Â£160 - although clearly it depends on how much the energy price cap rises by. The cost of the policy would be about Â£4.3bn for the year, depending again on how much prices rise. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Could VAT on gas and electricity be cut to zero? In May, Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a VAT cut, saying in Parliament: ""A flat rate payment has the benefit of being more progressive than VAT, which obviously gives very high, or higher, tax discounts to those who are particularly wealthy or have large houses and energy bills."" As Chancellor, he announced that all households in England, Scotland and Wales would receive Â£400 towards their fuel bills between October and March. Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut. He has not specified where the cuts in spending would be. He plans to go ahead with increases to corporation tax, but says he is planning to bring in ways to make it cheaper for companies to invest at the same time.

How will the new 20mph speed limit law work?,"If you are driving in Wales the speed limit has been cut from 30mph to 20mph Motorists in Wales now have to limit their speed to 20mph in built-up areas such as village and town centres. In 2022, the Seneddvoted to make Wales the first nation in the UK to adopt 20mphas the default speed limit on restricted roads. It started on 17 September, and has proved controversial - but how does it work? Here we try our best to answer your queries. Ken Skates was named as new transport secretary in March. The next month hesaid 20mph zones should be targeted at schools, hospitals and nurseries. He said there would be changes to the existing default 20mph speed limit in built-up areas with the ""voice of citizens at the heart of all we do"". On Tuesday 23 April, Mr Skates said the process of switching some 20mph roads back to 30mph would start in September. He claimedhe was ""refining""the project and urged people to contact councils to tell them which streets should be examined. But the Tories said the 20mph default limit would stay and nothing had changed. The 20mph limit has come into force for all restricted roads, which are defined as roads with lampposts placed not more than 200 yards (about 180m) apart. They are typically located in residential and built-up areas of high pedestrian activity. Minister banned from driving for speeding Children steer car off M4 after mum faints The 20mph limit began on 17 September 2023. The new law to make Wales the first nation to impose 20mph as the default on all restricted roads was passed by the Welsh Parliament in July 2022. The proposal,externalwas given the go-ahead by 39 votes to 15, afterinitial backingin the Senedd two years previously. The 20mph limit has come into force for all restricted roads The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 said it was not lawful to drive a on a restricted road at more than 30mph. That was later amended to 20mph. Would you pick pedal power over petrol? How easy is it to drive across Wales in an electric car? Enforcement began on 8 January, 2024, and roadside teams will use speed monitoring equipment to catch offending motorists. If you are pulled over doing more than 20mph in a built-up area in Wales you could, in theory, be fined a minimum Â£100 and get three penalty points. But police said their response will be proportionate and reasonable while drivers get used to the change as the focus for the first 12 months will be on education - as officers have a level of discretion. ""Where we find people driving above 20mph, we will stop drivers and speak to them about the dangers and risks about driving above the speed limit,"" said South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis. ""We won't be taking enforcement action against those people who are actually engaging with us and trying to bring their speed down - so they won't receive a fine. ""The people who will be fined will be those driving at the highest levels. Ultimately, if necessary, we will enforce - but that is always a last resort for us."" While police officers across Wales will initially be advised to use ""discretion"", all drivers will be fined if they are caught by a fixed speed camera. Receiving 12 or more points within three years may disqualify you from driving. Police in Wales have said they will try to educate and be reasonable with drivers adjusting to the 20mph speed limit If you are caught by a camera, depending on the speed, you will be sent an option for a speed awareness course, a fixed penalty notice or a letter telling you to go to court. If you are stopped by the police they can give you a verbal warning, send you a fixed penalty notice, offer a speed awareness course or order you to go to court. Instead of fines, speeding drivers will be offered the chance to watch a video about the dangers of speeding and the benefits of slowing down. Welsh government minister Lee Waters said there will be an ""education led"" approach to enforcement, as ""there's no incentive for us to fine because the money won't stay in Wales"". ""Police guidelines say enforcement will be targeted on drivers travelling 10% above the speed limit - plus 2mph,"" he said. ""For now this will be increased to 10% plus 4mph meaning we start to prosecute at 26mph in a 20mph limit."" As Mr Waters alluded to, the money collected from speeding fines in Wales goes to the UK government. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The money generated by 20mph speeding fines, as with all speeding fines, is directed to HM Treasury."" Speed limits in the Road Traffic Regulations and the Highway Code apply to motor vehicles only, and not to bicycles. But the Highway Code does state that cyclists should be considerate of other road users. The Welsh government has acknowledged the new lower limit is not appropriate everywhere and has said local authorities can make exceptions, though not outside schools. For example, Flintshire councilidentified 15 roadsthat could be exempt from the new policy. The Welsh government has produced aninteractive map,externalshowing the status of current and proposed exemptions to the 20mph speed limit. There has been a pilot scheme running in eight areas of Wales since 2021. They are St Dogmaels in Pembrokeshire, St Brides Major in the Vale of Glamorgan, Llanelli (north), Buckley in Flintshire, Cardiff (north), Cilfrew in Neath Porth Talbot, Abergavenny and Severnside (Caerwent, Caldicot, Magor and Undy) in Monmouthshire. Interim data shows the number of drivers complying with the 20mph speed limit rose from 45% at the start of the trial to 64%. Many areas of London now have 20mph as the default speed for residential roads, while Scotland plans to follow Wales' lead and make the policy nationwide by 2025. Many cities and towns across the UK now have 20mph zones as the norm for residential areas even if the local authority does not have a blanket policy across the whole area. The cost of bringing it in has been estimated at Â£33m. The Welsh Government said the Â£32.5m price tag was ""outweighed"" by reduced impact on the NHS and emergency services, which one study said could save Â£92m a year. The Welsh government said the direct financial cost of the policy falls ""almost entirely"" on its shoulders, and it is funding the capital works carried out by the local authorities through grants. Latestpolice data from 2022 show,externaled just over half - 51% - of the 4,442 people hurt in collisions in Wales happened on 30mph roads and in 23% of them, someone was killed or seriously injured. The total number of injuries fell by 23.5% compared to 2019. Campaigners argue the chances of someone surviving being hit by a car at 20mph rather than 30mph is seven times higher while stopping distances are almost halved. Ministers in the Senedd have been promoting sustainable travel - such as cycling or walking - after Walesdeclared a climate emergencyin 2019 and aims to becomecarbon net zero by 2050,external.

LiveLiveEight contenders in race for next PM after Javid pulls out8 minutes ago,"Eight candidates make it onto the ballot for the Conservative Party leadership contest Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi received the support of at least 20 MPs Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti withdraw from the contest just minutes before the deadline Candidates are pitching their bids to fellow Tory MPs at a closed hustings in Westminster. They each have 12 minutes to speak Successful contenders will go through to a vote on Wednesday, with the final two candidates selected before the end of next week The winner will be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates - please join us then. Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady announces top eight Tory leadership candidates Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative Party's 1922 Committee, which organises leadership contests, announces the names of the eight Conservative leadership contenders. They are Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi. Each has the backing of at least 20 fellow MPs. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti MP withdrew from the contest just minutes before the deadline. The first ballot and its result happen on Wednesday. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch MP has also been tweeting, sharing her gratitude after making it through to the final eight. Allow Twitter content?

The eight candidates are just about to start speaking at the first hustings in Parliament. They're getting 12 minutes each to try to persuade Conservative MPs they should be the one to take over as party leader and prime minister. They're going to be speaking in this order: Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Nadhim Zahawim and then Penny Mordaunt. We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid withdraws from the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader. He says: ""Serving in government is a true privilege. It has been just seven days since I took the difficult decision to resign from the most important job I have ever had, as health secretary during a pandemic."" ""Since then, I have set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country."" ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again."" ""There is an abundance of both ideas and talent in our party. One of the candidates will be given the honour of becoming prime minister."" ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Gary Speed's mum on sadness that never goes away,"This video can not be played Gary Speed's mother is urging people to open up about their mental health Gary Speed's mother has spoken at length about the sadness that ""never goes away,"" more than a decade after the ex-footballer took his own life. The former Wales manager was found dead at his home in November 2011. He was widely credited with reigniting Welsh football fortunes and setting them on the road to the 2022 World Cup. His mother Carol said she would never find the answer to why he died but urged others to talk about their mental health - and get help. ""It's just something that you don't ever get over at all,"" she said, speaking openly about the former Leeds, Newcastle and Everton midfielder in one of the first public interviews since he died. ""You know, you can smile and you can laugh, and you can have a good day, but it's always there. The sadness is always there."" Families bereaved by suicide ask for more help Football academies: A failed dream 'sends you to a dark place' Speed's parents Roger and Carol say they miss their son ""every day"" Now retired, Carol Speed still shares the modest semi-detached home in Deeside, Flintshire, where the Welsh sporting giant grew up with her husband Roger, Speed's father. Roger now lives with dementia, and Carol cares for him. They both still treasure the memories of their son captured in scores of photos, shirts and pennants adorning walls around the house. It is a shrine to a footballing star who was loved by both his family and fans, but will always remain 42. A star in the making - just two of the precious photographs Speed's parents still cherish Speed's road to success started early as a winning player for Deeside Primary Schools Outside, Carol has been joking about how a young Gary would constantly kick a ball against the garage door, so hard he broke it. The lush green lawn at the back of the house was once worn bare by the teen's kickabouts. The Aston Park field where Speed used to play has been renamed in his honour Not much more than a stone's throw from their front door stands the playground and field that marks Aston Park, where Speed honed his footballing skills with schoolmates. Today, a stone plinth and benchmark a memorialto Queensferry's lost hero. At an inquest 10 years ago, the coroner said he could not be satisfied Speed had intended to kill himself. He left behind his wife Louise and two sons, Tommy and Ed, who were just teenagers when he died. 2012 memorial game: Chris Coleman has stayed in touch with Carol after he succeeded Speed as Wales boss For Carol, questions about the death still haunt her. ""I'll never find the answer to why. That makes it doubly hard to live with,"" she said. ""You know, if people are ill and they die, then you know why, but we didn't. We just didn't know with Gary. ""No answers whatsoever - no. And that's hard - that's hard. Because we didn't have any idea he was feeling like that. Afraid to talk? Mental health and elite sports Tyson Fury: How do other sports support mental health? ""He never showed it. He was always smiling. ""We couldn't keep an eye on him, because we didn't think there was anything wrong."" Her son was ""always smiling"" and kept any mental health fears hidden away In words perhaps only a mother could utter, she added: ""If I'd had been there that evening it wouldn't have happened. No way - no way. ""Gary wasn't short of money, he had a nice house, a nice family - a job that he absolutely adored. So, if it can happen to someone like him, it can happen to anyone, can't it?"" The death of Gary Speed was marked by a national outpouring of grief, from supporters at his former clubs - Leeds, Newcastle, Everton, and Bolton - and, of course, the Wales national team. There was an outpouring from fans after Speed's death - here just one of the tributes at Leeds United ""He'd only just gone to Sheffield United, so I was shocked when he took the Welsh job,"" recalled Carol. ""He said: 'You don't turn your country down', you know. ""I'm just glad he did well with them, for the short time he was with them."" Wales World Cup 2022: Coleman on Speed's impact 'We'll go toe-to-toe with anyone' says Wales' Page She said while the entire family still struggles with the loss of the footballer, the support from fans a decade on remains ""unbelievable"". ""People are remembered on sort of anniversaries of their death and things like that, but there's always something going on about Gary. It is very touching. ""We always thought he was a good lad, he was our lad and we thought he was wonderful - but so did everybody else. ""I can't believe that people are still talking about him, really."" Speed is seen as laying the foundation for Wales to qualify for the 2022 World Cup However, it has taken Carol over a decade to be able to watch football again. She said she could always envisage her son on the pitch or touchline, and that had been unbearable. ""I couldn't watch football at all for 10 years and didn't want to know about football at all,"" said Carol. ""I'm enjoying it again now. I don't know whether I blamed football - I don't know."" It means she will be closely following Wales' progress as the side heads to Qatar for the World Cup. ""When I first started watching Wales again, it felt a bit strange, but I'm past that now,"" she added. Carol was also certain how her son would feel about qualification: ""He'd be over the moon. He'd be really, really into it, he would. I think that was his goal really. ""He wanted to get them there, definitely."" Qualified: Gareth Bale roars as Wales win through to the World Cup finals in Qatar It will be 11 years since his death when Wales walk out for their Group B games in Qatar in November, with the anniversary falling between matches against Iran and England. Speed's mother said discussions around mental health, especially for men, had undergone an important change since his death. ""It was never spoken about. It never even crossed my mind. I couldn't believe it when Gary did what he did. I was just numb. Huw Edwards says depression left him bedridden âI got PTSD after witnessing my daughterâs birthâ ""But it seems to have been all brought out since Gary, and people are not frightened to talk about it anymore."" She said the message was simple: ""Speak to someone even though it's hard. ""Because they had no idea what it does to the family. It just breaks people up, completely. ""It certainly has, our life. It's ruined our life completely.""

Ukraine claims arms depot attack with US rockets,"Russian reports said several people were killed in the attack and that dozens of people had been left homeless Ukraine's military says it has destroyed a Russian ammunition depot in the southern city of Nova Kakhovka, killing dozens of soldiers, in an attack apparently involving US-supplied missiles. However, Russian occupation officials say homes and warehouses were hit, leaving seven dead and up to 80 hurt. It was not possible to verify the extent of damage or casualties. Unconfirmed footage of several powerful explosions was shared on social media. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak attributed the attack to the US-supplied Himars multiple rocket launcher and spoke of a ""reality collision"" for the world's ""second army"". A Russian-installed official in the southern Kherson region, Katerina Gubareva, accused Ukraine of bombing ""peaceful cities with American weapons"". Himars is far more accurate than Russia's equivalent systems and is already being credited with a string of recent attacks deep into Russian-held territory. Large areas of the Kherson region were seized by the Russians in the first weeks of the invasion, but Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive while Russia has focused on its military push into Ukrainian territory in the east. Kyiv has urged residents to leave the area to escape the counter-attack. Russian-appointed officials made no mention of an arms depot being hit but said instead that warehouses containing the mineral fertiliser saltpetre had exploded - a claim ridiculed by Ukrainian officials. Russian reports said warehouses for aid or mineral fertiliser were hit, disputing Ukrainian accounts Vladimir Leontyev, who was put in charge of the Kherson region, told the Russian Tass news agency that dozens of residents had been left homeless and the city significantly damaged. Another Russian-backed official, Kirill Stremousov, said seven people were still listed as missing. Details of who was caught up in the explosions were unclear, but Ukrainian military officials said more than 50 Russian soldiers were killed and military hardware destroyed. A spokesman in Odesa, Serhiy Bratchuk, said Nova Kakhovka was now ""minus"" its ammunition depot. While Russian claims of damage to civilian buildings could not be confirmed, both sides agreed a Himars launcher had played a part in the attack. The first M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) arrived in Ukraine at the end of June and were immediately linked to explosions at Russian ammunition depots and command centres as far as 70km from the front line. Russian TV said Monday night's attack was so powerful that windows within a 2km-radius (1.25 miles) had blown out, flats had been destroyed, and hospitals and a market damaged. Russia has regularly accused Ukraine of targeting its own civilians. The Russian Ria Novosti agency published footage of what it said was damaged warehouses from a humanitarian aid centre. Ukrainian local official Serhiy Khlan rejected as propaganda Russian claims that a hospital and residential buildings had been destroyed. Mr Khlan appealed to residents to avoid the areas under attack, asserting that those whose windows had been blown out were happy as they realised Ukrainian forces were close. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, Russia's bombardment of Ukrainian cities has claimed further lives. The number killed in Saturday's attack on a five-storey block of flats in the eastern town of Chasiv Yar has risen to 45, including one child, local officials say. Nine people have been rescued from the rubble. The southern city of Mykolaiv was hit early on Tuesday morning, leaving 12 people wounded. Residential buildings in Mykolaiv were damaged and officials said 12 people were wounded BBC correspondent Sarah Rainsford said windows had been blown out in the main hospital building in the city as well as nearby flats. There were multiple holes in the ground and shrapnel damage at the scene, she said, from what looked like cluster bombs: ""People tell me it was the heaviest night of shelling they remember.""

Sri Lanka leader due to quit after mass protests,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled Sri Lanka ahead of his expected resignation as president President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled Sri Lanka on a military jet, amid mass protests over the island's economic crisis. The country's air force confirmed the 73-year-old flew to the Maldives with his wife and two security officials. The president has pledged to resign by Wednesday, but an official resignation letter is yet to be received. In the president's absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as acting president. Mr Wickremesinghe declared a state of emergency and told the military to restore order as protesters stormed his office and demanded that he also resign. Mr Rajapaksa's departure ends a family dynasty that has dominated Sri Lanka's politics for the past two decades. The president had been in hiding after crowds stormed his residence on Saturday, andhad pledged to resign on Wednesday. His arrival in the Maldives, an island chain south-west of Sri Lanka, led to protests there too, with some urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing president. A source told the BBC that Mr Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also left Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? How Sri Lanka's dramatic day unfolded Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? As Sri Lankans awoke to the news of Mr Rajapaksa's departure, thousands of people took to the streets of the capital, Colombo. Many gathered at Galle Face Green, the city's main protest site. Some listened to fiery speeches at a makeshift stage set up for ordinary people to take the mic. Punctuated by cries of ""Victory to the struggle"", the rallying cry of the protest movement, speakers railed against a government and the leaders they feel have failed them. Police fired tear gas to disperse a group of protesters near the prime minister's office, but they managed to storm the office and other state buildings. In an earlier televised address, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he had ordered the military to do ""whatever is necessary to restore order"". ""We can't tear up our constitution. We can't allow fascists to take over. We must end this fascist threat to democracy,"" he said. But many protesters say they will continue their demonstrations until both leaders have resigned from government. Some demonstrators were furious about Mr Rajapaksa's departure, seeing a lack of accountability. ""We don't like it. We want to keep him. We want our money back! And we want to put all the Rajapaksas in an open prison where they can do farm work,"" said protester GP Nimal. But 23-year-old university student Reshani Samarakoon told the BBC that the former president's exile offered ""hope that in the future we can eventually become a developed country, economically and socially"". One of the demonstrators in Colombo delivers a speech to the crowd Sri Lankans blame President Rajapaksa's administration for their worst economic crisis in decades. For months they have been struggling with daily power cuts and shortages of basics like fuel, food and medicines. The leader, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, is believed to have wanted to flee abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new administration. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters storm Sri Lankan president's palace in Colombo, swam in the pool and set the PM's house on fire Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo What a fall from grace for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa - for so long such a major figure in Sri Lanka. Few expected that matters would ultimately go this way. As the former defence chief he oversaw the military operations in the controversial war against the Tamil Tiger rebels that ended in 2009. He is accused of human rights abuses during the war and also targeting those who dissented, but he has always denied those accusations. The Rajapaksa family has dominated Sri Lankan politics for two decades, and with strong backing from the Sinhala Buddhist majority, Gotabaya became president in 2019. His departure is a remarkable victory for the protesters who came to the streets to express their anger against the mismanagement of the economy and the escalating cost of living. The president's departure threatens a potential power vacuum in Sri Lanka, which needs a functioning government to help start digging it out of financial ruin. Politicians from other parties have been talking about forming a new unity government but there is no sign they are near agreement yet. It's also not clear if the public would accept what they come up with. Under the constitution, it's Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who should act in the president's stead if the latter resigns. The prime minister is considered the president's deputy in parliament. However, Mr Wickremesinghe is also deeply unpopular. Protesters set fire to his private residence on Saturday - he and his family were not inside - and he said he would resign to make way for a unity government, but gave no date. That leaves the parliament's speaker as the next most likely to step in as caretaker president, constitutional experts say. But Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena is an ally of the Rajapaksas, and it is unclear whether the public would accept his authority. Whoever does become acting president has 30 days to hold an election for a new president from among members of parliament. The winner of that vote could then see out the remainder of Mr Rajapaksa's term until late 2024. Inside the presidential palace now full of Sri Lankans The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' On Monday, the main opposition leader SajithPremadasa told the BBC he would be tilting for the presidency. But he also lacks public support and there is deep public suspicion of politicians in general. The protest movement which has brought Sri Lanka to the brink of change also does not have an obvious contender for the country's leadership.

Heathrow tells airlines not to sell summer ticketsThe airport limits the number of passengers who can depart each day as it struggles to cope with demand.Business,"Heathrow Airport has told airlines to stop selling summer tickets, as the UK's biggest airport struggles to cope with the rebound in air travel. The airport is limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000, 4,000 fewer than currently scheduled. The cap on passenger numbers will be in place from now until 11 September. Thousands of UK travellers have been affected by disruption in recent weeks, including last-minute cancellations. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for holidays has returned. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up. Consumer group Which? urged Heathrow to clarify which flights would be cancelled as a result of the latest announcement. ""While this cap may ease the unacceptable chaos passengers are facing at the UK's biggest airport, thousands of people will now be worrying about whether their flight or holiday plans are about to fall apart,"" said Guy Hobbs, acting editor of Which? Travel. ""Heathrow must work with airlines to quickly provide clarity on which flights are being cut, and airlines need to be upfront with those passengers affected about their right to be rebooked at the earliest opportunity, including on services from other airlines."" A Heathrow spokesperson said it would take ""a couple of days"" for airlines to work with the scheduling company, Airport Coordination Limited, to decide what changes would be needed. Heathrow cuts flights and warns more could come Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Ministers told carriers to review their plans after chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff. In addition, a temporary government ""amnesty"" to the rules on airport slots was put in place, allowing airlines to change their summer schedules without facing a potential penalty. But despite this, Heathrow said airlines were still planning to operate flights carrying more daily passengers than could be processed in an acceptable manner. ""Over the past few weeks, as departing passenger numbers have regularly exceeded 100,000 a day, we have started to see periods when service drops to a level that is not acceptable: long queue times, delays for passengers requiring assistance, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late, low punctuality and last-minute cancellations,"" said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye. ""Our assessment is that the maximum number of daily departing passengers that airlines, airline ground handlers and the airport can collectively serve over the summer is no more than 100,000. ""The latest forecasts indicate that even despite the amnesty, daily departing seats over the summer will average 104,000 - giving a daily excess of 4,000 seats. On average only about 1,500 of these 4,000 daily seats have currently been sold to passengers, and so we are asking our airline partners to stop selling summer tickets to limit the impact on passengers."" But Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association and a former head of British Airways (BA), was sharply critical of Heathrow's move. ""To tell airlines to stop selling - what a ridiculous thing for an airport to say to an airline,"" Mr Walsh told Reuters. ""I am surprised Heathrow have not been able to get their act together better than this. Airlines have been predicting stronger traffic than Heathrow has been predicting... they clearly got it completely wrong."" He added: ""Heathrow are trying to maximise the profitability that they get from the airport at the expense of airlines."" It's a painful admission for Heathrow - but one that could be considered inevitable. The airport has been struggling to cope with a surge in passengers, following the removal of Covid-related travel restrictions. The results haven't been pretty. Long queues, delays, last-minute cancellations, busloads of orphaned bags and plenty of very angry travellers. Staff shortages have been a key problem - although Heathrow places most of the blame on airlines for failing to bring in enough ground handling workers. But some airline people tell a very different story. They claim Heathrow drastically underestimated passenger numbers, despite plenty of warnings, and accuse the airport of ""terrible mismanagement"". It has even been suggested Heathrow deliberately ""lowballed"" its passenger forecasts, as part of a campaign for permission to raise charges on airlines. Heathrow isn't alone in introducing restrictions.Gatwick imposed a lid on daily flights several weeks ago. But its move looks set to cause further aggravation for travellers during what has already become a pretty miserable summer. Heathrow'spassenger numbers have continued to riseas it recovers from the pandemic. But they are still below pre-coronavirus levels, when the airport saw roughly 110,000 to 125,000 daily departures. Mr Holland-Kaye apologised to passengers whose travel plans might be affected by the move. ""But this is the right thing to do to provide a better, more reliable journey and to keep everyone working at the airport safe."" Virgin Atlantic said it ""stands ready to deliver its full schedule this summer"". ""However, we support proactive measures being taken by Heathrow to reduce disruption, as long as action proposed does not disproportionately impact home carriers at the airport. ""Action should be based on thorough analysis showing the most effective measures to improve the situation and keep customers moving."" Are you concerned about booking a holiday?

Lego pulls out of Russia 'indefinitely'The Danish toymaker says it will end its partnership with a company which runs its 81 shops.Business,"Lego, the Danish toymaking giant, has said it will stop operating in Russia indefinitely due to ""continued extensive disruption"". The firmstopped delivering products to Russia in March,externalfollowing the invasion of Ukraine, but its shops remained open as most rival retailers pulled out. Lego said it would now end its partnership with Inventive Retail Group which runs 81 shops on Lego's behalf. It did not mention Russia's invasion of Ukraine for pulling out of Russia. A spokeswoman for Lego said: ""When the Lego Group stopped shipments to Russia in early March, we also ceased all commercial activity and put almost all our employees on extended leave."" The company said it was cutting most of its Moscow-based team and has ""provided 70 employees with financial packages to support them as they look for new opportunities"". Lego is one of a handful of Western brands that remained in Russia after other major companies shut their sites following the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine which was launched on 24 February. Some companies sold their products through franchisees in Russia and had to unwind complex partnerships with third party firms. McDonald's announced in May that it would close its sites in Russia which were later sold to a local company. The restaurants were ""de-arched"" and rebranded ""Tasty and that's it"". Unlike a number of companies who have condemned Russia, Lego has decided not to directly comment on the country's actions. In March, Lego said: ""Our thoughts are with all the children and families suffering as a result of the war in Ukraine."" A few years ago, the Danish company provoked a backlash when it emerged that it refused to sell a bulk order of its plastic bricks to the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Ai had used Lego to create portraits of dissident figures who had been jailed or exiled, such as Nelson Mandela, in the US and had planned a similar exhibition in Australia. However, he said Lego had told the museum in Melbourne its bricks could not be used for art containing ""any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements"". The decision was widely condemned andLego ended up changing its policy. In the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of Western firms which initially suspended business in Russia are now deciding to pull out altogether. US sportswear giant Nike and coffee chain Starbucks have both now retreated entirely from the Russian market, after suspending trading there in March. Car firm Renault has also sold its business in the country. The French firm said its 68% stake in carmaker Avtovaz would be sold to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow. Networking giant Cisco also said it would start to fully shut down operations in Russia and Belarus. Other well-known firms such as L'Oreal and rival Estee Lauder both said they would close shops and stop online sales but have not announced plans to permanently withdraw.

What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut?,"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about."" So, what are the tax cuts being promised? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak row over recession warning in latest TV clash Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What has she pledged and how much would it cost? scrap April's National Insurance rise:Â£13bn a year cancel planned corporation tax rise:Â£17bn a year temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills (she claims this would knock ""around Â£150"" off energy bills):Â£8.5bn a year Total estimated cost:Â£38.5bn a year National Insurance(NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age. It is also paid by employers. Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? Reversing the NI rise would cost about Â£13bn a year,according to,externalthe IFS. Corporation taxis a tax on the profits of businesses. The tax rate is currently 19% but it is due to increase to 25% in April 2023. The government estimates that cancelling this rise would cost Â£17bn a year. However, the IFS points out that doesn't take into account whether lowering tax could lead to increased investment by companies. ""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"". Ms Truss hopes that extra investment would stimulate growth, although that would be difficult because the Bank of England says there is not currently much spare capacity in the economy, which means there is not a lot of scope for the production of more goods and services. Green levies The government makes energy companies add an environmental and social element on to energy bills. This pays for things like schemes to help fund renewable energy and provide grants for insulation. They make up about Â£153 of an average dual fuel bill, according to Ofgem. In 2020-21, the levies raised Â£12.2bn, of which about 70% (Â£8.5bn) went on environmental programmes. Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism. Why did Liz Truss U-turn over public sector pay? BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Paul Johnson said: ""I think we're going to struggle to avoid a recession and certainly you're not going to avoid a recession by doing what she seems to be suggesting, which is big tax cuts. That's more likely to stimulate inflation and create a bigger recession later on."" What has he pledged and how much would it cost? Reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero:Â£4.3bn a year Cut 3p off income tax by late 2029: aboutÂ£19bn a year Mr Sunak was chancellor until 5 July (when he resigned), so announcing wholesale changes to his own policies could be seen as politically problematic. He launched his leadership bid saying: ""Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."" The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s. Mr Sunak has promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero for one year from October, if average bills rise above Â£3,000 a year. At the moment, VAT costs Â£94 of an average bill. Mr Sunak claim his measure will save an average household Â£160 - although clearly it depends on how much the energy price cap rises by. The cost of the policy would be about Â£4.3bn for the year, depending again on how much prices rise. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Could VAT on gas and electricity be cut to zero? In May, Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a VAT cut, saying in Parliament: ""A flat rate payment has the benefit of being more progressive than VAT, which obviously gives very high, or higher, tax discounts to those who are particularly wealthy or have large houses and energy bills."" As Chancellor, he announced that all households in England, Scotland and Wales would receive Â£400 towards their fuel bills between October and March. Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut.

Deadline for Tory leadership nominations,"Candidates vying to be the leader of the Conservative Party - and the next prime minister - have until 18:00 BST to get the support of at least 20 MPs. The deadline comes after the party increased the number of nominations required to make it on to the first-round ballot to speed up the process. Ten MPs are putting themselves forward to replace Boris Johnson. Three - Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, and Tom Tugendhat - have so far passed the necessary threshold. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi also told the BBC he had the support of 20 MPs. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has withdrawn from the contest, pledging to back Mr Sunak, who resigned as chancellor last week. Chris Mason: Whittling down of candidates begins Who could be the next prime minister? Faisal Islam: Tax cut beauty contest could turn ugly Tories using fantasy economics, Labour leader says Voting will get under way on Wednesday, with candidates needing 30 backers to make it into the second round. The field will be whittled down to two finalists before the end of next week in successive rounds of voting by Tory MPs. With candidates scrambling around for MPs' backing, Mr Sunak, former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch and Mr Tugendhat, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, have launched their official campaigns. A winner will be picked in a postal ballot of around 160,000 Conservative Party members over summer, with the result due to be announced on 5 September. On BBC Breakfast, Mr Zahawi was asked if he regretted his close association with Boris Johnson. He praised the prime minister for the coronavirus vaccine rollout and delivering Brexit, before saying he would bring the Conservative Party together and ""heal those wounds"". The contest so far has been dominated by the issue of taxation, with nearly all of the candidates pledging cuts to personal or business taxes, or both. On Monday the 1922 backbench committee, which organises leadership contests, increased the number of nominations needed to stand. Vice-chair of the committee, Nusrat Ghani, told Radio 4's Today this was a ""tweak"" to the rules, adding: ""I don't think it is a great task if you are trying to run for leader of the Conservative Party that you have the support of at least 20 colleagues."" Tuesday 12 July- nominations to get on the ballot open, closing at 18:00 BST Wednesday 13 July- first round of voting among Tory MPs Thursday 14 July- likely date for second round of voting Monday 18 July- likely date for third round of voting, if required Thursday 21 July- deadline for deciding final two candidates Monday 5 September- winner announced Mr Sunak and Mr Tugendhat are launching their official campaigns on Tuesday. The candidates for the party leadership are: Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch Attorney General Suella Braverman Foreign Office minister Rehman Chishti Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak Foreign Secretary Liz Truss Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Tugendhat Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Johnsonwill not be endorsingany of the candidates, having told the media: ""I wouldn't want to damage anyone's chances with my support."" Rishi Sunak is the man to beat among Tory MPs. After pledges of tax cuts from his rivals yesterday, the Mr Sunak will make an argument for what he sees as economic realism. Yes, tax cuts. But only after inflation is under control and the economy is growing. Expect him to argue he is prepared to make difficult decisions and act responsibly. Liz Truss meanwhile is pitching herself to MPs as the best person to stop Mr Sunak. She is expected to get some big cabinet backers today in Jacob Rees Mogg and Nadine Dorries. But unsurprisingly, she isn't the only person making the argument she is best placed to take on Mr Sunak. A number of candidates will spend the next few hours trying to shore up supporters. Most believe they will meet the 20 threshold to get onto tomorrow's ballot. We'll find out for sure later. Meanwhile, Labour will table a confidence motion in the government, sources say. The party promised to bring the House of Commons vote if the Conservatives did not remove Mr Johnson from office immediately. It could be held as early as Wednesday, but it is unlikely many Conservatives would back it. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer  for their tax pledges, accusing them of entering an ""arms race of fantasy economics"". He also accused them of ""hypocrisy"" for having backed tax hikes that have been introduced during Mr Johnson's time in office. UNDER THE SKIN:Where's the most painful place to get a tattoo?

"Generations of children exploited, inquiry findsAgencies blamed children and not perpetrators for the abuse suffered in Telford, the report says.","The report found agencies dismissed reports of child exploitation as ""child prostitution"". Obvious evidence of child sex crimes in Telford was ignored for generations leading to more than 1,000 girls being abused, an inquiry has found. Agencies blamed children for the abuse they suffered, not the perpetrators, and exploitation was not investigated because of ""nervousness about race"". The inquiry was set up after theSunday Mirror revealed gangs had been abusing girls in the town since the 1980s,external. Chairman Tom Crowther QC said the abuse had thrived unchecked for decades. His report makes 47 recommendations for improvement by agencies involved. West Mercia Police has apologised ""unequivocally"" for past events as has Telford & Wrekin Council. Street pastors have reported seeing men in cars approaching girls as they left pubs and nightclubs. The report found agencies dismissed reports of child exploitation as ""child prostitution"". Mr Crowther said: ""The overwhelming theme of the evidence has been the appalling suffering of generations of children caused by the utter cruelty of those who committed child sexual exploitation. ""Victims and survivors repeatedly told the inquiry how, when they were children, adult men worked to gain their trust before ruthlessly betraying that trust, treating them as sexual objects or commodities. This video can not be played Telford inquiry: Survivor says her abusers 'hold no power' ""Countless children were sexually assaulted and raped. They were deliberately humiliated and degraded. They were shared and trafficked. They were subjected to violence and their families were threatened. ""They lived in fear and their lives were forever changed. They have asked, over the years: how was this allowed to happen?"" Other key report findings include: Teachers and social workers being discouraged from reporting abuse Offenders becoming ""emboldened"" by the absence of police action, with abuse continuing for years without concerted response Exploitation was not investigated because of nervousness about race, that investigating concerns against Asian men, in particular, would inflame ""racial tensions"" Even after an investigation leading to seven men being jailed for child sex crimes West Mercia Police and Telford & Wrekin Council scaled down their specialist teams ""to virtual zero"" in order to save money Seven men were jailed in 2012 following Operation Chalice, an investigation into child sexual exploitation The investigation was known as Operation Chalice and saw two Telford brothers among those jailed. A court heard the brothers sexually abused, trafficked and prostituted, or tried to prostitute, four teenagers between March 2008 and December 2009. The report found the most common way children were exploited was through a ""boyfriend"" model, where a child would meet a man, who would persuade them to become his girlfriend. Perpetrators, it said, sought out ""vulnerable"" children and would begin giving them lifts, buying them food, alcohol or cigarettes which led to the children becoming involved in sexual activity with the men as a ""favour"" as payment for the gifts. 'There were lots of adults, nobody asked questions' Telford child abuse inquiry: What do we know? Telford to commission child abuse probe Most of those responsible for the abuse did not use contraception and ""pregnancies were expected to be (and in many cases were) terminated."" Some of those abused went on to bear the perpetrator's children. In several cases, victims received death threats against them or their families if they tried to end the abuse. Lucy Lowe was 14 when she became pregnant by taxi driver Azhar Ali Mehmood The report references the case ofLucy Lowe, 16,who died along with her 17-year-old sister and mother in a house fire started by Azhar Ali Mehmood, 26, the father of her daughter. She had become pregnant at 14 to Mehmood. The report continued to say children were often abused in nightclubs and takeaways with witnesses also describing a ""rape house"" in Wellington, Telford, to which young people were taken. Within schools, it said, there was a ""reluctance"" to report concerning activity without ""concrete proof"" which was an ""overly cautious approach"", while ""obvious"" indicators like absences and changes in behaviour went unremarked by school staff. The report said, in the most recent figures from the first six months of 2020, police received 172 referrals related to child exploitation. The ""dreadful, life altering crime has not gone away - in Telford or elsewhere,"" the report said. It also outlines recent police evidence of ""an unacceptable, and quite frankly offensive attitude"", towards child abuse victims, with ""disparaging language being used"". The report said the crime ""has not gone away - in Telford or elsewhere"" In his statement, Mr Crowther said he looked back as far as 1989 to draw his conclusions, but had heard from victims exploited as long ago as the 1970s. ""I saw references to exploitation being 'generational'; having come to be regarded as 'normal' by perpetrators and inevitable by victims and survivors some of whose parents had been through similar experiences,"" he said. He urged agencies to accept the recommendations made in the report and hoped the report ""goes some way"" to giving a voice to the survivors. If you have been affected by anything in this report, support is available through theBBC's Action Line. Mr Crowther recommended the formation of a joint review team to publish an annual report on child abuse in Telford. Following the inquiry's publication, survivor Joanne Phillips, who gave evidence said: ""Victims were being identified as child prostitutes. Once you have been convicted that label will never leave you. ""Prosecutions are damaging to your life. ""Some children went to prison for not paying the fines. Convictions should be completely expunged. ""Today I feel incredibly proud of the girls in Telford....I cannot express enough how proud I am for seeing this through and their resilience and bravery."" Lucy Allan MP described the report as ""damning and devastating"" Lucy Allan, the MP for Telford, who has been campaigning on the issue since 2016, said: ""Today is a very important day for victims and survivors of CSE, not just in Telford but right across the country because this report is damning, it is devastating. ""There are clear patterns that existed well before this report was commissioned that people knew about CSE, we had had high profile court cases in Telford and we should have taken learnings from that and we quite clearly didn't. ""The saddest thing is that victims and survivors, their voices weren't heard, they weren't taken seriously and that should never have happened."" The report's recommendations should be adopted by local authorities around the country, she said. Telford & Wrekin Council said it has made 'significant improvement' in recent years Telford and Wrekin Council has said it ""apologises wholeheartedly"" to the victims. ""Child sexual exploitation is a vile crime that disgusts us and all right thinking people. ""The independent inquiry acknowledges we have made significant improvements in recent years."" It said it was working to provide support for victims and it was already carrying out many of the inquiry's recommendations. West Mercia Police issued an apology to survivors Assistant Chief Constable Richard Cooper, of West Mercia Police, said he would like to say sorry to the survivors and all those affected in Telford. ""While there were no findings of corruption, our actions fell far short of the help and protection you should have had from us, it was unacceptable, we let you down. It is important we now take time to reflect critically and carefully on the content of the report and the recommendations that have been made,"" he said. He said the force now has teams dedicated to preventing and tackling child exploitation and works better together with organisations to safeguard children. The Inquiry was set up three years ago after several criminal prosecutions brought the problems to light. The chairman, Tom Crowther QC, heard evidence from dozens of survivors of abuse. Countless children were sexually assaulted and raped. They were deliberately humiliated and degraded. They were shared and trafficked. They were subjected to violence and their families were threatened. They lived in fear and their lives were forever changed. They have asked, over the years: how was this allowed to happen?"" The answer, Mr Crowther believes, is the authorities had ignored obvious signs of child exploitation; had blamed the children and not the perpetrators, and in many cases wouldn't investigate cases because of ""nervousness about race"". West Mercia Police and the council scaled down their specialist child sexual exploitation teams to virtually zero - to save money. By 2015 the provision from both had in some ways gone back almost a decade. Two police investigations - Operation Chalice in 2012 and Operation Vapour in 2019 - led to 10 men of south Asian descent being convicted of sexual offences against young girls . But the inquiry has spoken to victims of exploitation from many more communities. West Mercia Police and Crime Commissioner, John Campion, said victims and survivors had been let down. ""I cannot say with absolute certainty, just because lessons have been learnt, that it will never happen again. ""However, my drive as PCC remains resolute to ensure the system, that is there to keep people safe, continues building on the progress that has been made."" Shropshire Council, which neighbours Telford & Wrekin said these crimes are ""happening right across the country"". It said awareness of the crime is now ""far greater"" and it has ""safeguards"" in place to help people living in the area. The Rev Keith Osmund-Smith, is part of the Street Pastors in Telford, a group of volunteers who work to help keep people safe while out at night. While working as West Mercia Police's chaplain, he went on sabbatical after he told a national newspaper he doubted if information passed to West Mercia Police officers about child sex exploitation was always acted on. He waslater reinstated. Keith Osmund-Smith says abuse is still going on He said he was glad matters raised had been addressed after being concerned police and local authority were not seeing young people as ""victims"". ""At ground level police officers were very concerned about what was going on but there was almost a cost-cutting exercise in the councilâ¦and also in the police where it became too expensive,"" he said. ""It is still happening and there is still no room for complacency, I think we are much better equipped to deal with it."" Mark Berry reported concerns seen at a night time cafe in Wellington Mark Berry formerly ran a project which operated a night cafe from a Methodist church in Wellington and street teams operating around nightclubs, supporting vulnerable people, including young girls. ""They would come into the cafe or we would talk to them outside and we began to hear stories about why they felt vulnerable, particularly on the streets, that there were groups of guys who were, what we would call now, grooming them, offering them gifts, wanting to take them to parties, things like that,"" he said. He said the staff would see men in cars approaching girls as they left pubs and nightclubs. ""These guys weren't going into the clubs, they weren't part of the normal night time life, the entertainment life, it felt like they were specifically there for this purpose,"" he said. He said girls would tell them how they felt ""vulnerable"", ""hassled"" and ""harassed"", which they reported to the police officers who they now know were heading up the Operation Chalice inquiry. Mr Berry said Telford had ""pulled together"" in the wake of investigations into exploitation Mr Berry said the town had ""pulled together"" in the wake of the investigation and added the inquiry was ""crucial"" for understanding what had happened. ""There needs to be justice and there needs to be resolution for the victims and for the wider community and people want that to happen,"" he said.

The inquiry was set up after theSunday Mirror revealed gangs had been abusing girls in the town since the 1980s,external. Chairman Tom Crowther QC said the abuse had thrived unchecked for decades. His report makes 47 recommendations for improvement by agencies involved. West Mercia Police has apologised ""unequivocally"" for past events as has Telford & Wrekin Council. Street pastors have reported seeing men in cars approaching girls as they left pubs and nightclubs. The report found agencies dismissed reports of child exploitation as ""child prostitution"". Mr Crowther said: ""The overwhelming theme of the evidence has been the appalling suffering of generations of children caused by the utter cruelty of those who committed child sexual exploitation. ""Victims and survivors repeatedly told the inquiry how, when they were children, adult men worked to gain their trust before ruthlessly betraying that trust, treating them as sexual objects or commodities. This video can not be played Telford inquiry: Survivor says her abusers 'hold no power' ""Countless children were sexually assaulted and raped. They were deliberately humiliated and degraded. They were shared and trafficked. They were subjected to violence and their families were threatened. ""They lived in fear and their lives were forever changed. They have asked, over the years: how was this allowed to happen?"" Other key report findings include: Teachers and social workers being discouraged from reporting abuse Offenders becoming ""emboldened"" by the absence of police action, with abuse continuing for years without concerted response Exploitation was not investigated because of nervousness about race, that investigating concerns against Asian men, in particular, would inflame ""racial tensions"" Even after an investigation leading to seven men being jailed for child sex crimes West Mercia Police and Telford & Wrekin Council scaled down their specialist teams ""to virtual zero"" in order to save money Seven men were jailed in 2012 following Operation Chalice, an investigation into child sexual exploitation The investigation was known as Operation Chalice and saw two Telford brothers among those jailed. A court heard the brothers sexually abused, trafficked and prostituted, or tried to prostitute, four teenagers between March 2008 and December 2009. The report found the most common way children were exploited was through a ""boyfriend"" model, where a child would meet a man, who would persuade them to become his girlfriend. Perpetrators, it said, sought out ""vulnerable"" children and would begin giving them lifts, buying them food, alcohol or cigarettes which led to the children becoming involved in sexual activity with the men as a ""favour"" as payment for the gifts. 'There were lots of adults, nobody asked questions' Telford child abuse inquiry: What do we know? Telford to commission child abuse probe Most of those responsible for the abuse did not use contraception and ""pregnancies were expected to be (and in many cases were) terminated."" Some of those abused went on to bear the perpetrator's children. In several cases, victims received death threats against them or their families if they tried to end the abuse. Lucy Lowe was 14 when she became pregnant by taxi driver Azhar Ali Mehmood The report references the case ofLucy Lowe, 16,who died along with her 17-year-old sister and mother in a house fire started by Azhar Ali Mehmood, 26, the father of her daughter. She had become pregnant at 14 to Mehmood. The report continued to say children were often abused in nightclubs and takeaways with witnesses also describing a ""rape house"" in Wellington, Telford, to which young people were taken. Within schools, it said, there was a ""reluctance"" to report concerning activity without ""concrete proof"" which was an ""overly cautious approach"", while ""obvious"" indicators like absences and changes in behaviour went unremarked by school staff. The report said, in the most recent figures from the first six months of 2020, police received 172 referrals related to child exploitation. The ""dreadful, life altering crime has not gone away - in Telford or elsewhere,"" the report said. It also outlines recent police evidence of ""an unacceptable, and quite frankly offensive attitude"", towards child abuse victims, with ""disparaging language being used"". The report said the crime ""has not gone away - in Telford or elsewhere"" In his statement, Mr Crowther said he looked back as far as 1989 to draw his conclusions, but had heard from victims exploited as long ago as the 1970s. ""I saw references to exploitation being 'generational'; having come to be regarded as 'normal' by perpetrators and inevitable by victims and survivors some of whose parents had been through similar experiences,"" he said. He urged agencies to accept the recommendations made in the report and hoped the report ""goes some way"" to giving a voice to the survivors. If you have been affected by anything in this report, support is available through theBBC's Action Line. Mr Crowther recommended the formation of a joint review team to publish an annual report on child abuse in Telford. Following the inquiry's publication, survivor Joanne Phillips, who gave evidence said: ""Victims were being identified as child prostitutes. Once you have been convicted that label will never leave you. ""Prosecutions are damaging to your life. ""Some children went to prison for not paying the fines. Convictions should be completely expunged. ""Today I feel incredibly proud of the girls in Telford....I cannot express enough how proud I am for seeing this through and their resilience and bravery."" Lucy Allan MP described the report as ""damning and devastating"" Lucy Allan, the MP for Telford, who has been campaigning on the issue since 2016, said: ""Today is a very important day for victims and survivors of CSE, not just in Telford but right across the country because this report is damning, it is devastating. ""There are clear patterns that existed well before this report was commissioned that people knew about CSE, we had had high profile court cases in Telford and we should have taken learnings from that and we quite clearly didn't. ""The saddest thing is that victims and survivors, their voices weren't heard, they weren't taken seriously and that should never have happened."" The report's recommendations should be adopted by local authorities around the country, she said. Telford & Wrekin Council said it has made 'significant improvement' in recent years Telford and Wrekin Council has said it ""apologises wholeheartedly"" to the victims. ""Child sexual exploitation is a vile crime that disgusts us and all right thinking people. ""The independent inquiry acknowledges we have made significant improvements in recent years."" It said it was working to provide support for victims and it was already carrying out many of the inquiry's recommendations. West Mercia Police issued an apology to survivors Assistant Chief Constable Richard Cooper, of West Mercia Police, said he would like to say sorry to the survivors and all those affected in Telford. ""While there were no findings of corruption, our actions fell far short of the help and protection you should have had from us, it was unacceptable, we let you down. It is important we now take time to reflect critically and carefully on the content of the report and the recommendations that have been made,"" he said. He said the force now has teams dedicated to preventing and tackling child exploitation and works better together with organisations to safeguard children. The Inquiry was set up three years ago after several criminal prosecutions brought the problems to light. The chairman, Tom Crowther QC, heard evidence from dozens of survivors of abuse. Countless children were sexually assaulted and raped. They were deliberately humiliated and degraded. They were shared and trafficked. They were subjected to violence and their families were threatened. They lived in fear and their lives were forever changed. They have asked, over the years: how was this allowed to happen?"" The answer, Mr Crowther believes, is the authorities had ignored obvious signs of child exploitation; had blamed the children and not the perpetrators, and in many cases wouldn't investigate cases because of ""nervousness about race"". West Mercia Police and the council scaled down their specialist child sexual exploitation teams to virtually zero - to save money. By 2015 the provision from both had in some ways gone back almost a decade. Two police investigations - Operation Chalice in 2012 and Operation Vapour in 2019 - led to 10 men of south Asian descent being convicted of sexual offences against young girls . But the inquiry has spoken to victims of exploitation from many more communities. West Mercia Police and Crime Commissioner, John Campion, said victims and survivors had been let down. ""I cannot say with absolute certainty, just because lessons have been learnt, that it will never happen again. ""However, my drive as PCC remains resolute to ensure the system, that is there to keep people safe, continues building on the progress that has been made."" Shropshire Council, which neighbours Telford & Wrekin said these crimes are ""happening right across the country"". It said awareness of the crime is now ""far greater"" and it has ""safeguards"" in place to help people living in the area. The Rev Keith Osmund-Smith, is part of the Street Pastors in Telford, a group of volunteers who work to help keep people safe while out at night. While working as West Mercia Police's chaplain, he went on sabbatical after he told a national newspaper he doubted if information passed to West Mercia Police officers about child sex exploitation was always acted on. He waslater reinstated. Keith Osmund-Smith says abuse is still going on He said he was glad matters raised had been addressed after being concerned police and local authority were not seeing young people as ""victims"". ""At ground level police officers were very concerned about what was going on but there was almost a cost-cutting exercise in the councilâ¦and also in the police where it became too expensive,"" he said. ""It is still happening and there is still no room for complacency, I think we are much better equipped to deal with it."" Mark Berry reported concerns seen at a night time cafe in Wellington Mark Berry formerly ran a project which operated a night cafe from a Methodist church in Wellington and street teams operating around nightclubs, supporting vulnerable people, including young girls. ""They would come into the cafe or we would talk to them outside and we began to hear stories about why they felt vulnerable, particularly on the streets, that there were groups of guys who were, what we would call now, grooming them, offering them gifts, wanting to take them to parties, things like that,"" he said. He said the staff would see men in cars approaching girls as they left pubs and nightclubs. ""These guys weren't going into the clubs, they weren't part of the normal night time life, the entertainment life, it felt like they were specifically there for this purpose,"" he said. He said girls would tell them how they felt ""vulnerable"", ""hassled"" and ""harassed"", which they reported to the police officers who they now know were heading up the Operation Chalice inquiry. Mr Berry said Telford had ""pulled together"" in the wake of investigations into exploitation Mr Berry said the town had ""pulled together"" in the wake of the investigation and added the inquiry was ""crucial"" for understanding what had happened. ""There needs to be justice and there needs to be resolution for the victims and for the wider community and people want that to happen,"" he said.

Contenders on the ballot to be next Tory PM to be revealed,"Eight candidates make it onto the ballot for the Conservative Party leadership contest Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi received the support of at least 20 MPs Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti withdraw from the contest just minutes before the deadline Candidates are pitching their bids to fellow Tory MPs at a closed hustings in Westminster. They each have 12 minutes to speak Successful contenders will go through to a vote on Wednesday, with the final two candidates selected before the end of next week The winner will be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates - please join us then. Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds.

The eight candidates are just about to start speaking at the first hustings in Parliament. They're getting 12 minutes each to try to persuade Conservative MPs they should be the one to take over as party leader and prime minister. They're going to be speaking in this order: Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Nadhim Zahawim and then Penny Mordaunt. We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid withdraws from the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader. He says: ""Serving in government is a true privilege. It has been just seven days since I took the difficult decision to resign from the most important job I have ever had, as health secretary during a pandemic."" ""Since then, I have set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country."" ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again."" ""There is an abundance of both ideas and talent in our party. One of the candidates will be given the honour of becoming prime minister."" ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" Â© 2025 BBC.

We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid withdraws from the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader. He says: ""Serving in government is a true privilege. It has been just seven days since I took the difficult decision to resign from the most important job I have ever had, as health secretary during a pandemic."" ""Since then, I have set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country."" ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again."" ""There is an abundance of both ideas and talent in our party. One of the candidates will be given the honour of becoming prime minister."" ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Gary Lineker stays top of BBC star pay list,"Gary Lineker was paid Â£1.36m for presenting Match of the Day and Sports Personality of the Year Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has topped a list of the BBC's best-paid stars for a fifth year in a row, taking Â£1.35m in the last financial year. That's slightly down on the Â£1.36m he earned in the previous year, which came after he took a pay cut from Â£1.75m. Radio 2 breakfast show host Zoe Ball is second on the new list, with Â£980,000. She also previously earned more but took a 28% pay cut at the end of 2020. She's one of three women in this year's top 10, down from four last year. Fiona Bruce and Vanessa Feltz have also made the cut again, but 6 Music's Lauren Laverne has dropped out of the top 10 after her pay fell by Â£15,000 to Â£380,000. See the list in full The figures were published in the corporation's latest annual report, which also revealed a sharp drop in the time UK adults spend watching TV every day. Average viewing dropped from eight hours 11 minutes in 2020/21 to seven hours 12 minutes in 2021/22, although part of that fall may be explained by people watching less than they did during the height of the pandemic. However, iPlayer usage has increased by around 12%. Meanwhile, 90% of the British population continues to use BBC services each week. The star salaries list does not include all presenters and actors because the corporation's commercial arm BBC Studios, which makes many of programmes, does not have to publish its talent spend. So for example, Claudia Winkleman is only listed for her weekly Radio 2 show and not for presenting Strictly Come Dancing, which is made by BBC Studios. Graham Norton has dropped off the list entirely after he left his Saturday Radio 2 show in December 2020, while the fee for his TV chat show, which is made for BBC One by his commercial company So Television, is not listed. Seventy-four on-air people earning more than Â£150,000 were listed this year, with the gender split similar to last year - 41 men (55%) and 33 women (45%). Previous director general Tony Hall had pledged that the gap would be closed by 2020. Zoe Ball took a Â£380,000 pay cut, which now puts her in the Â£980,000-a-year band Radio 1 breakfast host Greg James is the only new entry in the top 10, with Huw Edwards the only name apart from Lineker in the top 10 to have seen a pay reduction. The news presenter's earnings fell from Â£425,000 in 2020/21 to Â£410,000 in 2021/22. Some had an increase, with Alan Shearer getting a Â£60,000 pay bump. He now takes home Â£450,000 a year for his work on football shows including Match of the Day. Scott Mills, who is moving from Radio 1 to take up Steve Wright's afternoon slot on Radio 2 later this year, had an increase of Â£15,000. Wright also had a Â£15,000 pay rise, although his salary is likely to be reduced next year when he leaves his current daytime show. The gender pay gap widened for the first time since the BBC began recording its figures in 2017. It now stands at 5.9%, up on last year's 5.2%. The BBC said this could be down to several factors, including attrition - the loss of employees through retirement, redundancy or resignation who are not subsequently replaced. While there was no pay gap for ethnic minority BBC staff members in last year's report, there is now a gap of 1.6%, while the disability pay gap increased from 4% to 5.9%. The wage bill for all on-air talent overall is down slightly at Â£129.8m. Last year it was Â£130m. BBC director general Tim Davie said some of the pay increases were down to ""people this year taking on more responsibility and doing more shows"". He said the corporation was ""showing restraint when the market is [being] driven by extreme hyperinflation"". He said the pay list was ""a source of a lot of understandable attention"", but added: ""Actually if you step back, the actual amount paid for that group of talent, which only represents a tiny fraction of the 200,000-odd people who come on our airwaves every year... the return we get in terms of audience value is very strong. ""And actually our research shows people want to see the best people presenting and delivering for the BBC."" A number of high-profile broadcasters who have left the BBC during the last year still appear on the latest list, including former North America editor Jon Sopel, former Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, and Andrew Marr, who said he was leaving the corporation for LBC to ""get his voice back"". Mr Davie said: ""There are obviously headlines around individuals and some regretted losses, but actually our number in terms of the people being retained in the BBC is high."" He added that there was ""no shortage of demand"" for top positions at the broadcaster, but stressed the importance of bringing ""new talent"" through the BBC, which would always mean a ""degree of change"". The total bill for the BBC's executive board, including non-executives, was Â£4.3m, down from Â£4.8m in 2020/2021. But as has already been announced, Mr Davie's salary has increased from Â£494,000 to Â£522,000. The BBC is facing cutbacks after the government announced in January that it would freeze the licence fee for two years. Mr Davie told BBC Radio 4's Today programmeearlier this year that the settlement would ""affect our frontline output"". Asked what might be cut, he said ""everything's on the agenda"". The director general also told reporters the BBC would deliver a report into complaints made about former Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ Tim Westwood within the next two weeks. In April, Westwood was accused of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, which he strongly denies. Shortly afterwards,Mr Davie saidthe BBC had  ""seen no evidence"" of complaints being received about the hip-hop presenter's conduct. However,last week it was revealedthat the BBC had actually received six complaints, including one that had previously been referred to the police. ""We did an initial round of analysis of HR files, which didn't show something,"" Mr Davie said on Tuesday. ""That was why I made that statement, which was my understanding at that time."" An internal audit is now being carried out, he said.

Rajapaksa told: 'Quit now or face massive protest',"Thousands of protesters stormed the president's palace on Saturday, forcing him to flee Sri Lanka will see a ""terrible, massive strike"" and huge demonstrations if the president and prime minister do not quit by Wednesday, protest organisers and union leaders have warned. This is the day President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has promised to resign after he fled crowds who stormed his palace, but many worry he won't keep his word. A furious public blames him for their worst economic crisis in decades. Sri Lankans are struggling with rolling power cuts and fuel and food shortages. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said he would step down once an all-party interim government is set up following Mr Rajapaksa's departure. But many Sri Lankans want him to leave immediately too - because once Mr Rajapaksa departs, under Sri Lanka's constitution, Mr Wickremesinghe would automatically become acting president for 30 days. ""If they do not go by the 13th [of July], we will restart the protests on a different level,"" protest organiser Father Jeevantha Peiris told the BBC. ""The trade unions and civil rights groups confirm from the 14th onwards they will start a terrible, massive strike along with all the protests."" A union leader later confirmed this. Father Jeevantha (centre) speaks at the meeting, with Wasantha Mudalige in the blue-green checked shirt on the far right Student leader Wasantha Mudalige warned if the two leaders ""try to fool the people, we will take drastic actions and it will be much more intense"" than the mass protests on Saturday in the capital, Colombo. Thousands had swarmed the presidential palace forcing Mr Rajapaksa, an authoritarian leader whose family has dominated the island's politics for almost two decades, to flee. His whereabouts are currently unclear. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. Amid uncertainty on the eve of his expected departure, organisers of the Aragalaya protest movement - named after the Sinhalese word for ""struggle"" - announced a list of demands at a public meeting with political parties and trade unions at Colombo library. Besides demands for the resignations of the two leaders and everyone in their government, they also called for the executive presidency to be abolished, immediate economic relief and a People's Council to advise the government. They also want the country's coffers, which most believe were drained by corruption, to be replenished. How this would be achieved is not clear. First fuel in days trickles through to Sri Lankans Inside the palace now full of the people The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? Representatives of political parties in parliament were present and said they agreed with the protesters' points, with one lawmaker even saying sorry for allowing the country to slide into economic crisis under their watch. ""To my other parliamentarians: we should apologise and rectify the situation, and be accountable to the people,"" he said as the dozens-strong crowd clapped. Sri Lankans are forced to queue for essentials like cooking gas and prices have soared But some also warned the protests could not continue indefinitely as the country needed stability. ""Aragalaya has to accept whoever comes into power next. You cannot keep protesting,"" said one representative from the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The question of what's next for the movement looms large. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters swim in the Sri Lankan president's pool on Saturday Since it began in May, it has been driven by ordinary citizens joining forces with a vast array of interest groups - from unionists and farmers to artists, students and socialists - for one single goal: removing Gotabaya Rajapaksa, his brother Mahinda and the rest of their family from power. The president is the only one of these who remains in office. But the protest movement's hydra-headed strength has also proved to be a weakness: it has been largely leaderless with no charismatic figure emerging for people to unite behind. Protesters and members of the public have spent the last few days seeing for themselves how their leaders live Factions have clashed over the direction of the movement and one dispute between two socialist groups led to a physical fight that left several injured in the capital on Monday night, according to local media reports. It has also meant the protest movement for now cannot offer a contender for the country's leadership once Mr Rajapaksa goes. Deep public suspicion of politicians has meant there is no clear favourite among those in parliament either. Though theleader of the opposition Sajith Premadasa has put himself forwardfor the top job, he is seen by some as politically inexperienced and ineffective, and has yet to attract strong public support. But protest organisers the BBC spoke to on Tuesday said they saw the movement remaining as a check on any future government, and were optimistic it could play a role in moving the country out of its current political and economic deadlock. ""With people power, it's possible,"" said Father Jeevantha. ""The international community and the Sri Lanka diaspora, they are ready to help. People are united and ready to make sacrifices. ""We have a good moment now with the people's power.""

LiveLiveContenders on the ballot to be next Tory PM to be revealed8 minutes ago,"Eight candidates make it onto the ballot for the Conservative Party leadership contest Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi received the support of at least 20 MPs Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti withdraw from the contest just minutes before the deadline Candidates are pitching their bids to fellow Tory MPs at a closed hustings in Westminster. They each have 12 minutes to speak Successful contenders will go through to a vote on Wednesday, with the final two candidates selected before the end of next week The winner will be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates - please join us then. Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds.

Gary Speed's mum on sadness that never goes awayThe mum of the former Wales football boss opens up more than a decade after he took his own life.Wales,"This video can not be played Gary Speed's mother is urging people to open up about their mental health Gary Speed's mother has spoken at length about the sadness that ""never goes away,"" more than a decade after the ex-footballer took his own life. The former Wales manager was found dead at his home in November 2011. He was widely credited with reigniting Welsh football fortunes and setting them on the road to the 2022 World Cup. His mother Carol said she would never find the answer to why he died but urged others to talk about their mental health - and get help. ""It's just something that you don't ever get over at all,"" she said, speaking openly about the former Leeds, Newcastle and Everton midfielder in one of the first public interviews since he died. ""You know, you can smile and you can laugh, and you can have a good day, but it's always there. The sadness is always there."" Families bereaved by suicide ask for more help Football academies: A failed dream 'sends you to a dark place' Speed's parents Roger and Carol say they miss their son ""every day"" Now retired, Carol Speed still shares the modest semi-detached home in Deeside, Flintshire, where the Welsh sporting giant grew up with her husband Roger, Speed's father. Roger now lives with dementia, and Carol cares for him. They both still treasure the memories of their son captured in scores of photos, shirts and pennants adorning walls around the house. It is a shrine to a footballing star who was loved by both his family and fans, but will always remain 42.

His mother Carol said she would never find the answer to why he died but urged others to talk about their mental health - and get help.

LiveLiveContenders on the ballot to be next Tory PM to be revealedCandidates in the Conservative leadership race have until 18:00 BST to secure the support of at least 20 MPs.UK Politics,"Eight candidates make it onto the ballot for the Conservative Party leadership contest Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi received the support of at least 20 MPs Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti withdraw from the contest just minutes before the deadline Candidates are pitching their bids to fellow Tory MPs at a closed hustings in Westminster. They each have 12 minutes to speak Successful contenders will go through to a vote on Wednesday, with the final two candidates selected before the end of next week The winner will be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates - please join us then. Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds.

They are Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi. Each has the backing of at least 20 fellow MPs. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti MP withdrew from the contest just minutes before the deadline. The first ballot and its result happen on Wednesday. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch MP has also been tweeting, sharing her gratitude after making it through to the final eight. Allow Twitter content?

The eight candidates are just about to start speaking at the first hustings in Parliament. They're getting 12 minutes each to try to persuade Conservative MPs they should be the one to take over as party leader and prime minister. They're going to be speaking in this order: Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Nadhim Zahawim and then Penny Mordaunt. We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid withdraws from the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader. He says: ""Serving in government is a true privilege. It has been just seven days since I took the difficult decision to resign from the most important job I have ever had, as health secretary during a pandemic."" ""Since then, I have set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country."" ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again."" ""There is an abundance of both ideas and talent in our party. One of the candidates will be given the honour of becoming prime minister."" ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Don't demonise Johnson, Sunak warns ToriesThe ex-chancellor launches his own party leadership bid, calling his former boss a ""remarkable"" man.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Watch: Sunak praises Johnson as he launches Tory leadership bid Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak has launched his bid to become Conservative leader, warning against ""demonising"" the ""remarkable"" Boris Johnson. He also hit out at his rivals' tax-cut promises, dismissing them as ""not credible"" until the rate of inflation is brought under control. Eight candidates are running to be Tory leader and PM. Sajid Javid announced he was out of the race minutes before the final list was announced. The former health secretary withdrew from the content, saying: ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" MPs in the running need the backing of 20 MPs, as Tory backbench organisers prepare to announce who is through to the next round. Rehman Chishti pulled out of the race, as did Transport Secretary Grant Shapps earlier on Tuesday. Home Secretary Priti Patel ruled out entering the contest. She said she would not stand despite ""encouragement and support"" to do so from colleagues and Tory supporters. Sunak hits back at Tory leadership tax critics Who could be the next prime minister? Do Tory leadership tax pledges add up? How will the new Tory leader and PM be chosen? Of the remaining candidates, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Mr Sunak, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, Attorney General Suella Braverman and backbench MP Tom Tugendhat have so far passed the threshold to get on the ballot. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC he also had enough support to get through. In a series of votes, Conservative MPs will begin whittling the candidates down on Wednesday, with the final two going to a full ballot of around 160,000 party members over the summer. In a busy morning, Mr Tugendhat and former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch also officially launched their leadership bids with media events that enabled them to demonstrate their support. This video can not be played Watch: Let's be honest about our economic challenge - Kemi Badenoch Withdrawing from the contest, Mr Shapps pledged his support to Mr Sunak, with Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab also backing him. But Tory heavyweight Michael Gove, sacked from the cabinet last week by Mr Johnson, is among those supporting Ms Badenoch. And former senior minister Damian Green is one of the MPs backing Mr Tugendhat. At his campaign launch, in central London, Mr Sunak, who quit the government last week in protest at Mr Johnson's leadership, said: ""Boris Johnson is one of the most remarkable people I've ever met. ""And, whatever some commentators may say, he has a good heart."" He added: ""Is he flawed? Yes. And so are the rest of us."" Mr Sunak said he had resigned because Mr Johnson's leadership was ""no longer working"", but he would have ""no part in a rewriting of history that seeks to demonise Boris, exaggerate his faults or deny his efforts"". This video can not be played Watch: 'We need a clean start' - Tugendhat's leadership pledge So far, the contest has focused on the issue of tax cuts, with most candidates saying they would make them immediately if they got into Downing Street. But Mr Sunak warned that it was not credible to promise more spending and lower taxes in the immediate term. ""While that may be politically inconvenient for me, it is also the truth,"" he added, ""as is the fact that once we've gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of when, not if."" The candidates for the party leadership (with numbers of declared backers so far) are: Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch (16) Attorney General Suella Braverman (12) Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt (13) Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid (11) Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt (25) Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak (45) Foreign Secretary Liz Truss (21) Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Tugendhat (20) Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi (14) At her campaign launch, Ms Badenoch promised she would not enter into a ""bidding war"" over tax cuts, saying: ""The dividing line in this race is not tax cuts; it's judgement."" ""It's time to tell the truth,"" she told supporters. ""For too long politicians have been saying you can have it all - you can have your cake and eat it. But I'm here to tell you that's not the case."" Meanwhile, Mr Tugendhat promised to slash fuel duty by 10p and reverse the recent rise in National Insurance payments if he became prime minister. ""I am here to make the case that our economy can only prosper if we believe that people - and not Westminster - know best how to spend their money,"" he said. Addressing his lack of ministerial experience, Mr Tugendhat said: ""The reality is that the job of prime minister is unlike every other job in government. ""It's not a management job; it's not a departmental job. It's a job that demands vision and leadership.""

"Don't demonise Johnson, Sunak warns Tories","This video can not be played Watch: Sunak praises Johnson as he launches Tory leadership bid Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak has launched his bid to become Conservative leader, warning against ""demonising"" the ""remarkable"" Boris Johnson. He also hit out at his rivals' tax-cut promises, dismissing them as ""not credible"" until the rate of inflation is brought under control. Eight candidates are running to be Tory leader and PM. Sajid Javid announced he was out of the race minutes before the final list was announced. The former health secretary withdrew from the content, saying: ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" MPs in the running need the backing of 20 MPs, as Tory backbench organisers prepare to announce who is through to the next round. Rehman Chishti pulled out of the race, as did Transport Secretary Grant Shapps earlier on Tuesday. Home Secretary Priti Patel ruled out entering the contest. She said she would not stand despite ""encouragement and support"" to do so from colleagues and Tory supporters. Sunak hits back at Tory leadership tax critics Who could be the next prime minister? Do Tory leadership tax pledges add up? How will the new Tory leader and PM be chosen? Of the remaining candidates, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Mr Sunak, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, Attorney General Suella Braverman and backbench MP Tom Tugendhat have so far passed the threshold to get on the ballot. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC he also had enough support to get through. In a series of votes, Conservative MPs will begin whittling the candidates down on Wednesday, with the final two going to a full ballot of around 160,000 party members over the summer. In a busy morning, Mr Tugendhat and former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch also officially launched their leadership bids with media events that enabled them to demonstrate their support. This video can not be played Watch: Let's be honest about our economic challenge - Kemi Badenoch Withdrawing from the contest, Mr Shapps pledged his support to Mr Sunak, with Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab also backing him. But Tory heavyweight Michael Gove, sacked from the cabinet last week by Mr Johnson, is among those supporting Ms Badenoch. And former senior minister Damian Green is one of the MPs backing Mr Tugendhat. At his campaign launch, in central London, Mr Sunak, who quit the government last week in protest at Mr Johnson's leadership, said: ""Boris Johnson is one of the most remarkable people I've ever met. ""And, whatever some commentators may say, he has a good heart."" He added: ""Is he flawed? Yes. And so are the rest of us."" Mr Sunak said he had resigned because Mr Johnson's leadership was ""no longer working"", but he would have ""no part in a rewriting of history that seeks to demonise Boris, exaggerate his faults or deny his efforts"". This video can not be played Watch: 'We need a clean start' - Tugendhat's leadership pledge So far, the contest has focused on the issue of tax cuts, with most candidates saying they would make them immediately if they got into Downing Street. But Mr Sunak warned that it was not credible to promise more spending and lower taxes in the immediate term. ""While that may be politically inconvenient for me, it is also the truth,"" he added, ""as is the fact that once we've gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of when, not if."" The candidates for the party leadership (with numbers of declared backers so far) are: Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch (16) Attorney General Suella Braverman (12) Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt (13) Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid (11) Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt (25) Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak (45) Foreign Secretary Liz Truss (21) Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Tugendhat (20) Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi (14) At her campaign launch, Ms Badenoch promised she would not enter into a ""bidding war"" over tax cuts, saying: ""The dividing line in this race is not tax cuts; it's judgement."" ""It's time to tell the truth,"" she told supporters. ""For too long politicians have been saying you can have it all - you can have your cake and eat it. But I'm here to tell you that's not the case."" Meanwhile, Mr Tugendhat promised to slash fuel duty by 10p and reverse the recent rise in National Insurance payments if he became prime minister. ""I am here to make the case that our economy can only prosper if we believe that people - and not Westminster - know best how to spend their money,"" he said. Addressing his lack of ministerial experience, Mr Tugendhat said: ""The reality is that the job of prime minister is unlike every other job in government. ""It's not a management job; it's not a departmental job. It's a job that demands vision and leadership."" Tuesday 12 July- nominations to get on the ballot open, closing at 18:00 BST Wednesday 13 July- first round of voting among Tory MPs Thursday 14 July- likely date for second round of voting Monday 18 July- likely date for third round of voting, if required Thursday 21 July- deadline for deciding final two candidates Monday 5 September- winner announced Mr Johnson - whose premiership collapsed as ministers criticised and quit over his handling of Partygate and other scandals -will not be endorsingany of the candidates.

They each have 12 minutes to speak Successful contenders will go through to a vote on Wednesday, with the final two candidates selected before the end of next week The winner will be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates - please join us then. Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds.

They are Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi. Each has the backing of at least 20 fellow MPs. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti MP withdrew from the contest just minutes before the deadline. The first ballot and its result happen on Wednesday. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch MP has also been tweeting, sharing her gratitude after making it through to the final eight. Allow Twitter content?

The eight candidates are just about to start speaking at the first hustings in Parliament. They're getting 12 minutes each to try to persuade Conservative MPs they should be the one to take over as party leader and prime minister. They're going to be speaking in this order: Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Nadhim Zahawim and then Penny Mordaunt. We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid withdraws from the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader. He says: ""Serving in government is a true privilege. It has been just seven days since I took the difficult decision to resign from the most important job I have ever had, as health secretary during a pandemic."" ""Since then, I have set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country."" ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again."" ""There is an abundance of both ideas and talent in our party. One of the candidates will be given the honour of becoming prime minister."" ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Generations of children exploited, inquiry findsAgencies blamed children rather than perpetrators for the abuse they suffered, its chairman says.Shropshire","The report found agencies dismissed reports of child exploitation as ""child prostitution"". Obvious evidence of child sex crimes in Telford was ignored for generations leading to more than 1,000 girls being abused, an inquiry has found. Agencies blamed children for the abuse they suffered, not the perpetrators, and exploitation was not investigated because of ""nervousness about race"". The inquiry was set up after theSunday Mirror revealed gangs had been abusing girls in the town since the 1980s,external. Chairman Tom Crowther QC said the abuse had thrived unchecked for decades. His report makes 47 recommendations for improvement by agencies involved. West Mercia Police has apologised ""unequivocally"" for past events as has Telford & Wrekin Council. Street pastors have reported seeing men in cars approaching girls as they left pubs and nightclubs. The report found agencies dismissed reports of child exploitation as ""child prostitution"". Mr Crowther said: ""The overwhelming theme of the evidence has been the appalling suffering of generations of children caused by the utter cruelty of those who committed child sexual exploitation. ""Victims and survivors repeatedly told the inquiry how, when they were children, adult men worked to gain their trust before ruthlessly betraying that trust, treating them as sexual objects or commodities. This video can not be played Telford inquiry: Survivor says her abusers 'hold no power' ""Countless children were sexually assaulted and raped. They were deliberately humiliated and degraded. They were shared and trafficked. They were subjected to violence and their families were threatened. ""They lived in fear and their lives were forever changed. They have asked, over the years: how was this allowed to happen?"" Other key report findings include: Teachers and social workers being discouraged from reporting abuse Offenders becoming ""emboldened"" by the absence of police action, with abuse continuing for years without concerted response Exploitation was not investigated because of nervousness about race, that investigating concerns against Asian men, in particular, would inflame ""racial tensions"" Even after an investigation leading to seven men being jailed for child sex crimes West Mercia Police and Telford & Wrekin Council scaled down their specialist teams ""to virtual zero"" in order to save money Seven men were jailed in 2012 following Operation Chalice, an investigation into child sexual exploitation The investigation was known as Operation Chalice and saw two Telford brothers among those jailed. A court heard the brothers sexually abused, trafficked and prostituted, or tried to prostitute, four teenagers between March 2008 and December 2009. The report found the most common way children were exploited was through a ""boyfriend"" model, where a child would meet a man, who would persuade them to become his girlfriend. Perpetrators, it said, sought out ""vulnerable"" children and would begin giving them lifts, buying them food, alcohol or cigarettes which led to the children becoming involved in sexual activity with the men as a ""favour"" as payment for the gifts. 'There were lots of adults, nobody asked questions' Telford child abuse inquiry: What do we know? Telford to commission child abuse probe Most of those responsible for the abuse did not use contraception and ""pregnancies were expected to be (and in many cases were) terminated."" Some of those abused went on to bear the perpetrator's children. In several cases, victims received death threats against them or their families if they tried to end the abuse. Lucy Lowe was 14 when she became pregnant by taxi driver Azhar Ali Mehmood The report references the case ofLucy Lowe, 16,who died along with her 17-year-old sister and mother in a house fire started by Azhar Ali Mehmood, 26, the father of her daughter. She had become pregnant at 14 to Mehmood. The report continued to say children were often abused in nightclubs and takeaways with witnesses also describing a ""rape house"" in Wellington, Telford, to which young people were taken. Within schools, it said, there was a ""reluctance"" to report concerning activity without ""concrete proof"" which was an ""overly cautious approach"", while ""obvious"" indicators like absences and changes in behaviour went unremarked by school staff. The report said, in the most recent figures from the first six months of 2020, police received 172 referrals related to child exploitation. The ""dreadful, life altering crime has not gone away - in Telford or elsewhere,"" the report said. It also outlines recent police evidence of ""an unacceptable, and quite frankly offensive attitude"", towards child abuse victims, with ""disparaging language being used"". The report said the crime ""has not gone away - in Telford or elsewhere"" In his statement, Mr Crowther said he looked back as far as 1989 to draw his conclusions, but had heard from victims exploited as long ago as the 1970s. ""I saw references to exploitation being 'generational'; having come to be regarded as 'normal' by perpetrators and inevitable by victims and survivors some of whose parents had been through similar experiences,"" he said. He urged agencies to accept the recommendations made in the report and hoped the report ""goes some way"" to giving a voice to the survivors. If you have been affected by anything in this report, support is available through theBBC's Action Line. Mr Crowther recommended the formation of a joint review team to publish an annual report on child abuse in Telford. Following the inquiry's publication, survivor Joanne Phillips, who gave evidence said: ""Victims were being identified as child prostitutes. Once you have been convicted that label will never leave you. ""Prosecutions are damaging to your life. ""Some children went to prison for not paying the fines. Convictions should be completely expunged. ""Today I feel incredibly proud of the girls in Telford....I cannot express enough how proud I am for seeing this through and their resilience and bravery."" Lucy Allan MP described the report as ""damning and devastating"" Lucy Allan, the MP for Telford, who has been campaigning on the issue since 2016, said: ""Today is a very important day for victims and survivors of CSE, not just in Telford but right across the country because this report is damning, it is devastating. ""There are clear patterns that existed well before this report was commissioned that people knew about CSE, we had had high profile court cases in Telford and we should have taken learnings from that and we quite clearly didn't. ""The saddest thing is that victims and survivors, their voices weren't heard, they weren't taken seriously and that should never have happened."" The report's recommendations should be adopted by local authorities around the country, she said. Telford & Wrekin Council said it has made 'significant improvement' in recent years Telford and Wrekin Council has said it ""apologises wholeheartedly"" to the victims. ""Child sexual exploitation is a vile crime that disgusts us and all right thinking people. ""The independent inquiry acknowledges we have made significant improvements in recent years."" It said it was working to provide support for victims and it was already carrying out many of the inquiry's recommendations. West Mercia Police issued an apology to survivors Assistant Chief Constable Richard Cooper, of West Mercia Police, said he would like to say sorry to the survivors and all those affected in Telford. ""While there were no findings of corruption, our actions fell far short of the help and protection you should have had from us, it was unacceptable, we let you down. It is important we now take time to reflect critically and carefully on the content of the report and the recommendations that have been made,"" he said. He said the force now has teams dedicated to preventing and tackling child exploitation and works better together with organisations to safeguard children. The Inquiry was set up three years ago after several criminal prosecutions brought the problems to light. The chairman, Tom Crowther QC, heard evidence from dozens of survivors of abuse. Countless children were sexually assaulted and raped. They were deliberately humiliated and degraded. They were shared and trafficked. They were subjected to violence and their families were threatened. They lived in fear and their lives were forever changed. They have asked, over the years: how was this allowed to happen?"" The answer, Mr Crowther believes, is the authorities had ignored obvious signs of child exploitation; had blamed the children and not the perpetrators, and in many cases wouldn't investigate cases because of ""nervousness about race"". West Mercia Police and the council scaled down their specialist child sexual exploitation teams to virtually zero - to save money. By 2015 the provision from both had in some ways gone back almost a decade. Two police investigations - Operation Chalice in 2012 and Operation Vapour in 2019 - led to 10 men of south Asian descent being convicted of sexual offences against young girls . But the inquiry has spoken to victims of exploitation from many more communities. West Mercia Police and Crime Commissioner, John Campion, said victims and survivors had been let down. ""I cannot say with absolute certainty, just because lessons have been learnt, that it will never happen again. ""However, my drive as PCC remains resolute to ensure the system, that is there to keep people safe, continues building on the progress that has been made."" Shropshire Council, which neighbours Telford & Wrekin said these crimes are ""happening right across the country"". It said awareness of the crime is now ""far greater"" and it has ""safeguards"" in place to help people living in the area. The Rev Keith Osmund-Smith, is part of the Street Pastors in Telford, a group of volunteers who work to help keep people safe while out at night. While working as West Mercia Police's chaplain, he went on sabbatical after he told a national newspaper he doubted if information passed to West Mercia Police officers about child sex exploitation was always acted on. He waslater reinstated. Keith Osmund-Smith says abuse is still going on He said he was glad matters raised had been addressed after being concerned police and local authority were not seeing young people as ""victims"". ""At ground level police officers were very concerned about what was going on but there was almost a cost-cutting exercise in the councilâ¦and also in the police where it became too expensive,"" he said. ""It is still happening and there is still no room for complacency, I think we are much better equipped to deal with it."" Mark Berry reported concerns seen at a night time cafe in Wellington Mark Berry formerly ran a project which operated a night cafe from a Methodist church in Wellington and street teams operating around nightclubs, supporting vulnerable people, including young girls. ""They would come into the cafe or we would talk to them outside and we began to hear stories about why they felt vulnerable, particularly on the streets, that there were groups of guys who were, what we would call now, grooming them, offering them gifts, wanting to take them to parties, things like that,"" he said. He said the staff would see men in cars approaching girls as they left pubs and nightclubs. ""These guys weren't going into the clubs, they weren't part of the normal night time life, the entertainment life, it felt like they were specifically there for this purpose,"" he said. He said girls would tell them how they felt ""vulnerable"", ""hassled"" and ""harassed"", which they reported to the police officers who they now know were heading up the Operation Chalice inquiry. Mr Berry said Telford had ""pulled together"" in the wake of investigations into exploitation Mr Berry said the town had ""pulled together"" in the wake of the investigation and added the inquiry was ""crucial"" for understanding what had happened. ""There needs to be justice and there needs to be resolution for the victims and for the wider community and people want that to happen,"" he said.

"Gary Speed's mum on sadness that never goes awayThe mum of the former Wales football boss opens up more than a decade after he took his own life.WalesDon't demonise Johnson, Sunak warns ToriesThe ex-chancellor launches his own party leadership bid, calling his former boss a ""remarkable"" man.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Gary Speed's mother is urging people to open up about their mental health Gary Speed's mother has spoken at length about the sadness that ""never goes away,"" more than a decade after the ex-footballer took his own life. The former Wales manager was found dead at his home in November 2011. He was widely credited with reigniting Welsh football fortunes and setting them on the road to the 2022 World Cup. His mother Carol said she would never find the answer to why he died but urged others to talk about their mental health - and get help. ""It's just something that you don't ever get over at all,"" she said, speaking openly about the former Leeds, Newcastle and Everton midfielder in one of the first public interviews since he died. ""You know, you can smile and you can laugh, and you can have a good day, but it's always there. The sadness is always there."" Families bereaved by suicide ask for more help Football academies: A failed dream 'sends you to a dark place' Speed's parents Roger and Carol say they miss their son ""every day"" Now retired, Carol Speed still shares the modest semi-detached home in Deeside, Flintshire, where the Welsh sporting giant grew up with her husband Roger, Speed's father. Roger now lives with dementia, and Carol cares for him. They both still treasure the memories of their son captured in scores of photos, shirts and pennants adorning walls around the house. It is a shrine to a footballing star who was loved by both his family and fans, but will always remain 42. A star in the making - just two of the precious photographs Speed's parents still cherish Speed's road to success started early as a winning player for Deeside Primary Schools Outside, Carol has been joking about how a young Gary would constantly kick a ball against the garage door, so hard he broke it. The lush green lawn at the back of the house was once worn bare by the teen's kickabouts. The Aston Park field where Speed used to play has been renamed in his honour Not much more than a stone's throw from their front door stands the playground and field that marks Aston Park, where Speed honed his footballing skills with schoolmates. Today, a stone plinth and benchmark a memorialto Queensferry's lost hero. At an inquest 10 years ago, the coroner said he could not be satisfied Speed had intended to kill himself. He left behind his wife Louise and two sons, Tommy and Ed, who were just teenagers when he died. 2012 memorial game: Chris Coleman has stayed in touch with Carol after he succeeded Speed as Wales boss For Carol, questions about the death still haunt her. ""I'll never find the answer to why. That makes it doubly hard to live with,"" she said. ""You know, if people are ill and they die, then you know why, but we didn't. We just didn't know with Gary. ""No answers whatsoever - no. And that's hard - that's hard. Because we didn't have any idea he was feeling like that. Afraid to talk? Mental health and elite sports Tyson Fury: How do other sports support mental health? ""He never showed it. He was always smiling. ""We couldn't keep an eye on him, because we didn't think there was anything wrong."" Her son was ""always smiling"" and kept any mental health fears hidden away In words perhaps only a mother could utter, she added: ""If I'd had been there that evening it wouldn't have happened. No way - no way. ""Gary wasn't short of money, he had a nice house, a nice family - a job that he absolutely adored. So, if it can happen to someone like him, it can happen to anyone, can't it?"" The death of Gary Speed was marked by a national outpouring of grief, from supporters at his former clubs - Leeds, Newcastle, Everton, and Bolton - and, of course, the Wales national team. There was an outpouring from fans after Speed's death - here just one of the tributes at Leeds United ""He'd only just gone to Sheffield United, so I was shocked when he took the Welsh job,"" recalled Carol. ""He said: 'You don't turn your country down', you know. ""I'm just glad he did well with them, for the short time he was with them."" Wales World Cup 2022: Coleman on Speed's impact 'We'll go toe-to-toe with anyone' says Wales' Page She said while the entire family still struggles with the loss of the footballer, the support from fans a decade on remains ""unbelievable"". ""People are remembered on sort of anniversaries of their death and things like that, but there's always something going on about Gary. It is very touching. ""We always thought he was a good lad, he was our lad and we thought he was wonderful - but so did everybody else. ""I can't believe that people are still talking about him, really."" Speed is seen as laying the foundation for Wales to qualify for the 2022 World Cup However, it has taken Carol over a decade to be able to watch football again. She said she could always envisage her son on the pitch or touchline, and that had been unbearable. ""I couldn't watch football at all for 10 years and didn't want to know about football at all,"" said Carol. ""I'm enjoying it again now. I don't know whether I blamed football - I don't know."" It means she will be closely following Wales' progress as the side heads to Qatar for the World Cup. ""When I first started watching Wales again, it felt a bit strange, but I'm past that now,"" she added. Carol was also certain how her son would feel about qualification: ""He'd be over the moon. He'd be really, really into it, he would. I think that was his goal really. ""He wanted to get them there, definitely."" Qualified: Gareth Bale roars as Wales win through to the World Cup finals in Qatar It will be 11 years since his death when Wales walk out for their Group B games in Qatar in November, with the anniversary falling between matches against Iran and England. Speed's mother said discussions around mental health, especially for men, had undergone an important change since his death. ""It was never spoken about. It never even crossed my mind. I couldn't believe it when Gary did what he did. I was just numb. Huw Edwards says depression left him bedridden âI got PTSD after witnessing my daughterâs birthâ ""But it seems to have been all brought out since Gary, and people are not frightened to talk about it anymore."" She said the message was simple: ""Speak to someone even though it's hard. ""Because they had no idea what it does to the family. It just breaks people up, completely. ""It certainly has, our life. It's ruined our life completely.""

Lego pull out of Russia 'indefinitely',"Lego, the Danish toymaking giant, has said it will stop operating in Russia indefinitely due to ""continued extensive disruption"". The firmstopped delivering products to Russia in March,externalfollowing the invasion of Ukraine, but its shops remained open as most rival retailers pulled out. Lego said it would now end its partnership with Inventive Retail Group which runs 81 shops on Lego's behalf. It did not mention Russia's invasion of Ukraine for pulling out of Russia. A spokeswoman for Lego said: ""When the Lego Group stopped shipments to Russia in early March, we also ceased all commercial activity and put almost all our employees on extended leave."" The company said it was cutting most of its Moscow-based team and has ""provided 70 employees with financial packages to support them as they look for new opportunities"". Lego is one of a handful of Western brands that remained in Russia after other major companies shut their sites following the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine which was launched on 24 February. Some companies sold their products through franchisees in Russia and had to unwind complex partnerships with third party firms. McDonald's announced in May that it would close its sites in Russia which were later sold to a local company. The restaurants were ""de-arched"" and rebranded ""Tasty and that's it"". Unlike a number of companies who have condemned Russia, Lego has decided not to directly comment on the country's actions. In March, Lego said: ""Our thoughts are with all the children and families suffering as a result of the war in Ukraine."" A few years ago, the Danish company provoked a backlash when it emerged that it refused to sell a bulk order of its plastic bricks to the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Ai had used Lego to create portraits of dissident figures who had been jailed or exiled, such as Nelson Mandela, in the US and had planned a similar exhibition in Australia. However, he said Lego had told the museum in Melbourne its bricks could not be used for art containing ""any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements"". The decision was widely condemned andLego ended up changing its policy. In the wake of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a growing number of Western firms which initially suspended business in Russia are now deciding to pull out altogether. US sportswear giant Nike and coffee chain Starbucks have both now retreated entirely from the Russian market, after suspending trading there in March. Car firm Renault has also sold its business in the country. The French firm said its 68% stake in carmaker Avtovaz would be sold to a Russian science institute, while its shares in Renault Russia will go to the city of Moscow. Networking giant Cisco also said it would start to fully shut down operations in Russia and Belarus. Other well-known firms such as L'Oreal and rival Estee Lauder both said they would close shops and stop online sales but have not announced plans to permanently withdraw. Russia was the fifth largest European retail market globally last year, valued at Â£337.2bn, so some firms have been reluctant to burn bridges.

Patel says she will not stand in race to be new PM,"Eight candidates make it onto the ballot for the Conservative Party leadership contest Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi received the support of at least 20 MPs Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti withdraw from the contest just minutes before the deadline Candidates are pitching their bids to fellow Tory MPs at a closed hustings in Westminster. They each have 12 minutes to speak Successful contenders will go through to a vote on Wednesday, with the final two candidates selected before the end of next week The winner will be announced on 5 September Edited by Chris Giles We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates - please join us then. Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds. This video can not be played Sir Graham Brady announces top eight Tory leadership candidates Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative Party's 1922 Committee, which organises leadership contests, announces the names of the eight Conservative leadership contenders. They are Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi. Each has the backing of at least 20 fellow MPs. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti MP withdrew from the contest just minutes before the deadline. The first ballot and its result happen on Wednesday. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch MP has also been tweeting, sharing her gratitude after making it through to the final eight. Allow Twitter content?

The eight candidates are just about to start speaking at the first hustings in Parliament. They're getting 12 minutes each to try to persuade Conservative MPs they should be the one to take over as party leader and prime minister. They're going to be speaking in this order: Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Nadhim Zahawim and then Penny Mordaunt. We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid withdraws from the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader. He says: ""Serving in government is a true privilege. It has been just seven days since I took the difficult decision to resign from the most important job I have ever had, as health secretary during a pandemic."" ""Since then, I have set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country."" ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again."" ""There is an abundance of both ideas and talent in our party. One of the candidates will be given the honour of becoming prime minister."" ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gary Lineker stays top of BBC star pay listThe Match of the Day presenter takes home Â£1.35m, with Radio 2's Zoe Ball the next highest earner.Entertainment & Arts","Gary Lineker was paid Â£1.36m for presenting Match of the Day and Sports Personality of the Year Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has topped a list of the BBC's best-paid stars for a fifth year in a row, taking Â£1.35m in the last financial year. That's slightly down on the Â£1.36m he earned in the previous year, which came after he took a pay cut from Â£1.75m. Radio 2 breakfast show host Zoe Ball is second on the new list, with Â£980,000. She also previously earned more but took a 28% pay cut at the end of 2020. She's one of three women in this year's top 10, down from four last year. Fiona Bruce and Vanessa Feltz have also made the cut again, but 6 Music's Lauren Laverne has dropped out of the top 10 after her pay fell by Â£15,000 to Â£380,000. See the list in full The figures were published in the corporation's latest annual report, which also revealed a sharp drop in the time UK adults spend watching TV every day. Average viewing dropped from eight hours 11 minutes in 2020/21 to seven hours 12 minutes in 2021/22, although part of that fall may be explained by people watching less than they did during the height of the pandemic. However, iPlayer usage has increased by around 12%. Meanwhile, 90% of the British population continues to use BBC services each week. The star salaries list does not include all presenters and actors because the corporation's commercial arm BBC Studios, which makes many of programmes, does not have to publish its talent spend. So for example, Claudia Winkleman is only listed for her weekly Radio 2 show and not for presenting Strictly Come Dancing, which is made by BBC Studios. Graham Norton has dropped off the list entirely after he left his Saturday Radio 2 show in December 2020, while the fee for his TV chat show, which is made for BBC One by his commercial company So Television, is not listed. Seventy-four on-air people earning more than Â£150,000 were listed this year, with the gender split similar to last year - 41 men (55%) and 33 women (45%). Previous director general Tony Hall had pledged that the gap would be closed by 2020. Zoe Ball took a Â£380,000 pay cut, which now puts her in the Â£980,000-a-year band Radio 1 breakfast host Greg James is the only new entry in the top 10, with Huw Edwards the only name apart from Lineker in the top 10 to have seen a pay reduction. The news presenter's earnings fell from Â£425,000 in 2020/21 to Â£410,000 in 2021/22. Some had an increase, with Alan Shearer getting a Â£60,000 pay bump. He now takes home Â£450,000 a year for his work on football shows including Match of the Day. Scott Mills, who is moving from Radio 1 to take up Steve Wright's afternoon slot on Radio 2 later this year, had an increase of Â£15,000. Wright also had a Â£15,000 pay rise, although his salary is likely to be reduced next year when he leaves his current daytime show. The gender pay gap widened for the first time since the BBC began recording its figures in 2017. It now stands at 5.9%, up on last year's 5.2%. The BBC said this could be down to several factors, including attrition - the loss of employees through retirement, redundancy or resignation who are not subsequently replaced. While there was no pay gap for ethnic minority BBC staff members in last year's report, there is now a gap of 1.6%, while the disability pay gap increased from 4% to 5.9%. The wage bill for all on-air talent overall is down slightly at Â£129.8m. Last year it was Â£130m. BBC director general Tim Davie said some of the pay increases were down to ""people this year taking on more responsibility and doing more shows"". He said the corporation was ""showing restraint when the market is [being] driven by extreme hyperinflation"". He said the pay list was ""a source of a lot of understandable attention"", but added: ""Actually if you step back, the actual amount paid for that group of talent, which only represents a tiny fraction of the 200,000-odd people who come on our airwaves every year... the return we get in terms of audience value is very strong. ""And actually our research shows people want to see the best people presenting and delivering for the BBC."" A number of high-profile broadcasters who have left the BBC during the last year still appear on the latest list, including former North America editor Jon Sopel, former Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, and Andrew Marr, who said he was leaving the corporation for LBC to ""get his voice back"". Mr Davie said: ""There are obviously headlines around individuals and some regretted losses, but actually our number in terms of the people being retained in the BBC is high."" He added that there was ""no shortage of demand"" for top positions at the broadcaster, but stressed the importance of bringing ""new talent"" through the BBC, which would always mean a ""degree of change"". The total bill for the BBC's executive board, including non-executives, was Â£4.3m, down from Â£4.8m in 2020/2021. But as has already been announced, Mr Davie's salary has increased from Â£494,000 to Â£522,000. The BBC is facing cutbacks after the government announced in January that it would freeze the licence fee for two years. Mr Davie told BBC Radio 4's Today programmeearlier this year that the settlement would ""affect our frontline output"". Asked what might be cut, he said ""everything's on the agenda"". The director general also told reporters the BBC would deliver a report into complaints made about former Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ Tim Westwood within the next two weeks. In April, Westwood was accused of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, which he strongly denies. Shortly afterwards,Mr Davie saidthe BBC had  ""seen no evidence"" of complaints being received about the hip-hop presenter's conduct. However,last week it was revealedthat the BBC had actually received six complaints, including one that had previously been referred to the police. ""We did an initial round of analysis of HR files, which didn't show something,"" Mr Davie said on Tuesday. ""That was why I made that statement, which was my understanding at that time."" An internal audit is now being carried out, he said.

Do Tory leadership tax pledges add up?Contenders have promised a range of tax cuts but given little detail about how they will be funded.UK PoliticsComments,"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about.""

The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money?

""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"".

Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism.

BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows.""

The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s.

Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut. He has not specified where the cuts in spending would be. He plans to go ahead with increases to corporation tax, but says he is planning to bring in ways to make it cheaper for companies to invest at the same time.

Heathrow tells airlines not to sell summer ticketsThe UK's biggest airport has been struggling to cope with the rebound in demand for air travel.,"Heathrow Airport has told airlines to stop selling summer tickets, as the UK's biggest airport struggles to cope with the rebound in air travel. The airport is limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000, 4,000 fewer than currently scheduled. The cap on passenger numbers will be in place from now until 11 September. Thousands of UK travellers have been affected by disruption in recent weeks, including last-minute cancellations. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for holidays has returned. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up. Consumer group Which? urged Heathrow to clarify which flights would be cancelled as a result of the latest announcement. ""While this cap may ease the unacceptable chaos passengers are facing at the UK's biggest airport, thousands of people will now be worrying about whether their flight or holiday plans are about to fall apart,"" said Guy Hobbs, acting editor of Which? Travel. ""Heathrow must work with airlines to quickly provide clarity on which flights are being cut, and airlines need to be upfront with those passengers affected about their right to be rebooked at the earliest opportunity, including on services from other airlines."" A Heathrow spokesperson said it would take ""a couple of days"" for airlines to work with the scheduling company, Airport Coordination Limited, to decide what changes would be needed. Heathrow cuts flights and warns more could come Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Ministers told carriers to review their plans after chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff. In addition, a temporary government ""amnesty"" to the rules on airport slots was put in place, allowing airlines to change their summer schedules without facing a potential penalty. But despite this, Heathrow said airlines were still planning to operate flights carrying more daily passengers than could be processed in an acceptable manner. ""Over the past few weeks, as departing passenger numbers have regularly exceeded 100,000 a day, we have started to see periods when service drops to a level that is not acceptable: long queue times, delays for passengers requiring assistance, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late, low punctuality and last-minute cancellations,"" said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye. ""Our assessment is that the maximum number of daily departing passengers that airlines, airline ground handlers and the airport can collectively serve over the summer is no more than 100,000. ""The latest forecasts indicate that even despite the amnesty, daily departing seats over the summer will average 104,000 - giving a daily excess of 4,000 seats. On average only about 1,500 of these 4,000 daily seats have currently been sold to passengers, and so we are asking our airline partners to stop selling summer tickets to limit the impact on passengers."" But Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association and a former head of British Airways (BA), was sharply critical of Heathrow's move. ""To tell airlines to stop selling - what a ridiculous thing for an airport to say to an airline,"" Mr Walsh told Reuters. ""I am surprised Heathrow have not been able to get their act together better than this. Airlines have been predicting stronger traffic than Heathrow has been predicting... they clearly got it completely wrong."" He added: ""Heathrow are trying to maximise the profitability that they get from the airport at the expense of airlines."" It's a painful admission for Heathrow - but one that could be considered inevitable. The airport has been struggling to cope with a surge in passengers, following the removal of Covid-related travel restrictions. The results haven't been pretty. Long queues, delays, last-minute cancellations, busloads of orphaned bags and plenty of very angry travellers. Staff shortages have been a key problem - although Heathrow places most of the blame on airlines for failing to bring in enough ground handling workers. But some airline people tell a very different story. They claim Heathrow drastically underestimated passenger numbers, despite plenty of warnings, and accuse the airport of ""terrible mismanagement"". It has even been suggested Heathrow deliberately ""lowballed"" its passenger forecasts, as part of a campaign for permission to raise charges on airlines. Heathrow isn't alone in introducing restrictions.Gatwick imposed a lid on daily flights several weeks ago. But its move looks set to cause further aggravation for travellers during what has already become a pretty miserable summer. Heathrow'spassenger numbers have continued to riseas it recovers from the pandemic. But they are still below pre-coronavirus levels, when the airport saw roughly 110,000 to 125,000 daily departures. Mr Holland-Kaye apologised to passengers whose travel plans might be affected by the move. ""But this is the right thing to do to provide a better, more reliable journey and to keep everyone working at the airport safe."" Virgin Atlantic said it ""stands ready to deliver its full schedule this summer"". ""However, we support proactive measures being taken by Heathrow to reduce disruption, as long as action proposed does not disproportionately impact home carriers at the airport. ""Action should be based on thorough analysis showing the most effective measures to improve the situation and keep customers moving."" Are you concerned about booking a holiday?

SAS killings: How a scandal was uncovered,"Panorama has revealed disturbing evidence of war crimes by the SAS in Afghanistan - and of subsequent attempts to cover them up. Hannah O'Grady describes how a series of alleged murders of civilians was finally brought to light. Getting to the bottom of this story involved four years of painstaking detective work. Crucial to this was a cache of internal emails from within the headquarters of UK Special Forces (UKSF) - the military directorate that oversees the SAS. These contained a handful of details about previously classified deadly raids that senior UKSF officers had considered suspicious back in 2011. At the time, British troops were still fighting the Taliban alongside allies in Afghanistan. We were able to see these emails because they were included in court documents from a judicial review into a night raidpreviously investigatedby Panorama in 2019, which brought to light evidence that the UK military had failed to properly investigate a series of suspected civilian murders in Afghanistan. We knew from sources within the Royal Military Police (RMP) that investigators believed that suspect killings were far more widespread than the three incidents featured in our initial programme. But all we had to go on from the court documents were around a dozen dates of when the raids took place, and sometimes the number of people killed. We had no way of identifying where they had occurred from the documents alone. RMP investigators had been prevented by armed forces headquarters from visiting the sites in question. Our RMP sources also told us a lack of co-operation from UKSF prevented them from interviewing senior Special Forces officers and that they suspected pressure had been exerted from on high when they were ordered not to view potentially crucial aerial footage of the operations. The Ministry of Defence spokesman said that British forces ""served with courage and professionalism in Afghanistan"" and were always held to the ""highest standards"". The MoD said it could not comment on specific allegations, but that declining to comment should not be taken as acceptance of the allegations' factual accuracy. Then we had a breakthrough. A source - who must remain anonymous - handed us hundreds of contemporaneous military reports. They didn't disclose the precise location of the raids, but they did offer potentially vital clues about what had happened during each one. We trawled through hundreds of these operational accounts. Then we spent months trying to work out where they had taken place. To do this, we scoured press cuttings looking for incidents that might match those in the court documents - our colleagues in BBC Monitoring had archived and translated local language news coverage from 2011. Panorama was also given access to a leaked US military log. Combing through that, we looked for events that might match a British night raid. We spoke to journalists who had covered the conflict, including incredibly brave local reporters, as well as soldiers and other British officials in Afghanistan. Together, this gave Panorama enough to travel to Afghanistan and speak to witnesses, who would give their evidence for the first time. View of southern Afghanistan from a military helicopter The US military log had given us a map grid reference that led us to the village of Nad Ali, in Helmand province. There the Panorama team met Haji Habibullah - a charismatic, bear-like man in his 70s whose neighbours treated him like an elder. But his demeanour changed when he described the killing of his two young sons aged 16 and 20. Remembering what happened to them, Habibullah broke down and wept. In the early hours of 7 February 2011, Habibullah's sons, Samiullah and Nisar Ahmad, had been sleeping in a single-room guesthouse in the grounds of the family home. Alongside them were seven mourners who had come to the village for a funeral. Then four helicopters carrying SAS personnel landed in the nearby fields - and soon, all nine people in the guesthouse were dead. Haji Habibullah Haji Habibullah's home in Nad Ali According to the official SAS account of the incident, they had believed the property was linked to a Taliban leader. As the troops entered the compound, the SAS said, several insurgents opened fire - so the SAS then shot back, killing those in the guesthouse. The report adds that three AK-47 rifles were recovered in the raid. But that wasn't how Habibullah remembered it. All those who died had been unarmed civilians, he said, unconnected to the Taliban. He took the BBC team to the guesthouse. It had been bricked up - the memory of his sons' deaths had made it too painful to use again. ""When I remember them it hurts me so much,"" Habibullah said. Panorama examined the guesthouse, measuring and photographing marks on the walls. Fragments of what appeared to be bullets were still present, embedded in the wall. All but one set of bullet holes were in clusters less than 75cm from the floor. After returning from Afghanistan, Panorama showed the photographs and measurements to an expert in UKSF weaponry, who said multiple rounds appeared to have been fired from above - which suggested the men had been shot while they were lying down or sitting against the wall, and not in a firefight. We also discovered that several years after the shootings, RMP investigators had viewed photographs of the scene, taken in the immediate aftermath, and drawn the same conclusion. SAS Death Squads Exposed: A British War Crime? British special forces killed hundreds of people on night raids in Afghanistan, but were some of the shootings executions? BBC Panorama's Richard Bilton uncovers new evidence and tracks down eyewitnesses. Watch now on BBC iPlayer One military police officer told us they also thought the low height of the bullet marks in the wall significantly undermined the SAS's version of events. But because of the obstruction they faced from others within the military and the Ministry of Defence, the RMP had felt they stood little chance of prosecuting anyone for murder. In its statement, the MoD said: ""No new evidence has been presented, but the Service Police will consider any allegations should new evidence come to light."" Moreover, Habibullah described how all nine men had been shot cleanly to the head or chest - a common characteristic of a deliberate SAS shooting at close range. The raid was also suspiciously similar to another SAS operation we had looked at in our 2019 investigation, in which everyone inside a guesthouse had been killed, including a 12 and 14 year old boy, with clusters of bullet holes left close to the floor. And indeed, it appeared that guesthouses were specifically targeted - a source who served with the SAS in Afghanistan told us it became an unofficial ""policy"" to kill everyone they encountered inside one, whether they were armed or not. It is notable that while nine people - suspected insurgents, according to the SAS - were killed in the Nad Ali raid, only three guns were recovered in the SAS's version of events. Habibullah's insistence that those who died were not armed raised the possibility of the use of so-called ""drop weapons"" - planted to make it appear that defenceless people had been armed when they were killed. We spoke to people who had served with the SAS squadron who confirmed they had witnessed AK-47s  being planted in this way. In the immediate aftermath of the Nad Ali incident, there were suspicions that something had gone terribly wrong. Back at Special Forces HQ in London, in a secret memo, a senior officer had shared concerns with the head of UK Special Forces. Another 2011 raid that matched one of the dates in the UKSF documents caught our attention. A small mention of civilian casualties in a local newspaper article helped us find it. Two days after the incident in Nad Ali, eight people were killed by the same unit during a raid on a home in the village of Khanano, in Musa Qala, towards the very north of Helmand. This time seven were shot dead in a guesthouse, and a further detainee was later killed inside the main house. The similarities with previous incidents were striking. Again, everyone in a guesthouse had been killed and, according to the SAS, fewer AK47s were recovered than the number of people shot dead. According to the SAS's operational account, an insurgent fired at the SAS as they approached and was killed. In the guesthouse they found four dead bodies, plus two armed men who were apparently responsible. These supposed insurgents were then shot and killed by the SAS, their official version of events said. Then, it continued, the other inhabitants of the house surrendered and were rounded up - and when another man was taken inside the main building to assist with the search, he picked up a concealed rifle and aimed it at the soldiers, so he too was shot dead. But people within UKSF told Panorama the SAS's account of the raid described a very unlikely set of events. We had learned from military police sources that the RMP had been concerned that blood patterns and other details in photos taken at the scene were not consistent with what the SAS claimed had taken place. We discovered senior UKSF officers had remarked in emails sent the following day that the incident was suspiciously similar to several other operations in which an Afghan man had been taken into a property after surrendering to the SAS, then supposedly grabbed a weapon and was shot before he could open fire. Panorama travelled to the scene and met Mohammad Daud, 43, a quiet, unassuming man who remembered the events of that night in stark detail. Daud told us two of his brothers - Mohammad Tahir, who was 15, and Abdul Zahir, 25 - had been killed along with five others staying in the guesthouse. Daud said that after the killings, he had discovered that two of the dead men may have been linked to the Taliban. He said they were strangers who had shown up on their doorstep asking for shelter - it's a common Afghan custom to offer travellers a room. But the family strongly denied that any of those who died had been armed or that they had fired on the SAS. According to Daud and his family, all seven men in the guesthouse were found lying dead inside the room. This does not tally with the SAS unit's own account that the first person killed by the SAS had been outdoors, threatening troops with an AK rifle. The military police had also been concerned about this inconsistency. Mohammad Daud Inside the guesthouse at Mohammad Daud's compound The report had said four men in the guesthouse were killed by insurgents, who were then in turn killed by the SAS. But the family described how all the men had been shot cleanly to the head or chest - as in the Nad Ali raid - which would be unusual in a firefight. The SAS had also claimed the insurgents had been positioned behind the dead men when they fired. But the family said all had gunshot wounds to the front of their bodies. Additionally, the family told us how the bullets had passed through most of the bodies into the bedding and the floor beneath them. Again, this looked like a series of close-range Special Forces killings from above. Daud showed us the guesthouse. It showed no obvious signs of indiscriminate or accidental firing. There were, however, bullet holes in the door and in the wall behind it. From the position the body of Daud's brother Mohammad Tahir was found in, they believe he was trying to open the door from the inside when he was shot. After the shootings in the guesthouse, Daud said, the SAS then moved on to the main building, where they summoned everyone into the courtyard. According to Daud and others present, the troops then checked their names against a list and asked his brother Ahmad Shah go back inside and open a curtain. Soon shots rang out and Ahmad Shah was dead. Ahmad Shah shared his name with the suspected leader of a Taliban bomb-making cell. Perhaps the troops were unaware, but it is a common name in Afghanistan. Daud and his family believe the carnage at their home was a result of mistaken identity.

Watch the investigation from 2019:War Crimes Scandal Exposed As we kept digging, we uncovered further incidents that followed the same pattern and matched the details of the operations that had caused so much concern among UKSF officers. An operation in Sangin on 12 March 2011 resulted in the deaths of eight members of the same family. The SAS's account stated its troops were attacked with small arms fire and a grenade. However, when the Panorama team went to visit the scene, the family denied that there had been any weapons in their home. They said each of the men killed were shot five or six times ""on their foreheads, mouth and on the face"". Haji Sadiquallah's compound in Sangin A low bullet mark on the wall of the guesthouse again suggested one of those killed may have been lying down when he was shot dead. Haji Sadiquallah told Panorama how his son and nephew were handcuffed, taken back inside separate rooms and shot dead. ""There was no AK-47, no grenade, no machine gun or any other weapon in our house,"" he said. ""They just say that to exonerate themselves. They say that to hide their violence - to legitimise what they did. It is a complete lie."" Haji Sadiquallah All in all, our evidence painted a disturbing picture - one that suggested war crimes had been committed by British Special Forces and that these had been covered up for years. Before we left him Habibullah took Panorama's team to visit the graves of his sons. These were simple graves, decorated with flags and colourful scraps of material, close to the family home. Habibullah said a prayer beside them and then fell silent. In a further statement today, the MoD said it believed Panorama had jumped to ""unjustified conclusions from allegations that have already been fully investigated"". It said: ""We have provided a detailed and comprehensive statement to Panorama, highlighting unequivocally how two Service Police operations carried out extensive and independent investigation into allegations about the conduct of UK forces in Afghanistan. ""Neither investigation found sufficient evidence to prosecute. Insinuating otherwise is irresponsible, incorrect and puts our brave Armed Forces personnel at risk both in the field and reputationally. ""The Ministry of Defence of course stands open to considering any new evidence, there would be no obstruction. But in the absence of this, we strongly object to this subjective reporting.""

How would the new 20mph speed limit law work?,"If you are driving in Wales the speed limit has been cut from 30mph to 20mph Motorists in Wales now have to limit their speed to 20mph in built-up areas such as village and town centres. In 2022, the Seneddvoted to make Wales the first nation in the UK to adopt 20mphas the default speed limit on restricted roads. It started on 17 September, and has proved controversial - but how does it work? Here we try our best to answer your queries. Ken Skates was named as new transport secretary in March. The next month hesaid 20mph zones should be targeted at schools, hospitals and nurseries. He said there would be changes to the existing default 20mph speed limit in built-up areas with the ""voice of citizens at the heart of all we do"". On Tuesday 23 April, Mr Skates said the process of switching some 20mph roads back to 30mph would start in September. He claimedhe was ""refining""the project and urged people to contact councils to tell them which streets should be examined. But the Tories said the 20mph default limit would stay and nothing had changed. The 20mph limit has come into force for all restricted roads, which are defined as roads with lampposts placed not more than 200 yards (about 180m) apart. They are typically located in residential and built-up areas of high pedestrian activity. Minister banned from driving for speeding Children steer car off M4 after mum faints The 20mph limit began on 17 September 2023. The new law to make Wales the first nation to impose 20mph as the default on all restricted roads was passed by the Welsh Parliament in July 2022. The proposal,externalwas given the go-ahead by 39 votes to 15, afterinitial backingin the Senedd two years previously. The 20mph limit has come into force for all restricted roads The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 said it was not lawful to drive a on a restricted road at more than 30mph. That was later amended to 20mph. Would you pick pedal power over petrol? How easy is it to drive across Wales in an electric car? Enforcement began on 8 January, 2024, and roadside teams will use speed monitoring equipment to catch offending motorists. If you are pulled over doing more than 20mph in a built-up area in Wales you could, in theory, be fined a minimum Â£100 and get three penalty points. But police said their response will be proportionate and reasonable while drivers get used to the change as the focus for the first 12 months will be on education - as officers have a level of discretion. ""Where we find people driving above 20mph, we will stop drivers and speak to them about the dangers and risks about driving above the speed limit,"" said South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Mark Travis. ""We won't be taking enforcement action against those people who are actually engaging with us and trying to bring their speed down - so they won't receive a fine. ""The people who will be fined will be those driving at the highest levels. Ultimately, if necessary, we will enforce - but that is always a last resort for us."" While police officers across Wales will initially be advised to use ""discretion"", all drivers will be fined if they are caught by a fixed speed camera. Receiving 12 or more points within three years may disqualify you from driving. Police in Wales have said they will try to educate and be reasonable with drivers adjusting to the 20mph speed limit If you are caught by a camera, depending on the speed, you will be sent an option for a speed awareness course, a fixed penalty notice or a letter telling you to go to court. If you are stopped by the police they can give you a verbal warning, send you a fixed penalty notice, offer a speed awareness course or order you to go to court. Instead of fines, speeding drivers will be offered the chance to watch a video about the dangers of speeding and the benefits of slowing down. Welsh government minister Lee Waters said there will be an ""education led"" approach to enforcement, as ""there's no incentive for us to fine because the money won't stay in Wales"". ""Police guidelines say enforcement will be targeted on drivers travelling 10% above the speed limit - plus 2mph,"" he said. ""For now this will be increased to 10% plus 4mph meaning we start to prosecute at 26mph in a 20mph limit."" As Mr Waters alluded to, the money collected from speeding fines in Wales goes to the UK government. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The money generated by 20mph speeding fines, as with all speeding fines, is directed to HM Treasury."" Speed limits in the Road Traffic Regulations and the Highway Code apply to motor vehicles only, and not to bicycles. But the Highway Code does state that cyclists should be considerate of other road users. The Welsh government has acknowledged the new lower limit is not appropriate everywhere and has said local authorities can make exceptions, though not outside schools. For example, Flintshire councilidentified 15 roadsthat could be exempt from the new policy. The Welsh government has produced aninteractive map,externalshowing the status of current and proposed exemptions to the 20mph speed limit. There has been a pilot scheme running in eight areas of Wales since 2021. They are St Dogmaels in Pembrokeshire, St Brides Major in the Vale of Glamorgan, Llanelli (north), Buckley in Flintshire, Cardiff (north), Cilfrew in Neath Porth Talbot, Abergavenny and Severnside (Caerwent, Caldicot, Magor and Undy) in Monmouthshire. Interim data shows the number of drivers complying with the 20mph speed limit rose from 45% at the start of the trial to 64%. Many areas of London now have 20mph as the default speed for residential roads, while Scotland plans to follow Wales' lead and make the policy nationwide by 2025. Many cities and towns across the UK now have 20mph zones as the norm for residential areas even if the local authority does not have a blanket policy across the whole area. The cost of bringing it in has been estimated at Â£33m. The Welsh Government said the Â£32.5m price tag was ""outweighed"" by reduced impact on the NHS and emergency services, which one study said could save Â£92m a year. The Welsh government said the direct financial cost of the policy falls ""almost entirely"" on its shoulders, and it is funding the capital works carried out by the local authorities through grants. Latestpolice data from 2022 show,externaled just over half - 51% - of the 4,442 people hurt in collisions in Wales happened on 30mph roads and in 23% of them, someone was killed or seriously injured. The total number of injuries fell by 23.5% compared to 2019. Campaigners argue the chances of someone surviving being hit by a car at 20mph rather than 30mph is seven times higher while stopping distances are almost halved. Ministers in the Senedd have been promoting sustainable travel - such as cycling or walking - after Walesdeclared a climate emergencyin 2019 and aims to becomecarbon net zero by 2050,external. They think a lower limit might encourage a change in behaviour.

Gary Lineker stays top of BBC salaries list,"Gary Lineker was paid Â£1.36m for presenting Match of the Day and Sports Personality of the Year Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has topped a list of the BBC's best-paid stars for a fifth year in a row, taking Â£1.35m in the last financial year. That's slightly down on the Â£1.36m he earned in the previous year, which came after he took a pay cut from Â£1.75m. Radio 2 breakfast show host Zoe Ball is second on the new list, with Â£980,000. She also previously earned more but took a 28% pay cut at the end of 2020. She's one of three women in this year's top 10, down from four last year. Fiona Bruce and Vanessa Feltz have also made the cut again, but 6 Music's Lauren Laverne has dropped out of the top 10 after her pay fell by Â£15,000 to Â£380,000. See the list in full The figures were published in the corporation's latest annual report, which also revealed a sharp drop in the time UK adults spend watching TV every day. Average viewing dropped from eight hours 11 minutes in 2020/21 to seven hours 12 minutes in 2021/22, although part of that fall may be explained by people watching less than they did during the height of the pandemic. However, iPlayer usage has increased by around 12%. Meanwhile, 90% of the British population continues to use BBC services each week. The star salaries list does not include all presenters and actors because the corporation's commercial arm BBC Studios, which makes many of programmes, does not have to publish its talent spend. So for example, Claudia Winkleman is only listed for her weekly Radio 2 show and not for presenting Strictly Come Dancing, which is made by BBC Studios. Graham Norton has dropped off the list entirely after he left his Saturday Radio 2 show in December 2020, while the fee for his TV chat show, which is made for BBC One by his commercial company So Television, is not listed. Seventy-four on-air people earning more than Â£150,000 were listed this year, with the gender split similar to last year - 41 men (55%) and 33 women (45%). Previous director general Tony Hall had pledged that the gap would be closed by 2020. Zoe Ball took a Â£380,000 pay cut, which now puts her in the Â£980,000-a-year band Radio 1 breakfast host Greg James is the only new entry in the top 10, with Huw Edwards the only name apart from Lineker in the top 10 to have seen a pay reduction. The news presenter's earnings fell from Â£425,000 in 2020/21 to Â£410,000 in 2021/22. Some had an increase, with Alan Shearer getting a Â£60,000 pay bump. He now takes home Â£450,000 a year for his work on football shows including Match of the Day. Scott Mills, who is moving from Radio 1 to take up Steve Wright's afternoon slot on Radio 2 later this year, had an increase of Â£15,000. Wright also had a Â£15,000 pay rise, although his salary is likely to be reduced next year when he leaves his current daytime show. The gender pay gap widened for the first time since the BBC began recording its figures in 2017. It now stands at 5.9%, up on last year's 5.2%. The BBC said this could be down to several factors, including attrition - the loss of employees through retirement, redundancy or resignation who are not subsequently replaced. While there was no pay gap for ethnic minority BBC staff members in last year's report, there is now a gap of 1.6%, while the disability pay gap increased from 4% to 5.9%. The wage bill for all on-air talent overall is down slightly at Â£129.8m. Last year it was Â£130m. BBC director general Tim Davie said some of the pay increases were down to ""people this year taking on more responsibility and doing more shows"". He said the corporation was ""showing restraint when the market is [being] driven by extreme hyperinflation"". He said the pay list was ""a source of a lot of understandable attention"", but added: ""Actually if you step back, the actual amount paid for that group of talent, which only represents a tiny fraction of the 200,000-odd people who come on our airwaves every year... the return we get in terms of audience value is very strong. ""And actually our research shows people want to see the best people presenting and delivering for the BBC."" A number of high-profile broadcasters who have left the BBC during the last year still appear on the latest list, including former North America editor Jon Sopel, former Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, and Andrew Marr, who said he was leaving the corporation for LBC to ""get his voice back"". Mr Davie said: ""There are obviously headlines around individuals and some regretted losses, but actually our number in terms of the people being retained in the BBC is high."" He added that there was ""no shortage of demand"" for top positions at the broadcaster, but stressed the importance of bringing ""new talent"" through the BBC, which would always mean a ""degree of change"". The total bill for the BBC's executive board, including non-executives, was Â£4.3m, down from Â£4.8m in 2020/2021. But as has already been announced, Mr Davie's salary has increased from Â£494,000 to Â£522,000. The BBC is facing cutbacks after the government announced in January that it would freeze the licence fee for two years. Mr Davie told BBC Radio 4's Today programmeearlier this year that the settlement would ""affect our frontline output"". Asked what might be cut, he said ""everything's on the agenda"". The director general also told reporters the BBC would deliver a report into complaints made about former Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ Tim Westwood within the next two weeks. In April, Westwood was accused of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, which he strongly denies. Shortly afterwards,Mr Davie saidthe BBC had  ""seen no evidence"" of complaints being received about the hip-hop presenter's conduct. However,last week it was revealedthat the BBC had actually received six complaints, including one that had previously been referred to the police. ""We did an initial round of analysis of HR files, which didn't show something,"" Mr Davie said on Tuesday. ""That was why I made that statement, which was my understanding at that time."" An internal audit is now being carried out, he said.

Heathrow limits passenger numbers over summer,"Heathrow Airport has told airlines to stop selling summer tickets, as the UK's biggest airport struggles to cope with the rebound in air travel. The airport is limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000, 4,000 fewer than currently scheduled. The cap on passenger numbers will be in place from now until 11 September. Thousands of UK travellers have been affected by disruption in recent weeks, including last-minute cancellations. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for holidays has returned. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up. Consumer group Which? urged Heathrow to clarify which flights would be cancelled as a result of the latest announcement. ""While this cap may ease the unacceptable chaos passengers are facing at the UK's biggest airport, thousands of people will now be worrying about whether their flight or holiday plans are about to fall apart,"" said Guy Hobbs, acting editor of Which? Travel. ""Heathrow must work with airlines to quickly provide clarity on which flights are being cut, and airlines need to be upfront with those passengers affected about their right to be rebooked at the earliest opportunity, including on services from other airlines."" A Heathrow spokesperson said it would take ""a couple of days"" for airlines to work with the scheduling company, Airport Coordination Limited, to decide what changes would be needed. Heathrow cuts flights and warns more could come Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Ministers told carriers to review their plans after chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff. In addition, a temporary government ""amnesty"" to the rules on airport slots was put in place, allowing airlines to change their summer schedules without facing a potential penalty. But despite this, Heathrow said airlines were still planning to operate flights carrying more daily passengers than could be processed in an acceptable manner. ""Over the past few weeks, as departing passenger numbers have regularly exceeded 100,000 a day, we have started to see periods when service drops to a level that is not acceptable: long queue times, delays for passengers requiring assistance, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late, low punctuality and last-minute cancellations,"" said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye. ""Our assessment is that the maximum number of daily departing passengers that airlines, airline ground handlers and the airport can collectively serve over the summer is no more than 100,000. ""The latest forecasts indicate that even despite the amnesty, daily departing seats over the summer will average 104,000 - giving a daily excess of 4,000 seats. On average only about 1,500 of these 4,000 daily seats have currently been sold to passengers, and so we are asking our airline partners to stop selling summer tickets to limit the impact on passengers."" But Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association and a former head of British Airways (BA), was sharply critical of Heathrow's move. ""To tell airlines to stop selling - what a ridiculous thing for an airport to say to an airline,"" Mr Walsh told Reuters. ""I am surprised Heathrow have not been able to get their act together better than this. Airlines have been predicting stronger traffic than Heathrow has been predicting... they clearly got it completely wrong."" He added: ""Heathrow are trying to maximise the profitability that they get from the airport at the expense of airlines."" It's a painful admission for Heathrow - but one that could be considered inevitable. The airport has been struggling to cope with a surge in passengers, following the removal of Covid-related travel restrictions. The results haven't been pretty. Long queues, delays, last-minute cancellations, busloads of orphaned bags and plenty of very angry travellers. Staff shortages have been a key problem - although Heathrow places most of the blame on airlines for failing to bring in enough ground handling workers. But some airline people tell a very different story. They claim Heathrow drastically underestimated passenger numbers, despite plenty of warnings, and accuse the airport of ""terrible mismanagement"". It has even been suggested Heathrow deliberately ""lowballed"" its passenger forecasts, as part of a campaign for permission to raise charges on airlines. Heathrow isn't alone in introducing restrictions.Gatwick imposed a lid on daily flights several weeks ago. But its move looks set to cause further aggravation for travellers during what has already become a pretty miserable summer. Heathrow'spassenger numbers have continued to riseas it recovers from the pandemic. But they are still below pre-coronavirus levels, when the airport saw roughly 110,000 to 125,000 daily departures. Mr Holland-Kaye apologised to passengers whose travel plans might be affected by the move. ""But this is the right thing to do to provide a better, more reliable journey and to keep everyone working at the airport safe."" Virgin Atlantic said it ""stands ready to deliver its full schedule this summer"". ""However, we support proactive measures being taken by Heathrow to reduce disruption, as long as action proposed does not disproportionately impact home carriers at the airport. ""Action should be based on thorough analysis showing the most effective measures to improve the situation and keep customers moving."" Are you concerned about booking a holiday?

"Train drivers very close to striking, union warnsAslef boss Mick Whelan says a walk-out could happen within weeks if pay talks with management fail.","Train drivers are ""very close"" to going on strike and could walk out within weeks, according to their union. Drivers at eight rail companies voted on Monday in favour of industrial action in a row over pay. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, told the BBC that strike action could happen in the coming weeks if talks over wage rises stall. ""We don't do this lightly,"" he said. ""We see it as a sign of failure when we do have to do it."" However, he pointed out that the union had received a strong mandate from its members to take industrial action with drivers voting overwhelmingly of strikes. But the Department for Transport (DfT) said: 'It is very disappointing that, rather than commit to serious dialogue with the industry, Aslef are first seeking to cause further misery to passengers by joining others in disrupting the rail network."" Mr Whelan did not say when strikes might begin. Unions must give 14 days' notice. The announcement has led to fears of disruption to the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, which is expected to attract about one million tourists between 28 July and 8 August. Train drivers at the following companies have voted to strike: Arriva Rail London Chiltern Railways: Great Western: LNER Northern Trains: Southeastern: TransPennine Express: West Midlands Trains: Separately, about 2,500 members of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) also voted in favour of strike action on Monday. Rail services have already been hit by three days of strikes in June when 40,000 members of the RMT union who work for 13 train companies and Network Rail walked out. The RMT has resumed talks with Network Rail, which owns and operates the UK's rail infrastructure, as well as the train companies over pay rises.  The RMT recently told the BBC that it is ""not in any rush"" to call for further strikes in July. Commenting on why Aslef members voted for industrial action, Mr Whelan said: ""Quite simply, we haven't had a pay rise for three years. Train drivers went to work during the pandemic, we moved food and medicine around the country, we got other key workers to work and with the cost of living increase and inflation going through the roof, people feel they deserve a pay rise."" The DfT said: ""We urge the union bosses to reconsider and work with its employers, not against them, to agree a new way forward."" It added: ""Our railway is in desperate need of modernisation to make it work better for passengers and be financially sustainable for the long term."" But Mr Whelan said: ""If you want productivity you pay for it.""

In addition, a temporary government ""amnesty"" to the rules on airport slots was put in place, allowing airlines to change their summer schedules without facing a potential penalty. But despite this, Heathrow said airlines were still planning to operate flights carrying more daily passengers than could be processed in an acceptable manner. ""Over the past few weeks, as departing passenger numbers have regularly exceeded 100,000 a day, we have started to see periods when service drops to a level that is not acceptable: long queue times, delays for passengers requiring assistance, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late, low punctuality and last-minute cancellations,"" said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye. ""Our assessment is that the maximum number of daily departing passengers that airlines, airline ground handlers and the airport can collectively serve over the summer is no more than 100,000. ""The latest forecasts indicate that even despite the amnesty, daily departing seats over the summer will average 104,000 - giving a daily excess of 4,000 seats. On average only about 1,500 of these 4,000 daily seats have currently been sold to passengers, and so we are asking our airline partners to stop selling summer tickets to limit the impact on passengers."" But Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association and a former head of British Airways (BA), was sharply critical of Heathrow's move. ""To tell airlines to stop selling - what a ridiculous thing for an airport to say to an airline,"" Mr Walsh told Reuters. ""I am surprised Heathrow have not been able to get their act together better than this. Airlines have been predicting stronger traffic than Heathrow has been predicting... they clearly got it completely wrong."" He added: ""Heathrow are trying to maximise the profitability that they get from the airport at the expense of airlines."" It's a painful admission for Heathrow - but one that could be considered inevitable. The airport has been struggling to cope with a surge in passengers, following the removal of Covid-related travel restrictions. The results haven't been pretty. Long queues, delays, last-minute cancellations, busloads of orphaned bags and plenty of very angry travellers. Staff shortages have been a key problem - although Heathrow places most of the blame on airlines for failing to bring in enough ground handling workers. But some airline people tell a very different story. They claim Heathrow drastically underestimated passenger numbers, despite plenty of warnings, and accuse the airport of ""terrible mismanagement"". It has even been suggested Heathrow deliberately ""lowballed"" its passenger forecasts, as part of a campaign for permission to raise charges on airlines. Heathrow isn't alone in introducing restrictions.Gatwick imposed a lid on daily flights several weeks ago. But its move looks set to cause further aggravation for travellers during what has already become a pretty miserable summer. Heathrow'spassenger numbers have continued to riseas it recovers from the pandemic. But they are still below pre-coronavirus levels, when the airport saw roughly 110,000 to 125,000 daily departures. Mr Holland-Kaye apologised to passengers whose travel plans might be affected by the move. ""But this is the right thing to do to provide a better, more reliable journey and to keep everyone working at the airport safe."" Virgin Atlantic said it ""stands ready to deliver its full schedule this summer"". ""However, we support proactive measures being taken by Heathrow to reduce disruption, as long as action proposed does not disproportionately impact home carriers at the airport. ""Action should be based on thorough analysis showing the most effective measures to improve the situation and keep customers moving."" Are you concerned about booking a holiday?

"Gary Lineker stays top of BBC salaries listGary Lineker took home Â£1.35m in the last financial year, with Zoe Ball the BBC's next highest earner.Entertainment & Arts","Gary Lineker was paid Â£1.36m for presenting Match of the Day and Sports Personality of the Year Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has topped a list of the BBC's best-paid stars for a fifth year in a row, taking Â£1.35m in the last financial year. That's slightly down on the Â£1.36m he earned in the previous year, which came after he took a pay cut from Â£1.75m. Radio 2 breakfast show host Zoe Ball is second on the new list, with Â£980,000. She also previously earned more but took a 28% pay cut at the end of 2020. She's one of three women in this year's top 10, down from four last year. Fiona Bruce and Vanessa Feltz have also made the cut again, but 6 Music's Lauren Laverne has dropped out of the top 10 after her pay fell by Â£15,000 to Â£380,000. See the list in full The figures were published in the corporation's latest annual report, which also revealed a sharp drop in the time UK adults spend watching TV every day. Average viewing dropped from eight hours 11 minutes in 2020/21 to seven hours 12 minutes in 2021/22, although part of that fall may be explained by people watching less than they did during the height of the pandemic. However, iPlayer usage has increased by around 12%. Meanwhile, 90% of the British population continues to use BBC services each week. The star salaries list does not include all presenters and actors because the corporation's commercial arm BBC Studios, which makes many of programmes, does not have to publish its talent spend. So for example, Claudia Winkleman is only listed for her weekly Radio 2 show and not for presenting Strictly Come Dancing, which is made by BBC Studios. Graham Norton has dropped off the list entirely after he left his Saturday Radio 2 show in December 2020, while the fee for his TV chat show, which is made for BBC One by his commercial company So Television, is not listed. Seventy-four on-air people earning more than Â£150,000 were listed this year, with the gender split similar to last year - 41 men (55%) and 33 women (45%). Previous director general Tony Hall had pledged that the gap would be closed by 2020. Zoe Ball took a Â£380,000 pay cut, which now puts her in the Â£980,000-a-year band Radio 1 breakfast host Greg James is the only new entry in the top 10, with Huw Edwards the only name apart from Lineker in the top 10 to have seen a pay reduction. The news presenter's earnings fell from Â£425,000 in 2020/21 to Â£410,000 in 2021/22. Some had an increase, with Alan Shearer getting a Â£60,000 pay bump. He now takes home Â£450,000 a year for his work on football shows including Match of the Day. Scott Mills, who is moving from Radio 1 to take up Steve Wright's afternoon slot on Radio 2 later this year, had an increase of Â£15,000. Wright also had a Â£15,000 pay rise, although his salary is likely to be reduced next year when he leaves his current daytime show. The gender pay gap widened for the first time since the BBC began recording its figures in 2017. It now stands at 5.9%, up on last year's 5.2%. The BBC said this could be down to several factors, including attrition - the loss of employees through retirement, redundancy or resignation who are not subsequently replaced. While there was no pay gap for ethnic minority BBC staff members in last year's report, there is now a gap of 1.6%, while the disability pay gap increased from 4% to 5.9%. The wage bill for all on-air talent overall is down slightly at Â£129.8m. Last year it was Â£130m. BBC director general Tim Davie said some of the pay increases were down to ""people this year taking on more responsibility and doing more shows"". He said the corporation was ""showing restraint when the market is [being] driven by extreme hyperinflation"". He said the pay list was ""a source of a lot of understandable attention"", but added: ""Actually if you step back, the actual amount paid for that group of talent, which only represents a tiny fraction of the 200,000-odd people who come on our airwaves every year... the return we get in terms of audience value is very strong. ""And actually our research shows people want to see the best people presenting and delivering for the BBC."" A number of high-profile broadcasters who have left the BBC during the last year still appear on the latest list, including former North America editor Jon Sopel, former Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, and Andrew Marr, who said he was leaving the corporation for LBC to ""get his voice back"". Mr Davie said: ""There are obviously headlines around individuals and some regretted losses, but actually our number in terms of the people being retained in the BBC is high."" He added that there was ""no shortage of demand"" for top positions at the broadcaster, but stressed the importance of bringing ""new talent"" through the BBC, which would always mean a ""degree of change"". The total bill for the BBC's executive board, including non-executives, was Â£4.3m, down from Â£4.8m in 2020/2021. But as has already been announced, Mr Davie's salary has increased from Â£494,000 to Â£522,000. The BBC is facing cutbacks after the government announced in January that it would freeze the licence fee for two years. Mr Davie told BBC Radio 4's Today programmeearlier this year that the settlement would ""affect our frontline output"". Asked what might be cut, he said ""everything's on the agenda"". The director general also told reporters the BBC would deliver a report into complaints made about former Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ Tim Westwood within the next two weeks. In April, Westwood was accused of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, which he strongly denies. Shortly afterwards,Mr Davie saidthe BBC had  ""seen no evidence"" of complaints being received about the hip-hop presenter's conduct. However,last week it was revealedthat the BBC had actually received six complaints, including one that had previously been referred to the police. ""We did an initial round of analysis of HR files, which didn't show something,"" Mr Davie said on Tuesday. ""That was why I made that statement, which was my understanding at that time."" An internal audit is now being carried out, he said.

"Train drivers very close to striking, union warns","Train drivers are ""very close"" to going on strike and could walk out within weeks, according to their union. Drivers at eight rail companies voted on Monday in favour of industrial action in a row over pay. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, told the BBC that strike action could happen in the coming weeks if talks over wage rises stall. ""We don't do this lightly,"" he said. ""We see it as a sign of failure when we do have to do it."" However, he pointed out that the union had received a strong mandate from its members to take industrial action with drivers voting overwhelmingly of strikes. But the Department for Transport (DfT) said: 'It is very disappointing that, rather than commit to serious dialogue with the industry, Aslef are first seeking to cause further misery to passengers by joining others in disrupting the rail network."" Mr Whelan did not say when strikes might begin. Unions must give 14 days' notice. The announcement has led to fears of disruption to the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, which is expected to attract about one million tourists between 28 July and 8 August. Train drivers at the following companies have voted to strike: Arriva Rail London Chiltern Railways: Great Western: LNER Northern Trains: Southeastern: TransPennine Express: West Midlands Trains: Separately, about 2,500 members of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) also voted in favour of strike action on Monday. Rail services have already been hit by three days of strikes in June when 40,000 members of the RMT union who work for 13 train companies and Network Rail walked out. The RMT has resumed talks with Network Rail, which owns and operates the UK's rail infrastructure, as well as the train companies over pay rises.  The RMT recently told the BBC that it is ""not in any rush"" to call for further strikes in July. Commenting on why Aslef members voted for industrial action, Mr Whelan said: ""Quite simply, we haven't had a pay rise for three years. Train drivers went to work during the pandemic, we moved food and medicine around the country, we got other key workers to work and with the cost of living increase and inflation going through the roof, people feel they deserve a pay rise."" The DfT said: ""We urge the union bosses to reconsider and work with its employers, not against them, to agree a new way forward."" It added: ""Our railway is in desperate need of modernisation to make it work better for passengers and be financially sustainable for the long term."" But Mr Whelan said: ""If you want productivity you pay for it.""

Heathrow imposes passenger number cap over summer,"Heathrow Airport has told airlines to stop selling summer tickets, as the UK's biggest airport struggles to cope with the rebound in air travel. The airport is limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000, 4,000 fewer than currently scheduled. The cap on passenger numbers will be in place from now until 11 September. Thousands of UK travellers have been affected by disruption in recent weeks, including last-minute cancellations. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for holidays has returned. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up. Consumer group Which? urged Heathrow to clarify which flights would be cancelled as a result of the latest announcement. ""While this cap may ease the unacceptable chaos passengers are facing at the UK's biggest airport, thousands of people will now be worrying about whether their flight or holiday plans are about to fall apart,"" said Guy Hobbs, acting editor of Which? Travel. ""Heathrow must work with airlines to quickly provide clarity on which flights are being cut, and airlines need to be upfront with those passengers affected about their right to be rebooked at the earliest opportunity, including on services from other airlines.""

Soaring costs stretching holidaymakers' budgets,"From travelling to the airport to the first serving of tapas, the costs British holidaymakers will pay abroad this summer are higher than before the pandemic. The price of car hire for a week has, on average, more than doubled, according to the data compiled for BBC News, by Ice Travel Group, holding company of travel comparison sites icelolly.com and Travel Supermarket. Average fees, meanwhile, for accommodation, airport parking and insurance are also higher according to the data, versus 2019. The group's research compared average prices for its 10 most popular destinations in June 2019 with the 10 most popular destinations in June 2022. Hiring a car, for instance, has risen from around Â£220, to almost Â£500, although this cost varies by destination - Italy and Ireland had some of the steepest increases. Karen Beddow The data also reveal all-inclusive package holiday deals were, on average, 17% more expensive, rising to Â£1,000 for a family of four. Bed-and-breakfast accommodation was also up from Â£608 to Â£755, on average. Prices for these deals varied by destination though, with the biggest rises for both holiday types in Egypt, Greece, the US, the United Arab Emirates and Italy. Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? Holiday cost inflation is something Mini Travellers blogger Karen Beddow is all too aware of. On a recent camping trip to the Netherlands with her three daughters over Easter, even the cost of cooking their own camp stove dinner was ""eye-watering"", she says. ""The cost of eating out, or just buying food in the supermarket, was so much more than we expected,"" she says. ""When you're cooking for yourself you expect it to be cheap but it wasn't."" Ms Beddow has some tips though. ""I always look at booking my airport parking or car hire, as soon as I book my trip. Because those are the sort of things people forget to do until the last minute and they'll only go up in price. ""And I always take a huge picnic on a flight because airport food is so expensive."" In addition, thepound remains weakagainst several currencies, meaning UK travellers are getting less for their money in many of their favourite destinations. In spite of all the increases, Chris Webber, head of holidays at Ice Travel Group, says getting away remains a ""priority expense"" for many after the pandemic lockdowns. ""[This] drive in demand is directly impacting the increasing prices, which we can see in everything from flight costs to car hire,"" he explains. Higher energy costs and staffing shortages following the pandemic are putting pressure on tourism businesses across the globe. Mr Webber adds that travel businesses simply aren't back up to full speed with staffing and resources, adding ""what we're hearing from the agents and operatorsâ¦ is that prices for 2023 travel are expected to rise too."" Ashley Price and wife Jaclyn who run Corner Bar in Benidorm are managing multiple rising costs Delays, cancellations and other complications as a result of the pandemic have added, on average, 40% to the cost of a single trip travel insurance policy, up from Â£35 to just over Â£50. Multi-trip policies rose 15%, according to Ice Lolly's insurance partner, CYTI. Ashley Price, who runs Corner Bar in the resort of Benidorm, Spain, feels like almost everything is going up in price for his business. The bar prides itself on offering a hearty, â¬3.50 full-English breakfast - but he says it's getting tougher to do. A full-English breakfast in Spain may have a few more ingredients from Ireland this year ""Four months ago we paid â¬22 for a box of eggs, now it's â¬51. Cooking oil has tripled, along with mayonnaise."" Corner Bar has switched from UK to Irish products in a bid to keep on top of its expenses. ""Some Spanish companies are trying to replicate British products,"" he adds. But filling staff vacancies is his biggest worry. ""There's an estimated 4,000 job shortages in Benidorm alone, which would usually be filled by young Brits doing summer jobs,"" he explains. ""We now have to close as 6pm every day, because we have not got enough staff to stay open."" Taken together, hidden extra costs, if not factored-in, will sting - particularly alongside the on-going disruption at airports and a cost-of-living squeeze at home. But back in the UK, Karen the travel blogger says there are some things families could do - for instance, doing extra research before you leave on prices for all the extras such as trips and treats. It's hard to rein in holiday spending at the best of times, and with so many people getting abroad for the first time in years, there are even more reasons to splash the cash this summer. But with rising costs at every turn on holiday, the problems will really come home to roost in the autumn and winter. With every household facing rising food and fuel bills, this is not the year that people will be able to pay-off the summer holiday over the winter months. A bargain break is all but impossible to find this year, so the balance between having a blast on holiday, and making sure you can afford it, has become harder but more important than ever.

"Sri Lanka opposition chief wants to replace RajapaksaSajith Premadasa tells the BBC he plans to run for the presidency, after urgent talks with allies.Asia","This video can not be played Watch: Sri Lanka opposition leader tells the BBC he is ready to run for presidency Sri Lanka's main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa has told the BBC he intends to run for president, once Gotabaya Rajapaksa steps down. This comes after his Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party held talks with allies to get support for the move. Sri Lanka is facing an unprecedented economic crisis which has brought thousands to the streets since March. The country has run out of cash and is struggling to import basic items like food, fuel and medicine. President Rajapaksa announced that he plans to resign this week, and the Speaker of parliament has said lawmakers will choose the next president on 20 July. Relief as limited fuel sales resume Mr Premadasa told the BBC that his party and allies agreed he should be ""putting my nomination for the position of presidency, if a vacancy occurs"". He lost the presidential election in 2019, and would need the support of the governing alliance MPs to win. He is banking on getting it due to the popular discontent against Mr Rajapaksa and his family, who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for more than two decades. The country's inflation rate reached a whopping 55% in June, and millions of people are struggling to make a living. Mr Premadasa said he was ready to take part in an all-party interim government. The SJB leader has been criticised for refusing to take the post of prime minister when it was offered to him in April. His rival Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed - but has also indicated he would resign to make way for a unity government. Mr Premadasa described the current situation in Sri Lanka as ""confused, uncertainty and total anarchy"", saying it needs ""consensus, consultation, compromise and coming togetherness"". Sajith Premadasa said the nation needed consensus and compromise The country's usable reserves have dropped to around $250m (Â£210m), according to local media reports. The crippling shortage of fuel has devastated public transport. There are rolling power cuts as power plants lack enough fuel to function. Schools are closed this week as well due to the fuel crisis. Many people are trying to leave the country. Mr Premadasa has conceded that there are no quick fixes. To return the economy to 2019 levels would take approximately four to five years, he said, adding that his party had an economic plan to overcome the crisis. Inside the palace now full of the people 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? ""We are not going to hoodwink the people. We are going to be frank and present a plan to get rid of Sri Lanka's economic ills,"" Mr Premadasa said.

Retail sales fall at fastest rate since lockdown,"During the pandemic, nationwide lockdowns meant shops were closed for weeks at a time so shopping habits changed Retail sales are falling at a rate ""not seen since the depths of the pandemic"", as price rises hit household budgets, a UK retail body has said. Shoppers are cutting back on white goods such as fridges and dishwashers as well as opting for cheaper brands, the British Retail Consortium added. Sales in shops and online have dropped for three months in a row, figures from the BRC and accountants KPMG indicate. Prices in the UK are currently rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -hit 9.1% in May, with the increasing cost of food, energy bills and fuel putting pressure on households' finances. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said people were cutting back on spending ""against a backdrop of unprecedented price rises on the High Street"". He said online shopping had continued to drop, with total sales down 9%. The biggest falls have been for purchases of furniture, home appliances and computing. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC said: ""While the Jubilee [bank holiday] weekend gave food sales a temporary boost, and fashion sales benefited from the summer holiday and wedding season, this was not enough to counter the substantial slowdown in consumer spending."" Shoppers rein in spending as incomes squeezed Total sales decreased by 1% in the five weeks between 29 May and 2 July 2022, against an increase of 10.4% in June 2021, figures from the BRC and KPMG show. It followed declines in April and May. Food inflation meanwhile, could reach 15% this summer according to forecasts by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD), meaning shoppers will be paying more for their essential groceries. IGD chief executive, Susan Barratt said: ""Shopping habits are changing; some 60% of shoppers are now spending time to save money - up from 55% in March."" ""With record petrol prices, being able to walk to a grocery store is also increasingly important,"" she added, ""with 27% of shoppers agreeing this is a driver of store choice, compared to 24% in May."" The cutback in spending on white goods reported by the BRC's survey comes just days after online electricals retailer AO World said it was seeking to raise about Â£40m. The company's share price had been falling after it was reported that credit insurer Atradius had cut cover for the firm's suppliers. Without credit insurance, suppliers often demand upfront payments in case the company they are selling to collapses and cannot pay its bill.

Do Tory leadership tax pledges add up?UK Politics,"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about."" So, what are the tax cuts being promised? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak row over recession warning in latest TV clash Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What has she pledged and how much would it cost? scrap April's National Insurance rise:Â£13bn a year cancel planned corporation tax rise:Â£17bn a year temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills (she claims this would knock ""around Â£150"" off energy bills):Â£8.5bn a year Total estimated cost:Â£38.5bn a year National Insurance(NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age. It is also paid by employers. Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? Reversing the NI rise would cost about Â£13bn a year,according to,externalthe IFS. Corporation taxis a tax on the profits of businesses. The tax rate is currently 19% but it is due to increase to 25% in April 2023. The government estimates that cancelling this rise would cost Â£17bn a year. However, the IFS points out that doesn't take into account whether lowering tax could lead to increased investment by companies. ""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"". Ms Truss hopes that extra investment would stimulate growth, although that would be difficult because the Bank of England says there is not currently much spare capacity in the economy, which means there is not a lot of scope for the production of more goods and services. Green levies The government makes energy companies add an environmental and social element on to energy bills. This pays for things like schemes to help fund renewable energy and provide grants for insulation. They make up about Â£153 of an average dual fuel bill, according to Ofgem. In 2020-21, the levies raised Â£12.2bn, of which about 70% (Â£8.5bn) went on environmental programmes. Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism. Why did Liz Truss U-turn over public sector pay? BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Paul Johnson said: ""I think we're going to struggle to avoid a recession and certainly you're not going to avoid a recession by doing what she seems to be suggesting, which is big tax cuts. That's more likely to stimulate inflation and create a bigger recession later on."" What has he pledged and how much would it cost? Reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero:Â£4.3bn a year Cut 3p off income tax by late 2029: aboutÂ£19bn a year Mr Sunak was chancellor until 5 July (when he resigned), so announcing wholesale changes to his own policies could be seen as politically problematic. He launched his leadership bid saying: ""Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."" The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s. Mr Sunak has promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero for one year from October, if average bills rise above Â£3,000 a year. At the moment, VAT costs Â£94 of an average bill. Mr Sunak claim his measure will save an average household Â£160 - although clearly it depends on how much the energy price cap rises by. The cost of the policy would be about Â£4.3bn for the year, depending again on how much prices rise. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Could VAT on gas and electricity be cut to zero? In May, Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a VAT cut, saying in Parliament: ""A flat rate payment has the benefit of being more progressive than VAT, which obviously gives very high, or higher, tax discounts to those who are particularly wealthy or have large houses and energy bills."" As Chancellor, he announced that all households in England, Scotland and Wales would receive Â£400 towards their fuel bills between October and March. Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut. He has not specified where the cuts in spending would be. He plans to go ahead with increases to corporation tax, but says he is planning to bring in ways to make it cheaper for companies to invest at the same time.

Today's page was written by Sam Hancock, Dulcie Lee, Emily McGarvey, Aoife Walsh, Thomas Mackintosh, Laura Gozzi, Jasmine Andersson, Jack Burgess and Marita Moloney. It was edited by Nathan Williams, Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Claire Heald and Chris Giles.   We're pausing our live coverage of the Conservative leadership race soon. But before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments:  We understand the eight candidates who all want to be the next PM have finished speaking to their fellow Tory MPs at tonight's hustings. The leadership contenders were given 12 minutes to make their case ahead of the first round of votes tomorrow. Wednesday is set to be another busy day, with those vying to succeed Boris Johnson facing a vote after PMQs from 13:30 to 15:30 BST. Candidates must secure at least 30 votes each to make it to the next round, with a result expected by early evening. The leadership race will eventually be whittled down to two candidates by the end of next week, after which they will have the summer recess to win the support of the Tory membership before the final result on 5 September. Former Cabinet minister David Davis, who is backing Penny Mordaunt, has denied that leadership candidate Rishi Sunak is ""hated"" by many Tory MPs. Earlier, Davis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""I don't think he's hated at all. ""We need a change of policy. ""If Rishi's going to stick with this policy, which has landed us with a recession and higher-than-average inflation for our economic peers, then I want to change that"". He called the former chancellor a ""perfectly charming, nice individual"". It's been a busy day with Tory MPs voicing their support for the party leadership contenders, with dozens publicly declaring their endorsements of who they'd like the next PM to be. But former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is remaining tight-lipped about who he'd like to see take charge. Speaking from the House of Commons where the eight candidates are speaking at hustings tonight, Duncan Smith told Sky News he's been ""impressed"" by all the contenders so far. ""This for once wasn't about Europe, it wasn't directly about taxation but was about how do you work to improve the quality of life for those who are the poorest in society,"" he says. ""It forced candidates to stop the to-and-fro bickering about who will cut taxes and not cut taxes and actually get down to talking about real lives."" Patrick Flynn, political analyst at the betting exchange SMarkets, has been running his figures on who might win this contest, and at what stage all the others will be beaten in the votes by MPs. According to his model, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Kemi Badenoch and Nadim Zahawi will be eliminated in the first three ballots among MPs; Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss will go after that; Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt will make the final two. At that stage, all Conservative Party members are able to vote, with the result due on 5 September. Flynn explained his workings - he looks at how different demographics of MPs have endorsed candidates so far and how those who supported different runners in past contests are shaping up now. He also looks at MPs voting records on social and economic issues and where their constituencies lie on Brexit. While some commentators have predicted a quick falling away of candidates, Flynn suggests we could be in for up to five rounds of voting before two rivals emerge. We're getting some insight from the hustings where eight candidates contesting the Tory leadership race are setting out their stalls. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn is among the reporters gathered in the corridor outside the committee room in the House of Commons. She reports how bookmakers' favourite Rishi Sunak is also keen to get ahead at the hustings, arriving early for his speaking slot. The former chancellor is forced to head away from the committee room while leadership rival Tom Tugendhat takes to the podium. Jeremy Hunt's been talking to LBC Radio, before he headed off to the hustings, now ongoing in Parliament. He says it would be ""immoral"" to offer personal tax cuts as part of a leadership bid, funded from borrowing. He promotes corporate tax cuts. Hunt says he's costed his substantial tax cut pledges and admits ""they are expensive"" - but argues he could ""do this within the fiscal rule that says that debt has to fall as a proportion of GDP over the period"". He argues that while corporation tax cuts are ""not vote winners"", they would lead to economic growth by the time of the next election. Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News The hustings are taking place as we speak in a House of Commons committee room. Cameras are not allowed in, so reporters are waiting in the corridor outside. Liz Truss has left after having her allotted 12 minutes to speak. Asked how it was, she says âvery hotâ. In terms of atmosphere or temperature? âEverything!â, comes the reply. Jeremy Hunt has now gone inâ¦ to slightly less banging on tables (the traditional way backbench Tories express their approval). A Tory organiser outside also described the room - saying âitâs absolutely swelteringâ. MP for Gosport Caroline Dinenage says she'll be throwing her weight behind Penny Mordaunt. She's backing her friend and old schoolmate Mordaunt, an arch Brexiteer, even though she herself voted to remain. ""The
fact is she brings people together from across the party, and all the different political views,"" she tells the BBC's Ros Atkins. ""She unites us."" Dinenage also says Mordaunt has made ""fully costed"" pledges, such as cutting the cost of fuel. ""She's not going wild on unfunded commitments,"" she adds.

They are Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi. Each has the backing of at least 20 fellow MPs. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti MP withdrew from the contest just minutes before the deadline. The first ballot and its result happen on Wednesday.

The eight candidates are just about to start speaking at the first hustings in Parliament. They're getting 12 minutes each to try to persuade Conservative MPs they should be the one to take over as party leader and prime minister. They're going to be speaking in this order: Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Tom Tugendhat, Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, Nadhim Zahawim and then Penny Mordaunt. We are not expecting to be able to follow along with the hustings live - it's something just for Tory MPs - but will bring you any reaction as soon as we have it. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent At the hustings - that begin at 19:00 BST in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. Twelve minutes - you probably spend longer looking for a new car or new house than choosing a new prime minister. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Worth remembering too that we haven't had all of the candidates' campaign launches yet. Penny Mordaunt is due to hold hers tomorrow. Now that eight candidates have secured enough support, the 358 Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two candidates remain:  The first ballot will take place on Wednesday 13 July, from 13:30 to 15:30, with the result announced later tomorrow. The final two candidates should be known by the end of next week. After a series of hustings events around the country over the summer - when the remaining two candidates set out their plans - party members will pick the winner in a postal vote. Read more on this story here. We now know that there are eight people officially in the race to be the next Conservative party leader - and the next prime minister. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now the joint favourite with Penny Mordaunt, according to betting odds. They're followed by Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Kemi Badenoch. We've a handyguide hereas to who joins them in the running. A bit more from Graham Brady. He says the first round ballot will take place on Wednesday, from 13:30 to 15:30. The result will be announced ""as soon as we can after that"", he says. The first hustings are happening in Parliament this evening, starting in just under an hour. The eight candidates will have 12 minutes each to speak, ahead of tomorrow's vote. Any candidate receiving fewer than 30 votes from the 358 Tory MPs will be eliminated in this first round. If all candidates reach that number, the one with the fewest votes is eliminated. Rounds of voting continue until only two candidates remain, then the vote goes out to Conservative Party members across the UK. The final result of that summer ballot, and the name of a new prime minister, comes on 5 September Now we hear from Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. He says eight candidates have been nominated: Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi.  Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid withdraws from the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader. He says: ""Serving in government is a true privilege. It has been just seven days since I took the difficult decision to resign from the most important job I have ever had, as health secretary during a pandemic."" ""Since then, I have set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country."" ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again."" ""There is an abundance of both ideas and talent in our party. One of the candidates will be given the honour of becoming prime minister."" ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Deadline for Tory leadership nominationsCandidates vying to replace Boris Johnson have just hours to secure support from at least 20 MPs.,"Candidates vying to be the leader of the Conservative Party - and the next prime minister - have until 18:00 BST to get the support of at least 20 MPs. The deadline comes after the party increased the number of nominations required to make it on to the first-round ballot to speed up the process. Ten MPs are putting themselves forward to replace Boris Johnson. Three - Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, and Tom Tugendhat - have so far passed the necessary threshold. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi also told the BBC he had the support of 20 MPs. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has withdrawn from the contest, pledging to back Mr Sunak, who resigned as chancellor last week. Chris Mason: Whittling down of candidates begins Who could be the next prime minister? Faisal Islam: Tax cut beauty contest could turn ugly Tories using fantasy economics, Labour leader says Voting will get under way on Wednesday, with candidates needing 30 backers to make it into the second round. The field will be whittled down to two finalists before the end of next week in successive rounds of voting by Tory MPs. With candidates scrambling around for MPs' backing, Mr Sunak, former Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch and Mr Tugendhat, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, have launched their official campaigns. A winner will be picked in a postal ballot of around 160,000 Conservative Party members over summer, with the result due to be announced on 5 September. On BBC Breakfast, Mr Zahawi was asked if he regretted his close association with Boris Johnson. He praised the prime minister for the coronavirus vaccine rollout and delivering Brexit, before saying he would bring the Conservative Party together and ""heal those wounds"". The contest so far has been dominated by the issue of taxation, with nearly all of the candidates pledging cuts to personal or business taxes, or both. On Monday the 1922 backbench committee, which organises leadership contests, increased the number of nominations needed to stand. Vice-chair of the committee, Nusrat Ghani, told Radio 4's Today this was a ""tweak"" to the rules, adding: ""I don't think it is a great task if you are trying to run for leader of the Conservative Party that you have the support of at least 20 colleagues."" Tuesday 12 July- nominations to get on the ballot open, closing at 18:00 BST Wednesday 13 July- first round of voting among Tory MPs Thursday 14 July- likely date for second round of voting Monday 18 July- likely date for third round of voting, if required Thursday 21 July- deadline for deciding final two candidates Monday 5 September- winner announced Mr Sunak and Mr Tugendhat are launching their official campaigns on Tuesday. The candidates for the party leadership are: Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch Attorney General Suella Braverman Foreign Office minister Rehman Chishti Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak Foreign Secretary Liz Truss Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Tugendhat Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Johnsonwill not be endorsingany of the candidates, having told the media: ""I wouldn't want to damage anyone's chances with my support."" Rishi Sunak is the man to beat among Tory MPs. After pledges of tax cuts from his rivals yesterday, the Mr Sunak will make an argument for what he sees as economic realism. Yes, tax cuts. But only after inflation is under control and the economy is growing. Expect him to argue he is prepared to make difficult decisions and act responsibly. Liz Truss meanwhile is pitching herself to MPs as the best person to stop Mr Sunak. She is expected to get some big cabinet backers today in Jacob Rees Mogg and Nadine Dorries. But unsurprisingly, she isn't the only person making the argument she is best placed to take on Mr Sunak. A number of candidates will spend the next few hours trying to shore up supporters. Most believe they will meet the 20 threshold to get onto tomorrow's ballot. We'll find out for sure later. Meanwhile, Labour will table a confidence motion in the government, sources say. The party promised to bring the House of Commons vote if the Conservatives did not remove Mr Johnson from office immediately. It could be held as early as Wednesday, but it is unlikely many Conservatives would back it. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer  for their tax pledges, accusing them of entering an ""arms race of fantasy economics"". He also accused them of ""hypocrisy"" for having backed tax hikes that have been introduced during Mr Johnson's time in office. UNDER THE SKIN:Where's the most painful place to get a tattoo?

Soaring costs stretching holidaymakers budgets,"From travelling to the airport to the first serving of tapas, the costs British holidaymakers will pay abroad this summer are higher than before the pandemic. The price of car hire for a week has, on average, more than doubled, according to the data compiled for BBC News, by Ice Travel Group, holding company of travel comparison sites icelolly.com and Travel Supermarket. Average fees, meanwhile, for accommodation, airport parking and insurance are also higher according to the data, versus 2019. The group's research compared average prices for its 10 most popular destinations in June 2019 with the 10 most popular destinations in June 2022. Hiring a car, for instance, has risen from around Â£220, to almost Â£500, although this cost varies by destination - Italy and Ireland had some of the steepest increases. Karen Beddow The data also reveal all-inclusive package holiday deals were, on average, 17% more expensive, rising to Â£1,000 for a family of four. Bed-and-breakfast accommodation was also up from Â£608 to Â£755, on average. Prices for these deals varied by destination though, with the biggest rises for both holiday types in Egypt, Greece, the US, the United Arab Emirates and Italy. Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? Holiday cost inflation is something Mini Travellers blogger Karen Beddow is all too aware of. On a recent camping trip to the Netherlands with her three daughters over Easter, even the cost of cooking their own camp stove dinner was ""eye-watering"", she says. ""The cost of eating out, or just buying food in the supermarket, was so much more than we expected,"" she says. ""When you're cooking for yourself you expect it to be cheap but it wasn't."" Ms Beddow has some tips though. ""I always look at booking my airport parking or car hire, as soon as I book my trip. Because those are the sort of things people forget to do until the last minute and they'll only go up in price. ""And I always take a huge picnic on a flight because airport food is so expensive."" In addition, thepound remains weakagainst several currencies, meaning UK travellers are getting less for their money in many of their favourite destinations. In spite of all the increases, Chris Webber, head of holidays at Ice Travel Group, says getting away remains a ""priority expense"" for many after the pandemic lockdowns. ""[This] drive in demand is directly impacting the increasing prices, which we can see in everything from flight costs to car hire,"" he explains. Higher energy costs and staffing shortages following the pandemic are putting pressure on tourism businesses across the globe. Mr Webber adds that travel businesses simply aren't back up to full speed with staffing and resources, adding ""what we're hearing from the agents and operatorsâ¦ is that prices for 2023 travel are expected to rise too."" Ashley Price and wife Jaclyn who run Corner Bar in Benidorm are managing multiple rising costs Delays, cancellations and other complications as a result of the pandemic have added, on average, 40% to the cost of a single trip travel insurance policy, up from Â£35 to just over Â£50. Multi-trip policies rose 15%, according to Ice Lolly's insurance partner, CYTI. Ashley Price, who runs Corner Bar in the resort of Benidorm, Spain, feels like almost everything is going up in price for his business. The bar prides itself on offering a hearty, â¬3.50 full-English breakfast - but he says it's getting tougher to do. A full-English breakfast in Spain may have a few more ingredients from Ireland this year ""Four months ago we paid â¬22 for a box of eggs, now it's â¬51. Cooking oil has tripled, along with mayonnaise."" Corner Bar has switched from UK to Irish products in a bid to keep on top of its expenses. ""Some Spanish companies are trying to replicate British products,"" he adds. But filling staff vacancies is his biggest worry. ""There's an estimated 4,000 job shortages in Benidorm alone, which would usually be filled by young Brits doing summer jobs,"" he explains. ""We now have to close as 6pm every day, because we have not got enough staff to stay open."" Taken together, hidden extra costs, if not factored-in, will sting - particularly alongside the on-going disruption at airports and a cost-of-living squeeze at home. But back in the UK, Karen the travel blogger says there are some things families could do - for instance, doing extra research before you leave on prices for all the extras such as trips and treats. It's hard to rein in holiday spending at the best of times, and with so many people getting abroad for the first time in years, there are even more reasons to splash the cash this summer. But with rising costs at every turn on holiday, the problems will really come home to roost in the autumn and winter. With every household facing rising food and fuel bills, this is not the year that people will be able to pay-off the summer holiday over the winter months. A bargain break is all but impossible to find this year, so the balance between having a blast on holiday, and making sure you can afford it, has become harder but more important than ever.
