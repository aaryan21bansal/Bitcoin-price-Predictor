Federer scrapes through in French Open,"Federer hit 63 unforced errors to 51 winners and had his serve broken in four games Roger Federer says he may pull out of the French Open if there is too much risk to his knee, and to his Wimbledon prospects, from playing on. The Swiss beat Dominik Koepfer over three-and-a-half hours late on Saturday in only his sixth match since having double knee surgery. Federer, 39, is due to play Matteo Berrettini in the last 16 on Monday. But he said he will decide later on Sunday whether now would be the ""perfect time to take a rest"". The 20-time Grand Slam champion lacked fluency and trust in his game before coming through to beat Germany's Koepfer 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 at a near-empty Roland Garros. Eighth seed Federer is playing in only his third tournament since January 2020 and says he is using it to build up fitness for Wimbledon, which starts on his favoured grass surface at the end of June. ""We go through these matches, we analyse them highly and look on what's next,"" he said. ""We will do the same here on Sunday, because I need to decide if I keep on playing or not. Is it not too much risk at this moment to keep on pushing or is this just a perfect way to just take a rest?"" Italy's ninth seed Berrettini, 25, reached the fourth round at Roland Garros for the first time with a 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 6-4 win over South Korea's Kwon Soon-woo. After hitting 52 winners against Kwon to continue a fine clay-court season, Madrid runner-up Berrettini will be widely considered the favourite against 2009 champion Federer. Nadal beats Norrie to end British hopes Svitolina out as seeds exodus continues GB's Hewett through to wheelchair finals Federer increasingly struggled against Koepfer, ranked 59th in the world, in a gruelling contest that lacked quality and was played in a soulless atmosphere without fans. In a lengthy opening set, Federer was unable to clinch any of five break points - including a set point in the 10th game - before an untimely double fault from Koepfer helped the Swiss to nick the tie-break. The ruthless edge appeared, eventually, in the opening game of the second set when Federer whipped a crosscourt forehand past Koepfer to convert his third break point. Little separated the pair, who traded three more breaks in a row, during another close and cumbersome set. The solid Koepfer was able to draw unforced errors out of the erratic Federer, who also struggled with his usually reliable serve. Federer's demeanour became increasingly despondent after Koepfer broke in the first game of the third set and he looked to be waning physically as the German remained in control. Somehow, the Swiss shifted the momentum back in his favour out of nowhere with a break back in the eighth game and, after missing a set point in the 12th, took the third tie-break. The fourth set looked destined for another tie-break before Federer dug deep to pick up his level and win the final three games for victory. But there were no fans to celebrate the moment, which seemed particularly stark when it was a player who has entertained packed stadiums for so many years. ""There are still a few people here, I don't know who they are: sponsors, journalists, my team too,"" Federer said. ""I love tennis, I like to play. I might have been more nervous if the stadium had been full."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For the first time, the French Open has introduced daily night sessions, which consist of one match starting at 9pm local time under the floodlights on Court Philippe Chatrier. That meant the third set did not start until shortly after 11pm, the match eventually finishing not long before 1am, and left many tennis fans on social media platforms wondering who actually benefited from the late scheduling. No fans were present on court because of the 9pm curfew imposed by the French government as part of coronavirus restrictions. ""I think these night matches start too late,"" former British number one Laura Robson said on BBC Radio 5 Live. ""They have got a very quick turnaround before their next match, probably get back to the their hotel between 2am and 3am, then have to reset. ""It is not easy, especially when your next opponent has long been and gone. ""I can't imagine this is what Federer was expecting when he walked out on the court, to be there so late. It is one other thing to worry about. Less recovery time and less sleep, with Berrettini to come."" Only one of the six night matches so far have been a women's match - Serena Williams' opener against Irina-Camelia Begu on Monday - and it would be optimistic to think a men's match would only last two hours, making late finishes inevitable. Russel Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent It was a match that will live long in the memory, although not always for the right reasons. Roger Federer is not supposed to play like this - even though this was just his sixth match in the past 16 months. There was little fluency, and some horrible errors. But in his 40th year, and at nearly a quarter to one on a Sunday morning in a soulless and empty stadium, Federer still found the key to victory. Night sessions are here to stay. They will look and sound great in years to come - as long as they don't start as late as 9pm. But they are absolutely no fun when there is a curfew in town.

Rich nations back deal to tax multinationals,"This video can not be played G7 global tax 'levels the playing field' The G7 group of advanced economies has reached a ""historic"" deal to make multinational companies pay more tax. Finance ministers meeting in London agreed to battle tax avoidance by making companies pay more in the countries where they do business. They also agreed in principle to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to avoid countries undercutting each other. Tech giants Amazon and Facebook are among those likely to be affected. Amazon has â¬250m 'back taxes' overturned in court Europe to fight Apple 13bn euro tax bill decision The Dane targeting multinationals The deal announced on Saturday, between the US, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan, plus the EU, could see billions of dollars flow to governments to pay off debts incurred during the Covid crisis. Negotiated over many years, it will put pressure on other countries to follow suit, including at a meeting of the G20 next month, which includes China, Russia and Brazil. The G7 attendees posed for photos at Lancaster House US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters that the ""historic"" agreement on a global minimum tax would ""end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation and ensure fairness for the middle class and working people in the US around the world"". UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who hosted the summit, said the agreement would make the global tax system ""fit for the global digital age"". His German counterpart, Olaf Scholz, said it was ""very good news for tax justice and solidarity and bad news for tax havens"". ""Companies will no longer be in a position to dodge their tax obligations by booking their profits in lowest-tax countries,"" he said. Governments have long grappled with the challenge of taxing global companies operating across many countries. That challenge has grown with the boom in huge tech corporations like Amazon and Facebook. At the moment companies can set up local branches in countries that have relatively low corporate tax rates and declare profits there. That means they only pay the local rate of tax, even if the profits mainly come from sales made elsewhere. This is legal and commonly done. The deal aims to stop this from happening in two ways. Firstly the G7 will aim to make companies pay more tax in the countries where they are selling their products or services, rather than wherever they end up declaring their profits. Secondly, they want a global minimum tax rate so as to avoid countries undercutting each other with low tax rates. The right to tax is the essence of sovereign power. That is why co-ordinated international action is so difficult. It has been the dream of campaigners and mainly European finance ministers for years. They would scarcely have believed it was possible until the past few months. But the need to fill coffers emptied by the pandemic, and the arrival of the Biden administration in the US, created a moment of opportunity. There was, however, a big compromise to get this across the line. A minimum corporation tax rate of 15% is rather low. Although European finance ministers succeeded in including the phrase ""at least 15%"", which offers a path to get that number higher. How much bite this change actually has will depend on the fine print of ongoing negotiations. Tech firms say they welcomed the move. Facebook vice president Nick Clegg said they recognised it could mean the company ""paying more tax, and in different places"". And then there is the question of the rest of the world. This now goes from the G7 to the wider G20 group, including China, Russia and Brazil, and then beyond. The German finance minister told me that the likes of Ireland, with its low corporation tax rate, now needed to ""get on the train"". The Irish finance minister told me he accepted that change was coming, but he would continue to argue for legitimate tax competition. A process has begun, a precedent has been set. It may or may not end up being transformative, but this moment is historic. The rules on making multinationals pay taxes where they operate - known as ""pillar one"" of the agreement -  would apply to global companies with at least a 10% profit margin. Twenty percent of any profit above that would be reallocated and taxed in the countries where they operate, according tothe G7 communiquÃ©,external. In the case of the UK, for example, more tax revenue would be raised from large multinationals and would help pay for public services. The second ""pillar"" of the agreement commits states to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to avoid countries undercutting each other. In the UK, corporation tax is already 19% and is set to rise to 25% by 2023 in response to spending during the pandemic. Ms Yellen said there was an understanding that national digital services taxes such as those levied by the UK and EU countries would be scrapped and replaced by the new agreement. Such taxes are regarded by the US as unfairly targeting American technology giants. US challenges 'unfair' tech taxes in the UK and EU ""The timing remains to be worked out exactly but there is broad agreement that these two things go hand in hand,"" the treasury secretary said. Asked whether Amazon and Facebook would fall under the new proposals for a global minimum corporation tax, she replied: ""It will include large profitable firms and those firms, I believe, will qualify by almost any definition."" Separately, the G7 also agreed to give a commitment to make it mandatory for firms to report the climate impact of their investment decisions. The agreement will be discussed in detail at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in July in Venice. Paolo Gentiloni, the EU commissioner for the economy, described Saturday's agreement as a ""big step... towards an unprecedented global agreement on tax reform"" and promised the EU would ""contribute actively to making that happen"" in Venice. Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso (L) rubbed elbows with European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni But Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, whose country offers a low 12.5% corporate tax rate, tweeted any agreement would have to ""meet the needs of small and large countries, developed and developing"". He referred to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental economic organisation with 38 member countries, which promotes world trade and has been also working on updating global tax rules. A spokesperson for Amazon quoted by Reuters news agency said: ""We believe an OECD-led process that creates a multilateral solution will help bring stability to the international tax system. ""The agreement by the G7 marks a welcome step forward in the effort to achieve this goal."" Facebook's Nick Clegg described the agreement as a ""significant first step towards certainty for businesses and strengthening public confidence in the global tax system"". A spokesperson for Google said: ""We strongly support the work being done to update international tax rules. We hope countries continue to work together to ensure a balanced and durable agreement will be finalised soon.""

Charities criticise UK's 'devastating' aid cuts,"The UK gives much of its humanitarian aid to Yemen, with projects similar to this one run by a Kuwaiti charity Families are going hungry and girls are missing school because of the UK's cuts to foreign aid spending, dozens of charities and academics have warned. Charities including Oxfam and ActionAid UK said they had caused ""devastation"" that could undermine the UK's credibility at the upcoming G7 summit. In a letter to Boris Johnson, they said there was ""no justifiable economic need"" for cuts of almost Â£4bn a year. The government says it will still spend more than Â£10bn on foreign aid in 2021. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show it was a ""temporary"" reduction, which was ""entirely reasonable"" given that the pandemic had caused a ""once-in-300-year economic interruption"". Foreign aid: What is it used for? Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? More Conservative rebels join bid to reverse cuts The letter comes ahead of a potential Commons vote on Monday when more than 30 rebel Tory MPs, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, hope to reverse the cuts. Last year, ministers decided to reduce this year's spending on overseas aid from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%,saying it was hard to justify,given that the UK faces record levels of peacetime borrowing to cope with the pandemic. This video can not be played Sir Bob Geldof: ''We don't take the piece of bread from that child's mouth in Yemen'' But charities including Save the Children, WWF UK and Cafod said the reduction had already led to the closure of feeding centres and clinics - and forced the cancellation of projects including water sanitation and training for healthcare workers. The letter - signed by more than 1,700 academics, charities and business leaders - was shared with the BBC as the UK prepares to welcome leaders from the G7 group of major advanced economies to a summit in Cornwall. ""While other G7 countries have stepped up their aid budget, the UK is the only one to have rowed back on its commitments,"" it said. The letter added that doing this during the pandemic was a ""double blow to the world's poorest communities"". The UK gave Â£1.5bn humanitarian aid - short-term help in an immediate crises - in 2019, in in projects like this one by the World Food Programme in Yemen Foreign aid is resources given from one country to another. It can involve a transfer of things like food or equipment, or even people to provide training and medical help. In 2020, the UK spent Â£14.5bn on aid, meeting its 0.7% target,according to provisional data,external. Overall, the top five recipients were Pakistan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Yemen and Nigeria, with almost all the money going to countries in Africa and Asia. The government has pledged to restore aid spending to 0.7% ""when the fiscal situation allows"" - but it has not specified a date. Ministers cut the spending without changing a 2015 law which made the 0.7% target legally binding. More than 30 Conservative rebels, including former ministers Damian Green, Stephen Crabb and Johnny Mercer, say they are planning to reverse the cuts on Monday by voting to amend legislation related to a newscientific research agency. Their amendment - which will need the support of more Tory MPs to pass - would oblige the agency to make up any shortfall from the 0.7% target from January 2022. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether the amendment is within the scope of the bill and whether it should be put to a vote. Anti-poverty campaigner Sir Bob Geldof told the Andrew Marr Show said of the aid cut: ""It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense economically, financially, politically, diplomatically, morally or in the humanitarian consequences of it. ""And I'm very much afraid that something that we're told is temporary will become permanent."" Mr Hancock said: ""The decisions that the government has taken around this are entirely reasonable. We face a once-in-300-year economic interruption."" He added that much of the work done by the UK, including distributing vaccines to other countries ""at cost"", did not officially ""count as aid"".

Amazon has â¬250m 'back taxes' overturned in court,"Amazon has won a court battle over â¬250m (Â£215m) in taxes it had been ordered to pay Luxembourg. The European Commission had ordered the tech giant to repay the funds as back taxes, alleging that Amazon had been given unfair special treatment. But the EU's General Court overturned that order, finding it had been given ""no selective advantage"". Amazon said the decision was ""in line with our long-standing position that we followed all applicable laws"". ""We're pleased that the court has made this clear, and we can continue to focus on delivering for our customers across Europe,"" the company said in a statement. The contentious order dates back to 2017, when the European Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, had turned her attention to tech giants and their tax arrangements in some EU countries. The European Commission had alleged that the tax deal amounted to state aid for the company - something which breaks the rules of the EU's internal market. Both Amazon and the country of Luxembourg went to court to have the decision overturned. ""None of the findings set out by the Commission in the contested decision are sufficient to demonstrate the existence of an advantage,""the court said in a statement,external. ""The contested decision must be annulled in its entirety."" A much larger tax bill for a similar case with Apple in Ireland - involving â¬13bn (Â£11.6bn) - was also overturned last year.The Commission lodged an appeal in September. Europe to fight Apple 13bn euro tax bill decision Amazon charged with abusing EU competition rules It is not yet clear if the EU will appeal against the latest Amazon ruling. In a statement,external, Margrethe Vestager said: ""All companies should pay their fair share of tax."" She said the Amazon-Luxembourg deal meant ""three-quarters of the profits made from all Amazon sales in the EU went untaxed until 2014"". ""We will carefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps."" The court also ruled separately on French energy firm Engie, which had been ordered to pay â¬120m (Â£103m) back to Luxembourg. The court upheld that decision. Despite the setbacks, the Commission's pressure on tech giants to pay more tax has indirectly led to changes in tax systems used by some EU members. An international effort involving the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is also aiming to establish a set of common international rules on how multinational corporations should be taxed. That could apply to the major tech giants, and has led to friction between some European countries and the United States, where many of the companies are based. In January,both France and the UK decided to delaythe introduction of a planned ""tech tax"" while the OECD negotiations continue.

Pauline Black, lead singer of The Selecter, performed a song to kick off the Coventry Moves event which was held online. Bicycles and cars travelled across the city as part of the celebrations to highlight its manufacturing history. Although there were pop-up doorstep performances, people were urged to watch from the event home. Organisers had to rethink events to comply with Covid-19 restrictions and members of the public were able to see the celebrationvia the festival website,externaland social media. Coventry Moves, the signature event of the year, was originally due to coincide with the launch on 15 May, butwas movedbecause of the coronavirus pandemic. Classic cars representing Coventry's motoring history went through the city Two cavalcades of 20 cars each were filled with Irish, Bollywood and Caribbean dancers who would burst from the vehicles for performances in streets Activities began at about 08:00 BST with the single voice of a woman, singing from a balcony in the Spon End area, before Black's performance. She represented the spirit of the River Sherbourne running under the city and was joined by a choir and dancers. Black was the first of six ""energies of the city"" that were introduced - faces that ""encapsulate"" the city's spirit. Organisers said the energies were resilience, social justice, youthfulness, sustainability, people power and innovation. Latest updates from Coventry Moves Getting ready for the launch event BBC: Coventry UK City of Culture Dancers, including the Coventry Morris Men, have taken part River Runners traced the route of the River Sherbourne through the city Performers, called River Runners, then traced the route of the underground river, meeting other energies along their route.

Motofest provided 40 vehicles and their drivers with nine classic and heritage cars coming from Jaguar Land Rover. Saturday's activities included a parade of 14 modern Lady Godivas, chosen from more than 140 nominations, to represent the city's women. Women escorted the Lady Godivas to the city centre carrying manifestos for change in the city Godiva, who died in 1067, was married to Leofric, the Earl of Mercia and Lord of Coventry.

Videos featured the city's commitment to protecting the environment and stories of individuals and communities who came from across the world to build Coventry. In the culmination of Coventry Moves, people were invited to turn on radios at their doorsteps to premiere a piece of music, as nine stations played different parts of the piece from 20:21 BST. In Earlsdon, residents of Stanley Road lined up their radios to hear all the parts of the music These form the full version when they are heard at the same time, so residents were asked to talk to neighbours and plan who would listen to which station. BBC Sounds: Coventry Moves Together For those in the city centre, strategically placed speakers enabled revellers to hear all the complementing pieces together at the same time. Residents told the BBC they felt moved by the music, which featured the voices of the city's children, and proud to be from Coventry.

US delays tariffs in 'tech tax' row,"The US has announced and immediately suspended tariffs on about $2bn (Â£1.4bn) of imports in retaliation for taxes on its tech firms. The 25% tariffs apply to certain goods from the UK, as well as Austria, India, Italy, Spain, and Turkey. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the delay would allow more time for discussions on tax. ""The US remains committed to reaching a consensus on international tax issues,"" she said. It comes after a year-long US investigation into digital services taxes put in place by the six countries, which tax tech firms on their revenues, rather than profits. Washington previously described the taxes as ""unreasonable"" and ""discriminatory"" against American social media companies, online marketplaces and tech firms. The US government said it will approve the threatened tariffs on $887m of UK goods, as well as on $383m of Italian goods and $323m of Spanish products. In addition it will impose tariffs on $118m of goods from India and $65m worth of products from Austria. But it suspended the introduction of the tariffs immediately for up to 180 days as talks on how to tax tech companies with a global footprint continue in the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). US suspends tariffs on single malt Scotch whisky US backs down from tariffs over French tech taxes ""The US is focused on finding a multilateral solution to a range of key issues related to international taxation, including our concerns with digital services taxes,"" said Ms Tai. But she noted that it still had the option to impose the charges. ""Today's actions provide time for those negotiations to continue to make progress while maintaining the option of imposing tariffs... if warranted in the future,"" she said. Under the proposals, the UK would face extra duties on goods including make-up, perfume, coats, ceramics and some types of toys,according to US Trade Representative documents.,external At the Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility calculated the digital services tax would raise Â£300m in the current financial year, and as much as Â£700m in future years. It was introduced in the UK last April and taxes at 2% the revenues of tech companies who derive value from UK users. It followed years of claims in Europe and elsewhere that big tech firms do not pay enough tax in the countries where they operate.

Covid restrictions ease for millions of Scots,"Millions of people in Scotland have moved into lower restriction levels, allowing them to meet in larger groups indoors and outside. In Glasgow people are allowed to meet in each other's homes for the first time in nine months, and to drink alcohol in pub and restaurants. Other areas of the mainland are seeing soft play centres open for the first time in more than a year. But restrictions on many of Scotland's islands are nearest ""normality"". Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles have moved into level zero - the lowest of the Scottish government's five tier system for exiting lockdown. Fourteen council areas in the north and south of mainland Scotland moved from level two to level one at midnight. What level is your area in? What are the latest Covid rules? However 13 areas with a combined population of 2.3million in the central belt remain in level two, rather than moving down to level one as planned due to high case numbers. The whole country is due to move to level zero on 28 June but the prevalence of the Delta variant, first detected in India, may delay that. Infections have more than tripled in the past month with Friday's 992 new cases being thehighest figure reported since 17 February. There were 860 new cases reported on Saturday. Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said public health advisors were ""little bit worried"" and the country had to be ""cautious"" in its route out of lockdown. Danny Whelan and Fiona Griffin were among the first to enjoy a drink indoors at FlÃ¹r in Glasgow's Partick In Glasgow, where residents and businesses have faced the toughest restrictions in Scotland for almost nine months, pubs and restaurants are opening later in the evenings and serving alcohol indoors again. Steve Aitken of FlÃ¹r in Partick told BBC Scotland of his relief at being able to finally allow customers to drink alcohol inside. ""There's been a lot of ups and downs, a lot of times when we've felt like chucking it but now we've finally got the doors open, we've got some people inside, it's going to be amazing,"" he said. The city that has been locked down for nine months The bar operated as a takeaway/bottle shop during lockdown but now he is hopeful for the future. ""Probably the biggest worry is another spike and another lockdown but hopefully with the vaccine and everyone playing the game, we won't have that,"" he added. Customer Danny Whelen said: ""It feels like a lifetime ago the last time we could be indoors and enjoying drinks. I'm delighted - happy to be back."" For some children it was their first time at soft play in Inverclyde Bob McVitie, of Inverclyde Leisure, said it was great to welcome back staff and customers to soft play for the first time in 440 days after the region moved to level one. ""I think it all gives us a little bit of hope that lockdown's easing and there's a bright future ahead,"" he said. Customer Monica Miller said it was the first time her young son, Blair, had been to the facility. ""It's wonderful experience... a small bit of normality back into life for us, to let him be among other kids, run about and have a bit of freedom."" Scotland's councils will be in thefollowing levelsfrom Saturday: Level two- Glasgow, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Clackmannanshire, and Stirling Level one- Highland, Argyll and Bute, Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Moray, Angus, Perth and Kinross, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, East Lothian, West Lothian, West Dunbartonshire, Dumfries and Galloway, and the Borders Level zero- Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles, and a number of smaller islands Meanwhile in Orkney the move to level zero means up to 10 people from four households can meet in a cafe, pub or restaurant. Raymond Hutchison, from the St Ola Hotel in Kirkwall, said it was a welcome boost to businesses on the islands. He told BBC Scotland: ""What's more exciting for me is that we've got into level zero now at the start of June. ""So does that mean we can get to the next level, which is what we need, as early as the end of the month? That would be fantastic."" Raymond Hutchison said the further easing of restrictions at the beginning of the summer was good timing for businesses in Orkney But the leader of Orkney Islands Council, James Stockan, also urged caution as increasing numbers of tourists visit the islands over the summer. ""It's the direction of travel that's really important. At the same time we've got to be very conscious that we have more and more people coming here,"" he told the BBC. ""We're really asking them to take a lateral flow test - and even our own community going away and coming back again. Just taking those tests to give us an extra degree of safety."" Outside the central belt most of the mainland now faces level one restrictions. The change to personal freedoms which comes from a move down from level two is not dramatic, but it does change the mood. The knowledge that it is possible to meet more friends and family members can lift spirits. In Campbeltown this morning, for instance, the atmosphere seems much more relaxed almost - for want of a better phrase - normal. Customers in shops still have to wear masks, of course, while cafes still have to take details from diners. But mainland Argyll and Bute now has lighter restrictions than at any time since March 2020. In much of rural Scotland tourism is hugely important to the economy and the stakes will be high for many businesses. But in some rural areas there is a little nervousness too. Often these areas have had very low Covid rates all through the crisis. Some local people may be worried that reopening travel risks a rise in case numbers - despite optimism that vaccination is breaking the link between cases and serious illnesses. That perhaps serves as a reminder to visitors to follow the rules and be mindful that some local people, who may seem like they are being over-vigilant, might be a little worried. After so long, finding a form of normal is about more than the legal easing of restrictions. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What rules are changing, and when?

'Dead days' for Welsh shops as customers stay away,"Cardiff saw the seventh-sharpest drop in footfall figures of any UK city Low customer numbers after shops reopened have left retailers facing a ""precarious picture"", the Welsh Retail Consortium has said. Footfall in Wales increased by 8% from April to May, but figures showed a decline of more than 30% in visitors compared to May 2019. Sara Jones, head of the industry body, said the past 12 months has been ""disastrous"" for shops. The Welsh government said it was taking measures to support the retail sector. Non-essential shopswere allowed to reopen in Wales on 12 April, almost four months after closing due to lockdown. The figures showed Wales had the steepest decline in footfall out of the UK nations. Almost one in five shops in Wales empty Small towns 'set to benefit from Covid recovery' It saw a drop of 30% between 2 and 29 May 2021, compared with the same month in 2019. Out of 13 UK nations and regions, only London saw a steeper decline. Cardiff saw the seventh-sharpest drop in footfall figures of any city, behind London, Birmingham, Portsmouth, Manchester, Nottingham and Bristol. Charlotte Little, who owns Doodlebug, a card and gift shop in Cwmbran, said trading had been unpredictable since reopening, and the figures mirrored her experience. She said: ""We're finding that one day you think it's picking up and then it just plummets and you get an incredibly dead day. ""We're having strange days where footfall is really high but takings are really low. ""We're trying our best to fathom the rhythm of it. It's all over the place and hard to tell and plan to get your ordering right and get staffing levels right. Charlotte Little says trade has been unpredictable She said the past few years had been unpredictable with the rise of online shopping, but hoped things would settle down as restrictions eased. ""It's just hoping that people get the confidence again, but there's tonnes of faces I haven't seen for a long time,"" she said. ""I wonder 'will they ever come back?'"" Ceredig Davies, who owns the Mona Liza gift shop in Aberystwyth, said while the numbers of people coming into shops had been high, spending was lower. ""Footfall this half-term has been, if anything, more than 2019, because of people taking day trips and short breaks so all the coastal towns in Ceredigion have been absolutely rammed. Ceredig Davies says coastal towns have been lucky for customer numbers but spending is down ""But as far as spending goes, everybody providing food and drink has been doing quite well, but retail I would say, from talking to other shopkeepers and shop managers, that their turnover isn't as high as 2019. Mr Davies said despite lower spending, it has been good to be able to be open. ""A lot of businesses have been fortunate with Welsh government grants and without that we would be on our knees, and it's still difficult with social distancing and people's patience perhaps not what it was at first - it's been a long time for that and people really just want to be out shopping. ""But from a personal point of view, to see our regular customers coming back and saying 'great to see you back open, great to see you're still here' has given a boost."" Ms Jones said a rise in footfall compared to April was ""welcome"" but ""unspectacular"" after a turbulent year following the first lockdown. She said: ""After a disastrous 12 months, Welsh retailers would have been hopeful for a stronger May. ""But results suggest that any hoped-for resurgence in shopper numbers following the April reopening has been relatively muted and the improvement, whilst welcome, is unspectacular at best."" Sara Jones said the slight increase in footfall was ""relatively muted"" after a ""disastrous"" 12 months Ms Jones said better weather in June might drive traffic back to shops, but also called on the Welsh government to develop a retail recovery strategy. She said: ""It is crucial that our policymakers use innovative measures and think creatively about how the industry, and wider High Street ecosystem, can be supported through measures such as free parking or a voucher scheme, as is planned for Northern Ireland."" 'Good progress' on NI Covid-19 voucher scheme Pandemic leaves businesses 'close to exhaustion' A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We fully recognise the Covid pandemic has had a big impact on high streets across Wales, which is why we are taking a number of measures to support the retail sector. ""We are committed to the development of a retail strategy, which will respond to the challenges the sector faces in the short, medium and long term."" He added the government had given more than Â£2bn to businesses across Wales, and some sectors still have a business rates holiday package ""which goes considerably beyond what is available in England"". It is also trialling community-based remote working hubs to encourage people to work closer to home and drive footfall back into town centres.

Dozens killed in Burkina Faso attack,"The Burkinabe army has been struggling to contain militant violence Armed men killed at least 160 people in an attack on a village in northern Burkina Faso, the country's worst attack in recent years, officials say. Homes and the local market were burned during the raid on Solhan in the early hours of Saturday morning. No group has said it was behind the violence, but Islamist attacks are increasingly common in the country, especially in border regions. The UN chief said he was ""outraged"" by the incident. AntÃ³nio Guterres ""strongly condemns the heinous attack and underscores the urgent need for the international community to redouble support to member states in the fight against violent extremism and its unacceptable human toll,"" his spokesperson said. On Sunday, a total of 160 bodies were recovered from what local officials in Solhan described as three mass graves, AFP news agency reported. ""It's the local people themselves who have started exhuming the bodies and burying them after transporting them,"" an unnamed local source said, according to AFP. The number of people killed in Solhan has increased from earlier reports of about 132 deaths, and there are concerns that the death toll may rise further. Following the news of Saturday's attack,the Burkinabe President Roch Kabore declared three days of national mourning,external, writing in a tweet that ""we must stand united against the forces of evil"". He described the attack as ""barbaric"" and said that security forces were trying to track down the perpetrators. Critical stage for fight against jihadis in West Africa In another attack on Friday night, 14 people were reported to have been killed in the village of Tadaryat, about 150km (93 miles) to the north of Solhan. Last month, 30 people died in an attack in the east of Burkina Faso. The country is facing a deepening security crisis, like many of its neighbours, as armed groups carry out raids and kidnappings across much of the region. In May, the Burkinabe army launched a large-scale operation in response to a resurgence of militant attacks. Despite this, the security forces are struggling to prevent the violence that has forced more than a million people from their homes over the past two years. Africa's semi-arid Sahel region has been hit by an insurgency since militants captured large parts of northern Mali in 2012 and 2013. French forces have been supporting troops from Mali, Chad, Mauritania, Niger and Burkina Faso to fight the militants. But this weekFrance halted co-operation with Maliover the recent coup there.

Dozens face fines for stealing Sardinia beach sand,"The white sands of Sardinia's beaches are treasured on the island - and elsewhere Dozens of people are facing fines of up to â¬3,000 (Â£2,580; $3,650) for removing beach sand and shells from the Italian island of Sardinia, local media report. Authorities said on Saturday that 41 individuals had been reported for the theft of about 100kg (220lb) of items from beaches in separate incidents. Sardinia's famed white sand is treasured on the island and it is strictly forbidden to remove it. The trade in Sardinian sand, pebbles and shells was made illegal in 2017. The fines imposed might seem heavy-handed, but for years islanders have complained about the theft of their natural assets. Tourists, mainly Europeans and including some Italians, bottle the sand to keep as souvenirs or auction it online. Why Sardinia's tourists taking sand 'souvenirs' face fines As part of an ongoing investigation, military and customs police in Sardinia have been monitoring airports and harbours, and also searching websites for illegal sales. Tourists attempting to remove bottled sand in their luggage have been caught during customs checks using X-rays. Police said that in recent days they had discovered dozens of online adverts for the sale of items collected from the Mediterranean island's coasts illegally, some at what they described as ""high prices"". The details of those accused of wrongdoing have been reported to the Forestry Corps (national state police) of Sardinia and face fines under the island's regional law. The police said they had already collected about â¬13,000 in fines, adding that the seized items were being returned to the areas from which they were taken where possible. Allow Facebook content?

On a Facebook page set up to highlight the issue called ""Sardinia robbed and plundered,external"", users often describe the threat of such thefts as an environmental emergency. Pierluigi Cocco, an environmental scientist and resident of the Sardinian capital Cagliari, told the BBC that the beaches were ""the main reason why tourists are attracted to the island of Sardinia"". For some people, he said, taking the sand home served as a reminder of a ""treasured memory"". But he said the removal of sand could contribute to the reduction of beaches over the years, which would pose an environmental threat as climate change brings about a rise in sea levels. Images like this are shared on social media as an example of sand seized at airports The island's Forestry Corps has also said that taking sand could, over time, destroy Sardinia's beaches, which were created over millions of years. In 2019, a French couple visiting Sardinia werecaught with 40kg of sand in the boot of their SUV. Police discovered the sand crammed into 14 plastic bottles taken from a beach in Chia, southern Sardinia. The couple told police they wanted to take it home as a ""souvenir"" and did not realise they had committed an offence.

First vaccine doses in UK surpass 40 million,"More than 40 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a vaccine - or 76.2% of the adult population, figures show It comes as the number of people in hospital with Covid rises but not ""very significantly,"" an NHS boss says. Vaccines appear to have ""broken the chain"" between catching Covid and becoming seriously ill, Chris Hopson adds Despite this, there are ""concerning signs"" the new Delta variant first identified in India is spreading in the UK, scientists say Figures suggest that in just a week, the number of coronavirus infections in the UK has risen by as much as two-thirds Scotland's restriction levels are easing for millions despite an overall rise in cases, with people in Glasgow now able to meet in others' homes Extra surge testing is being rolled out in parts of England, including Berkshire and Bradford, to tackle the spread of the Delta variant Airlines are putting on extra capacity to help British travellers return before Portugal moves off the green list for UK travellers on Tuesday There have been a further 5,765 cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to official figures Edited by Holly Wallis We're now bringing our live page to a close for today but we'll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks for joining us. The live page writers today were Lauren Turner, Alex Therrien and Joshua Cheetham. The page was edited by Holly Wallis. Millions of people in Scotland have moved into lower restrictions We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here's a round-up of the main stories: Margaret Keenan was the first person to be vaccinated in the UK There has been more reaction to news the UK has now administered more than 40 million first vaccine doses. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says in a statement that it's an ""astonishing achievement"" to reach the milestone less than six months after theUK's vaccination programme began. He says: ""In all corners of the UK, people are rolling up their sleeves when their time comes to protect themselves and the people around them. It seems with every day, we pass another major vaccination milestone on the road back to recovery."" Hancock adds: ""I encourage everyone who is eligible to join the millions who have the fullest possible protection from this virus by getting their jab when the time comes."" NHS national medical director Prof Stephen Powis also says: ""This latest milestone in our ongoing fight against coronavirus gives us another welcome opportunity to thank everyone in the NHS working flat out to deliver the biggest vaccination programme in our history - they are protecting millions of people at speed and saving thousands of lives. ""There has never been a more important time to get protected so when it's your turn and you're contacted by the NHS, book your jab or bring forward your second dose."" Low customer numbers after shops reopened in Wales have left retailers facing a ""precarious picture"", the Welsh Retail Consortium has said. Its head Sara Jones said the past 12 months had been ""disastrous"" for shops. Footfall in Wales increased by 8% from April to May, but figures showed a decline of more than 30% in visitors compared to May 2019. The Welsh government says it is taking measures to support the retail sector. Non-essential shopswere allowed to reopen in Wales on 12 April, almost four months after closing due to lockdown. The figures showed Wales had the steepest decline in footfall out of the four UK nations - it saw a drop of 30% between 2 and 29 May 2021, compared with the same month in 2019. Out of 13 UK nations and regions, only London saw a steeper decline. Cardiff saw the seventh-sharpest drop in footfall figures of any city, behind London, Birmingham, Portsmouth, Manchester, Nottingham and Bristol. Surge testing has begun in Bradford amid concerns over the Covid-19 Delta variant, which was first identified in India. Health officials are encouraging all people over the age of 11 to get tested ""to protect themselves and their families"". Bradford Council staff are knocking on doors and handing out testing kits. Walk-in mobile test units are also being set up across the city so people do not need an appointment. Read more Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Travel abroad is still very much up in the air - pardon the pun - with the government adding more countries to its red list for travel andtaking Portugal off the green list. England hasa limited number of green list destinations,external, where people can travel without having to quarantine on their return (although they will still have to take a Covid test before and after the trip). All other countries are rated amber or red, and travellers must quarantine after visiting them. What about refunds? Well, if the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised (this is official advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and separate to the traffic light system), then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. If this happens, you are entitled to a full refund, and you can choose to receive that refund in cash. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have had to wait longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. Read more here. As we reported a moment ago, the UK's vaccination programme has now surpassed 40 million first doses. But the milestone comes as cases continue to rise, fuelled by the spread of the Delta variant. In the below charts we look at some of the trends in the coronavirus figures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has responded to the news that the UK has now surpassed 40 million first vaccine doses.

The figures also show the number of first vaccine doses in the UK has now surpassed 40 million. Some 40,124,229 first doses have been administered - equivalent to 76.2% of the adult population. There have been 27,160,635 second doses delivered, or 51.6% of the adult population. The daily figures show there were 174,535 first doses and 360,691 second doses administered. Tweeting in response to the milestone,,externalPrime Minister Boris Johnson points out that the feat has been reached some six months after the vaccination programme began. He adds: ""Thank you to everyone who has been instrumental in getting us here. Please keep coming forward for both doses.""  There have been a further 5,765 cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according tothe government's daily figures.,external On Friday, 6,238 cases and 11 deaths were reported. We've heard experts warn that the planned ending of lockdown in England on 21 June is in the balance due to the spread of the so-called Delta variant. But what restrictions are meant to end? And what about the rest of the UK?  Read our explainer on how the rules are set to changehere. There have been 4.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and nearly 128,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. And nearly 40 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. But after a substantial decline since the start of the year, the average number of daily cases is now slowly rising. A further 6,238 confirmed cases in the UK were announced by the government on Friday. Several areas are experiencing a rise in cases linked to the Delta variant first detected in India and some scientific advisers have urged caution over lifting restrictions in England on 21 June amid warnings of a 'third wave'. Take a look atour explainer herefor more information - and to use the look-up tool to see the situation where you live. The vaccine rollout is continuing across the UK. Here's the latest on which age groups the four nations are now vaccinating, the priority groups having already been offered a jab:   The UK is using Covid vaccines made by:  A single-dose jab made by Janssenhas also been approved. You can't choose what vaccine you get, but you will be allocated one based partly on your age. If you're under 40 or pregnantyou will get Pfizer or Moderna. But, if you've already had one AZ jab with no after-effects you should have a second dose. Read more on vaccineshere. It would be ""foolish"" and a ""major risk"" to go ahead with the 21 June reopening in England as planned, an expert on a government advisory group says. Prof Stephen Reicher says there is currently enough evidence to say one of the government's four key tests for its roadmap out of lockdown has not been met. The professor - a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B) which advises the government  - says the criteria of risks not being fundamentally changed by new variants is ""not upheld"" because of the Delta variant. He tells the PA news agency: ""I think by the government's own criteria it's quite clear that it would be foolish to proceed on the data that we've got at the moment. The risk would be very great indeed."" He adds: ""Again, I make the point that it is about data not dates, and if you make it too much about the dates then you box yourself into a corner and I think that's what the government has done."" Pauline Black, lead singer of The Selecter, performed as part of the day's events Events are taking part across Coventry on Saturday to mark the start of its year as UK City of Culture - but people are being asked to watch online. The official start had been due to take place on 15 May, but was moved to today because of the pandemic. The Coventry Moves event has seen musical performances and bicycles travelling across the city. And there will also be the appearance of 14 modern Lady Godivas, who are representing the city's women. Godiva, who died in 1067, was married to Leofric, the Earl of Mercia and Lord of Coventry. According to legend, Leofric became so exasperated by Godiva's endless appeals to reduce taxes, he declared he would do so if she rode naked through the crowded marketplace.   Laura Whitmore, host of the dating show Love Island is coming back to our screens after a year away due to the pandemic. The dating show will resume later this month, for the first time since February 2020. The location of the show, usually filmed at a villa in Majorca, is yet to be announced. Its return had been confirmed by ITV in March. The new series is on ITV2 and is hosted by Laura Whitmore, whose husband Iain Stirling is the show's narrator.  Helen CattPolitical correspondent At the moment, ministers say there is nothing in the current data to suggest that England can't move into step four of the roadmap on 21 June. But what does the roadmap actually commit to? It says the government will reopen venues like nightclubs, it hopes to lift caps on numbers at weddings and remove ""all legal limits on social contact"". If you look at the rest of the roadmap, it's pretty clear that ""social contact"" has been used to refer to how many people can gather and where. So what it doesn't commit to is ending measures such as the one metre plus rule in pubs and restaurants, wearing face masks or even working from home. Those measures are being looked at by a government review. The results had been expected to be announced at the end of May but are now likely to come with the decision on step four on 14 June. That raises the possibility of step four going ahead as planned - but with at least some social distancing measures staying in place. In fact, the original roadmap says that ""some measures may be required even after all adults have been offered a vaccine"". The date for that is still currently 31 July. So even if step four does go ahead on 21 June, we shouldn't expect a return to normal overnight. And here are some of the latest developments from around the world: Thanks for joining our coronavirus live page. Here is a recap of the main UK stories so far today. Anyone over the age of 18 living or working in Harrow, north-west London, has been invited to have a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose this weekend. And as the pictures here show, many are choosing to take the opportunity. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Rich nations back deal to tax multinationalsG7 finance ministers have agreed to work together to create a ""level playing field"" on global taxation.World","This video can not be played G7 global tax 'levels the playing field' The G7 group of advanced economies has reached a ""historic"" deal to make multinational companies pay more tax. Finance ministers meeting in London agreed to battle tax avoidance by making companies pay more in the countries where they do business. They also agreed in principle to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to avoid countries undercutting each other. Tech giants Amazon and Facebook are among those likely to be affected. Amazon has â¬250m 'back taxes' overturned in court Europe to fight Apple 13bn euro tax bill decision The Dane targeting multinationals The deal announced on Saturday, between the US, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan, plus the EU, could see billions of dollars flow to governments to pay off debts incurred during the Covid crisis. Negotiated over many years, it will put pressure on other countries to follow suit, including at a meeting of the G20 next month, which includes China, Russia and Brazil. The G7 attendees posed for photos at Lancaster House US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters that the ""historic"" agreement on a global minimum tax would ""end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation and ensure fairness for the middle class and working people in the US around the world"". UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who hosted the summit, said the agreement would make the global tax system ""fit for the global digital age"". His German counterpart, Olaf Scholz, said it was ""very good news for tax justice and solidarity and bad news for tax havens"". ""Companies will no longer be in a position to dodge their tax obligations by booking their profits in lowest-tax countries,"" he said. Governments have long grappled with the challenge of taxing global companies operating across many countries. That challenge has grown with the boom in huge tech corporations like Amazon and Facebook. At the moment companies can set up local branches in countries that have relatively low corporate tax rates and declare profits there. That means they only pay the local rate of tax, even if the profits mainly come from sales made elsewhere. This is legal and commonly done. The deal aims to stop this from happening in two ways. Firstly the G7 will aim to make companies pay more tax in the countries where they are selling their products or services, rather than wherever they end up declaring their profits. Secondly, they want a global minimum tax rate so as to avoid countries undercutting each other with low tax rates. The right to tax is the essence of sovereign power. That is why co-ordinated international action is so difficult. It has been the dream of campaigners and mainly European finance ministers for years. They would scarcely have believed it was possible until the past few months. But the need to fill coffers emptied by the pandemic, and the arrival of the Biden administration in the US, created a moment of opportunity. There was, however, a big compromise to get this across the line. A minimum corporation tax rate of 15% is rather low. Although European finance ministers succeeded in including the phrase ""at least 15%"", which offers a path to get that number higher. How much bite this change actually has will depend on the fine print of ongoing negotiations. Tech firms say they welcomed the move. Facebook vice president Nick Clegg said they recognised it could mean the company ""paying more tax, and in different places"". And then there is the question of the rest of the world. This now goes from the G7 to the wider G20 group, including China, Russia and Brazil, and then beyond. The German finance minister told me that the likes of Ireland, with its low corporation tax rate, now needed to ""get on the train"". The Irish finance minister told me he accepted that change was coming, but he would continue to argue for legitimate tax competition. A process has begun, a precedent has been set. It may or may not end up being transformative, but this moment is historic. The rules on making multinationals pay taxes where they operate - known as ""pillar one"" of the agreement -  would apply to global companies with at least a 10% profit margin. Twenty percent of any profit above that would be reallocated and taxed in the countries where they operate, according tothe G7 communiquÃ©,external. In the case of the UK, for example, more tax revenue would be raised from large multinationals and would help pay for public services. The second ""pillar"" of the agreement commits states to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to avoid countries undercutting each other. In the UK, corporation tax is already 19% and is set to rise to 25% by 2023 in response to spending during the pandemic. Ms Yellen said there was an understanding that national digital services taxes such as those levied by the UK and EU countries would be scrapped and replaced by the new agreement. Such taxes are regarded by the US as unfairly targeting American technology giants. US challenges 'unfair' tech taxes in the UK and EU ""The timing remains to be worked out exactly but there is broad agreement that these two things go hand in hand,"" the treasury secretary said. Asked whether Amazon and Facebook would fall under the new proposals for a global minimum corporation tax, she replied: ""It will include large profitable firms and those firms, I believe, will qualify by almost any definition."" Separately, the G7 also agreed to give a commitment to make it mandatory for firms to report the climate impact of their investment decisions. The agreement will be discussed in detail at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in July in Venice. Paolo Gentiloni, the EU commissioner for the economy, described Saturday's agreement as a ""big step... towards an unprecedented global agreement on tax reform"" and promised the EU would ""contribute actively to making that happen"" in Venice. Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso (L) rubbed elbows with European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni But Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, whose country offers a low 12.5% corporate tax rate, tweeted any agreement would have to ""meet the needs of small and large countries, developed and developing"". He referred to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental economic organisation with 38 member countries, which promotes world trade and has been also working on updating global tax rules. A spokesperson for Amazon quoted by Reuters news agency said: ""We believe an OECD-led process that creates a multilateral solution will help bring stability to the international tax system. ""The agreement by the G7 marks a welcome step forward in the effort to achieve this goal."" Facebook's Nick Clegg described the agreement as a ""significant first step towards certainty for businesses and strengthening public confidence in the global tax system"". A spokesperson for Google said: ""We strongly support the work being done to update international tax rules. We hope countries continue to work together to ensure a balanced and durable agreement will be finalised soon.""

Dozens killed in Burkina Faso attackAs many as 100 people may have died in an area increasingly under threat from Islamist violence.Africa,"The Burkinabe army has been struggling to contain militant violence Armed men killed at least 160 people in an attack on a village in northern Burkina Faso, the country's worst attack in recent years, officials say. Homes and the local market were burned during the raid on Solhan in the early hours of Saturday morning. No group has said it was behind the violence, but Islamist attacks are increasingly common in the country, especially in border regions. The UN chief said he was ""outraged"" by the incident. AntÃ³nio Guterres ""strongly condemns the heinous attack and underscores the urgent need for the international community to redouble support to member states in the fight against violent extremism and its unacceptable human toll,"" his spokesperson said. On Sunday, a total of 160 bodies were recovered from what local officials in Solhan described as three mass graves, AFP news agency reported. ""It's the local people themselves who have started exhuming the bodies and burying them after transporting them,"" an unnamed local source said, according to AFP. The number of people killed in Solhan has increased from earlier reports of about 132 deaths, and there are concerns that the death toll may rise further. Following the news of Saturday's attack,the Burkinabe President Roch Kabore declared three days of national mourning,external, writing in a tweet that ""we must stand united against the forces of evil"". He described the attack as ""barbaric"" and said that security forces were trying to track down the perpetrators. Critical stage for fight against jihadis in West Africa In another attack on Friday night, 14 people were reported to have been killed in the village of Tadaryat, about 150km (93 miles) to the north of Solhan. Last month, 30 people died in an attack in the east of Burkina Faso. The country is facing a deepening security crisis, like many of its neighbours, as armed groups carry out raids and kidnappings across much of the region. In May, the Burkinabe army launched a large-scale operation in response to a resurgence of militant attacks. Despite this, the security forces are struggling to prevent the violence that has forced more than a million people from their homes over the past two years. Africa's semi-arid Sahel region has been hit by an insurgency since militants captured large parts of northern Mali in 2012 and 2013. French forces have been supporting troops from Mali, Chad, Mauritania, Niger and Burkina Faso to fight the militants. But this weekFrance halted co-operation with Maliover the recent coup there.

It was played across nine local radio stations simultaneously to create a sound bath effect, Mr Jones said. ""The reason for doing it was so the music comes at you from
different directions and it surrounds and immerses you,"" he said. The composer said he was ""thrilled"" by the reaction to the piece, which he said was ""a huge honour"" to record with the children. ""I feel like Iâve been a curator of what theyâve done,"" he said. ""They are an inspiration for the city, Iâm really thrilled
to hear people agree."" Deaf video designer Ben Glover has also created a film of the piece,which you can see here.,external Coventry residents have been surprised throughout the day by doorstep performances from dancers for City of Culture. Here's how some of them reacted: This video can not be played City of Culture: Residents react to doorstep shows Coventry's been working hard to get ready for this day and it seems like the multimillion-pound investment in the city centre is getting people excited. This video can not be played City of Culture: Locals react to Coventry's transformation Residents have reacted to a bespoke piece of music that was played in different sections in separate broadcasts across nine local radio stations at 20:21 to round off the day. ""I was crying because I was proud of the kids for making that, I was proud of our city, I was proud of where we come from,"" said Becky, a resident of Stanley Road. ""I was here with my friend Lucy, it was absolutely stunning. We didn't think it was going to work. ""I'm glad I got sent to Coventry, look at it tonight."" In Bullyard, revellers were caught by surprise when the song played on speakers outside. BBC CWR reporter Ushma Mistry said you could ""hear a pin drop"" before the music started to play over seven strategically placed speakers. ""I could see people looking up to see where the music was coming from,"" she said. ""It was an absolute picture."" People also stood up and clapped when the piece concluded. ""It definitely moved Coventry,"" she said. Like in Bullyard, speakers were also set up in Broadgate for people in the city centre to hear the music. Kerry just happened to be in the area and was emotional to hear it. ""It was magical,"" she said. ""It was really moving."" Artistic Director Justine Theman, in charge of today's events, said she had been ""delighted"" by the response from the local community. ""City of Culture in Coventry has made a commitment to taking work out to the
communities of the city and not keeping it all in the city centre,"" she said. ""In a way
the pandemic gave us an opportunity to really realise that and think of
creative ways to achieve that, so I feel really delighted by the responses of
people as weâve gone out into those communities."" Ms Themen also spoke to BBC Radio CWR about the challenges of creating the piece against the backdrop of coronavirus. ""The pandemic meant we couldnât tell people where we were going to be because that might attract large numbers of people,"" she said. ""So actually it was a frustration to not be able to say: 'Weâre doing this thing and we want you to know about it and we want you to come and see it.' ""But I think actually as itâs worked out and itâs been really beautiful to see people streaming out of their homes as theyâve heard the music of the cars or the bikes. ""Lots of really good things that have come out of the challenges weâve faced."" A group of residents on Stanley Road in the Earlsdon area have organised a street party to celebrate Coventry Moves. The group have put up bunting and lined up their radios along the wall so they can listen to Coventry Moves Together, which will see parts of a specially composed piece broadcast across seven local radio stations. ""Itâs been awesome, Iâve loved everyone coming together,"" said Becky, who lives on the street. ""Bring on City of Culture â weâre here, weâre ready.""

This video can not be played Pauline Black celebrates our hidden river, drawing us back to the cityâs origins. Pauline Black, who kicked off celebrations this morning with a song about the River Sherborne performed for a second time in University Square as the day's performances draw to a close. After the 14 Lady Godivas left the square, it was filled with the vintage car procession, the bicycle peleton, the dancers and river runners all of whom have been surprising people across the city since this morning. Pauline Black embodied the spirit of sustainability as fountains went off behind her, with the dancers mirroring her every move. She was then rejoined by the Morris dancers who flung blue powder representing River Sherborne at her, reminiscent of the start of the day. Some of the schoolchildren involved in creating Coventry Moves Together got a sneak preview of tonight's final event.

Local dance companies have been working with Hereward College, for young people with disabilities and additional needs. When it came time to select Coventry's ""energies"" - the themes important to the city today - social justice was high up on the list. Sue Bent, the head of a charity that employs solicitors and advisors to provide free legal advice, waschosen to represent social justice.

The women are carrying banners bearing their manifestos for a more equitable society. There's still plenty to come today from Coventry Moves. The day culminates at 20:21 with a special musical performance. People are being invited to turn on radios at their doorsteps later to premiere a piece of music. It will see Coventry schoolchildren feature on eight-minute tracks from composer Dan Jonesas part of an event entitled Coventry Moves Together. BBC CWR, Block Radio, Radio Panj, Hillz FM, Radio Abbey, Fresh, Vanny Radio, Radio Plus and Arawak will all begin playing individual streams of music simultaneously.

Jane and Alfie were enjoying a drink at a pub in Earlsdon when they saw the cycle peleton earlier today. ""It was absolutely lovely, it was brilliant to be a part of it,"" Jane said. The plans for Coventry Moves have had to be adapted while organisers were planning the event, to keep in line with Covid-19 restrictions - which is why today's events are being broadcast online. ""We've been lucky enough to see it first hand but obviously people can be at home watching if they feel safer in the comfort of their own homes,"" Jane said.

This video can not be played A soundscape of a city-wide orchestra for Coventry UK City of Culture 2021. The piece, composed by Dan Jones, features the voices of children from across the city. It was played across nine local radio stations simultaneously to create a sound bath effect, Mr Jones said. ""The reason for doing it was so the music comes at you from
different directions and it surrounds and immerses you,"" he said. The composer said he was ""thrilled"" by the reaction to the piece, which he said was ""a huge honour"" to record with the children. ""I feel like Iâve been a curator of what theyâve done,"" he said. ""They are an inspiration for the city, Iâm really thrilled
to hear people agree."" Deaf video designer Ben Glover has also created a film of the piece,which you can see here.,external Coventry residents have been surprised throughout the day by doorstep performances from dancers for City of Culture. Here's how some of them reacted: This video can not be played City of Culture: Residents react to doorstep shows Coventry's been working hard to get ready for this day and it seems like the multimillion-pound investment in the city centre is getting people excited. This video can not be played City of Culture: Locals react to Coventry's transformation Residents have reacted to a bespoke piece of music that was played in different sections in separate broadcasts across nine local radio stations at 20:21 to round off the day. ""I was crying because I was proud of the kids for making that, I was proud of our city, I was proud of where we come from,"" said Becky, a resident of Stanley Road. ""I was here with my friend Lucy, it was absolutely stunning. We didn't think it was going to work. ""I'm glad I got sent to Coventry, look at it tonight."" In Bullyard, revellers were caught by surprise when the song played on speakers outside. BBC CWR reporter Ushma Mistry said you could ""hear a pin drop"" before the music started to play over seven strategically placed speakers. ""I could see people looking up to see where the music was coming from,"" she said. ""It was an absolute picture."" People also stood up and clapped when the piece concluded. ""It definitely moved Coventry,"" she said. Like in Bullyard, speakers were also set up in Broadgate for people in the city centre to hear the music. Kerry just happened to be in the area and was emotional to hear it. ""It was magical,"" she said. ""It was really moving."" Artistic Director Justine Theman, in charge of today's events, said she had been ""delighted"" by the response from the local community. ""City of Culture in Coventry has made a commitment to taking work out to the
communities of the city and not keeping it all in the city centre,"" she said. ""In a way
the pandemic gave us an opportunity to really realise that and think of
creative ways to achieve that, so I feel really delighted by the responses of
people as weâve gone out into those communities."" Ms Themen also spoke to BBC Radio CWR about the challenges of creating the piece against the backdrop of coronavirus. ""The pandemic meant we couldnât tell people where we were going to be because that might attract large numbers of people,"" she said. ""So actually it was a frustration to not be able to say: 'Weâre doing this thing and we want you to know about it and we want you to come and see it.' ""But I think actually as itâs worked out and itâs been really beautiful to see people streaming out of their homes as theyâve heard the music of the cars or the bikes. ""Lots of really good things that have come out of the challenges weâve faced."" A group of residents on Stanley Road in the Earlsdon area have organised a street party to celebrate Coventry Moves. The group have put up bunting and lined up their radios along the wall so they can listen to Coventry Moves Together, which will see parts of a specially composed piece broadcast across seven local radio stations. ""Itâs been awesome, Iâve loved everyone coming together,"" said Becky, who lives on the street. ""Bring on City of Culture â weâre here, weâre ready."" And here's a reminder of Pauline Black's performance almost 12 hours ago that kicked off the day. This video can not be played Pauline Black celebrates our hidden river, drawing us back to the cityâs origins. Pauline Black, who kicked off celebrations this morning with a song about the River Sherborne performed for a second time in University Square as the day's performances draw to a close. After the 14 Lady Godivas left the square, it was filled with the vintage car procession, the bicycle peleton, the dancers and river runners all of whom have been surprising people across the city since this morning. Pauline Black embodied the spirit of sustainability as fountains went off behind her, with the dancers mirroring her every move. She was then rejoined by the Morris dancers who flung blue powder representing River Sherborne at her, reminiscent of the start of the day. Some of the schoolchildren involved in creating Coventry Moves Together got a sneak preview of tonight's final event. This video can not be played Coventry Moves Together: Children get a sneak preview Wheelchair athlete and Paralympian Kare Adenegan embodied the city's history of resilience in today's event. Since its experience of the Blitz, the city has built a reputation for rising from adversity, and building back better. She said she hoped the City of Culture events would inspire young people to be ""really proud and excited"" about the city. This video can not be played Kare Adenegan representing resilience Dancers and extreme performers put on a series of impromptu shows in the city centre this afternoon. Local dance companies have been working with Hereward College, for young people with disabilities and additional needs. When it came time to select Coventry's ""energies"" - the themes important to the city today - social justice was high up on the list. Sue Bent, the head of a charity that employs solicitors and advisors to provide free legal advice, waschosen to represent social justice. However, other champions are also among themodern Godivas who rode through Coventryearlier, echoing Lady Godiva's actions almost 1,000 years ago.

The women are carrying banners bearing their manifestos for a more equitable society. There's still plenty to come today from Coventry Moves. The day culminates at 20:21 with a special musical performance. People are being invited to turn on radios at their doorsteps later to premiere a piece of music. It will see Coventry schoolchildren feature on eight-minute tracks from composer Dan Jonesas part of an event entitled Coventry Moves Together. BBC CWR, Block Radio, Radio Panj, Hillz FM, Radio Abbey, Fresh, Vanny Radio, Radio Plus and Arawak will all begin playing individual streams of music simultaneously. With people switching on radios or internet devices at their doorsteps, ""the whole city will form an orchestra"", organisers said, ""weaving a musical tapestry across the city"". Take a look at this stunning display of ribbons in Coventry city centre: Each has an individual message and drawing and were made by local schoolchildren. City poet and rapper John Bernard is today representing youthfulness at the Coventry Moves event. His work examines issues of social commentary, youth empowerment, faith and purpose. Mr Bernard said he felt ""blessed"" to be included in today's event both on the writing and performance side. He was selected as a finalist by Words First - a talent development scheme run by BBC Arts, Radio 1Xtra and the Contains Strong Language poetry festival.

Jane and Alfie were enjoying a drink at a pub in Earlsdon when they saw the cycle peleton earlier today. ""It was absolutely lovely, it was brilliant to be a part of it,"" Jane said. The plans for Coventry Moves have had to be adapted while organisers were planning the event, to keep in line with Covid-19 restrictions - which is why today's events are being broadcast online. ""We've been lucky enough to see it first hand but obviously people can be at home watching if they feel safer in the comfort of their own homes,"" Jane said.

"Rich nations confident on reaching tech tax dealGerman finance minister Olaf Scholz says a minimum tax deal agreed by the G7 will ""change the world"".","The French finance minister urged low tax states like Ireland to back a deal which would target tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft. Finance ministers from the G7 group of leading economies are confident of striking a deal on taxing multinational companies at their meeting in London. The agreement is expected to include a global minimum rate of corporation tax. It would target tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft. German finance minister Olaf Scholz said the deal would ""change the world"". He said a 15% rate would help pay back debts that have built up during the pandemic - and that he was ""absolutely confident"" there would be an agreement. ""If we agree on the minimum taxation for corporates, this will help to go out of this race to the bottom we see with taxes today,"" he told the BBC. ""And this will help the countries we live in to finance their tasks, and - especially after Covid crisis and all the money we spent - to defend the health of the people, and to defend the economy."" French finance minister Bruno le Maire urged Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union, at 12.5%, to get ""on board"". This video can not be played G7: 'I believe we can make significant progress' - Sunak He told the BBC: ""European countries, that in the past, opposed this new international tax system, must understand that they have to give the agreement to this major breakthrough"". Both ministers said agreement on a minimum rate remained a sticking point. Mr Le Maire said he saw the 15% rate as a ""starting point"". He said: ""If it can be higher, it is better to have a higher rate than 15%."" Mr Scholz suggested that 15% would be an effective starting point that would mark a ""turning point"" after years of going in the other direction. It came after UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was ""confident"" of reaching a global agreement on digital taxation ahead of a meeting of world finance leaders. Finance minsters will also discuss climate change at the two-day meeting which started in London on Friday. Ahead of the G7 talks, Mr Le Maire and Mr Scholz along with their counterparts in Italy and Spain co-signed a letter urging an agreement on an international tax system ""fit for the 21st Century"". In a letter to The Guardian,external, they wrote: ""Introducing this fairer and more efficient international tax system was already a priority before the current economic crisis, and it will be all the more necessary coming out of it."" Those attending the G7 finance ministers summit are certain that a deal will be done on global taxation by Saturday morning - and they are not shy about its ""historic nature"". Mr Scholz told me they'll ""have an agreement which will really change the world... this will be a turning point in global co-operation"". Another finance minister said privately the deal will start to set the rules for the 21st Century, because if the Western G7 democracies were incapable of doing it, then China would. The UK's turnaround on minimum tax rates is quite something. Successive elections have been fought on the danger of corporation tax hikes to jobs and investment. Now, not only is that policy, but the UK looks set up to have overseen an agreement to limit the extent to which a future chancellor could cut it. There are two sticking points, sources tell me. Firstly, there is the mention (or not) of a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15%. There is also a move to use the wording ""at least 15%"" to show some ambition - but also to provide some negotiation space at the wider G20 meeting chaired by Italy and including the likes of China and Russia. The US also asked countries that have levied digital taxes - France, Italy and the UK, to withdraw them quickly as part of the deal. At least one finance minister said that was a ""non-starter"", as it could immediately result in the big tech giants paying less, not more tax. The end result will depend on fine detail, but looks likely to involve a new ability to charge 100 or so of the world's largest companies based on where their sales are, not where they house the factories or patents and trademarks. This could be transformative, and not just for Big Tech, but some more conventional multinationals. On Wednesday, the US announced it would impose tariffs on about $2bn (Â£1.4bn) of imports, including certain goods from the UK, in retaliation for taxes on big US tech firms. However, it suspended them for 180 days to allow further talks to take place in London and at a meeting of G20 nations in July. US delays tariffs in 'tech tax' row Amazon has â¬250m 'back taxes' overturned in court Mr Sunak is expected to push for an agreement on taxes and call for all global businesses to commit to climate reporting. Speaking ahead of the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak said: ""Securing a global agreement on digital taxation has also been a key priority this year - we want companies to pay the right amount of tax in the right place, and I hope we can reach a fair deal with our partners. ""I'm determined we work together and unite to tackle the world's most pressing economic challenges - and I'm hugely optimistic that we will deliver some concrete outcomes this weekend."" Governments have become increasingly concerned about the amount of tax paid by US tech giants. The ministers will be looking at how to stop the likes of Google, Amazon, Starbucks and Apple paying low or no taxes in countries where they generate revenues. The meeting is being held as it emerged that an Irish subsidiary of US technology giant Microsoft paid no corporation tax on $315bn in profit it made last year,according to The Guardian,external. Microsoft Round Island One is resident in Bermuda and the profit it generated last year is equal to nearly three-quarters of Ireland's GDP. Microsoft said this was due to ""a one-time event and reflects an inter-company reorganisation, not a cash gain"". ""Our organisational and tax structure reflects our complex global business. We are fully compliant with all local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,"" a spokesperson added. All G7 countries, bar the UK, have supported a proposal from the US for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% that could raise $50-$80bn for governments around the world. Germany, France, Italy and Spain said the commitment to a minimum 15% tax rate is ""a promising start"" but said G7 nations must reach ""a common position on a new international tax system"" in London before more nations meet next month. They wrote,external: ""We are confident it will create the momentum needed to reach a global agreement at the G20 in Venice in July. It is within our reach. Let's make sure it happens. We owe it to our citizens."" The UK is holding out for reassurances about the Digital Services Tax, which levies 2% on revenues derived in the UK from online marketplaces, search engines and social media platforms. It is open to the idea of a global corporate minimum tax rate and is said to be prepared to let the Digital Services Tax go if it obtains assurances that big tech will not simply be let off the hook. The Biden administration initially pushed for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 21% but has now retreated to 15%. However, officials have said that's regarded very much as a ""floor"". Finance ministers from the US, Japan, France, Canada, Germany and Italy will be attending the meeting at Lancaster House, along with representatives from the European Commission, the Eurogroup, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Breaking|Breaking newsRich nations back deal to tax multinationalsG7 finance minister have agreed to work together to create a 'level playing field' on global taxation.World,"This video can not be played G7 global tax 'levels the playing field' The G7 group of advanced economies has reached a ""historic"" deal to make multinational companies pay more tax. Finance ministers meeting in London agreed to battle tax avoidance by making companies pay more in the countries where they do business. They also agreed in principle to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to avoid countries undercutting each other. Tech giants Amazon and Facebook are among those likely to be affected. Amazon has â¬250m 'back taxes' overturned in court Europe to fight Apple 13bn euro tax bill decision The Dane targeting multinationals The deal announced on Saturday, between the US, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan, plus the EU, could see billions of dollars flow to governments to pay off debts incurred during the Covid crisis. Negotiated over many years, it will put pressure on other countries to follow suit, including at a meeting of the G20 next month, which includes China, Russia and Brazil. The G7 attendees posed for photos at Lancaster House US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters that the ""historic"" agreement on a global minimum tax would ""end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation and ensure fairness for the middle class and working people in the US around the world"". UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who hosted the summit, said the agreement would make the global tax system ""fit for the global digital age"". His German counterpart, Olaf Scholz, said it was ""very good news for tax justice and solidarity and bad news for tax havens"". ""Companies will no longer be in a position to dodge their tax obligations by booking their profits in lowest-tax countries,"" he said. Governments have long grappled with the challenge of taxing global companies operating across many countries. That challenge has grown with the boom in huge tech corporations like Amazon and Facebook. At the moment companies can set up local branches in countries that have relatively low corporate tax rates and declare profits there. That means they only pay the local rate of tax, even if the profits mainly come from sales made elsewhere. This is legal and commonly done. The deal aims to stop this from happening in two ways. Firstly the G7 will aim to make companies pay more tax in the countries where they are selling their products or services, rather than wherever they end up declaring their profits. Secondly, they want a global minimum tax rate so as to avoid countries undercutting each other with low tax rates. The right to tax is the essence of sovereign power. That is why co-ordinated international action is so difficult. It has been the dream of campaigners and mainly European finance ministers for years. They would scarcely have believed it was possible until the past few months. But the need to fill coffers emptied by the pandemic, and the arrival of the Biden administration in the US, created a moment of opportunity. There was, however, a big compromise to get this across the line. A minimum corporation tax rate of 15% is rather low. Although European finance ministers succeeded in including the phrase ""at least 15%"", which offers a path to get that number higher. How much bite this change actually has will depend on the fine print of ongoing negotiations. Tech firms say they welcomed the move. Facebook vice president Nick Clegg said they recognised it could mean the company ""paying more tax, and in different places"". And then there is the question of the rest of the world. This now goes from the G7 to the wider G20 group, including China, Russia and Brazil, and then beyond. The German finance minister told me that the likes of Ireland, with its low corporation tax rate, now needed to ""get on the train"". The Irish finance minister told me he accepted that change was coming, but he would continue to argue for legitimate tax competition. A process has begun, a precedent has been set. It may or may not end up being transformative, but this moment is historic. The rules on making multinationals pay taxes where they operate - known as ""pillar one"" of the agreement -  would apply to global companies with at least a 10% profit margin. Twenty percent of any profit above that would be reallocated and taxed in the countries where they operate, according tothe G7 communiquÃ©,external. In the case of the UK, for example, more tax revenue would be raised from large multinationals and would help pay for public services. The second ""pillar"" of the agreement commits states to a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% to avoid countries undercutting each other. In the UK, corporation tax is already 19% and is set to rise to 25% by 2023 in response to spending during the pandemic. Ms Yellen said there was an understanding that national digital services taxes such as those levied by the UK and EU countries would be scrapped and replaced by the new agreement. Such taxes are regarded by the US as unfairly targeting American technology giants. US challenges 'unfair' tech taxes in the UK and EU ""The timing remains to be worked out exactly but there is broad agreement that these two things go hand in hand,"" the treasury secretary said. Asked whether Amazon and Facebook would fall under the new proposals for a global minimum corporation tax, she replied: ""It will include large profitable firms and those firms, I believe, will qualify by almost any definition."" Separately, the G7 also agreed to give a commitment to make it mandatory for firms to report the climate impact of their investment decisions. The agreement will be discussed in detail at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in July in Venice. Paolo Gentiloni, the EU commissioner for the economy, described Saturday's agreement as a ""big step... towards an unprecedented global agreement on tax reform"" and promised the EU would ""contribute actively to making that happen"" in Venice. Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso (L) rubbed elbows with European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni But Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, whose country offers a low 12.5% corporate tax rate, tweeted any agreement would have to ""meet the needs of small and large countries, developed and developing"". He referred to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental economic organisation with 38 member countries, which promotes world trade and has been also working on updating global tax rules. A spokesperson for Amazon quoted by Reuters news agency said: ""We believe an OECD-led process that creates a multilateral solution will help bring stability to the international tax system. ""The agreement by the G7 marks a welcome step forward in the effort to achieve this goal."" Facebook's Nick Clegg described the agreement as a ""significant first step towards certainty for businesses and strengthening public confidence in the global tax system"". A spokesperson for Google said: ""We strongly support the work being done to update international tax rules. We hope countries continue to work together to ensure a balanced and durable agreement will be finalised soon.""

"LiveLiveCovid situation finely balanced, NHS boss warns11 minutes ago","More than 40 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a vaccine - or 76.2% of the adult population, figures show It comes as the number of people in hospital with Covid rises but not ""very significantly,"" an NHS boss says. Vaccines appear to have ""broken the chain"" between catching Covid and becoming seriously ill, Chris Hopson adds Despite this, there are ""concerning signs"" the new Delta variant first identified in India is spreading in the UK, scientists say Figures suggest that in just a week, the number of coronavirus infections in the UK has risen by as much as two-thirds Scotland's restriction levels are easing for millions despite an overall rise in cases, with people in Glasgow now able to meet in others' homes Extra surge testing is being rolled out in parts of England, including Berkshire and Bradford, to tackle the spread of the Delta variant Airlines are putting on extra capacity to help British travellers return before Portugal moves off the green list for UK travellers on Tuesday There have been a further 5,765 cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according to official figures Edited by Holly Wallis We're now bringing our live page to a close for today but we'll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks for joining us. The live page writers today were Lauren Turner, Alex Therrien and Joshua Cheetham. The page was edited by Holly Wallis. Millions of people in Scotland have moved into lower restrictions We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for today. But before we do, here's a round-up of the main stories: Margaret Keenan was the first person to be vaccinated in the UK There has been more reaction to news the UK has now administered more than 40 million first vaccine doses. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says in a statement that it's an ""astonishing achievement"" to reach the milestone less than six months after theUK's vaccination programme began. He says: ""In all corners of the UK, people are rolling up their sleeves when their time comes to protect themselves and the people around them. It seems with every day, we pass another major vaccination milestone on the road back to recovery."" Hancock adds: ""I encourage everyone who is eligible to join the millions who have the fullest possible protection from this virus by getting their jab when the time comes."" NHS national medical director Prof Stephen Powis also says: ""This latest milestone in our ongoing fight against coronavirus gives us another welcome opportunity to thank everyone in the NHS working flat out to deliver the biggest vaccination programme in our history - they are protecting millions of people at speed and saving thousands of lives. ""There has never been a more important time to get protected so when it's your turn and you're contacted by the NHS, book your jab or bring forward your second dose."" Low customer numbers after shops reopened in Wales have left retailers facing a ""precarious picture"", the Welsh Retail Consortium has said. Its head Sara Jones said the past 12 months had been ""disastrous"" for shops. Footfall in Wales increased by 8% from April to May, but figures showed a decline of more than 30% in visitors compared to May 2019. The Welsh government says it is taking measures to support the retail sector. Non-essential shopswere allowed to reopen in Wales on 12 April, almost four months after closing due to lockdown. The figures showed Wales had the steepest decline in footfall out of the four UK nations - it saw a drop of 30% between 2 and 29 May 2021, compared with the same month in 2019. Out of 13 UK nations and regions, only London saw a steeper decline. Cardiff saw the seventh-sharpest drop in footfall figures of any city, behind London, Birmingham, Portsmouth, Manchester, Nottingham and Bristol. Surge testing has begun in Bradford amid concerns over the Covid-19 Delta variant, which was first identified in India. Health officials are encouraging all people over the age of 11 to get tested ""to protect themselves and their families"". Bradford Council staff are knocking on doors and handing out testing kits. Walk-in mobile test units are also being set up across the city so people do not need an appointment. Read more Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Travel abroad is still very much up in the air - pardon the pun - with the government adding more countries to its red list for travel andtaking Portugal off the green list. England hasa limited number of green list destinations,external, where people can travel without having to quarantine on their return (although they will still have to take a Covid test before and after the trip). All other countries are rated amber or red, and travellers must quarantine after visiting them. What about refunds? Well, if the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised (this is official advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and separate to the traffic light system), then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. If this happens, you are entitled to a full refund, and you can choose to receive that refund in cash. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have had to wait longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. Read more here. As we reported a moment ago, the UK's vaccination programme has now surpassed 40 million first doses. But the milestone comes as cases continue to rise, fuelled by the spread of the Delta variant. In the below charts we look at some of the trends in the coronavirus figures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has responded to the news that the UK has now surpassed 40 million first vaccine doses.

The figures also show the number of first vaccine doses in the UK has now surpassed 40 million. Some 40,124,229 first doses have been administered - equivalent to 76.2% of the adult population. There have been 27,160,635 second doses delivered, or 51.6% of the adult population. The daily figures show there were 174,535 first doses and 360,691 second doses administered. Tweeting in response to the milestone,,externalPrime Minister Boris Johnson points out that the feat has been reached some six months after the vaccination programme began. He adds: ""Thank you to everyone who has been instrumental in getting us here. Please keep coming forward for both doses.""  There have been a further 5,765 cases and 13 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, according tothe government's daily figures.,external On Friday, 6,238 cases and 11 deaths were reported. We've heard experts warn that the planned ending of lockdown in England on 21 June is in the balance due to the spread of the so-called Delta variant. But what restrictions are meant to end? And what about the rest of the UK?  Read our explainer on how the rules are set to changehere. There have been 4.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and nearly 128,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. And nearly 40 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. But after a substantial decline since the start of the year, the average number of daily cases is now slowly rising. A further 6,238 confirmed cases in the UK were announced by the government on Friday. Several areas are experiencing a rise in cases linked to the Delta variant first detected in India and some scientific advisers have urged caution over lifting restrictions in England on 21 June amid warnings of a 'third wave'. Take a look atour explainer herefor more information - and to use the look-up tool to see the situation where you live. The vaccine rollout is continuing across the UK. Here's the latest on which age groups the four nations are now vaccinating, the priority groups having already been offered a jab:   The UK is using Covid vaccines made by:  A single-dose jab made by Janssenhas also been approved. You can't choose what vaccine you get, but you will be allocated one based partly on your age. If you're under 40 or pregnantyou will get Pfizer or Moderna. But, if you've already had one AZ jab with no after-effects you should have a second dose. Read more on vaccineshere. It would be ""foolish"" and a ""major risk"" to go ahead with the 21 June reopening in England as planned, an expert on a government advisory group says. Prof Stephen Reicher says there is currently enough evidence to say one of the government's four key tests for its roadmap out of lockdown has not been met. The professor - a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B) which advises the government  - says the criteria of risks not being fundamentally changed by new variants is ""not upheld"" because of the Delta variant. He tells the PA news agency: ""I think by the government's own criteria it's quite clear that it would be foolish to proceed on the data that we've got at the moment. The risk would be very great indeed."" He adds: ""Again, I make the point that it is about data not dates, and if you make it too much about the dates then you box yourself into a corner and I think that's what the government has done."" Pauline Black, lead singer of The Selecter, performed as part of the day's events Events are taking part across Coventry on Saturday to mark the start of its year as UK City of Culture - but people are being asked to watch online. The official start had been due to take place on 15 May, but was moved to today because of the pandemic. The Coventry Moves event has seen musical performances and bicycles travelling across the city. And there will also be the appearance of 14 modern Lady Godivas, who are representing the city's women. Godiva, who died in 1067, was married to Leofric, the Earl of Mercia and Lord of Coventry. According to legend, Leofric became so exasperated by Godiva's endless appeals to reduce taxes, he declared he would do so if she rode naked through the crowded marketplace.   Laura Whitmore, host of the dating show Love Island is coming back to our screens after a year away due to the pandemic. The dating show will resume later this month, for the first time since February 2020. The location of the show, usually filmed at a villa in Majorca, is yet to be announced. Its return had been confirmed by ITV in March. The new series is on ITV2 and is hosted by Laura Whitmore, whose husband Iain Stirling is the show's narrator.  Helen CattPolitical correspondent At the moment, ministers say there is nothing in the current data to suggest that England can't move into step four of the roadmap on 21 June. But what does the roadmap actually commit to? It says the government will reopen venues like nightclubs, it hopes to lift caps on numbers at weddings and remove ""all legal limits on social contact"". If you look at the rest of the roadmap, it's pretty clear that ""social contact"" has been used to refer to how many people can gather and where. So what it doesn't commit to is ending measures such as the one metre plus rule in pubs and restaurants, wearing face masks or even working from home. Those measures are being looked at by a government review. The results had been expected to be announced at the end of May but are now likely to come with the decision on step four on 14 June. That raises the possibility of step four going ahead as planned - but with at least some social distancing measures staying in place. In fact, the original roadmap says that ""some measures may be required even after all adults have been offered a vaccine"". The date for that is still currently 31 July. So even if step four does go ahead on 21 June, we shouldn't expect a return to normal overnight. And here are some of the latest developments from around the world: Thanks for joining our coronavirus live page. Here is a recap of the main UK stories so far today. Anyone over the age of 18 living or working in Harrow, north-west London, has been invited to have a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose this weekend. And as the pictures here show, many are choosing to take the opportunity. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Covid restriction levels ease for millions of ScotsMany areas of the country go from level two to level one but there are no changes for much of the central belt.,"Millions of people in Scotland have moved into lower restriction levels, allowing them to meet in larger groups indoors and outside. In Glasgow people are allowed to meet in each other's homes for the first time in nine months, and to drink alcohol in pub and restaurants. Other areas of the mainland are seeing soft play centres open for the first time in more than a year. But restrictions on many of Scotland's islands are nearest ""normality"". Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles have moved into level zero - the lowest of the Scottish government's five tier system for exiting lockdown. Fourteen council areas in the north and south of mainland Scotland moved from level two to level one at midnight. What level is your area in? What are the latest Covid rules? However 13 areas with a combined population of 2.3million in the central belt remain in level two, rather than moving down to level one as planned due to high case numbers. The whole country is due to move to level zero on 28 June but the prevalence of the Delta variant, first detected in India, may delay that. Infections have more than tripled in the past month with Friday's 992 new cases being thehighest figure reported since 17 February. There were 860 new cases reported on Saturday. Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said public health advisors were ""little bit worried"" and the country had to be ""cautious"" in its route out of lockdown. Danny Whelan and Fiona Griffin were among the first to enjoy a drink indoors at FlÃ¹r in Glasgow's Partick In Glasgow, where residents and businesses have faced the toughest restrictions in Scotland for almost nine months, pubs and restaurants are opening later in the evenings and serving alcohol indoors again. Steve Aitken of FlÃ¹r in Partick told BBC Scotland of his relief at being able to finally allow customers to drink alcohol inside. ""There's been a lot of ups and downs, a lot of times when we've felt like chucking it but now we've finally got the doors open, we've got some people inside, it's going to be amazing,"" he said. The city that has been locked down for nine months The bar operated as a takeaway/bottle shop during lockdown but now he is hopeful for the future. ""Probably the biggest worry is another spike and another lockdown but hopefully with the vaccine and everyone playing the game, we won't have that,"" he added. Customer Danny Whelen said: ""It feels like a lifetime ago the last time we could be indoors and enjoying drinks. I'm delighted - happy to be back."" For some children it was their first time at soft play in Inverclyde Bob McVitie, of Inverclyde Leisure, said it was great to welcome back staff and customers to soft play for the first time in 440 days after the region moved to level one. ""I think it all gives us a little bit of hope that lockdown's easing and there's a bright future ahead,"" he said. Customer Monica Miller said it was the first time her young son, Blair, had been to the facility. ""It's wonderful experience... a small bit of normality back into life for us, to let him be among other kids, run about and have a bit of freedom."" Scotland's councils will be in thefollowing levelsfrom Saturday: Level two- Glasgow, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Dundee, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Clackmannanshire, and Stirling Level one- Highland, Argyll and Bute, Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Moray, Angus, Perth and Kinross, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, East Lothian, West Lothian, West Dunbartonshire, Dumfries and Galloway, and the Borders Level zero- Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles, and a number of smaller islands Meanwhile in Orkney the move to level zero means up to 10 people from four households can meet in a cafe, pub or restaurant. Raymond Hutchison, from the St Ola Hotel in Kirkwall, said it was a welcome boost to businesses on the islands. He told BBC Scotland: ""What's more exciting for me is that we've got into level zero now at the start of June. ""So does that mean we can get to the next level, which is what we need, as early as the end of the month? That would be fantastic."" Raymond Hutchison said the further easing of restrictions at the beginning of the summer was good timing for businesses in Orkney But the leader of Orkney Islands Council, James Stockan, also urged caution as increasing numbers of tourists visit the islands over the summer. ""It's the direction of travel that's really important. At the same time we've got to be very conscious that we have more and more people coming here,"" he told the BBC. ""We're really asking them to take a lateral flow test - and even our own community going away and coming back again. Just taking those tests to give us an extra degree of safety."" Outside the central belt most of the mainland now faces level one restrictions. The change to personal freedoms which comes from a move down from level two is not dramatic, but it does change the mood. The knowledge that it is possible to meet more friends and family members can lift spirits. In Campbeltown this morning, for instance, the atmosphere seems much more relaxed almost - for want of a better phrase - normal. Customers in shops still have to wear masks, of course, while cafes still have to take details from diners. But mainland Argyll and Bute now has lighter restrictions than at any time since March 2020. In much of rural Scotland tourism is hugely important to the economy and the stakes will be high for many businesses. But in some rural areas there is a little nervousness too. Often these areas have had very low Covid rates all through the crisis. Some local people may be worried that reopening travel risks a rise in case numbers - despite optimism that vaccination is breaking the link between cases and serious illnesses. That perhaps serves as a reminder to visitors to follow the rules and be mindful that some local people, who may seem like they are being over-vigilant, might be a little worried. After so long, finding a form of normal is about more than the legal easing of restrictions. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What rules are changing, and when?

Rich nations confident on reaching tech tax deal,"The French finance minister urged low tax states like Ireland to back a deal which would target tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft. Finance ministers from the G7 group of leading economies are confident of striking a deal on taxing multinational companies at their meeting in London. The agreement is expected to include a global minimum rate of corporation tax. It would target tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft. German finance minister Olaf Scholz said the deal would ""change the world"". He said a 15% rate would help pay back debts that have built up during the pandemic - and that he was ""absolutely confident"" there would be an agreement. ""If we agree on the minimum taxation for corporates, this will help to go out of this race to the bottom we see with taxes today,"" he told the BBC. ""And this will help the countries we live in to finance their tasks, and - especially after Covid crisis and all the money we spent - to defend the health of the people, and to defend the economy."" French finance minister Bruno le Maire urged Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union, at 12.5%, to get ""on board"". This video can not be played G7: 'I believe we can make significant progress' - Sunak He told the BBC: ""European countries, that in the past, opposed this new international tax system, must understand that they have to give the agreement to this major breakthrough"". Both ministers said agreement on a minimum rate remained a sticking point. Mr Le Maire said he saw the 15% rate as a ""starting point"". He said: ""If it can be higher, it is better to have a higher rate than 15%."" Mr Scholz suggested that 15% would be an effective starting point that would mark a ""turning point"" after years of going in the other direction. It came after UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was ""confident"" of reaching a global agreement on digital taxation ahead of a meeting of world finance leaders. Finance minsters will also discuss climate change at the two-day meeting which started in London on Friday. Ahead of the G7 talks, Mr Le Maire and Mr Scholz along with their counterparts in Italy and Spain co-signed a letter urging an agreement on an international tax system ""fit for the 21st Century"". In a letter to The Guardian,external, they wrote: ""Introducing this fairer and more efficient international tax system was already a priority before the current economic crisis, and it will be all the more necessary coming out of it."" Those attending the G7 finance ministers summit are certain that a deal will be done on global taxation by Saturday morning - and they are not shy about its ""historic nature"". Mr Scholz told me they'll ""have an agreement which will really change the world... this will be a turning point in global co-operation"". Another finance minister said privately the deal will start to set the rules for the 21st Century, because if the Western G7 democracies were incapable of doing it, then China would. The UK's turnaround on minimum tax rates is quite something. Successive elections have been fought on the danger of corporation tax hikes to jobs and investment. Now, not only is that policy, but the UK looks set up to have overseen an agreement to limit the extent to which a future chancellor could cut it. There are two sticking points, sources tell me. Firstly, there is the mention (or not) of a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15%. There is also a move to use the wording ""at least 15%"" to show some ambition - but also to provide some negotiation space at the wider G20 meeting chaired by Italy and including the likes of China and Russia. The US also asked countries that have levied digital taxes - France, Italy and the UK, to withdraw them quickly as part of the deal. At least one finance minister said that was a ""non-starter"", as it could immediately result in the big tech giants paying less, not more tax. The end result will depend on fine detail, but looks likely to involve a new ability to charge 100 or so of the world's largest companies based on where their sales are, not where they house the factories or patents and trademarks. This could be transformative, and not just for Big Tech, but some more conventional multinationals. On Wednesday, the US announced it would impose tariffs on about $2bn (Â£1.4bn) of imports, including certain goods from the UK, in retaliation for taxes on big US tech firms. However, it suspended them for 180 days to allow further talks to take place in London and at a meeting of G20 nations in July. US delays tariffs in 'tech tax' row Amazon has â¬250m 'back taxes' overturned in court Mr Sunak is expected to push for an agreement on taxes and call for all global businesses to commit to climate reporting. Speaking ahead of the G7 meeting, Mr Sunak said: ""Securing a global agreement on digital taxation has also been a key priority this year - we want companies to pay the right amount of tax in the right place, and I hope we can reach a fair deal with our partners. ""I'm determined we work together and unite to tackle the world's most pressing economic challenges - and I'm hugely optimistic that we will deliver some concrete outcomes this weekend."" Governments have become increasingly concerned about the amount of tax paid by US tech giants. The ministers will be looking at how to stop the likes of Google, Amazon, Starbucks and Apple paying low or no taxes in countries where they generate revenues. The meeting is being held as it emerged that an Irish subsidiary of US technology giant Microsoft paid no corporation tax on $315bn in profit it made last year,according to The Guardian,external. Microsoft Round Island One is resident in Bermuda and the profit it generated last year is equal to nearly three-quarters of Ireland's GDP. Microsoft said this was due to ""a one-time event and reflects an inter-company reorganisation, not a cash gain"". ""Our organisational and tax structure reflects our complex global business. We are fully compliant with all local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate,"" a spokesperson added. All G7 countries, bar the UK, have supported a proposal from the US for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% that could raise $50-$80bn for governments around the world. Germany, France, Italy and Spain said the commitment to a minimum 15% tax rate is ""a promising start"" but said G7 nations must reach ""a common position on a new international tax system"" in London before more nations meet next month. They wrote,external: ""We are confident it will create the momentum needed to reach a global agreement at the G20 in Venice in July. It is within our reach. Let's make sure it happens. We owe it to our citizens."" The UK is holding out for reassurances about the Digital Services Tax, which levies 2% on revenues derived in the UK from online marketplaces, search engines and social media platforms. It is open to the idea of a global corporate minimum tax rate and is said to be prepared to let the Digital Services Tax go if it obtains assurances that big tech will not simply be let off the hook. The Biden administration initially pushed for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 21% but has now retreated to 15%. However, officials have said that's regarded very much as a ""floor"". Finance ministers from the US, Japan, France, Canada, Germany and Italy will be attending the meeting at Lancaster House, along with representatives from the European Commission, the Eurogroup, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Watchdog admits errors in reporting Tory donationsThe Electoral Commission says it wrongly disclosed the party received money from a defunct firm.,"The UK's election watchdog has admitted it previously incorrectly registered donations to the Conservative Party. The Electoral Commission had reported that the party accepted Â£10,000 in November 2019 from a company dissolved three years prior. But the watchdog has now said this was an ""administrative error,"" adding the party had in fact reported a donation from a different firm. It added it regretted ""any confusion,"" and the record would be corrected. Additionally, the commission said the Conservatives had advised them the party had ""inaccurately reported"" donations from another company. A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""We welcome this decision from the Electoral Commission and we will continue to work with them."" Earlier this week Labour called for the watchdog to investigate whether the donations had breached electoral transparency laws. Probe urged into Tory donations from defunct firms What are the rules governing political donations? Under current legislation, parties may only accept donations from a UK-registered company if it ""carries on business in the United Kingdom"". In its regular reporting of political donations, the commission said the Tories had accepted Â£10,000 from Stridewell Estates in November 2019. Government records indicate that the firm had been dissolved three years earlier, in November 2016. The commission said the party had in fact reported a donation from another firm, called Kirklee Property Company 2 Limited, and it had incorrectly confused the two because they shared the same address. Official records show that company was set up in 2006 and is still active. Business Insider, which first reported the story, has previously quoted a spokesman for Stridewell suggesting it could be a mistake. Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds wrote to the commission earlier this week The watchdog added that it was still working with the party to establish the details of donations from another company, Unionist Buildings Limited. The commission has reported that the Tories accepted Â£6,000 from the firm in June 2017. Records show the firm was dissolved six months earlier, in January. The commission said the Conservatives had admitted incorrectly reporting donations from that firm - but gave no further details. It said it remained in contact with the party ""so that we can publish the correct information and provide transparency to voters"". Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said: ""This confirmation that the Conservatives inaccurately recorded a donation amounting to thousands of pounds raises more questions than it answers. We urgently need to know where that money came from."" Meanwhile, the commission has also admitted it incorrectly registered details of another donation to the Conservatives in late 2019. It had previously said the party got Â£3,250 in December 2019 from a company called Landcap Development Eversley Ltd, which was disbanded 12 months prior. But it said the party had in fact reported a donation from a still-active company, Landcap Limited. It again said it had confused the two businesses because they shared an address. It is understood the watchdog discovered that error after the registered donation was brought to its attention.
