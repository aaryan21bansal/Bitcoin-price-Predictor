"Hammer victim, 96, facing 'long' recoveryD-Day veteran Jim Booth suffered a ""cowardly"" attack, but is ""a little stronger each day"", his family say.","Jim Booth is growing ""a little stronger each day"", his family say A great-grandfather who was attacked with a claw hammer in a suspected distraction burglary is facing a ""long process of recovery"", his family says. D-Day veteran Jim Booth, 96, was left with ""serious injuries"" after he was attacked by a cold caller asking if he needed any work done to his house, in Taunton, Somerset. In a statement, his family said they shared well-wishers' feelings of ""shock, incomprehension and outrage"". A 39-year-old man has been arrested. He is being held by Avon and Somerset Police on suspicion of attempted murder and aggravated burglary. Mr Booth was attacked on Wednesday after he told a cold caller, who had knocked on his front door, that he did not require any work on his house. In a statement, his children said: ""Countless friends, neighbours, members of the community and even strangers, have expressed their shock, incomprehension and outrage. ""We acknowledge and share those feelings."" However, they said Mr Booth was ""not easily defeated and he grows a little stronger each day"". ""Our father is an exceptional person of whom we are all immensely proud. ""He is the head of the family, a dearly loved father to his four children and adored by his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, to whom he's simply known as 'The Legend.' ""He is, and always has been, our own family hero."" They said Mr Booth had been the victim of a ""vicious and cowardly attack"" and paid tribute to police officers who have worked ""tirelessly"" on the case. ""We are all now focused on the long process of recovery, which will be helped by the love and support of all those around him,"" they added.

Pakistan calls army over 'blasphemy' clash,"This video can not be played Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters Pakistan's government has called for troops to be deployed in the capital, Islamabad, after violence broke out during protests by Islamists. About 200 people were injured when security forces tried to disperse an Islamist sit-in at the Faizabad Interchange - a key highway. Several deaths have been reported. The protesters have been blocking the highway for several weeks, demanding the sacking of Law Minister Zahid Hamid whom they accuse of blasphemy. Pakistani media report that demonstrators also broke into the minister's residence in Punjab province. Mr Hamid and his family were not in the building. The protests have spread to other cities, including Lahore and the southern port of Karachi. About 200 people were injured in Saturday's clashes The Pakistani government asked the army to deploy in Islamabad on Saturday evening. The interior minister said the order was issued at the request of the city authorities, who were not able to clear the sit-in. There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani military. Protesters want Pakistan's law minister to be sacked Earlier on Saturday, security forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse the demonstrators, Pakistani media report, but were met with rocks and tear gas shells. About 8,500 elite police and paramilitary forces took part in the operation to clear the Faizabad Interchange. The crackdown was later suspended. Protesters said four of their activists were killed, but police said there were no deaths, Reuters reports. However, officials are quoted in other reports confirming that several people were killed. Many of those injured are security personnel. The request for the military deployment came after hundreds more demonstrators turned up unexpectedly, forcing the police to retreat. At one point, the authorities took all private television news channels off air, apparently out of concern that the live coverage of the police action could inflame religious sentiments. The protesting Islamists, from the hardline Tehreek-i-Labaik Ya Rasool Allah Party, want the law minister to be sacked for omitting a reference to the Prophet Muhammad in a new version of the electoral oath. The minister has since apologised saying it was a clerical error.

Foster warns time is short for NI deal,"Arlene Foster said that all parties need to be ""serious about obtaining a deal that is balanced"" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has said Sinn FÃ©in must choose between making a deal with them or having direct rule ministers in place. Speaking at the party's annual conference, she said ""time is short"". Mrs Foster also spoke of the DUP's influence in Westminster and the party's commitment to Brexit. DUP MPs are propping up the Conservative government as part of a confidence-and-supply deal. Stormont deadlock: what you need to know On the failure of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, Mrs Foster said that ""some progress was made but that can only be built upon if all sides are genuinely serious about obtaining a deal that is balanced"". The DUP-Sinn FÃ©in power-sharing government fell apart in January following a row over a green energy scandal, which is now the subject of a public inquiry. A series of talks have failed to find agreement over issues including an Irish language act and same-sex marriage. Arlene Foster told the DUP party conference that Sinn FÃ©in needs to respect British culture ""I said back in the summer that this party was prepared to legislate for the Irish language in the context of legislating for the plurality of cultures that exist in Northern Ireland,"" Mrs Foster told the conference in Belfast. ""The Irish language is spoken and enjoyed by thousands of people in all parts of Northern Ireland,  it does no damage to our unionism or the Union we cherish. ""I respect the Irish language and those who speak it, however, respect isn't a one-way street. ""Respect works both ways."" Mrs Foster said Sinn FÃ©in needed to ""respect our British culture"". ""For too long they have shown nothing but disdain and disrespect for the national flag, the Royal Family, the Armed Forces, British symbols, the constitutional reality and the very name of this country. ""Time is short and those in Sinn FÃ©in blocking the restoration of local decision making need to decide whether they want to do business with us or have direct rule ministers in place. ""I still believe that devolution is the best way to govern Northern Ireland, but to do that in a way that delivers for all of our people we need serious partners in government."" On Brexit, Mrs Foster said it was ""perhaps the most substantial and complex process the government and parliament had undertaken in the modern political era"". She reiterated her desire to find a solution for Northern Ireland that would not harm the country's economic relationship with either the rest of the UK or the Republic of Ireland. ""As we joined the then European Community as one nation we will leave as one United Kingdom,"" she said. Responding to Mrs Foster's address, Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader, Michelle O'Neill said she and her party ""remained committed to making the institutions work,"" but said: ""They must operate on the basis agreed 20 years ago."" ""A majority of citizens in the north expect and are entitled to the same rights enjoyed by citizens across these islands; language and marriage equality rights, due process in all aspects of the legal and judicial system, including inquests."" Earlier, the party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the conference that the deal with the Conservative Party was ""in the national interest"" and an opportunity for Northern Ireland. ""Our interests in the negotiations were not in seats for ourselves at the cabinet table but in jobs and investment for our people,"" he said. ""Our goal is not to push some narrow DUP agenda but to deliver for the whole community in Northern Ireland,"" he added. Nigel Dodds said that the time is coming when direct rule will be ""the lesser of two evils"" The Conservative Party are represented at the conference through senior minister Damian Green and chief whip Julian Smith, who is due to give a keynote speech on Saturday afternoon. Mr Dodds also addressed the ongoing political deadlock at Stormont. Mr Dodds said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire must soon consider implementing direct rule if no deal is struck. ""While we understand, because of the talks process and the absence of ministers, things have been more difficult, within a very short space of time that will not be a tenable excuse for not taking action,"" he said. ""None of us want to see direct rule introduced but we are fast approaching the moment when it will be the lesser of two evils.""

One patient was transferred to a major trauma centre for leg injuries, while eight people were taken to central London hospitals for minor injuries.

Policeman hurt in 'despicable' van attack,"Officers tried to stop a white van on Hasfield Road in Norris Green A police officer was seriously injured when he was hit by a van driven at him in Liverpool. Police were trying to stop a white Transit van in Norris Green when it was driven onto the pavement and then at the officer at 19:25 GMT on Saturday. The officer was taken to hospital following the ""despicable attack"" where he is being treated for injuries to his ribs and leg, Merseyside Police said. A man, from Everton, has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The 34-year-old, who is also being held on possession of cannabis and driving while under the influence of drink or drugs, remains in custody. The van hit a police car and other parked vehicles on Hasfield Road before it was driven at the officer, detectives said. The policeman's injuries are not thought to be life-threatening Det Ch Insp Martin Earl said: ""This was a despicable attack on a police officer who was simply doing his job, trying to protect the communities of Merseyside. ""The officer has sustained serious injuries for which he is receiving treatment. He has also been left extremely shaken by his ordeal."" He added that colleagues have been left ""shocked"" by the incident and are being provided with support. Peter Singleton, chair of the Merseyside branch of the Police Federation - which represents 120,000 officers across the UK - said it was ""another sobering reminder of how dangerous policing can be"". ""It's an incident that shows there are individuals out there who really just do not care, have no thoughts for other people - for the public or police officers - and their safety,"" he said. He added it was an ""unnerving reminder"" of the death of Merseyside Police officerDave Phillips, who was killed while trying to stop a stolen vehicle in 2015.

"Actress, 14, wins at 'Chinese Oscars'","Vicky Chen beat established stars A teenage newcomer has beaten established stars to win best supporting actress at the film awards dubbed the Chinese-language Oscars. Vicky Chen, 14, was nominated at the Golden Horse Film Awards for her role in The Bold, The Corrupt and The Beautiful. Her co-star, Hong Kong veteran Kara Wai, won the best actress gong, which Chen was also nominated for. The awards are held annually in Taiwan and are open to Chinese-language films. The Bold, The Corrupt and The Beautiful, a crime drama centred around a wealthy family, was nominated in seven categories and won in three, including best film. Chen was also nominated for best actress for her role in Angels Wear White. She plays a hotel maid who witnesses a sexual assault and grapples with the decision of reporting it. Despite losing to Wai in that prize, she beat two former best actress winners in the best supporting actress category. Will censorship kill Chinese filmmaking? China takes on the world, with Matt Damon Film shines light on London's sex industry Although it missed out on best film, The Great Buddha+, by Taiwanese director Huang Hsin-Yao, was a big winner. It took five awards, including best adapted screenplay, best original film score and best cinematography. The mostly black-and-white dark comedy focuses on two friends - Pickle, a night security guard at a factory making Buddha statues, and Belly Button, a collector of recyclables. The pair uncover footage of Pickle's wealthy boss that reveals his dark secrets. The Bold, The Corrupt and the Beautiful came away with three awards Ang Lee, the Taiwanese-American director, and US actress Jessica Chastain jointly presented the best actress prize.

Bin workers accept deal to end strike,"This video can not be played Birmingham bin strike: 'I'm working next to a bin mountain' Bin workers in Birmingham who were involved in a three-month strike have agreed a deal with the city council. Unite's Howard Beckett said it was a ""victory for common sense"" and meant the industrial action was over. The row started in June when Unite claimed the council's bid to ""modernise"" the service and save Â£5m a year threatened more than 100 jobs. The deal put forward by the council sees 106 staff remain on their current wages but in new recycling roles. The strikes led to thousands of tonnes of rubbish left piled up on the city's streets. Why did refuse workers strike in Birmingham? Mr Beckett, Unite assistant general secretary, said it would no longer be taking the council to the High Court on Monday and a ""court order was expected to legally cement the agreement"". A judge granted an interim injunction against the council in Septemberand a trial was to determine if the council acted unlawfully. The council has agreed to pay Unite's legal costs, Mr Beckett said. ""This deal secures the grade three role and protects the pay of workers who faced losing thousands of pounds,"" he said. He added it was also a ""victory"" for residents ""who no longer need worry about the disruption of industrial action"". Ian Ward, leader of the Labour-run council, said the deal had been achieved through ""quiet, open and honest dialogue"", adding neither the council or Unite wanted things to escalate the way they did. ""This has always been about providing an efficient and effective refuse collection service for Birmingham, as that is what citizens rightly expect and deserve from us,"" he said. His predecessor, John Clancyresigned in Septemberafter criticism of his handling of the dispute. Mr Ward said the disruption had been ""completely unacceptable"" for residents The dealcreates new waste reduction and collection officer roles who will be on bin lorries, focusing on recycling to help ""engage and educate"" residents. Sending less waste to landfill and increasing recycling by 10% is expected to save Â£1.6m a year. The authority also estimates Â£3m a year can be saved by changing workers' hours from a four-day to a five-day week - meaning less reliance on overtime and agency staff.

Australia knocks UK Brexit trade plan,"Australia has criticised the UK's post-Brexit trade plans to split quotas of food imports from around the world. EU rules allow for a certain amount of goods to be brought in from countries outside of the Union without charging full tariffs. After Brexit, the UK and EU want to split these quotas, based on where the goods are mostly consumed. But Australian trade minister Steven Ciobo said it would impose unacceptable restrictions on their exports. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The point is that you have a choice about where you place your quota at the moment. ""Therefore, given that you could put it in the UK or you could put it into continental Europe, why would we accept a proposition that would see a decline in the quota available because of the Brexit decision?"" Post-Brexit trade proposals published What are Brexit Britain's trade options? Davis 'optimistic' over EU trade deal Dave Harrison, from Beef and Lamb New Zealand, agreed that its finances could be hit hard if they were not allowed to choose where to import more or less of their products. He told Today: ""We understand that Brexit causes a lot of difficulties for the European governments, but we don't think third countries should have to take a hit in terms of their negotiated legal rights as a result of that."" Shanker Singham, of The Legatum Institute, said the UK should talk to other countries about trade directly. He added: ""We should be going to them and saying we have the ability - once we take up our chair at the WTO [World Trade Organisation] - to do trade agreements with you that will include a certain amount of liberalisation, depending on what you are prepared to give us. ""But if you damage us on the way to reclaiming our seat on the WTO, we are not going to be able to do those deals with you."" The US, Brazil and Canada are also said to have their doubts about the new deal, believing it could hit them financially. A spokesman for the UK's Department of International Trade told Today the government wanted to minimise disruption to trading relationships and would engage with other members of the World Trade Organisation in an ""open, inclusive way"". Meanwhile, Tory MP Neil Parish, who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs committee in Parliament, raised concerns that if the UK's exports to the EU were hit post-Brexit and more imports were coming into the country from further afield, it could affect industries on our shores. Shadow international secretary of trade, Barry Gardiner, also said the wider implications could see an impact on the British countryside. ""As you affect farming, so you affect the way our country looks,"" he said. ""That means you also affect the tourist trade. ""These are huge decisions that are being taken and we must protect our farmers to make sure that our countryside looks the way we want it to. "" What happens now that a deal's been done?

Fake Sinai photos shared online,"This photo is actually three years old and not from Friday's attack How do you know if the photographs and video footage that you see on social media after an attack are real? In the absence of concrete facts, many people - and news organisations - turn to social media for information. The deadly attack on the al-Rawda mosque in Egypt's North Sinai province, which killed at least 235 people,was no different. In its immediate aftermath, news site Al-Araby shared a dramatic image of crowds outside a smoking building. The headline read: ""Sinai: 200 people killed and wounded in the bombing of a mosque"". The ambulance shown is indeed Egyptian. However, this image does not show the 24 November attack in Sinai. How do we know? By conducting a reverse image search, we can see that the photo was actually taken by a photographer working for the news agency AFP in 2015. It shows the aftermath of abomb attack in another Egyptian town which killed eight people. There are several ways of conducting a reverse image search. If you're using Google Chrome, you can right click on an image and select ""search for image"". If you're using a different browser, you can save the image and then re-upload it to a reverse image search tool. You'll then see the other places on the internet where it appears. Other social media users shared a video supposedly taken ""during the bombing of al-Rawda Mosque"" in Sinai. But this video was in fact first uploaded by Twitter user Mohammad Boland in early 2015, during an attack on a Shiite mosque in eastern Saudi Arabia. The original version of the distressing video,which was shown on American news network CNN,,externalis much higher quality. Video quality can be degraded when it is downloaded and re-uploaded - which makes it harder to find the original when you carry out a reverse image search. Another way of spotting a fake photo is to check the surroundings. Several users had shared a photo that showed a minaret collapsing during an explosion. But the minaret was not from the mosque in Sinai. It was taken in Mosul in 2014. If you come across that photo, compare it to the minaret from the mosque in Sinai, below. They clearly do not match. This is the mosque near al-Arish targeted by the militants in Sinai. There are plenty of genuine images of the devastating attack in Sinai and its aftermath. But there are fake photos in circulation - and by right clicking and carrying out your own reverse image search, you can check from where they really originate.

Egypt's militant groups,"IS' Sinai Province, the most prominent jihadist group, posted video showcasing their weapons More than 200 people have died in an unprecedented attack targeting a Sunni mosque in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula during Friday prayers, highlighting the alarming threat posed by jihadist militants in the region. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, the deadliest of its kind in the country. So-called Islamic State (IS) is the most prominent and violent of the militant groups in Sinai, with a record of targeting civilians in that area and in mainland Egypt. Other groups active in the country are mostly aligned with IS's arch jihadist rival, al-Qaeda. Sinai Province convoy IS's Sinai affiliate, Sinai Province, has claimed responsibility for many deadly attacks, mostly targeting the army in Sinai. It also claimed the downing of a Russian airliner in October 2015. Formerly known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, the group first appeared in September 2011 and rebranded itself with an IS pledge of allegiance in November 2014. The group generally targets Egyptian security forces in northern Sinai, but has also claimed an attack on a tourist site in southern Sinai in April. In the first part of the year IS stepped up its rhetoric and attacks against Christians in Sinai and elsewhere in Egypt, claiming two deadly attacks on churches in Tanta and Alexandria on 9 April. IS started to scale up its attacks in Sinai since September, as it started losing territory in Iraq and Syria. On 24 November, IS boasted about attacks it had carried out earlier in the week targeting policemen in western Arish, the area of the attacked mosque. In addition to its attacks on Christians, IS has adopted a threatening tone against Sufi Muslims, whom it considers to be heretics. The head of IS's religious police in Sinai had previously said that Sufis who did not ""repent"" would be killed. IS has beheaded a number of Sufi men whom it accused of ""sorcery"". Screen grab from the video posted by Jund al-Islam The propaganda and rhetoric of this low-profile group suggests alignment with al-Qaeda. Its rivalry with IS in Sinai surfaced in November when Jund al-Islam issued a threat to IS militants. In an audio message released on 11 November, Jund al-Islam claimed responsibility for an October attack on IS militants in Sinai, and vowed to crush the rival group ""for committing crimes against Muslims"" in the peninsula. A day later, Jund al-Islam issued another statement condemning the 9 November deadly attack on lorry drivers in northern Sinai, as well as blaming IS and the Egyptian government for the deaths. In both its recent messages, Jund al-Islam stressed that it did not target ""innocent Muslims"". Jund al-Islam's recent communiques follow a lengthy spell of media silence since 2015, and suggest the group is presenting itself as a challenger to IS in Sinai. The group emerged in September 2013 with a claim of a double suicide attack on the Egyptian military intelligence HQ in the northern Sinai town of Rafah, which borders the Gaza Strip. It stepped up its propaganda campaign in 2015, claiming rocket attacks on Israel and issuing a propaganda video that hinted at links with al-Qaeda in Yemen (AQAP). Not to be confused with the former Sahara-based jihadist group al-Mourabitoun, this Egyptian faction announced itself in 2015. However, since its formation, the group has not been observed to carry out any prominent attacks, and has mainly put out statements and threats. Given its lack of visible activity, it remains unclear where exactly al-Mourabitoun operates in Egypt. Its propaganda suggests an al-Qaeda orientation, and veteran jihadist media operatives have linked it to an al-Qaeda attempt to check the rise of IS in Egypt. Its leader, Abu-Umar al-Muhajir, alias Hisham Ashmawi, is a former Egyptian army officer and a senior figure in Ansar Beit al-Maqdis before it pledged allegiance to IS. In October 2015, Ashmawi called for the killing of Egyptian military officers, and for revenge in response to the deaths of Palestinians by Israel's security forces. Ashmawi reiterated that message in March 2016, and urged Muslim clerics to play an active role in encouraging young people to embrace jihad. This new group, not to be confused with the veteran Ansar al-Islam in Iraq, emerged in November, when it claimed responsibility for a high-profile attack in Egypt's Western Desert. Ansar al-Islam described the attack, in which more than 50 security personnel died, as ""the beginning of our jihad"". The group's attack claim and its founding statement of 3 November was widely circulated by high-profile online supporters of al-Qaeda, which suggested a nod of approval. Its rhetoric and pledge to fight until the establishment of Islamic law suggest a jihadist orientation. Ansar al-Islam's statement urged Egyptians to join the jihad, or support the group through words or funds. Al-Murabitun posted a video featuring its leader, Abu-Umar al-Muhajir Meaning ""Soldiers of Egypt"", this group appeared in January 2014, and carried out attacks in Cairo over the summer. It has possible al-Qaeda associations, in that the Yemeni and African branches of that network posted eulogies on the death of its leader in April 2015. It also coordinated attacks with Ansar Beit al-Maqdis before the latter joined IS. But Ajnad Misr has repeatedly said that it tries to avoid civilian casualties in its attacks. Many of the group's members are now thought to be in prison. In October 2017, the Egyptian authorities sought death sentences for 13 individuals with suspected links to the group. The individuals are accused of killing soldiers, police officers and civilians, with a verdict expected in December. The Hasm Movement surfaced in the summer of 2016 and has focused on attacking government and security personnel in Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt. The Egyptian authorities and media have linked Hasm to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is outlawed in Egypt. The group's rhetoric is more Islamist and ""pro-revolution"" than jihadist. On 1 October Hasm targeted the Myanmar embassy in Cairo with an explosive device to express its solidarity with Rohingya Muslims, it said. Hasm released its first propaganda video in January in which it showcased its training camps and boasted about the range of attacks it had carried out on the Egyptian authorities. Slick production and the group's claim of organisation and structure in the video were clearly meant to indicate that Hasm was not a shadowy group, but rather a sophisticated force to be reckoned with.

Here's whatNew Zealand head coach Steve Hansen told BBC One: ""I'm proud of the way my team stood up today. There was a lot of energy needed to win this game - every game we've played this year has been a big one - and it was great to win. ""Rieko Ioane is a special player. We've found another 14/15 players this year that we weren't expecting to have to do but the kids have stood up and worn the jersey with a lot of pride and skill.

""We are there with our style of play The execution is the issue not the intent. That's a frustration we have to live with now unfortunately. Thankfully, we've got next week."" Ramiro Moyano (con Sanchez) Argentina go over! Ramiro Moyano deserves that after that breaking run. He latches on to a chip from Gonzalo Bertranou to touch down in the corner. The conversion is good from Nicolas Sanchez. Ireland 28-12 Argentina Argentina steal the ball but they dilly-dally around the try line and Rory Best makes a massive hit on the wonderfully named Jeronimo de la Fuente. Then the Pumas regain possession and Ramiro Moyano goes sprinting down field! He can't quite make it over the 22 metre mark but what an attack from the visitors! They earn a scrum on the five metre mark. #bbcrugby Catherine Bateson:Not even sure why I momentarily got my hopes up then...the historic wait goes on. Saying that, those tries were very good Ireland 28-12 Argentina Ireland build through the attacking phases, and Argentina are pinged for offside at the breakdown, so the hosts kick to the corner again. They want another before full-time.  FT: Wales 18-33 New Zealand New Zealand wing Rieko Ioane speaking on BBC One: ""The Welsh crowd really know how to get behind their side. To play the Welsh at home for the first time is something I won't forget. ""It's been a season of ups and downs but we're happy with how we ended.

Wales 18-33 New Zealand Martyn WilliamsFormer Lions and Wales flanker on BBC Two Ultimately the All Blacks were too good. They controlled the second half and there was a sense of inevitability about it. They've got those special players who can create something from nothing. It was a missed opportunity for Wales after having the momentum in the first half. Johnny Sexton Argentina are penalised twice in quick succession so Johnny Sexton has the option of two locations for a kick from the tee. He lines it up just behind the 22 metre mark, and it's successful. FT: Wales 18-33 New Zealand Sam WarburtonWales flanker on BBC Two It's the same as when we've played New Zealand in the past. A couple of key moments have gone against us. Wales didn't give up  but we've been through it before and it's frustrating. FT: Wales 18-33 New Zealand Tom FordyceChief sports writer at the Principality Stadium There was a reason that the All Blacks were 1/9 with some bookies for this match: they win at full strength playing well, and they win while missing a heap of big names and stuttering. Wales full of promise that was too seldom converted, New Zealand ruthless when they had to be. Wales 18-33 New Zealand What a Test match. All Blacks under pressure, Wales in the ascendancy, but New Zealand got the job done. Wales have not beaten New Zealand since 19 December 1953, and the wait continues. Juan Manuel Leguizamon It's good! Leguizamon receives a lovely looping ball over the top from influential full-back Joaquin Tuculet and the Argentina replacement evades Rob Kearney's tackle to go over in the corner. No conversion from Nicholas Sanchez. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Pakistan calls on army to restore order,"This video can not be played Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters Pakistan's government has called for troops to be deployed in the capital, Islamabad, after violence broke out during protests by Islamists. About 200 people were injured when security forces tried to disperse an Islamist sit-in at the Faizabad Interchange - a key highway. Several deaths have been reported. The protesters have been blocking the highway for several weeks, demanding the sacking of Law Minister Zahid Hamid whom they accuse of blasphemy. Pakistani media report that demonstrators also broke into the minister's residence in Punjab province. Mr Hamid and his family were not in the building. The protests have spread to other cities, including Lahore and the southern port of Karachi. About 200 people were injured in Saturday's clashes The Pakistani government asked the army to deploy in Islamabad on Saturday evening. The interior minister said the order was issued at the request of the city authorities, who were not able to clear the sit-in. There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani military. Protesters want Pakistan's law minister to be sacked Earlier on Saturday, security forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to disperse the demonstrators, Pakistani media report, but were met with rocks and tear gas shells. About 8,500 elite police and paramilitary forces took part in the operation to clear the Faizabad Interchange. The crackdown was later suspended. Protesters said four of their activists were killed, but police said there were no deaths, Reuters reports. However, officials are quoted in other reports confirming that several people were killed. Many of those injured are security personnel. The request for the military deployment came after hundreds more demonstrators turned up unexpectedly, forcing the police to retreat. At one point, the authorities took all private television news channels off air, apparently out of concern that the live coverage of the police action could inflame religious sentiments. The protesting Islamists, from the hardline Tehreek-i-Labaik Ya Rasool Allah Party, want the law minister to be sacked for omitting a reference to the Prophet Muhammad in a new version of the electoral oath. The minister has since apologised saying it was a clerical error.

Russia joins hunt for missing submarine,"A neighbour of crew member Fernando Vicente Villarreal holds his photo at a vigil Russia has joined the search for Argentina's missing submarine and is expected to deploy a remote-controlled device to trawl the sea on Saturday. It is one of a dozen countries involved in the search to find out what happened to the ARA San Juan and its 44-person crew. The sub last made contact on Wednesday 15 November. Hopes of finding survivors have faded since a suspected explosion was reported near its last-known location. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri said, on Friday, that an inquiry would be launched to find out the ""truth"" after a week of uncertainty and speculation. Who are the missing crew? What happens when a submarine vanishes Some of the relatives of the missing crew members have expressed anger at the government and the navy, saying the 34-year-old submarine was in ill repair and unsafe. But the Argentine navy on Saturday insisted the submarine was cleared in routine checks before it set off. Mr Macri said it had recently undergone a refit and was ""in perfect condition"". Russia's Antonov aircraft - one of the world's largest planes - landed in Comodoro Rivadavia, a city in southern Argentina, on Friday night. An expectant crowd came to watch, according to local media. From there it headed to Ushuaia, the country's southern-most town, where the ARA San Juan began its recent trip. Russia's Antonov plane landed in southern Argentina on Friday night It arrived in Argentina carrying an unmanned submersible, known as the Pantera Plus, which conducts sonar scans up to a depth of 1,000 metres (3300ft). The Russian Ministry of Defence has also sent a scientific exploration ship, Yantar, which is yet to arrive having set off from near the coast of West Africa. It will be able to search at an even deeper level. According to AFP news agency, past tests have shown that depths plummet to more than 3,000 metres on the edge of the Argentine shelf. Experts say the Argentine sub would begin to break-up once below depths of around 600 metres. Russia's Kursk submarine sank in the Barents Sea in 2000 after a torpedo exploded during an exercise. All 118 on board the nuclear combat sub died, including 23 who survived the blast but died due to a lack of oxygen. One of the last to die left a note, which signed off saying: ""None of us can escape, I am writing blindly."" The Kursk submarine The Russian government was criticised for waiting five days to accept international assistance. The tragedy sparked the creation of the International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office (Ismerlo) three years later. What will subs look like in the future? Russia fined in Kursk sub disaster case This office - based in Northwood in the UK - is behind the coordination of the global rescue effort for ARA San Juan, which was launched on 17 November when the Argentine Navy made the disappearance public. It enabled US ships, plus planes and vessels from various other countries, to be quickly deployed. The Kursk was a nuclear combat submarine, 154m (505ft) long and participating in military exercises. The 66m ARA San Juan is almost exclusively dedicated to patrolling activities around the Argentine coast. It was thought to have torpedoes on board, but a navy spokesperson denied this on Saturday. ""The explosion did not come from its own weapon or due to an external attack,"" confirmed Capt Enrique Baldi. The crew of the ARA San Juan comprises 43 men and one woman The US, the UK, Brazil, Chile, Norway, Germany, Canada, France, Peru, Colombia and Uruguay have also joined the search. The US Navy has also deployed two underwater vehicles that conduct sonar scans. A Nasa research aircraft has flown over the search area but failed to spot anything. This video can not be played Families of the crew say relatives aren't being told anything ""We have the best naval, air and sensor resources available in the area, all focused on searching for the submarine,"" said Capt Baldi on Friday. ""We are still looking and no country is saying at the moment when they will stop. Logically it's time-limited but no-one is speaking about that at the moment.""

Foster warns time short for NI dealDUP leader says Sinn FÃ©in must decide between making a deal with them or having direct rule ministers.2m3 minutes agoNorthern Ireland,"Arlene Foster said that all parties need to be ""serious about obtaining a deal that is balanced"" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has said Sinn FÃ©in must choose between making a deal with them or having direct rule ministers in place. Speaking at the party's annual conference, she said ""time is short"". Mrs Foster also spoke of the DUP's influence in Westminster and the party's commitment to Brexit. DUP MPs are propping up the Conservative government as part of a confidence-and-supply deal. Stormont deadlock: what you need to know On the failure of talks between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, Mrs Foster said that ""some progress was made but that can only be built upon if all sides are genuinely serious about obtaining a deal that is balanced"". The DUP-Sinn FÃ©in power-sharing government fell apart in January following a row over a green energy scandal, which is now the subject of a public inquiry. A series of talks have failed to find agreement over issues including an Irish language act and same-sex marriage. Arlene Foster told the DUP party conference that Sinn FÃ©in needs to respect British culture ""I said back in the summer that this party was prepared to legislate for the Irish language in the context of legislating for the plurality of cultures that exist in Northern Ireland,"" Mrs Foster told the conference in Belfast. ""The Irish language is spoken and enjoyed by thousands of people in all parts of Northern Ireland,  it does no damage to our unionism or the Union we cherish. ""I respect the Irish language and those who speak it, however, respect isn't a one-way street. ""Respect works both ways."" Mrs Foster said Sinn FÃ©in needed to ""respect our British culture"". ""For too long they have shown nothing but disdain and disrespect for the national flag, the Royal Family, the Armed Forces, British symbols, the constitutional reality and the very name of this country. ""Time is short and those in Sinn FÃ©in blocking the restoration of local decision making need to decide whether they want to do business with us or have direct rule ministers in place. ""I still believe that devolution is the best way to govern Northern Ireland, but to do that in a way that delivers for all of our people we need serious partners in government."" On Brexit, Mrs Foster said it was ""perhaps the most substantial and complex process the government and parliament had undertaken in the modern political era"". She reiterated her desire to find a solution for Northern Ireland that would not harm the country's economic relationship with either the rest of the UK or the Republic of Ireland. ""As we joined the then European Community as one nation we will leave as one United Kingdom,"" she said. Responding to Mrs Foster's address, Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader, Michelle O'Neill said she and her party ""remained committed to making the institutions work,"" but said: ""They must operate on the basis agreed 20 years ago."" ""A majority of citizens in the north expect and are entitled to the same rights enjoyed by citizens across these islands; language and marriage equality rights, due process in all aspects of the legal and judicial system, including inquests."" Earlier, the party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the conference that the deal with the Conservative Party was ""in the national interest"" and an opportunity for Northern Ireland. ""Our interests in the negotiations were not in seats for ourselves at the cabinet table but in jobs and investment for our people,"" he said. ""Our goal is not to push some narrow DUP agenda but to deliver for the whole community in Northern Ireland,"" he added. Nigel Dodds said that the time is coming when direct rule will be ""the lesser of two evils"" The Conservative Party are represented at the conference through senior minister Damian Green and chief whip Julian Smith, who is due to give a keynote speech on Saturday afternoon. Mr Dodds also addressed the ongoing political deadlock at Stormont. Mr Dodds said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire must soon consider implementing direct rule if no deal is struck. ""While we understand, because of the talks process and the absence of ministers, things have been more difficult, within a very short space of time that will not be a tenable excuse for not taking action,"" he said. ""None of us want to see direct rule introduced but we are fast approaching the moment when it will be the lesser of two evils.""

Paul Ashton, from Sussex, went on the run in 2004 charged with possessing indecent images of children. When he was discovered at Caldey Island in 2011, more indecent images were found on his computer in the monastery. He was arrested and brought to justice after a visitor recognised him from a Crimestoppers ""Most Wanted"" list. The story behind Caldey Island 'Torment' of Caldey Island victim Father Thaddeus Kotik befriended children on the island The revelation comes after it emerged six women have been paid compensation by Caldey Abbey after they were abused by a monk on Caldey Island in the 1970s and 1980s. Since that information came to light last week, a further five women have come forward accusing Father Thaddeus Kotik of abusing them. Allegations were made to the abbey in 1990 but complaints were not passed on to police. Police confirm island sex abuse reports Monk abuse apology angers victims This video can not be played Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said the abbey ""got things wrong"" when it failed to report allegations to police Dyfed Powys Police was eventually made aware of the allegations in 2014 but could not prosecute Kotik as he died in 1992. The current abbot, Brother Daniel van Santvoort, has apologised the complaints were not referred to police sooner. Ashton is understood to have arrived on Caldey Island as a guest in 2004, but stayed and moved into the clock tower which overlooks the island. Paul Ashton was jailed in 2012 for possessing indecent images of children He was provided with accommodation and food by the monks, who knew him by his alias Robert Judd. A source said: ""When Robert arrived he offered to help and made himself indispensable. ""He operated the island's satellite internet and phone system, managed online accommodation bookings and the accounts and worked in the mail room. ""He put himself in an ideal position."" Ashton had absconded from his home in Bracklesham Bay, West Sussex after Sussex Police executed a search warrant and confiscated computers in 2004. In July 2011, an anonymous call was made to Crimestoppers by someone who had seen Ashton's face on its ""Most Wanted"" list, and he was arrested on the island. Sussex Police said: ""They recognised the picture as a man working in south Wales but under a different nameâ¦ police were informed and local officers swiftly arrested him in relation to the Sussex inquiry.

Trump says he shunned Person of the Year,"Mr Trump was named Time's Person of the Year in 2016 after his election to the presidency Time Magazine is disputing US President Donald Trump's account of how he rejected a request for an interview and photo shoot ahead of its Person of the Year issue. On Friday, Mr Trump tweeted that Time had called to say he was ""probably"" going to be named Person of the Year. But Time later said the president was incorrect about how it makes its choice. The president was awarded the title last year. He has previously falsely claimed that he holds the record for cover appearances on Time Magazine. The magazine's tradition - begun in 1927 as ""Man of the Year"" - recognises the person who ""for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year"". Time said it did not comment on its choice until publication, and that its decision would be revealed on 6 December. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

England hold off Tonga to reach final,"This video can not be played Highlights: England reach 2017 World Cup final despite late Tonga comeback Rugby League World Cup semi-final Tonga (0) 18 Tries:Junior, Havili, LoloheaGoals:Taukeiaho (3) England (12) 20 Tries:McGillvary, Widdop, BatemanGoals:Widdop (4) England reached a first World Cup final since 1995 as they survived a late Tonga fightback in Auckland to set up a meeting with holders Australia. Wayne Bennett's side were leading 20-0 with seven minutes remaining after tries from Jermaine McGillvary, Gareth Widdop and John Bateman. But Tevita Pangai Junior, Siliva Havili and Tuimoala Lolohea crashed over at a sold-out Mount Smart Stadium. And Andrew Fifita had a try ruled out in the final seconds of the match. Referee Matt Cecchin ruled that the prop had earlier lost the ball - and to the ire of the Tongans did not refer it to the video referee. It was an absolutely pulsating, nerve-shredding end to a match played in front of a passionate crowd who heavily favoured Tonga. England will face the Kangaroos, whothrashed Fiji 54-6in the other semi-final, in the final in Brisbane next Saturday, 2 December - a match you can watch live on BBC One. Tonga coach unhappy with controversial late call England's last appearance in the final came 22 years ago with Denis Betts, now among the coaching staff, captaining the side in a 16-8 defeat by Australia at Wembley. Every tournament since has ended in a semi-final defeat, each one by New Zealand, but it looked with seven minutes to go as though England were cruising into next Saturday's showpiece. England's semi-final record since 1995 1995 - England 25-10 Wales 2000 - England 6-49 New Zealand 2008 - England 22-32 New Zealand 2013 - England 18-20 New Zealand At 20-0 down, Tonga had other ideas. The Pacific Islanderscame from 16-2 down to beat New Zealandin the group stage and, backed by a vocal Tongan support in Auckland, almost engineered a comeback of even greater proportions. First, after 73 minutes, Junior edged his way over the England line to cross for a try that was eventually confirmed by the video referee - but it looked like nothing more than a well-deserved consolation. But the nerves began to kick in for Bennett's side as Tonga kept the ball alive before Havili broke through several would-be tacklers to make the score 20-12. Two minutes later and England's advantage was reduced to two points, Lolohea again breaching England's line to put Tonga within one score of their first World Cup final. England were in disarray and the crowd were absolutely roaring on Tonga. This video can not be played This is how close Tonga came to 'impossible' win McGillvary, one of England's best performers at this World Cup, stole a key intercept to win the ball back with England just needing to see out the final 90 seconds, but the winger lost the ball in a tackle to give Tonga one last attack. And when Fifita found a route through it looked like England's tournament was yet again going to end in semi-final heartbreak. Elliott Whitehead's attempted tackle forced the prop to drop the ball but, with Tonga thinking Whitehead had ripped it in an attempted ball steal, Fifita re-gathered and touched down over the line. Australian referee Cecchin deemed it as a loose carry from the Tonga prop, opting not to consult the video referee, and that was enough for England to hold on to reach a first final in 22 years. Gareth Widdop had a hand in all three of England's tries For 70 minutes, England's scrambling defence had stood up to the Tongan threat while the forwards set the platform for Widdop to provide the spark from full-back. England began their World Cup campaign with Widdop in the halves, but head coach Bennett used the St George Illawarra Dragons man the number one shirt in the final group game against France. Widdop has kept that spot since and, while also allowing Kevin Brown to flourish at six, proved the inspiration against Tonga with a hand in all three of England's tries. It was his superb break that set the field position for England to score their first, joining the line to send McGillvary in at the corner. The full-back doubled England's advantage shortly after with a try of his own, gathering Whitehead's pass to roll over from close range for a score that was awarded by the video referee. Widdop then edged England further ahead with a penalty after the break, before teeing up Bateman with a well-timed pass for the centre to crash in for England's third. He played with a positional nous and cunning that England will need if they are to threaten an unbeaten Kangaroos team next weekend. An estimated 80,000 people of Tongan descent live in Auckland Papua New Guinea's matches in Port Moresby were all sold out but very few other matches have been at the World Cup and there were oceans of empty seats at Friday's other semi-final in Brisbane. But England were met by a sea of red shirts and flags as the Tongan support poured into a sold-out Mount Smart Stadium which, at 30,003, witnessed its biggest crowd since home side Auckland Warriors joined the Australian Rugby League in 1995. There is an estimated 80,000 people of Tongan descent in Auckland, leading the city to be dubbed 'Little Tonga' and it almost made the semi-final feel like a home game for the Pacific Islanders. ""I've played in some massive games and hostile atmospheres, but nothing like this before,"" said England prop James Graham. Tonga's desire and belief they could get back into the semi-final was characterised by a rousing chorus of hymns from the red and white crowd, while they shared in the players' tears at the final whistle. Tonga became the first Tier Two nation to beat a Tier One side for more than 20 years when they beat the Kiwis in the group stage, coming after the likes ofJason Taumalolo, Manu Vatuvei and Fifita turned down New Zealand and Australiato play for the countries from which their families descend. England did well to stem the initial tide of enthusiasm, looking solid defensively and enjoying a 100% success rate in their opening 10 sets. Passionate, committed and absolutely amazing as they sung as one - the pro-Tonga crowd were absolutely amazing Bennett's side were let off when the Pacific Islanders shifted a flowing move to the left that winger Daniel Tupou fumbled with a clear run of the line in front of him. But with Brown and Luke Gale in the halves, England's game management was more controlled and considered - until a frantic final few minutes - and it was for large parts their most convincing performance of the tournament against undoubtedly their toughest test so far. ""For very long periods we were on top of that game but a little ill disciplined when we needed to be better,"" said Tonga coach Kristian Woolf. ""For whatever reason the sorts of opportunities we have taken in past games we weren't able to take."" This video can not be played Australia 54-6 Fiji highlights So Australia, for the 14th successive time, await in the final in Brisbane next Saturday. The clinical Kangaroos brushed aside a Fiji side in the semi-finals that had shocked co-hosts New Zealand in the last eight. Valentine Holmes crossed for a record six tries, his 12th of the competition, and has already surpassed Wendell Sailor's record of 10 scores with one match left to play. But Australia, unbeaten under coach Mal Meninga, are a threat right across the park with a settled back line, powerful forward pack and an in-form halves partnership led by Cooper Cronk. England will have to call on all that scrambling defence and ingenuity in attack if they are to shock the holders on their own turf.

Bin workers accept new deal to end strike,"This video can not be played Birmingham bin strike: 'I'm working next to a bin mountain' Bin workers in Birmingham who were involved in a three-month strike have agreed a deal with the city council. Unite's Howard Beckett said it was a ""victory for common sense"" and meant the industrial action was over. The row started in June when Unite claimed the council's bid to ""modernise"" the service and save Â£5m a year threatened more than 100 jobs. The deal put forward by the council sees 106 staff remain on their current wages but in new recycling roles. The strikes led to thousands of tonnes of rubbish left piled up on the city's streets. Why did refuse workers strike in Birmingham? Mr Beckett, Unite assistant general secretary, said it would no longer be taking the council to the High Court on Monday and a ""court order was expected to legally cement the agreement"". A judge granted an interim injunction against the council in Septemberand a trial was to determine if the council acted unlawfully. The council has agreed to pay Unite's legal costs, Mr Beckett said. ""This deal secures the grade three role and protects the pay of workers who faced losing thousands of pounds,"" he said. He added it was also a ""victory"" for residents ""who no longer need worry about the disruption of industrial action"". Ian Ward, leader of the Labour-run council, said the deal had been achieved through ""quiet, open and honest dialogue"", adding neither the council or Unite wanted things to escalate the way they did. ""This has always been about providing an efficient and effective refuse collection service for Birmingham, as that is what citizens rightly expect and deserve from us,"" he said. His predecessor, John Clancyresigned in Septemberafter criticism of his handling of the dispute. Mr Ward said the disruption had been ""completely unacceptable"" for residents The dealcreates new waste reduction and collection officer roles who will be on bin lorries, focusing on recycling to help ""engage and educate"" residents. Sending less waste to landfill and increasing recycling by 10% is expected to save Â£1.6m a year. The authority also estimates Â£3m a year can be saved by changing workers' hours from a four-day to a five-day week - meaning less reliance on overtime and agency staff.

YouTube ads pulled over predatory accounts,"Videos uploaded by young children were targeted by predators found news organisations Mars, Lidl, Adidas and others have pulled all advertisements from YouTube after some were found next to clips used by predators to target children. Investigations bythe BBCandthe Times,externalfound tens of thousands of ""predatory"" accounts have been used to leave explicit comments on children's videos. Problems with the video-sharing site's reporting systemhave been blamed for letting the accounts persist. YouTube said it was ""working urgently"" to clean up the site. A Mars spokesmantold the Guardian:,external""We are shocked and appalled to see that our adverts have appeared alongside such exploitative and inappropriate content."" It said it had immediately suspended advertising globally on YouTube and Google. Adverts would not return until it was sure YouTube had put safeguards in place, it added. Lidl, Deutsche Bank and Cadbury and many other big brands are also believed to have suspended advertising campaigns while the video-sharing site acts. A YouTube spokesman said: ""There shouldn't be any ads running on this content and we are working urgently to fix this."" The investigations found that clips posted innocently by young children on YouTube had attracted attention from predatory adults who left obscene comments and made sexually explicit requests. The BBC was alerted to the scale of the problem by volunteer members of YouTube's Trusted Flagger programme who alert the site to potential violations of its guidelines. M&S paused its ads on Google in June after they were found next to extremist content Trusted Flaggers who talked to the BBC said there could be up to 100,000 active predatory accounts on the site, all of which were able to survive because the system to report them did not work well. YouTube has responded to the twin investigations by shutting accounts used to make predatory comments and by turning off comments on thousands of videos. The ad suspensions come only days after YouTube unveiled new measures that were supposed to limit the spread of sexualised and violent content. It promised to be tougher about applying its guidelines on what was appropriate, block inappropriate comments on videos featuring children and expunge adverts that target families with material that is offensive. This is after YouTube was criticised about accounts that targeted children with videos that feature popular characters, such as Peppa Pig, in strange or disturbing situations. Also, in June this year, YouTube was forced to act after major brands pulled adverts when they found their content was being linked to videos featuring hate speech and extremism.

'No overcrowding link' to prison suicide,"There is no clear link between prison suicides and overcrowding behind bars, an international study has suggested. The research, published inthe Lancet Psychiatry journal,external, looked into almost 4,000 prison suicides in 24 countries, including England and Wales. It found deaths between 2011-14 were highest in the countries with the lowest rates of imprisonment. Prison suicides could be cut by sending fewer people with mental illnesses to prison and with better care, it added. Researchers analysed 3,906 prison suicides across 20 European countries, as well as in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It found rates of prison suicide varied considerably, ranging from 23 per 100,000 prisoners in the US, to 180 per 100,000 prisoners in Norway. What can be done to cut prison suicides? Reality check: Is Wales the new Botany Bay? The research found no connection between suicides and prison overcrowding - except in low-income countries where extremely crowded cells might cause extra stress. It found there were proportionately more self-inflicted deaths in prisons in Norway and Sweden, where custody was generally reserved for the most violent and dangerous offenders, including those with mental health problems. Suicide rates in UK prisons were called a ""national scandal"" aftera record number of people killed themselves in prisons in England and Walesin 2016. The Prison Reform Trust has said reducing jail populations is the way to make prisons safe. But this latest report said prison suicides ""are likely to be the result of a complex interaction of different factors, and not merely due to the prison environment"". ""Overall, our findings suggest that there are no simple ecological explanations for prison suicide,"" the report said. ""Rather, it is likely to be due to complex interactions between individual-level and ecological factors."" It concluded that suicide prevention initiatives should draw on ""multidisciplinary approaches"" which look at individual and system-level risk.

Reality Check: Fake Sinai photos on social media,"This photo is actually three years old and not from Friday's attack How do you know if the photographs and video footage that you see on social media after an attack are real? In the absence of concrete facts, many people - and news organisations - turn to social media for information. The deadly attack on the al-Rawda mosque in Egypt's North Sinai province, which killed at least 235 people,was no different. In its immediate aftermath, news site Al-Araby shared a dramatic image of crowds outside a smoking building. The headline read: ""Sinai: 200 people killed and wounded in the bombing of a mosque"". The ambulance shown is indeed Egyptian. However, this image does not show the 24 November attack in Sinai. How do we know? By conducting a reverse image search, we can see that the photo was actually taken by a photographer working for the news agency AFP in 2015. It shows the aftermath of abomb attack in another Egyptian town which killed eight people. There are several ways of conducting a reverse image search. If you're using Google Chrome, you can right click on an image and select ""search for image"". If you're using a different browser, you can save the image and then re-upload it to a reverse image search tool. You'll then see the other places on the internet where it appears. Other social media users shared a video supposedly taken ""during the bombing of al-Rawda Mosque"" in Sinai. But this video was in fact first uploaded by Twitter user Mohammad Boland in early 2015, during an attack on a Shiite mosque in eastern Saudi Arabia. The original version of the distressing video,which was shown on American news network CNN,,externalis much higher quality. Video quality can be degraded when it is downloaded and re-uploaded - which makes it harder to find the original when you carry out a reverse image search. Another way of spotting a fake photo is to check the surroundings. Several users had shared a photo that showed a minaret collapsing during an explosion. But the minaret was not from the mosque in Sinai. It was taken in Mosul in 2014. If you come across that photo, compare it to the minaret from the mosque in Sinai, below. They clearly do not match. This is the mosque near al-Arish targeted by the militants in Sinai. There are plenty of genuine images of the devastating attack in Sinai and its aftermath. But there are fake photos in circulation - and by right clicking and carrying out your own reverse image search, you can check from where they really originate.

Who are Egypt's militant groups?,"IS' Sinai Province, the most prominent jihadist group, posted video showcasing their weapons More than 200 people have died in an unprecedented attack targeting a Sunni mosque in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula during Friday prayers, highlighting the alarming threat posed by jihadist militants in the region. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, the deadliest of its kind in the country. So-called Islamic State (IS) is the most prominent and violent of the militant groups in Sinai, with a record of targeting civilians in that area and in mainland Egypt. Other groups active in the country are mostly aligned with IS's arch jihadist rival, al-Qaeda. Sinai Province convoy IS's Sinai affiliate, Sinai Province, has claimed responsibility for many deadly attacks, mostly targeting the army in Sinai. It also claimed the downing of a Russian airliner in October 2015. Formerly known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, the group first appeared in September 2011 and rebranded itself with an IS pledge of allegiance in November 2014. The group generally targets Egyptian security forces in northern Sinai, but has also claimed an attack on a tourist site in southern Sinai in April. In the first part of the year IS stepped up its rhetoric and attacks against Christians in Sinai and elsewhere in Egypt, claiming two deadly attacks on churches in Tanta and Alexandria on 9 April. IS started to scale up its attacks in Sinai since September, as it started losing territory in Iraq and Syria. On 24 November, IS boasted about attacks it had carried out earlier in the week targeting policemen in western Arish, the area of the attacked mosque. In addition to its attacks on Christians, IS has adopted a threatening tone against Sufi Muslims, whom it considers to be heretics. The head of IS's religious police in Sinai had previously said that Sufis who did not ""repent"" would be killed. IS has beheaded a number of Sufi men whom it accused of ""sorcery"". Screen grab from the video posted by Jund al-Islam The propaganda and rhetoric of this low-profile group suggests alignment with al-Qaeda. Its rivalry with IS in Sinai surfaced in November when Jund al-Islam issued a threat to IS militants. In an audio message released on 11 November, Jund al-Islam claimed responsibility for an October attack on IS militants in Sinai, and vowed to crush the rival group ""for committing crimes against Muslims"" in the peninsula. A day later, Jund al-Islam issued another statement condemning the 9 November deadly attack on lorry drivers in northern Sinai, as well as blaming IS and the Egyptian government for the deaths. In both its recent messages, Jund al-Islam stressed that it did not target ""innocent Muslims"". Jund al-Islam's recent communiques follow a lengthy spell of media silence since 2015, and suggest the group is presenting itself as a challenger to IS in Sinai. The group emerged in September 2013 with a claim of a double suicide attack on the Egyptian military intelligence HQ in the northern Sinai town of Rafah, which borders the Gaza Strip. It stepped up its propaganda campaign in 2015, claiming rocket attacks on Israel and issuing a propaganda video that hinted at links with al-Qaeda in Yemen (AQAP). Not to be confused with the former Sahara-based jihadist group al-Mourabitoun, this Egyptian faction announced itself in 2015. However, since its formation, the group has not been observed to carry out any prominent attacks, and has mainly put out statements and threats. Given its lack of visible activity, it remains unclear where exactly al-Mourabitoun operates in Egypt. Its propaganda suggests an al-Qaeda orientation, and veteran jihadist media operatives have linked it to an al-Qaeda attempt to check the rise of IS in Egypt. Its leader, Abu-Umar al-Muhajir, alias Hisham Ashmawi, is a former Egyptian army officer and a senior figure in Ansar Beit al-Maqdis before it pledged allegiance to IS. In October 2015, Ashmawi called for the killing of Egyptian military officers, and for revenge in response to the deaths of Palestinians by Israel's security forces. Ashmawi reiterated that message in March 2016, and urged Muslim clerics to play an active role in encouraging young people to embrace jihad. This new group, not to be confused with the veteran Ansar al-Islam in Iraq, emerged in November, when it claimed responsibility for a high-profile attack in Egypt's Western Desert. Ansar al-Islam described the attack, in which more than 50 security personnel died, as ""the beginning of our jihad"". The group's attack claim and its founding statement of 3 November was widely circulated by high-profile online supporters of al-Qaeda, which suggested a nod of approval. Its rhetoric and pledge to fight until the establishment of Islamic law suggest a jihadist orientation. Ansar al-Islam's statement urged Egyptians to join the jihad, or support the group through words or funds. Al-Murabitun posted a video featuring its leader, Abu-Umar al-Muhajir Meaning ""Soldiers of Egypt"", this group appeared in January 2014, and carried out attacks in Cairo over the summer. It has possible al-Qaeda associations, in that the Yemeni and African branches of that network posted eulogies on the death of its leader in April 2015. It also coordinated attacks with Ansar Beit al-Maqdis before the latter joined IS. But Ajnad Misr has repeatedly said that it tries to avoid civilian casualties in its attacks. Many of the group's members are now thought to be in prison. In October 2017, the Egyptian authorities sought death sentences for 13 individuals with suspected links to the group. The individuals are accused of killing soldiers, police officers and civilians, with a verdict expected in December. The Hasm Movement surfaced in the summer of 2016 and has focused on attacking government and security personnel in Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt. The Egyptian authorities and media have linked Hasm to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is outlawed in Egypt. The group's rhetoric is more Islamist and ""pro-revolution"" than jihadist. On 1 October Hasm targeted the Myanmar embassy in Cairo with an explosive device to express its solidarity with Rohingya Muslims, it said. Hasm released its first propaganda video in January in which it showcased its training camps and boasted about the range of attacks it had carried out on the Egyptian authorities. Slick production and the group's claim of organisation and structure in the video were clearly meant to indicate that Hasm was not a shadowy group, but rather a sophisticated force to be reckoned with.

'Altercation' caused Oxford Circus panic,"Police want to speak to two men after an altercation ""erupted"" on a platform Police have released images of two men they want to speak to, after an altercation at a central London Tube station created mass panic on Friday. Officers want to speak to anyone who was at Oxford Circus underground station at the time of the evacuation. Sixteen people were treated after they were injured fleeing the station, following reports of gunshots being fired on a Central Line platform. There was no evidence any weapons had been fired, police said. Shoppers were barricaded inside stores on Oxford Street and armed police were deployed after the alarm was raised during the evening rush hour on Black Friday. Police initially treated the incident as potentially terrorism-related, before standing down. The British Transport Police said it believed there had been an altercation between two men on the platform before the scare. Oxford Circus scare: As it happened The Metropolitan Police said it began receiving ""numerous"" 999 calls reporting gunshots in Oxford Street and at Oxford Circus station at 16:38 GMT on Friday. The first armed response vehicle was on the scene in less than a minute from receiving the first call, the force said.

According to BBC correspondent Andy Moore, eyewitnesses reported being evacuated from the tube station on the instructions of a generic announcement. They came up to street level in a state of confusion - some reporting loud bangs - spreading panic among shoppers which quickly passed down the street and onto social media. The British Transport Police told those in the area to ""go into a building and stay inside until further notice"". People barricaded themselves into shops, many of which went into lockdown - including Selfridges, which is half a mile down Oxford Street from Oxford Circus. Singer Olly Murs, who was shopping in Selfridges, told his 7.8m followers on Twitter: ""Get out of Selfridges now gun shots!! I'm inside."" He added: ""Really not sure what's happened! I'm in the back office... but people screaming and running towards exits!"" Mr Murs, who was later criticised for spreading panic, said afterwards: ""It's easy to say now it was nothing but in a state of shock and panic I was trying to make people aware of what was happening. Which I was led to believe by staff and customers that someone was shooting."" Selfridges later said on Twitter that it was evacuated ""as a precautionary measure"".

Officer suspended amid criminal probeAssistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins is suspended as an investigation into criminal conduct begins.3h3 hours agoScotland,"A senior officer from Police Scotland has been suspended amid an investigation into criminal conduct. Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins was suspended with immediate effect by the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) on Friday afternoon. Three other officers have also been suspended and two have been placed on restricted duties. A spokesman for ACC Higgins said he ""denies and rejects"" any allegations of wrongdoing. The independent police watchdog is investigating allegations of criminal conduct and gross misconduct. In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Iain Livingstone confirmed the suspension of ACC Higgins, who was responsible for operational support, custody and criminal justice. He said: ""I can confirm that Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins was suspended today by the Scottish Police Authority. ""In addition, three other officers have been suspended, and two others placed on restricted duties, by Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick. ""This is in connection with an investigation by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc). ""At this time our focus must remain on continuing to meet the operational challenges that we face each day."" He added that Assistant Chief Constable Nelson Telfer would take responsibility for the operational support portfolio. However a spokesman for ACC Higgins said he denied wrongdoing. ""He will fully cooperate with the investigation. He intends to resume his duties as soon as this matter has been resolved,"" he added. BBC Scotland understands the allegations are connected to a wider criminal investigation. They are not connected to the separate Pirc investigations into allegations of misconduct against Chief Constable Phil Gormley who is currently on ""special leave."" Nor are they connected to inquiries into allegations that officers in the former counter-corruption unit abused their position when attempting to find the source of a journalist's information. ACC Higgins joined Strathclyde Police in 1988 and served in uniform posts across Glasgow and Lanarkshire. He became a superintendent in 2006 and was then promoted to detective chief superintendent and head of the public protection unit in 2010. Later in 2010, he was made divisional commander in charge of Glasgow Central and West Division. He was appointed Strathclyde Police Temporary Assistant Chief Constable (Territorial Policing) in March 2012. In January 2013, he became assistant chief constable of Police Scotland with responsibility for operational support before assuming responsibility for the wider justice and support portfolio. In his current role, which he was appointed to in September last year, he has responsibility for the operational support, custody and criminal justice divisions. The decision to suspend Mr Higgins was taken by the SPA board after it was alerted to the criminal and misconduct allegations by the Pirc. In a statement, the SPA said the suspension would be reviewed in four weeks or if there is a change in circumstances. The Pirc said it initially referred the anonymous allegations to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, as it is responsible for the prosecution of crime. The Crown Office decided an independent investigation should be carried out by the Pirc and that is now under way. As the complaint also included allegations of misconduct by a senior police officer, the commissioner referred the matters to the SPA on 18 October. The SPA suspended Mr Higgins on Friday and referred allegations of gross misconduct to the Pirc The commissioner is now carrying out an assessment to establish whether a misconduct investigation is required. A spokesman for the commissioner said: ""Following receipt of anonymous allegations of criminality by officers, including a senior officer, serving with Police Scotland, the Commissioner referred the allegations to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). ""This was to allow the COPFS to consider whether the criminal allegations should be investigated by the Commissioner. ""The COPFS decided that an independent investigation should be carried out by the PIRC and this is now under way."" The Scottish government has issued a statement saying that as the matter was under investigation by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner it was unable to comment further. However, Liam Kerr, the justice spokesman for the Conservative Party, called for Scotland's justice secretary to come ""out of the shadows"" on the difficulties faced by Police Scotland. He told BBC Radio Scotland: ""The conspicuous absences of the justice secretary - my view would be that he's got to step out of the shadows and get a grip on this because it keeps happening on his watch.""

Egypt vows forceful response after massacre,"This video can not be played A man who survived the Egypt mosque attack says he saw between 10 and 20 people with weapons Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has vowed to respond with ""the utmost force"" after 300 people were killed at a North Sinai mosque during Friday prayers. The al-Rawda mosque in the town of Bir al-Abed was bombed and fleeing worshippers were then gunned down. The Egyptian military has said it has conducted air strikes on ""terrorist"" targets in response. No group has yet claimed the attack, the deadliest in recent memory. After bombs were set off, dozens of gunmen waiting outside the mosque opened fire on those trying to escape. The assailants reportedly set parked vehicles on fire in the vicinity to block off access to the building, and fired on ambulances trying to help victims. Thirty children are among the dead and at least 100 people have been wounded. Egypt's militant groups explained Sisi the strongman What is Sufism? ""What is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism,"" Mr Sisi said in a televised address hours after the attack. ""The armed forces and the police will avenge our martyrs and restore security and stability with the utmost force."" Egyptian security forces have for years been fighting an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula, and militants affiliated with so-called Islamic State (IS) have been behind scores of deadly attacks in the desert region. The injured were brought to hospitals near and far, including in Cairo Locals say the al-Rawda mosque is used by the local Sawarka tribe, which is known to cooperate with the security services against militants. It is also known to be popular with worshippers of Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam that is condemned by some jihadist groups. The head of IS's ""religious police"" in Sinai said last December that Sufis who did not ""repent"" would be killed, after the group beheaded two elderly men reported to be Sufi clerics. The number of victims is unprecedented for an attack of this type, says the BBC's Sally Nabil in Cairo. She adds that this is the first time that worshippers inside a mosque have been targeted by militants in North Sinai. An army spokesman said ""terrorist spots"", where weapons and ammunition were reportedly stocked, had been bombed by air force jets on Friday in response. The official also said that several vehicles used in the attack had been located and destroyed. Three days of national mourning have been declared. By Orla Guerin, Cairo correspondent This is a major challenge to the Egyptian state. If this was IS, it is always worth considering the broader regional dimension. In the last few months, IS has had massive territorial losses in Iraq and across the border in Syria. If IS was behind this, this could be an attempt to remind supporters around the world that they are still here, still relevant and can still inflict terrible damage on their enemies. What we don't know right now is if the Egyptian security establishment, if President Sisi, has anything else in the arsenal to try. He has already tried the hardline military approach - there has been a massive military operation going on in the Sinai peninsula for years. It has not delivered results that time and time again the Egyptian establishment has promised. But it is unclear if they have something new they can try to attempt to curb this very stubborn Islamic insurgency which has inflicted such terrible damage in this attack. Militant Islamists stepped up attacks in Sinai after Egypt's military overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi following mass anti-government protests in July 2013. Hundreds of police, soldiers and civilians have been killed since then, mostly in attacks carried out by the Sinai Province group, which is affiliated to IS. Sinai Province has also carried out deadly attacks against Egypt's Coptic Christian minority elsewhere in the country, and said it was behindthe bombing of a Russian planecarrying tourists in Sinai in 2015, killing 224 people on board. Egypt disputes desert shootout reports Sinai plane crash: What we know The IS affiliate in Sinai It has been operating mainly in North Sinai, which has been under a state of emergency since October 2014, when 33 security personnel were killed in an attack claimed by the group. Sinai Province is thought to want to take control of the Sinai peninsula in order to turn it into an Islamist province run by IS. Security forces ""will avenge our martyrs"", President Sisi said Journalists, including from state-sponsored outlets, have not been allowed to report from North Sinai in the last few years. Correspondents say that the frequency of attacks raises doubts about the effectiveness of military operations against militants. Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit condemned the attack as a ""terrifying crime which again shows that Islam is innocent of those who follow extremist terrorist ideology"". Governments in the UK, US, France, Russia, Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere have deplored the massacre. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Egypt Sinai attackers 'carried IS flags',"This video can not be played The Egyptian military released footage of air strikes on ""terrorist targets"" Egyptian officials investigating the massacre of worshippers at a mosque in Sinai say the attackers were carrying the flag of the Islamic State group. At least 305 people died in the assault, which was launched during Friday prayers and has not yet been claimed by any group. Egypt's public prosecutor said there were up to 30 attackers at the scene.

""The armed forces and the police will avenge our martyrs and restore security and stability with the utmost force."" By Dr HA Hellyer, regional expert What is particular about this attack is that this is not only the first on such a scale, but it was also carried out with such a lack of interest in local dynamics. Until now, radical groups have been trying to recruit in Egypt, from among local Egyptians. It is very difficult to see how that will be remotely possible following this attack - irrespective of local grievances vis-Ã -vis the state. If anything, this will only intensify local opposition to any group that claims the slightest bit of sympathy for attacks of this nature.

Sex offender evaded justice at abbey,"Caldey Island is a popular tourist attraction A fugitive child sex offender fled to a Pembrokeshire island's abbey to evade justice and remained there for seven years, it has been revealed. Paul Ashton, from Sussex, went on the run in 2004 charged with possessing indecent images of children. When he was discovered at Caldey Island in 2011, more indecent images were found on his computer in the monastery. He was arrested and brought to justice after a visitor recognised him from a Crimestoppers ""Most Wanted"" list. The story behind Caldey Island 'Torment' of Caldey Island victim Father Thaddeus Kotik befriended children on the island The revelation comes after it emerged six women have been paid compensation by Caldey Abbey after they were abused by a monk on Caldey Island in the 1970s and 1980s. Since that information came to light last week, a further five women have come forward accusing Father Thaddeus Kotik of abusing them. Allegations were made to the abbey in 1990 but complaints were not passed on to police. Police confirm island sex abuse reports Monk abuse apology angers victims This video can not be played Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said the abbey ""got things wrong"" when it failed to report allegations to police Dyfed Powys Police was eventually made aware of the allegations in 2014 but could not prosecute Kotik as he died in 1992. The current abbot, Brother Daniel van Santvoort, has apologised the complaints were not referred to police sooner. Ashton is understood to have arrived on Caldey Island as a guest in 2004, but stayed and moved into the clock tower which overlooks the island. Paul Ashton was jailed in 2012 for possessing indecent images of children He was provided with accommodation and food by the monks, who knew him by his alias Robert Judd. A source said: ""When Robert arrived he offered to help and made himself indispensable. ""He operated the island's satellite internet and phone system, managed online accommodation bookings and the accounts and worked in the mail room. ""He put himself in an ideal position."" Ashton had absconded from his home in Bracklesham Bay, West Sussex after Sussex Police executed a search warrant and confiscated computers in 2004. In July 2011, an anonymous call was made to Crimestoppers by someone who had seen Ashton's face on its ""Most Wanted"" list, and he was arrested on the island. Sussex Police said: ""They recognised the picture as a man working in south Wales but under a different nameâ¦ police were informed and local officers swiftly arrested him in relation to the Sussex inquiry. ""More computer equipment containing further images was also found."" Ashton, then aged 59, pleaded guilty at Chichester Crown Court to possessing more than 5,000 indecent images of children on his computers, hard drives and USB sticks. He was jailed for 30 months in March 2012 and was placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life. Caldey Abbey has been asked to comment.

Mexico creates huge marine national park,"The island is best known for its species including manta rays - with spans of up to 7m (22ft) The Mexican government has created a large marine reserve around a group of islands home to hundreds of species including rays, whales and sea turtles. The Revillagigedo Archipelago is a group of volcanic islands off the country's south-west coast. With a protection zone of 57,000 square miles (150,000km), it has become the largest ocean reserve in North America. The move will mean all fishing activity will be banned, and the area will be patrolled by the navy. It is hoped the move will help populations hit by commercial fishing operations in the area recover. The park was designated by a decree signed by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. It will also forbid natural resources being extracted from the land or the building of new hotel infrastructure. The area, which is about 250 miles (400km) south-west of the country's Baja California peninsula has been described as the Galapagos of North America, because of its volcanic nature and unique ecology. The archipelago consists of San Benedicto, Socorro, Roca Partida and Clarion volcanic islands Sitting on the convergence of two ocean currents, the islands are a hub for open water and migratory species. It has hundreds of breeds of ocean wildlife, including humpback whales that use the shallow and coastal areas around the islands for breeding. Last year the Pacific Ocean site was named as a UNESCO world heritage area. MarÃ­a JosÃ© Villanueva, the director of conservation of WWF in Mexico, described the move as an ""important precedent"",externalto the rest of the world, according to local media.

"YouTube ads pulled over predatory accountsMars, Lidl and Adidas are among companies to act after inappropriate content found next to their ads.9h9 hours agoTechnology","Videos uploaded by young children were targeted by predators found news organisations Mars, Lidl, Adidas and others have pulled all advertisements from YouTube after some were found next to clips used by predators to target children. Investigations bythe BBCandthe Times,externalfound tens of thousands of ""predatory"" accounts have been used to leave explicit comments on children's videos. Problems with the video-sharing site's reporting systemhave been blamed for letting the accounts persist. YouTube said it was ""working urgently"" to clean up the site. A Mars spokesmantold the Guardian:,external""We are shocked and appalled to see that our adverts have appeared alongside such exploitative and inappropriate content."" It said it had immediately suspended advertising globally on YouTube and Google. Adverts would not return until it was sure YouTube had put safeguards in place, it added. Lidl, Deutsche Bank and Cadbury and many other big brands are also believed to have suspended advertising campaigns while the video-sharing site acts. A YouTube spokesman said: ""There shouldn't be any ads running on this content and we are working urgently to fix this."" The investigations found that clips posted innocently by young children on YouTube had attracted attention from predatory adults who left obscene comments and made sexually explicit requests. The BBC was alerted to the scale of the problem by volunteer members of YouTube's Trusted Flagger programme who alert the site to potential violations of its guidelines. M&S paused its ads on Google in June after they were found next to extremist content Trusted Flaggers who talked to the BBC said there could be up to 100,000 active predatory accounts on the site, all of which were able to survive because the system to report them did not work well. YouTube has responded to the twin investigations by shutting accounts used to make predatory comments and by turning off comments on thousands of videos. The ad suspensions come only days after YouTube unveiled new measures that were supposed to limit the spread of sexualised and violent content. It promised to be tougher about applying its guidelines on what was appropriate, block inappropriate comments on videos featuring children and expunge adverts that target families with material that is offensive. This is after YouTube was criticised about accounts that targeted children with videos that feature popular characters, such as Peppa Pig, in strange or disturbing situations. Also, in June this year, YouTube was forced to act after major brands pulled adverts when they found their content was being linked to videos featuring hate speech and extremism.

"'Clean your windows' to avoid jet crashesIn the past five years, there have been 19 near misses involving UK aircraft and US fighter planes.9h9 hours agoSuffolk","One case this year involved RAF Lakenheath-based F-15s which came within 50m (150ft) of an RAF Voyager The US Air Force (USAF) has urged its UK-based pilots to keep cockpit windows clean to avoid mid-air collisions with civilian aircraft. RAF Lakenheath-based USAF F-15 jets were involved in 19 near-misses with UK aircraft in the past five years. An F-15 pilot from the Suffolk base was recently praised after spotting a glider by eyesight rather than radar and avoiding a collision. The USAF said its pilots were trained to fly in a ""vigilant state"". The near-miss in April happened when a pair of low-flying F-15s came close to a glider over the Black Mountains near Hereford. TheUK Airprox Board found the glider, which was not picked up on radar, was spotted by one of the pilots and the F-15s manoeuvred out of the way,external. The British Glider Association commended the F15 pilot's look-out skills. More than 1,000 near-misses have been reported to the UK Airprox Board in the past five years, of which about 360 have involved UK or US military aircraft. One of the most serious happened in January when two F-15s from RAF Lakenheathcame within 50m (150ft) of an RAF tanker plane. The USAF said not only was there ""increasing general aviation traffic"" but smaller civilian aircraft were not equipped with transponders, meaning they may not be picked up on radar. Nearly all of the US aircraft based at RAF Lakenheath operate on ultra high frequency (UHF) radio and cannot hear civilian aircraft, which use very high frequency (VHF), the USAF says. The reference sheets given to pilots at RAF Lakenheath outline a number of measures aimed at avoiding mid-air collisions As a result, the USAF has urged its pilots to use what it describes as ""see and avoid"" - essentially to keep a look out. Areference sheet for USAF pilots at RAF Lakenheath, which is home to the US 48th Fighter Wing, urges them to keep their windscreens clean,externaland to ""consciously note how much time you spend looking outside the cockpit"". A USAF spokesman said: ""Sometimes little things like keeping your screen clean can make the difference. ""Safety is always a priority for our pilots, who are trained to maintain a vigilant state of situational awareness at all times. ""The airspace above the United Kingdom remains busy and complex, but we are confident the risk of airprox (air proximity) events is minimized by our continuous training, consistent focus on flight safety and our direct communication with Royal Air Force and civilian air traffic control services.""

"'No overcrowding link' to prison suicideResearchers looked at almost 4,000 prison suicides in 24 countries, including in England and Wales.6h6 hours agoUK","There is no clear link between prison suicides and overcrowding behind bars, an international study has suggested. The research, published inthe Lancet Psychiatry journal,external, looked into almost 4,000 prison suicides in 24 countries, including England and Wales. It found deaths between 2011-14 were highest in the countries with the lowest rates of imprisonment. Prison suicides could be cut by sending fewer people with mental illnesses to prison and with better care, it added. Researchers analysed 3,906 prison suicides across 20 European countries, as well as in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It found rates of prison suicide varied considerably, ranging from 23 per 100,000 prisoners in the US, to 180 per 100,000 prisoners in Norway. What can be done to cut prison suicides? Reality check: Is Wales the new Botany Bay? The research found no connection between suicides and prison overcrowding - except in low-income countries where extremely crowded cells might cause extra stress. It found there were proportionately more self-inflicted deaths in prisons in Norway and Sweden, where custody was generally reserved for the most violent and dangerous offenders, including those with mental health problems. Suicide rates in UK prisons were called a ""national scandal"" aftera record number of people killed themselves in prisons in England and Walesin 2016. The Prison Reform Trust has said reducing jail populations is the way to make prisons safe. But this latest report said prison suicides ""are likely to be the result of a complex interaction of different factors, and not merely due to the prison environment"". ""Overall, our findings suggest that there are no simple ecological explanations for prison suicide,"" the report said. ""Rather, it is likely to be due to complex interactions between individual-level and ecological factors."" It concluded that suicide prevention initiatives should draw on ""multidisciplinary approaches"" which look at individual and system-level risk.

"US 'to stop arming anti-IS Syrian Kurds'The US confirms making ""adjustments"" to support for Syrian groups, but does not name the YPG militia.7h7 hours agoMiddle East","The YPG played a key role in removing IS from Raqqa and other strongholds The US is to stop supplying arms to the Syrian Kurdish militia the YPG, Turkey has said. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said President Donald Trump had made the promise in a phone call to his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The White House said it was making ""adjustments"" to its support for partners inside Syria but did not explicitly name the YPG. Turkey has long complained about US support for the group. Washington has viewed the YPG as a key player in the fight against so-called Islamic State (IS), but Ankara brands the group's fighters as terrorists. Turkey says the YPG is as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades in south-eastern Turkey. The US, however, has seen the YPG as distinct from the PKK. In May it announced it would supply arms to the Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which were poised to drive IS from its stronghold of Raqqa. It had previously armed only Arab elements of the SDF. US-led coalition military advisers have been assisting YPG fighters ""President Trump instructed [his generals] in a very open way that the YPG will no longer be given weapons,""Mr Cavusoglu was quoted as saying in the Turkish Hurriyet Daily News,external. He said Mr Trump gave his assurances after President Erdogan reiterated his concern over the continued supply of weapons and armoured vehicles to the YPG. What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? The rapid rise and fall of 'Islamic State' Analysis: The BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington If this is true, it would be a major shift in US policy. The Kurds have proved to be valuable partners in the fight against IS. It is notable that Washington's account of the call does not mention taking away the arms that the Trump administration agreed to give the YPG earlier this year - something Ankara has called for. Turkey feared the weapons would end up in the hands of fighters intent on creating an independent Kurdish state. The Pentagon is likely reassessing its needs in Syria as the fight against IS has waned in recent months. But whatever adjustments are being made, it is clear the US military has no plans to leave the war-torn country. It has been revealed that about 2,000 US troops are now based there - a significant increase since the Obama administration. The White House confirmed the two leaders had spoken by phone and said Mr Trump ""reaffirmed the strategic partnership"" between the US and Turkey. ""Consistent with our previous policy, President Trump also informed President Erdogan of pending adjustments to the military support provided to our partners on the ground in Syria, now that the battle of Raqqa is complete,"" the statement said. ""We are progressing into a stabilisation phase to ensure that Isis [IS] cannot return. The leaders also discussed the purchase of military equipment from the United States."" Pro-Syrian government forces have also driven IS from land it once controlled The SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, has driven IS militants from much of the land it once controlled. The YPG and its political arm, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), denies any direct links with the PKK, whose insurgency has left thousands dead. But Mr Cavusoglu has previously said that every weapon obtained by the YPG constituted ""a threat to Turkey"". The SDF declared victory in Raqqa last month after a four-month battle to retake the city from IS, which had ruled it for three years.

England hold off Tonga to reach finalEngland reach a first World Cup final since 1995 as they see off Tonga in Auckland to set up a meeting with Australia.12m13 minutes agoBBC Sport,"This video can not be played Highlights: England reach 2017 World Cup final despite late Tonga comeback Rugby League World Cup semi-final Tonga (0) 18 Tries:Junior, Havili, LoloheaGoals:Taukeiaho (3) England (12) 20 Tries:McGillvary, Widdop, BatemanGoals:Widdop (4) England reached a first World Cup final since 1995 as they survived a late Tonga fightback in Auckland to set up a meeting with holders Australia. Wayne Bennett's side were leading 20-0 with seven minutes remaining after tries from Jermaine McGillvary, Gareth Widdop and John Bateman. But Tevita Pangai Junior, Siliva Havili and Tuimoala Lolohea crashed over at a sold-out Mount Smart Stadium. And Andrew Fifita had a try ruled out in the final seconds of the match. Referee Matt Cecchin ruled that the prop had earlier lost the ball - and to the ire of the Tongans did not refer it to the video referee. It was an absolutely pulsating, nerve-shredding end to a match played in front of a passionate crowd who heavily favoured Tonga. England will face the Kangaroos, whothrashed Fiji 54-6in the other semi-final, in the final in Brisbane next Saturday, 2 December - a match you can watch live on BBC One. Tonga coach unhappy with controversial late call England's last appearance in the final came 22 years ago with Denis Betts, now among the coaching staff, captaining the side in a 16-8 defeat by Australia at Wembley. Every tournament since has ended in a semi-final defeat, each one by New Zealand, but it looked with seven minutes to go as though England were cruising into next Saturday's showpiece. England's semi-final record since 1995 1995 - England 25-10 Wales 2000 - England 6-49 New Zealand 2008 - England 22-32 New Zealand 2013 - England 18-20 New Zealand At 20-0 down, Tonga had other ideas. The Pacific Islanderscame from 16-2 down to beat New Zealandin the group stage and, backed by a vocal Tongan support in Auckland, almost engineered a comeback of even greater proportions. First, after 73 minutes, Junior edged his way over the England line to cross for a try that was eventually confirmed by the video referee - but it looked like nothing more than a well-deserved consolation. But the nerves began to kick in for Bennett's side as Tonga kept the ball alive before Havili broke through several would-be tacklers to make the score 20-12. Two minutes later and England's advantage was reduced to two points, Lolohea again breaching England's line to put Tonga within one score of their first World Cup final. England were in disarray and the crowd were absolutely roaring on Tonga. This video can not be played This is how close Tonga came to 'impossible' win McGillvary, one of England's best performers at this World Cup, stole a key intercept to win the ball back with England just needing to see out the final 90 seconds, but the winger lost the ball in a tackle to give Tonga one last attack. And when Fifita found a route through it looked like England's tournament was yet again going to end in semi-final heartbreak. Elliott Whitehead's attempted tackle forced the prop to drop the ball but, with Tonga thinking Whitehead had ripped it in an attempted ball steal, Fifita re-gathered and touched down over the line. Australian referee Cecchin deemed it as a loose carry from the Tonga prop, opting not to consult the video referee, and that was enough for England to hold on to reach a first final in 22 years. Gareth Widdop had a hand in all three of England's tries For 70 minutes, England's scrambling defence had stood up to the Tongan threat while the forwards set the platform for Widdop to provide the spark from full-back. England began their World Cup campaign with Widdop in the halves, but head coach Bennett used the St George Illawarra Dragons man the number one shirt in the final group game against France. Widdop has kept that spot since and, while also allowing Kevin Brown to flourish at six, proved the inspiration against Tonga with a hand in all three of England's tries. It was his superb break that set the field position for England to score their first, joining the line to send McGillvary in at the corner. The full-back doubled England's advantage shortly after with a try of his own, gathering Whitehead's pass to roll over from close range for a score that was awarded by the video referee. Widdop then edged England further ahead with a penalty after the break, before teeing up Bateman with a well-timed pass for the centre to crash in for England's third. He played with a positional nous and cunning that England will need if they are to threaten an unbeaten Kangaroos team next weekend. An estimated 80,000 people of Tongan descent live in Auckland Papua New Guinea's matches in Port Moresby were all sold out but very few other matches have been at the World Cup and there were oceans of empty seats at Friday's other semi-final in Brisbane. But England were met by a sea of red shirts and flags as the Tongan support poured into a sold-out Mount Smart Stadium which, at 30,003, witnessed its biggest crowd since home side Auckland Warriors joined the Australian Rugby League in 1995. There is an estimated 80,000 people of Tongan descent in Auckland, leading the city to be dubbed 'Little Tonga' and it almost made the semi-final feel like a home game for the Pacific Islanders. ""I've played in some massive games and hostile atmospheres, but nothing like this before,"" said England prop James Graham. Tonga's desire and belief they could get back into the semi-final was characterised by a rousing chorus of hymns from the red and white crowd, while they shared in the players' tears at the final whistle. Tonga became the first Tier Two nation to beat a Tier One side for more than 20 years when they beat the Kiwis in the group stage, coming after the likes ofJason Taumalolo, Manu Vatuvei and Fifita turned down New Zealand and Australiato play for the countries from which their families descend. England did well to stem the initial tide of enthusiasm, looking solid defensively and enjoying a 100% success rate in their opening 10 sets. Passionate, committed and absolutely amazing as they sung as one - the pro-Tonga crowd were absolutely amazing Bennett's side were let off when the Pacific Islanders shifted a flowing move to the left that winger Daniel Tupou fumbled with a clear run of the line in front of him. But with Brown and Luke Gale in the halves, England's game management was more controlled and considered - until a frantic final few minutes - and it was for large parts their most convincing performance of the tournament against undoubtedly their toughest test so far. ""For very long periods we were on top of that game but a little ill disciplined when we needed to be better,"" said Tonga coach Kristian Woolf. ""For whatever reason the sorts of opportunities we have taken in past games we weren't able to take."" This video can not be played Australia 54-6 Fiji highlights So Australia, for the 14th successive time, await in the final in Brisbane next Saturday. The clinical Kangaroos brushed aside a Fiji side in the semi-finals that had shocked co-hosts New Zealand in the last eight. Valentine Holmes crossed for a record six tries, his 12th of the competition, and has already surpassed Wendell Sailor's record of 10 scores with one match left to play. But Australia, unbeaten under coach Mal Meninga, are a threat right across the park with a settled back line, powerful forward pack and an in-form halves partnership led by Cooper Cronk. England will have to call on all that scrambling defence and ingenuity in attack if they are to shock the holders on their own turf.

According to BBC correspondent Andy Moore, eyewitnesses reported being evacuated from the tube station on the instructions of a generic announcement. They came up to street level in a state of confusion - some reporting loud bangs - spreading panic among shoppers which quickly passed down the street and onto social media. The British Transport Police told those in the area to ""go into a building and stay inside until further notice"". People barricaded themselves into shops, many of which went into lockdown - including Selfridges, which is half a mile down Oxford Street from Oxford Circus. Singer Olly Murs, who was shopping in Selfridges, told his 7.8m followers on Twitter: ""Get out of Selfridges now gun shots!! I'm inside."" He added: ""Really not sure what's happened! I'm in the back office... but people screaming and running towards exits!"" Mr Murs, who was later criticised for spreading panic, said afterwards: ""It's easy to say now it was nothing but in a state of shock and panic I was trying to make people aware of what was happening. Which I was led to believe by staff and customers that someone was shooting."" Selfridges later said on Twitter that it was evacuated ""as a precautionary measure"".

Classic cars 'stripped by restorer',"About 40 customers of Christopher Handford say he took their money for work that was not carried out Dozens of car enthusiasts claim they have been defrauded out of hundreds of thousands of pounds by a businessman who vanished after stripping their vehicles for restoration. About 40 customers say Christopher Handford took their money for work that was not carried out. Nearly Â£300,000 is said to have been paid by the customers to North West Mini Motors in Glossop, Derbyshire. The BBC has repeatedly tried to reach Mr Handford for comment. Engines and other car parts were left in the garage when the new owners took over This car, left in the garage when the new owners took over, was said to have been brought intact by a customer The new owners of the garage said he disappeared in October, leaving car parts and other items behind. Derbyshire Police has confirmed it is investigating. Matthew Slater said he was ""devastated"" when he first saw his cars, which had parts such as doors, steering columns and engines missing. He says it has cost him more than Â£20,000. ""I was promised two full restorations and that has just not happened, I just got empty promises,"" he said. ""I have known him for six years and he should not have done this to a friend, let alone anyone else."" Will Taylor also sent a car to Mr Handford, who he befriended through a Mini club, and said it makes him feel ""horrible"" and ""depressed"". ""It went in as a nice show car - polished, clean, shiny wheels,"" he said. ""There's actually more rust on it now than when it went in. ""I considered us quite close friends - obviously friends shouldn't do this to each other."" Beverley Hulme said her family has lost more than Â£7,000 on a car, which has been in her family for more than 40 years and is in exactly the same state as when she put it on for repairs. ""We're actually one of the fortunate victims in so much as he hasn't actually been touched and we've got [it] back,"" she said. ""There's a lot of people who are in a lot worse position."" Ms Hulme said after Mr Handford stopped replying to emails she started looking at online reviews, which she said were ""quite scary"" and prompted her to help others. ""There could be potentially so many more [victims] out there that we can't get hold of,"" she said. ""It's a case of making sure he doesn't do this again and take money from other people.""

UK warned to brace for cold and snow,"There has already been snow across parts of Scotland Icy conditions caused train delays of up to 90 minutes on Saturday, after temperatures dropped below freezing in parts of the country overnight. Network Rail,externalsaid some Southern, Gatwick Express and Thameslink lines were forced to run at reduced speeds. South Western Railway also warned of delays due to ice, which came on top of planned weekend engineering works. Temperatures fell to lows of -5.2C in Yorkshire, as forecasters said the wintry weather looked set to continue. The Met Office has issued ayellow warning,externalfor ice across Northern Ireland, north-west and south-west England and much of Scotland between 20:00 on Saturday and 10:00 GMT on Sunday. The yellow warning advises people to ""be aware"" that conditions will turn icy again tonight, with rain, sleet and hail showers continuing. Following the frosty start to the day,BBC Weatherforecasted a cold and bright day with wintry showers in the north and west of England. The showers will fall as snow over the hills and to low levels in the north, and perhaps in some parts of the Midlands. Snowy scenes in Pitlochry, Scotland, on Friday Dr Thomas Waite, from Public Health England, reminded people to take precautions. ""Those most at risk include older people, very young children and those with conditions like heart and lung disease,"" he said. ""Ask yourself if you could check on a neighbour to see if there's anything they need?"" Figures from the Office for National Statistics, showed an estimated 34,400 ""excess deaths"" occurred in England and Wales last winter. Meanwhile, councils in England and Wales have stockpiled 1.5 million tonnes of salt for roads this winter. Nine out of 10 councils in England and Wales either have the same amount of salt as last year or even more, according to the Local Government Association (LGA). More than half of councils are sharing salt stocks, while others share gritters and staff when required. With temperatures falling, some local authorities have already deployed gritters on to roads. There have already been heavy snowfalls in the Scottish Highlands this week, whereicy conditions caused a number of road accidents. Meanwhile in Lancashire, more than70 people had to be rescuedfrom floods.

'Clean your windows' to avoid jet crashes,"One case this year involved RAF Lakenheath-based F-15s which came within 50m (150ft) of an RAF Voyager The US Air Force (USAF) has urged its UK-based pilots to keep cockpit windows clean to avoid mid-air collisions with civilian aircraft. RAF Lakenheath-based USAF F-15 jets were involved in 19 near-misses with UK aircraft in the past five years. An F-15 pilot from the Suffolk base was recently praised after spotting a glider by eyesight rather than radar and avoiding a collision. The USAF said its pilots were trained to fly in a ""vigilant state"". The near-miss in April happened when a pair of low-flying F-15s came close to a glider over the Black Mountains near Hereford. TheUK Airprox Board found the glider, which was not picked up on radar, was spotted by one of the pilots and the F-15s manoeuvred out of the way,external. The British Glider Association commended the F15 pilot's look-out skills. More than 1,000 near-misses have been reported to the UK Airprox Board in the past five years, of which about 360 have involved UK or US military aircraft. One of the most serious happened in January when two F-15s from RAF Lakenheathcame within 50m (150ft) of an RAF tanker plane. The USAF said not only was there ""increasing general aviation traffic"" but smaller civilian aircraft were not equipped with transponders, meaning they may not be picked up on radar. Nearly all of the US aircraft based at RAF Lakenheath operate on ultra high frequency (UHF) radio and cannot hear civilian aircraft, which use very high frequency (VHF), the USAF says. The reference sheets given to pilots at RAF Lakenheath outline a number of measures aimed at avoiding mid-air collisions As a result, the USAF has urged its pilots to use what it describes as ""see and avoid"" - essentially to keep a look out. Areference sheet for USAF pilots at RAF Lakenheath, which is home to the US 48th Fighter Wing, urges them to keep their windscreens clean,externaland to ""consciously note how much time you spend looking outside the cockpit"". A USAF spokesman said: ""Sometimes little things like keeping your screen clean can make the difference. ""Safety is always a priority for our pilots, who are trained to maintain a vigilant state of situational awareness at all times. ""The airspace above the United Kingdom remains busy and complex, but we are confident the risk of airprox (air proximity) events is minimized by our continuous training, consistent focus on flight safety and our direct communication with Royal Air Force and civilian air traffic control services.""

Egypt mosque attackers kill 235,"The militants targeted a mosque near al-Arish Militants have launched a bomb and gun attack on a mosque in Egypt's North Sinai province, killing 235 people, state media say. The al-Rawda mosque in the town of Bir al-Abed was targeted during Friday prayers. It is the deadliest attack of its kind since an Islamist insurgency in the peninsula was stepped up in 2013. Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi vowed to respond with ""brute force"" after talks with security officials. No group has yet claimed the attack, but militants affiliated with so-called Islamic State (IS) have been responsible for scores of deadly attacks in the province. This video can not be played Ambulances rushed to the scene of the attack They usually target security forces and Christian churches, and the bloody attack on a mosque associated with Sufi Muslims has shocked Egypt. Witnesses said dozens of gunmen arrived in off-road vehicles and bombed the packed mosque before opening fire on worshippers as they tried to flee. The assailants are reported to have set parked vehicles on fire in the vicinity to block off access to the mosque. Pictures from the scene show rows of bloodied victims inside the mosque. At least 100 people were wounded, reports say, overwhelming hospitals. ""They were shooting at people as they left the mosque,"" a local resident who had relatives there told Reuters news agency. ""They were shooting at the ambulances too."" It is the deadliest militant attack in modern Egyptian history. Bir al-Abed is about 130 miles (211km) from Cairo. Locals are quoted as saying that followers of Sufism, a mystical branch of Sunni Islam, regularly gathered at the mosque. Although Sufis are widely accepted across much of the Muslim world, some jihadist groups, including IS, see them as heretics. Who are Egypt's militant groups? What is Sufism? The head of IS's religious police in Sinai said last December that Sufis who did not ""repent"" would be killed, after the group beheaded two elderly men reported to be Sufi clerics. The victim of the mosque attack also included military conscripts. Militant Islamists have been waging an insurgency on the Sinai peninsula in recent years, stepping up attacks after Egypt's military overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi after mass anti-government protests in July 2013. Hundreds of police, soldiers and civilians have been killed since then, mostly in attacks carried out by Sinai Province group, which is affiliated to IS. In September,at least 18 policemen were killed when the group attacked a convoy near al-Arish. Sinai Province has also carried out deadly attacks against Egypt's Coptic Christian minority elsewhere in the country, and said it bombed a Russian plane carrying tourists in Sinai in 2015, killing 224 people on board. Egypt disputes desert shootout reports Sinai plane crash: What we know The IS affiliate in Sinai It has been operating mainly in North Sinai, which has been under a state of emergency since October 2014, when 33 security personnel were killed in an attack claimed by the group. Sinai Province is thought to want to take control of the Sinai Peninsula in order to turn it into an Islamist province run by IS. By Sally Nabil, BBC News, Cairo Islamist militants have been operating in northern Sinai for several years, mainly targeting security forces. But this is the first time that worshippers inside a mosque have been targeted. The number of victims is unprecedented for an attack of this type. Northern Sinai has been living under a media blackout over the past few years. No media organisations have been allowed to go there, including state-sponsored ones. The frequency of attacks raises doubts about the effectiveness of military operations. While the army releases statements every now and then, claiming victory in some parts of Sinai, there seems to be no end in sight to the ongoing battle between the army and militants. The injured were brought to hospitals far away, including in Cairo President Sisi has declared three days of mourning. The military is reported to have already conducted air strikes in mountains around Bir al-Abed. ""What is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism, to destroy our efforts to stop the terrible criminal plan that aims to destroy what is left of our region,"" Mr Sisi said in a televised address. Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit condemned the attack as a ""terrifying crime which again shows that Islam is innocent of those who follow extremist terrorist ideology"". In other reaction: UK Prime Minister Theresa May tweeted: ""Appalled by the sickening attack on a mosque in North Sinai. Condolences with all those in #Egypt affected by this evil and cowardly act."" US President Donald Trump called the attack ""horrible and cowardly"". French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the attack ""despicable"", while Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said lights at the Eiffel Tower would turn off to honour the victims The city hall in Tel Aviv, Israel, projected the Egyptian flag to show solidarity Allow Twitter content?

Egypt vows forceful response after attack,"This video can not be played A man who survived the Egypt mosque attack says he saw between 10 and 20 people with weapons Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has vowed to respond with ""the utmost force"" after 300 people were killed at a North Sinai mosque during Friday prayers. The al-Rawda mosque in the town of Bir al-Abed was bombed and fleeing worshippers were then gunned down. The Egyptian military has said it has conducted air strikes on ""terrorist"" targets in response. No group has yet claimed the attack, the deadliest in recent memory. After bombs were set off, dozens of gunmen waiting outside the mosque opened fire on those trying to escape. The assailants reportedly set parked vehicles on fire in the vicinity to block off access to the building, and fired on ambulances trying to help victims. Thirty children are among the dead and at least 100 people have been wounded. Egypt's militant groups explained Sisi the strongman What is Sufism? ""What is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism,"" Mr Sisi said in a televised address hours after the attack. ""The armed forces and the police will avenge our martyrs and restore security and stability with the utmost force."" Egyptian security forces have for years been fighting an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula, and militants affiliated with so-called Islamic State (IS) have been behind scores of deadly attacks in the desert region. The injured were brought to hospitals near and far, including in Cairo Locals say the al-Rawda mosque is used by the local Sawarka tribe, which is known to cooperate with the security services against militants. It is also known to be popular with worshippers of Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam that is condemned by some jihadist groups. The head of IS's ""religious police"" in Sinai said last December that Sufis who did not ""repent"" would be killed, after the group beheaded two elderly men reported to be Sufi clerics. The number of victims is unprecedented for an attack of this type, says the BBC's Sally Nabil in Cairo. She adds that this is the first time that worshippers inside a mosque have been targeted by militants in North Sinai. An army spokesman said ""terrorist spots"", where weapons and ammunition were reportedly stocked, had been bombed by air force jets on Friday in response. The official also said that several vehicles used in the attack had been located and destroyed. Three days of national mourning have been declared. By Orla Guerin, Cairo correspondent This is a major challenge to the Egyptian state. If this was IS, it is always worth considering the broader regional dimension. In the last few months, IS has had massive territorial losses in Iraq and across the border in Syria. If IS was behind this, this could be an attempt to remind supporters around the world that they are still here, still relevant and can still inflict terrible damage on their enemies. What we don't know right now is if the Egyptian security establishment, if President Sisi, has anything else in the arsenal to try. He has already tried the hardline military approach - there has been a massive military operation going on in the Sinai peninsula for years. It has not delivered results that time and time again the Egyptian establishment has promised. But it is unclear if they have something new they can try to attempt to curb this very stubborn Islamic insurgency which has inflicted such terrible damage in this attack. Militant Islamists stepped up attacks in Sinai after Egypt's military overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi following mass anti-government protests in July 2013. Hundreds of police, soldiers and civilians have been killed since then, mostly in attacks carried out by the Sinai Province group, which is affiliated to IS.
