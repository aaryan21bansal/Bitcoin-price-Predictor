Boohoo 'set to buy Debenhams brand and website',"Boohoo is set to buy the Debenhams brand and website, the BBC understands. However, the fast fashion retailer will not be taking on any of the company's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce. The announcement could come as early as Monday morning. The 242-year-old chain is already in the process of closing down, after administrators failed to secure a rescue deal for the business, with the likely loss of 12,000 jobs. A closing down sale at 124 Debenhams stores began in December, as administrators continued to seek offers for all, or parts of the business. In the last week or so, the company announced that six shops would not reopen after lockdown, including its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. Debenhams set to close putting 12,000 jobs at risk Mike Ashley in talks to rescue Debenhams What went wrong at Debenhams? Boohoo has already bought a number of High Street brands out of administration. It snapped up Oasis, Coast and Karen Millen, but not the associated stores. Debenhams and Boohoo declined to comment. Debenhams has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping has moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April. Mike Ashley has bought other struggling businesses including House of Fraser and Evans Cycles However, its position became untenable during the coronavirus pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods. The firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May, as it struggled to stay afloat. Businessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April. However the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of Â£125m, was rejected as being too low, leaving JD Sports as the last remaining bidder. Mr Ashley had previously built up a 29% stake in the chain, but saw his Â£150m holding wiped out in 2019, when the company fell into administration and then ended up in the hands of its lenders - a consortium led by hedge fund Silverpoint. In early December, the Frasers Group confirmed thatit was working on a possible last minute rescue of Debenhams. The announcement came five days after staff were informed andliquidators moved in to Debenhams' stores to start clearing stock, after a potential rescue deal with JD Sports fell through. But Frasers said there was ""no certainty"" it could save the chain. One of the biggest issues, it said, was the collapse into administration last week of another High Street giant, Arcadia, which is the biggest concession holder in Debenhams department stores.

World record number of satellites launched,"This video can not be played Watch: Rocket launch containing record breaking number of satellites A new world record has been set for the number of satellites sent to space on a single rocket. The 143 payloads, of all shapes and sizes, rode to orbit on a SpaceX Falcon rocket that launched out of Florida. The number beats the previous record of 104 satellites carried aloft by an Indian vehicle in 2017. It's further evidence of the major structural changes taking place in space activity that are allowing many more actors to get involved. This shift is the result of a revolution in robust, miniaturised, low-cost components - many taken direct from consumer electronics such as smartphones - that mean pretty much anyone can now build a capable satellite in a very small package. And with SpaceX offering to transport those packages to orbit for just $1m, the commercial opportunities will continue to open up. Branson's rocket team go 'bonkers' with delight Satellite radar firm delivers super sharp pictures Elon Musk's Starship prototype makes a big impact Guatemala's Santa MarÃ­a volcano: Planet is imaging the entire Earth daily with its Dove satellites SpaceX itself had 10 satellites on the Falcon - the latest additions to its Starlink telecommunications mega-constellation, which is going to deliver broadband internet connections around the globe. San Francisco's Planet company had the most satellites of all on the flight - 48. These were another batch of its SuperDove models that image the Earth's surface daily at a resolution of 3-5m. The new spacecraft take the firm's operational fleet now in orbit to more than 200. ""Internet of things"": SpaceBees will connect to all manner of objects on the ground The SuperDoves are the size of a shoebox. Many of the other payloads on the Falcon rocket were little bigger than a coffee mug, however; and some were smaller even than a paperback book. Swarm Technologies is rolling out what it calls the SpaceBees. They're just 10cm by 10cm by 2.5cm. They'll act as telecommunications nodes to connect devices that are attached to all manner of objects on the ground, from migrating animals to shipping containers. The satellites were mounted on a dispenser that ejected them in sequence Some of the larger items on the Falcon rocket were suitcase-sized. Among these were several radar satellites. Radar has been one of the major beneficiaries of the revolution in componentry. Traditionally, radar satellites were big, multi-tonne objects that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to fly, which essentially meant only the military or major space agencies could afford to operate them. But the adoption of new materials and compact ""off the shelf"" parts have dramatically shrunk the size (to under 100kg) and price (a couple of million dollars) of these spacecraft. iQPS artwork: The radar satellites unfurl large antennas once they are in space Iceye from Finland, Capella from the US, and iQPS of Japan all took the ride to orbit on Sunday. These start-ups are establishing constellations in the sky that will return rapid, repeat imagery of the Earth. Radar has the advantage over standard optical cameras of being able to pierce cloud, and to sense the Earth's surface whether it is day or night. We're entering an age when any change on the planet, wherever it happens, will be picked up almost immediately. The Falcon carried the 143 satellites into a 500km-high path that runs from pole to pole. This is one of the drawbacks of a big rideshare mission: you go where the rocket goes, and for some that might not be ideal. A number of satellite missions will want an orbit that's higher or lower in the sky, or on a different inclination to the equator. This can be achieved by mounting the satellites on ""space tugs"" which, after coming off the top of the rocket, modify the final parameters for their ""passengers"" over the course of several weeks. Sunday's Falcon carried two such tugs. But for some missions a bespoke ride is going to be the only satisfactory solution. It's why we're now witnessing a rush to produce small rockets that can run dedicated flights. This video can not be played Watch: Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne rocket blasts its way to space These smaller rockets will not be able to compete on cost with the big vehicles, such as SpaceX's Falcon-9, but they should attract the custom of those with very specific or urgent needs. Dan Hart, the CEO of Virgin Orbit, which has developed a small rocket that can be launched from under the wing of a Boeing 747, says the start-ups are becoming more discerning. ""These small satellites used to be points of fascination and interest, and it was a case of finding the cheapest way possible to get into space,"" he explained. ""That's rapidly changing. These are now businesses with critical missions that risk losing revenue if they have to wait on others or go into an unsuitable orbit. And that's why you're going to see people who will pay that little bit more to get to where they want to go when they absolutely need to go there,"" he told BBC News. This video can not be played Will Marshall: ""Our satellites 'phoned home' and they are healthy"" With the roll call of satellites going into orbit now accelerating rapidly, the issue of traffic management is becoming a hot topic. Full-on collisions are currently rare, but a surprisingly large number (10%) of satellites will even now experience sudden, unexpected momentum changes, most probably the result of being hit by some small fragment from a previous mission. The space sector needs to find smarter ways to track objects in orbit and to command timely avoidance manoeuvres, otherwise certain altitudes could ultimately become unusable because of the presence of dangerously dense debris fields. Jonathan McDowell from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics is a noted historian of astronautics. He commented: ""There are now over 3,000 working satellites in orbit. The number of satellites launched last year at over 1,200 is over twice as many as in any previous year. And the ones launched today - that used to be the number you'd launch in a whole year. So it's getting really crowded up there."" Will Marshall, the CEO of Planet, said his company, and indeed all of the companies on Sunday's flight, were accutley aware of the issue. ""We are seeing crowded areas in certain orbits,"" he told BBC News. ""Most of the crowded piece that is in danger of what they call Kessler Syndrome (runaway collisions) is quite high up. So one of the tricks that all of these satellites that were launched today use is to just stay really low where there's still a lot of atmospheric drag and eventually those satellites just come down.""

"UK firms told 'set up in EU to avoid trade issues'Firms say they have been advised by officials to set up EU hubs, but the government says it is not policy.Business","Simon Spurrell (C) from the Cheshire Cheese Company says he was advised to set up an EU hub UK firms that export to the EU say they are being encouraged by the government to set up subsidiaries in the bloc to avoid disruption under new trade rules. Firms have been hit by extra charges, taxes and paperwork, leading some to stop exporting to the EU altogether. But several say they have been told that setting up hubs in Europe would minimise the disruption, even if it means moving investment out of the UK. The Department for International Trade said it was ""not government policy"". ""The Cabinet Office have issued clear guidance, available atwww.gov.uk/transition,external, and we encourage all businesses to follow that guidance."" The Cheshire Cheese Company said it had been advised by an official to set up in the EU after  it was forced to stop its exports to the bloc due to trade rules that came in on 1 January. The firm, which sold Â£180,000 of cheese to the EU last year, found that every Â£25-30 gift box of cheese it sends to consumers on the Continent now needs a veterinary-approved health certificate costing Â£180. ""I spoke to someone at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for advice. They told me setting up a fulfilment centre in the EU where we could pack the boxes was my only solution,"" co-founder Simon Spurrell told the BBC. The firm, which had been optimistic about Brexit, is now looking at setting up a hub in France where it would ""test the water"". Retailers warn they could burn goods stuck in EU 'I was asked to pay an extra Â£82 for my Â£200 coat' Brexit: 'My meat exports are rotting in Rotterdam' But it has also scrapped plans to build a new Â£1m warehouse in Macclesfield employing 20-30 people. ""Instead we might end up employing French workers and paying tax to the EU,"" Mr Spurrell said. ""I left the EU as a UK citizen but now they are suggesting I rejoin my company to the EU, so what was Brexit for?"" The issue, he said, was that the under the post-Brexit trade deal, a vet must approve every consignment of fresh food that his company ships to the EU. It is a complex and costly process that has hit exporters of fresh meat and fish as well, and was partly why the governmentset up a Â£23m support fund for UK fishing companies. UK retailers who export to the EU have also complained about being hit with unsustainable costs when customers in the bloc return goods bought online.  This is due to new customs clearance charges incurred by shipping firms. Some retailers have even warned they could burn clothes stuck at borders as it is cheaper than bringing them home. Ulla Vitting Richards Ulla Vitting Richards, who runs her sustainable fashion brand Vildnis from the UK, told the BBC last week she had stopped exporting to the EU, which was her fastest growing market, because of the new processes. She also said that she had been advised - this time by a Department for International Trade (DIT) representative - that setting up a subsidiary distribution hub might help. ""He told me we'd be best off moving stock to a warehouse in Germany and get them to handle it,"" she said. As early as last October,trade consultants Blick Rothenberg warnedthat thousands of UK businesses might need to set up an EU presence in order to keep exporting to European markets. However, experts say EU firms exporting to the UK - which currently enjoy a grace period over the imposition of some rules - will soon face the same issues. Indeed, some EU exporters havealready stopped deliveries to the UK because of new VAT related charges. The DIT said it was not government policy to advise UK firms to set up EU hubs and that it was ""ensuring all officials are properly conveying"" the right information.

Hope for tourism after 'devastating' Covid impact,"Tourists returned to Llandudno in the summer, despite the pandemic There is hope for the tourism industry in Wales for the coming year, despite the ""devastating"" impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, business owners have said. Welsh Government data,externalshowed occupancy levels in all sectors of the tourism industry fell dramatically in 2020. However, in August and September, when restrictions were loosest, occupancy rates in most sectors were similar or better than in the previous two years. The Welsh Government said it had set aside Â£180m to support tourism. According to the data, about 66% of hotel rooms were occupied in 2018 and 2019, but this number fell to an average of 39% between March and September of 2020 as a result of lockdown restrictions. Businesses without shared facilities were allowed to reopen again on 11 July, leading to a resurgence in figures over the summer months. In August and September, the occupancy rates in hotels were 71% and 67% respectively, short of the previous two years' averages of 78% and 75%, but much closer to a typical season. And self-catered accommodation and bed and breakfasts recorded higher occupancy rates over those two months in 2020 than in the previous two years. UK staycation boom predicted for 2021 EasyJet sees summer holiday bookings surge 250% Lynette Esposito, who owns the Elm Tree Hotel in Llandudno, Conwy, said 2020 had been ""absolutely awful"" and the impact of the pandemic had been ""shocking"" and ""devastating"" for her business. She added that, not only did the hotel miss out on business due to closures, but it also incurred extra running costs in order to abide by the regulations. She said: ""I think that with the restrictions and guidelines that we need to follow, it definitely did have an impact on establishments where your service would automatically bring people together in one room. It did increase costs. ""We couldn't do our usual open buffet. Being a hotel you definitely had to take more precautions in making sure everyone was safe, bearing in mind there are a lot more common areas - we have a lift, a bar area and a lounge."" The Elm Tree Hotel was not able to open at full capacity, but Lynette Esposito said business was better than previous years in August and September But despite closing four of the 14 rooms in the Elm Tree Hotel to help with social distancing, Ms Esposito said business after reopening was better than normal. She said: ""We traded two full months which were very buoyant and very strong... [August and September] were actually better than the year before."" Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? She said this increase in demand during late summer last year boded well for the coming year, providing restrictions allowed holidays within the UK over the summer. ""I think when we're allowed to open we will see significant increase in demand. ""I think we will have a really good season. People are hungry for some action again and I think consumers will benefit from that."" The Welsh Government surveyed businesses from six different sectors of the tourism industry. Of those, self-catered accommodation and guesthouses both recorded higher occupancy rates in August and September than in both 2018 and 2019. The occupancy rates in static caravan homes had only reached just over half of the level of previous years in August, but with 92% occupancy in September, this sector also recorded occupancy rates higher than the same month in 2018 and 2019. Jeff Revill, whose campsite straddles England and Wales, hopes the weather will allow good business for his campsite Touring caravan and camping parks recorded slightly lower figures, while hostels saw significant decreases in occupancy rates. Camping is another sector which has been badly hit by the pandemic, particularly for sites which use shared facilities, such as Broadstone Park Camping and Fishery, which straddles the border between Monmouthshire and Gloucestershire. The site hosts campers in tents, caravans and also has glamping pods, but the majority of visitors use a shared toilet and shower block on the English side of the site, whichcaused a headache for owner Jeff Revillwhen the two countries had different lockdown rules. He said he is ""optimistic"" for the 2021 season despite a difficult year in 2020. ""It had a detrimental impact on us,"" he said. ""When we were open it was good, we were quite busy even when there were still some restrictions in place. I suppose for us it was our own imposed restrictions which stopped us doing even more business. ""We didn't fill the campsite to its full capacity. It was a good August but we could've done more."" Broadstone Park hosts caravans, campers and glampers, but most have to use shared facilities while staying on site UK holiday firms have said staycations areexpected to boom in 2021after lockdown ends. Mr Revill added: ""I've got faith and confidence that when we can open business will be good, but I suppose weather has an important role on our business as a whole. ""Things being normal, weather-wise, I would think we'll have quite a good future with people staying in this country and I think it will bring out some people who might not have done this sort of thing before."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are committed to doing all we can to protect businesses during this very challenging time. Our package of support is the most generous in the UK and more than Â£1.7bn of Welsh Government financial assistance has reached businesses across all sectors since March. ""Money is already reaching tourism, hospitality and leisure businesses from the Â£180m sector specific fund which opened on Wednesday 13 January.""

Taiwan reports large incursion by Chinese war jets,"A Chinese anti-submarine military plane flying in the Taiwan Strait last September Taiwan has reported a ""large incursion"" by Chinese warplanes for the second day running, a show of force that coincides with the first days of US President Joe Biden's term of office. Sunday's operation involved 15 aircraft and followed a similar drill that led to a warning from Washington. China sees democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province, but Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state. Analysts say China is testing the level of support of Mr Biden for Taiwan. In the US's first public remarks on Taiwan since Mr Biden came into power, the US State Department reaffirmed its ""rock-solid commitment"" to helping it defend itself. China has carried out regular flights over the international waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Taiwanese-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea in recent months. But they are usually conducted by one to three reconnaissance or anti-submarine warfare aircraft, according to Taiwan. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? The Taiwan-sized problem for the next US president What my grandfather's life taught me about China and America Taiwan's defence ministry said eight Chinese bomber planes capable of carrying nuclear weapons, four fighter jets and one anti-submarine aircraftentered its self-declared south-western air defence identification zone,externalon Saturday. Sunday's operation involved 12 fighters, two anti-submarine aircraft and a reconnaissance plane, the ministry said. On both occasions, Taiwan's air force warned away the aircraft and deployed air defence missile systems to monitor the planes. The drills come days after the inauguration of President Biden, who is expected to maintain pressure on China over a wide range of issues including human rights, trade disputes, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which has been a major thorn in the deteriorating relationship between the two powers. The Trump administration established closer ties with Taipei, ramping up arms sales and sending senior officials to the territory despite fierce warnings from China. Days before he left office,Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lifted long-standing restrictionson contacts between American and Taiwanese officials. On Monday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said US military activities in the region were not good for peace. ""The United States frequently sends aircraft and vessels into the South China Sea to flex its muscles,"" he told reporters. ""This is not conducive to peace and stability in the region."" He condemned a US aircraft carrier group sailing into the South China Sea on Saturday as ""a show of force"". The US says it is a ""freedom of navigation"" exercise. The substance of the new US administration's policies on China and Taiwan remains to be seen but, in response to Saturday's operation, state department spokesman Ned Price said the US would continue to deepen its ties with the island. This video can not be played President Tsai Ing-wen tells China to âface realityâ and show Taiwan respect ""The United States notes with concern the pattern of ongoing PRC attempts to intimidate its neighbours, including Taiwan,"",externalhe said in a statement, in reference to the People's Republic of China. ""We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected representatives."" Last week, the island's de-facto ambassador to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, was invited to attend Mr Biden's inauguration, in what was seen as another sign of the new administration's support for Taiwan. Lo Chih-cheng, a senior lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said China's moves were an attempt to deter the new US government from backing the island. ""It's sending a message to the Biden administration,"" he told the Reuters news agency. By Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei China refrained from flying into Taiwan's south-west air defence identification zone for years, even though it had the right to do so - such zones are not recognised in international law. So the Taiwanese government calls China's flyovers ""incursions"", but technically they are not. Analysts believe China wants to show dissatisfaction towards what it sees as former US President Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen changing the status quo over the past four years. Just because there's now a change in US president, doesn't mean Beijing will stop asserting what it has long seen as its right to fly in its own backyard. It also wants to warn President Tsai against taking further steps towards formal independence. Perhaps more importantly, Beijing wants to send a strong message early on in Joe Biden's presidency that the Taiwan issue is dangerous and remind him not to play with fire by emboldening Ms Tsai, as the Trump administration did. Instead it's hoping Mr Biden will mitigate the risk by scaling down support for Taiwan, or at least sending a message to Taipei not to be a troublemaker. Regardless of the reason, it may be hard to convince Beijing to return to the gentler old days. China and Taiwan have had separate governments since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has long tried to limit Taiwan's international activities and both have vied for influence in the Pacific region. Tensions have increased in recent years and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to take the island back. Although Taiwan is officially recognised by only a handful of nations, its democratically elected government has strong commercial and informal links with many countries. Like most nations, the US has no official diplomatic ties with Taipei, but a US law does require it to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

UK firms told 'set up in EU to avoid trade issues',"Simon Spurrell (C) from the Cheshire Cheese Company says he was advised to set up an EU hub UK firms that export to the EU say they are being encouraged by the government to set up subsidiaries in the bloc to avoid disruption under new trade rules. Firms have been hit by extra charges, taxes and paperwork, leading some to stop exporting to the EU altogether. But several say they have been told that setting up hubs in Europe would minimise the disruption, even if it means moving investment out of the UK. The Department for International Trade said it was ""not government policy"". ""The Cabinet Office have issued clear guidance, available atwww.gov.uk/transition,external, and we encourage all businesses to follow that guidance."" The Cheshire Cheese Company said it had been advised by an official to set up in the EU after  it was forced to stop its exports to the bloc due to trade rules that came in on 1 January. The firm, which sold Â£180,000 of cheese to the EU last year, found that every Â£25-30 gift box of cheese it sends to consumers on the Continent now needs a veterinary-approved health certificate costing Â£180. ""I spoke to someone at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for advice. They told me setting up a fulfilment centre in the EU where we could pack the boxes was my only solution,"" co-founder Simon Spurrell told the BBC. The firm, which had been optimistic about Brexit, is now looking at setting up a hub in France where it would ""test the water"". Retailers warn they could burn goods stuck in EU 'I was asked to pay an extra Â£82 for my Â£200 coat' Brexit: 'My meat exports are rotting in Rotterdam' But it has also scrapped plans to build a new Â£1m warehouse in Macclesfield employing 20-30 people. ""Instead we might end up employing French workers and paying tax to the EU,"" Mr Spurrell said. ""I left the EU as a UK citizen but now they are suggesting I rejoin my company to the EU, so what was Brexit for?"" The issue, he said, was that the under the post-Brexit trade deal, a vet must approve every consignment of fresh food that his company ships to the EU. It is a complex and costly process that has hit exporters of fresh meat and fish as well, and was partly why the governmentset up a Â£23m support fund for UK fishing companies. UK retailers who export to the EU have also complained about being hit with unsustainable costs when customers in the bloc return goods bought online.  This is due to new customs clearance charges incurred by shipping firms. Some retailers have even warned they could burn clothes stuck at borders as it is cheaper than bringing them home. Ulla Vitting Richards Ulla Vitting Richards, who runs her sustainable fashion brand Vildnis from the UK, told the BBC last week she had stopped exporting to the EU, which was her fastest growing market, because of the new processes. She also said that she had been advised - this time by a Department for International Trade (DIT) representative - that setting up a subsidiary distribution hub might help. ""He told me we'd be best off moving stock to a warehouse in Germany and get them to handle it,"" she said. As early as last October,trade consultants Blick Rothenberg warnedthat thousands of UK businesses might need to set up an EU presence in order to keep exporting to European markets. However, experts say EU firms exporting to the UK - which currently enjoy a grace period over the imposition of some rules - will soon face the same issues. Indeed, some EU exporters havealready stopped deliveries to the UK because of new VAT related charges. The DIT said it was not government policy to advise UK firms to set up EU hubs and that it was ""ensuring all officials are properly conveying"" the right information.

"Asos bids for Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge","Asos says it is in ""exclusive"" talks to buy Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands out of administration. But the online retailer said it only wanted the brands, not their shops, suggesting any deal would cost jobs. The current owner of the brands, Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, fell into administration last November putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Asos said it was ""a compelling opportunity"" to buy ""strong brands that resonate well with its customer base"". ""However, at this stage, there can be no certainty of a transaction and Asos will keep shareholders updated as appropriate,"" it added. Last week, a consortium including fashion chain Next dropped its bid to buy Topshop and Topman because it could not meet the price tag. Others interested in some or all of Arcadia - which also owns Dorothy Perkins and Burton - include Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, a consortium including JD Sports, and the online retailer Boohoo. Next pulls out of race to buy Topshop brands Asos adds 3m customers as profits soar in pandemic In addition, the Issa brothers, who recently bought supermarket chain Asda, and Chinese fast fashion giant Shein are said to have made bids for Topshop. Asos has seen strong sales in the pandemic and is already one of the biggest wholesalers for Topshop, Topman, Burton and Miss Selfridge. Administrators from Deloitte requested that final bids be submitted last Monday, with the auction expected to conclude at the end of January. Sir Philip Green is under pressure to use his own money to plug an estimated Â£350m hole in Arcadia's pension fund, which has about 10,000 members. Last year the retail tycoon had an estimated fortune of Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Arcadia employed about 13,000 people and had 444 shops at the time of its collapse.

"500 Covid cases at DVLA a 'scandal', union says","A Covid outbreak was declared at the DVLA's contact centre in December Staff are scared to work at the UK vehicle licensing agency's contact centre in Swansea where 500 workers have contracted coronavirus since the pandemic began, a union says. The PCS union has urged ministers to intervene and described the numbers as a ""scandal"". A DVLA spokesperson insisted safety was a priority and it followed guidance to ""help keep our offices Covid secure"". The Welsh Government said it had been ""worried about the DVLA for a while"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said he has repeatedly raised concerns over case numbers at the offices. Home working here to stay, say businesses Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Minister Eluned Morgan said the decision tointroduce tougher Covid regulations for workplacesin Wales was made, in part, due to the situation at the DVLA. In December, acoronavirus outbreak was declaredat the centre at Swansea Vale in Llansamlet after 352 cases of Covid-19 in the space of four months. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford: DVLA 'must follow Welsh Covid rules in Wales' The DVLA has about 6,000 staff based in Swansea but said it was currently operating on a ""far reduced capacity"". A DVLA worker, who did not want to be identified, told BBC Wales News that close contacts of people testing positive are not always sent home to self-isolate, social-distancing is not being followed and homeworking is not always possible because of ""archaic"" systems. ""There are certain elements within management who are trying to bend the rules and regulations,"" they said. ""It has been mentioned that you don't need your track and trace [contact tracing app] on. If someone's off with Covid, the people who haven't had their app on haven't been sent home. ""They'll say 'your app hasn't pinged, you're not going home'."" The worker said it was difficult for staff to adhere to the two-metre distancing rule because of the way the office was laid out and some staff had resigned. ""The atmosphere sucks, people are scared. I have heard of some people walking out,"" they said. One worker said two-metres distancing was not always being observed ""I think they have been raising concerns. They probably didn't get the answer they wanted. It's not necessarily the manager's fault, the managers are struggling too."" PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka said: ""It is a scandal that DVLA are not doing more to reduce numbers in the workplace when Covid infections are on the rise. ""Our members are telling us they are scared to enter the workplace for fear of catching Covid 19. ""Minsters must intervene and ensure DVLA are doing their utmost to enable staff to work from home and temporarily cease non-critical services."" DVLA to recruit 400 more staff to clear backlog Drivers furious after waiting months for licences Eluned Morgan told Radio Cymru the Welsh Government has been keeping an eye on the situation at the Swansea offices. Eluned Morgan said the Welsh Government has been concerned at the situation at the DVLA for ""some time"". The wellbeing minister said: ""We've been worried about the DVLA for a while, now. We've been putting pressure on them. ""It comes up time and again from the people who represent Swansea, and we're worried the pressure on people working there hasn't helped. ""The situation is one of the reasons why we've introduced new rules, new legislation, to tighten the restrictions on people at work."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething added: ""We're concerned about anecdotal reports we've heard from the trade union side, individuals, that all of the requirements weren't being followed."" He said there would be questions for management to answer if there had been a breach of the rules. The DVLA said some staff have been able to work from home ""in line with government advice"", though others were required to be in the office due to their roles ""In view of the essential nature of the public services we provide, some operational staff are required to be in the office where their role means they cannot work from home,"" said a spokesman. The DVLA said it has worked closely with Public Health Wales, Swansea council's environmental health staff and union officials to try to make its buildings Covid safe, including opening an additional site in Swansea. However, there were currently four Covid cases across its estate, with none at its contact centre. ""Before Christmas, when transmission infection rates were extremely high in the local community where most of our staff live, we saw a rise in staff testing positive for Covid,"" he said. Swansea MP Carolyn Harris said, during the first lockdown, she was in ""constant contact"" with the DVLA due to concerns raised by workers. ""Since Christmas, I've not been able to get hold of anyone from the DVLA,"" she told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement. ""Last night I spent a long time trying to hold of the chief executive. ""Some of the stuff that I am now reading, and some of the stuff I've had in over the last 24 hours, really worries me."" The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said its inspector had been tackling ""a series of concerns"" since August and had spoken to the PCS, which it said was ""broadly supportive of DVLA's approach"". A spokesperson added: ""Most recently HSE joined Swansea Environmental Health Officers and Public Health Wales for some joint visits to premises, in our role to assist public health to assess the potential of work place transmission as part of their wider work to contain outbreaks.""

Here are some of the main headlines from today:   Today's live page was brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Sophie Williams, Paul Gribben and Lauren Turner. We'll be back with more on Monday morning. Six coronavirus testing centres have been forced to close due to heavy snow in the West Midlands. The weather is also causing travel disruption, with treacherous conditions reported on some of the region's roads. A severe weather warning for snow remains in place until midnight, with another warning for ice issued by the Met Office until Monday morning. Workers for an aid charity have been despatched to support emergency workers and those affected by recent flooding. Read morehere. The Midlands has become the first region in England to administer more than one million first doses of coronavirus vaccine, new figures from NHS England show. The data also shows London still lags behind all other regions in terms of the total number of jabs given. It has delivered around 641,000 jabs since 8 December. Over the last seven days, London also delivered the lowest number of first doses, with 219,350 given between 17 January and 23 January. In the same time period, there were 219,350 in the Midlands. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said he fully expects the capital's numbers to rise. One possible reason for the discrepancy could be that London has a lower average age than the rest of the UK, according to data from Trust for London, and older people are being vaccinated first. Alan JohnstonBBC Middle East analyst Egypt - the Arab world's most populous nation - has begun
the process of vaccinating its more than 100 million citizens against
the coronavirus. The country has recorded nearly 9,000 deaths from the
disease. The first recipients of a vaccine were a doctor and a nurse.
They were given a Chinese-made injection. Vaccines from Britain and Russia will be included in the
inoculation programme as it unfolds. Egyptâs health minister said the country was aiming to
produce an injection locally, with a view to distributing it to the rest of
Africa. There have been warnings that the continent is in danger of being left
behind, as richer parts of the world strike vaccine-supply deals and drive up
prices. Read more: There have now been a total of 6,353,321 people who've received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK, the latest government figures show. In addition, 469,660 have had their second dose. The government is planning to offer a vaccine to everyone in the four most vulnerable categories by 15 February. Another 30,004 positive coronavirus tests have been recorded in the UK, according to government figures just released. It brings the total number of cases so far to 3,647,463. It's the lowest daily number of cases since 19 December. There were an additional 610 deaths recorded today of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths now stands at 97,939. Figures tend to be lower on Sunday and Mondays because of lags in reporting at the weekend.  Portugal has been heading to the polls to vote for the country's president. The election comes as the country continues to see a surge in cases. Portugal has recorded 624,469 cases and 10,194 deaths since the pandemic began. Hospitalisations are at an all-time high according to Reuters news agency. Images from the polls show people wearing PPE, sanitizing their hands and socially distancing while queuing.

The envelopes being sent out in Fife, Forth Valley, Ayrshire and Arran, Lanarkshire, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Lothian are part of a new booking system being used in six health board areas. According to theScottish government's vaccine deployment plan,,externalthe 470,000 people aged in the 70 and 79 age bracket should receive their first dose by mid-February. But many over-80s have yet to receive their first jab and the government has faced criticism from opposition parties concerned that Scotland is ""lagging behind"" England on the vaccine roll-out. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told theBBC's Andrew Marr Showthat figure had now reached about 40% and the rollout was ""gathering pace every day"". Ms Sturgeon said the rollout to the over-80s has been slower because the Scottish government has ""very deliberately"" focused on vaccinating care home residents first, which is ""more time-consuming and labour intensive"".

and AstraZeneca over a delay in the distribution of vaccines. Both companies have warned they will not be able to deliver
vaccines to the EU as agreed due to production issues. On Saturday a senior Italian health official warned that the
countrywill have to
rethink its vaccination programme if supply issues continue. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the aim of the legal
action would be to secure the doses rather than to seek damages. ""We are working so our vaccine plan programme does not change.
We are activating all channels so the EU Commission does all it can to make
these gentlemen respect their contracts,â he told RAI state television. The head of Italy's Higher Health Council Franco Locatelli
said Pfizer deliveries were 29% lower than planned this week but the levels
were expected to return to those agreed by 1 February.

A tearful Sam Folkard recalled how a nurse looked ""heartbroken"" as she turned off the machine keeping father-of-seven Edward Folkard alive. ""The nurse that had to turn his machine off in the end was probably about the same age as me, if not younger,"" said Sam. Katie Folkard said she was ""eternally grateful"" to the nursing staff for letting her family say goodbye. ""That would have been our worst fear - that he went on his own."" The sisters plan to raise money for the staff as a thank you for their help. President Joe Bidenâs chief of staff claims there was no
distribution plan for the vaccine from the Trump administration. âThe process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside
of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not
really exist when we came into the White House,â Ron Klain told NBC News. Last week sources told CNN that the Biden team were having
toâbuild everything from scratchâ when it came to distribution plans.,external However top US medical expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, hit back at criticism in a White House Briefing. ""I mean we're coming in with fresh ideas, but also some ideas with the previous administration. You can't say it was absolutely not usable at all,"" he said. President Biden has criticised the rollout of the vaccine in the
country. He has promised 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days. Watch how President Biden plans to tackle the pandemic

year olds in order for them to take school exams, the government says. The country has one of the highest vaccination rates in the
world against coronavirus. According to its health ministry, it has administered
at least one dose to more than 25% of its population since 19 December. Vaccines are currently available to those over 40. A spokeswoman for the countryâs education ministry said the
addition of the 16-18 year-olds allows their return to school and the âorderly
holding of examsâ. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is campaigning for

Dubai is slowing down the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine due
to a delay in deliveries. Pfizer announced last week that shipments of its vaccine
will reduce while it increases production capacity at its Belgian plant. The Emirate said it would scale back its vaccinations but
all those scheduled to take their second dose should still turn up for their
appointment. The UAE has one of the highest rates of Covid vaccinations
in the world, with more than two million of its 10m population vaccinated so
far. A total of 274,376 cases have been confirmed so far and 783
deaths. Dubai has recently been in the spotlight after a number ofBritish influencers were
pictured holidaying while the UK was under tough restrictions. Earlier this
month it was dropped from the UKâs quarantine-free list amid a spike in cases. Two women who were rescued from Ben Lomond in Scotland have been charged with breaching coronavirus regulations.

""There are so many people that are going to die, and it's not fair."" ""Even before Covid, more than four in 10 people with a learning disability died of a lung condition like pneumonia,"" says Professor Tuffney-Wijne, of Kingston University. ""As a group of people, they really are at risk."" Legal action is being taken against the Department of Health and Social Care, which says it is working hard to vaccinate all those at risk. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said it had made ""a clinical decision to prioritise those with profound and severe learning disabilities within our first six categories"". New border controls in France have come into effect. Anyone from the EU entering France by air or sea
must provide a negative PCR test that has been obtained in the previous 72
hours. However those entering the country by land will not need a
negative test. People arriving in France from outside the EU already
have to provide a negative PCR test result and quarantine for seven days before
taking another test. According to Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari,
about 62,000 people from EU countries enter France by air or sea every week. France has recorded more than three million cases and 72,788
deaths. Prime Minister Jean Castex confirmed about one million
people had already received one dose of the vaccination by Saturday. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Taiwan reports large incursion by Chinese war jetsChina's moves coincide with the start of the Biden administration, which has shown support for Taiwan.Asia","A Chinese anti-submarine military plane flying in the Taiwan Strait last September Taiwan has reported a ""large incursion"" by Chinese warplanes for the second day running, a show of force that coincides with the first days of US President Joe Biden's term of office. Sunday's operation involved 15 aircraft and followed a similar drill that led to a warning from Washington. China sees democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province, but Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state. Analysts say China is testing the level of support of Mr Biden for Taiwan. In the US's first public remarks on Taiwan since Mr Biden came into power, the US State Department reaffirmed its ""rock-solid commitment"" to helping it defend itself. China has carried out regular flights over the international waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Taiwanese-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea in recent months. But they are usually conducted by one to three reconnaissance or anti-submarine warfare aircraft, according to Taiwan. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? The Taiwan-sized problem for the next US president What my grandfather's life taught me about China and America Taiwan's defence ministry said eight Chinese bomber planes capable of carrying nuclear weapons, four fighter jets and one anti-submarine aircraftentered its self-declared south-western air defence identification zone,externalon Saturday. Sunday's operation involved 12 fighters, two anti-submarine aircraft and a reconnaissance plane, the ministry said. On both occasions, Taiwan's air force warned away the aircraft and deployed air defence missile systems to monitor the planes. The drills come days after the inauguration of President Biden, who is expected to maintain pressure on China over a wide range of issues including human rights, trade disputes, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which has been a major thorn in the deteriorating relationship between the two powers. The Trump administration established closer ties with Taipei, ramping up arms sales and sending senior officials to the territory despite fierce warnings from China. Days before he left office,Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lifted long-standing restrictionson contacts between American and Taiwanese officials. On Monday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said US military activities in the region were not good for peace. ""The United States frequently sends aircraft and vessels into the South China Sea to flex its muscles,"" he told reporters. ""This is not conducive to peace and stability in the region."" He condemned a US aircraft carrier group sailing into the South China Sea on Saturday as ""a show of force"". The US says it is a ""freedom of navigation"" exercise. The substance of the new US administration's policies on China and Taiwan remains to be seen but, in response to Saturday's operation, state department spokesman Ned Price said the US would continue to deepen its ties with the island. This video can not be played President Tsai Ing-wen tells China to âface realityâ and show Taiwan respect ""The United States notes with concern the pattern of ongoing PRC attempts to intimidate its neighbours, including Taiwan,"",externalhe said in a statement, in reference to the People's Republic of China. ""We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected representatives."" Last week, the island's de-facto ambassador to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, was invited to attend Mr Biden's inauguration, in what was seen as another sign of the new administration's support for Taiwan. Lo Chih-cheng, a senior lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said China's moves were an attempt to deter the new US government from backing the island. ""It's sending a message to the Biden administration,"" he told the Reuters news agency. By Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei China refrained from flying into Taiwan's south-west air defence identification zone for years, even though it had the right to do so - such zones are not recognised in international law. So the Taiwanese government calls China's flyovers ""incursions"", but technically they are not. Analysts believe China wants to show dissatisfaction towards what it sees as former US President Donald Trump and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen changing the status quo over the past four years. Just because there's now a change in US president, doesn't mean Beijing will stop asserting what it has long seen as its right to fly in its own backyard. It also wants to warn President Tsai against taking further steps towards formal independence. Perhaps more importantly, Beijing wants to send a strong message early on in Joe Biden's presidency that the Taiwan issue is dangerous and remind him not to play with fire by emboldening Ms Tsai, as the Trump administration did. Instead it's hoping Mr Biden will mitigate the risk by scaling down support for Taiwan, or at least sending a message to Taipei not to be a troublemaker. Regardless of the reason, it may be hard to convince Beijing to return to the gentler old days. China and Taiwan have had separate governments since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has long tried to limit Taiwan's international activities and both have vied for influence in the Pacific region. Tensions have increased in recent years and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to take the island back. Although Taiwan is officially recognised by only a handful of nations, its democratically elected government has strong commercial and informal links with many countries. Like most nations, the US has no official diplomatic ties with Taipei, but a US law does require it to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

Here are some of the main headlines from today:   Today's live page was brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Sophie Williams, Paul Gribben and Lauren Turner. We'll be back with more on Monday morning. Six coronavirus testing centres have been forced to close due to heavy snow in the West Midlands. The weather is also causing travel disruption, with treacherous conditions reported on some of the region's roads. A severe weather warning for snow remains in place until midnight, with another warning for ice issued by the Met Office until Monday morning. Workers for an aid charity have been despatched to support emergency workers and those affected by recent flooding. Read morehere. The Midlands has become the first region in England to administer more than one million first doses of coronavirus vaccine, new figures from NHS England show. The data also shows London still lags behind all other regions in terms of the total number of jabs given. It has delivered around 641,000 jabs since 8 December. Over the last seven days, London also delivered the lowest number of first doses, with 219,350 given between 17 January and 23 January. In the same time period, there were 219,350 in the Midlands. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said he fully expects the capital's numbers to rise. One possible reason for the discrepancy could be that London has a lower average age than the rest of the UK, according to data from Trust for London, and older people are being vaccinated first. Alan JohnstonBBC Middle East analyst Egypt - the Arab world's most populous nation - has begun
the process of vaccinating its more than 100 million citizens against
the coronavirus. The country has recorded nearly 9,000 deaths from the
disease. The first recipients of a vaccine were a doctor and a nurse.
They were given a Chinese-made injection. Vaccines from Britain and Russia will be included in the
inoculation programme as it unfolds. Egyptâs health minister said the country was aiming to
produce an injection locally, with a view to distributing it to the rest of
Africa. There have been warnings that the continent is in danger of being left
behind, as richer parts of the world strike vaccine-supply deals and drive up
prices. Read more: There have now been a total of 6,353,321 people who've received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK, the latest government figures show. In addition, 469,660 have had their second dose. The government is planning to offer a vaccine to everyone in the four most vulnerable categories by 15 February. Another 30,004 positive coronavirus tests have been recorded in the UK, according to government figures just released. It brings the total number of cases so far to 3,647,463. It's the lowest daily number of cases since 19 December. There were an additional 610 deaths recorded today of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths now stands at 97,939. Figures tend to be lower on Sunday and Mondays because of lags in reporting at the weekend.  Portugal has been heading to the polls to vote for the country's president. The election comes as the country continues to see a surge in cases. Portugal has recorded 624,469 cases and 10,194 deaths since the pandemic began. Hospitalisations are at an all-time high according to Reuters news agency. Images from the polls show people wearing PPE, sanitizing their hands and socially distancing while queuing.

The envelopes being sent out in Fife, Forth Valley, Ayrshire and Arran, Lanarkshire, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Lothian are part of a new booking system being used in six health board areas. According to theScottish government's vaccine deployment plan,,externalthe 470,000 people aged in the 70 and 79 age bracket should receive their first dose by mid-February. But many over-80s have yet to receive their first jab and the government has faced criticism from opposition parties concerned that Scotland is ""lagging behind"" England on the vaccine roll-out. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told theBBC's Andrew Marr Showthat figure had now reached about 40% and the rollout was ""gathering pace every day"". Ms Sturgeon said the rollout to the over-80s has been slower because the Scottish government has ""very deliberately"" focused on vaccinating care home residents first, which is ""more time-consuming and labour intensive"".

and AstraZeneca over a delay in the distribution of vaccines. Both companies have warned they will not be able to deliver
vaccines to the EU as agreed due to production issues. On Saturday a senior Italian health official warned that the
countrywill have to
rethink its vaccination programme if supply issues continue. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the aim of the legal
action would be to secure the doses rather than to seek damages. ""We are working so our vaccine plan programme does not change.
We are activating all channels so the EU Commission does all it can to make
these gentlemen respect their contracts,â he told RAI state television. The head of Italy's Higher Health Council Franco Locatelli
said Pfizer deliveries were 29% lower than planned this week but the levels
were expected to return to those agreed by 1 February.

A tearful Sam Folkard recalled how a nurse looked ""heartbroken"" as she turned off the machine keeping father-of-seven Edward Folkard alive. ""The nurse that had to turn his machine off in the end was probably about the same age as me, if not younger,"" said Sam. Katie Folkard said she was ""eternally grateful"" to the nursing staff for letting her family say goodbye. ""That would have been our worst fear - that he went on his own."" The sisters plan to raise money for the staff as a thank you for their help. President Joe Bidenâs chief of staff claims there was no
distribution plan for the vaccine from the Trump administration. âThe process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside
of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not
really exist when we came into the White House,â Ron Klain told NBC News. Last week sources told CNN that the Biden team were having
toâbuild everything from scratchâ when it came to distribution plans.,external However top US medical expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, hit back at criticism in a White House Briefing. ""I mean we're coming in with fresh ideas, but also some ideas with the previous administration. You can't say it was absolutely not usable at all,"" he said. President Biden has criticised the rollout of the vaccine in the
country. He has promised 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days. Watch how President Biden plans to tackle the pandemic

year olds in order for them to take school exams, the government says. The country has one of the highest vaccination rates in the
world against coronavirus. According to its health ministry, it has administered
at least one dose to more than 25% of its population since 19 December. Vaccines are currently available to those over 40. A spokeswoman for the countryâs education ministry said the

Dubai is slowing down the rollout of the Pfizer vaccine due
to a delay in deliveries. Pfizer announced last week that shipments of its vaccine
will reduce while it increases production capacity at its Belgian plant. The Emirate said it would scale back its vaccinations but
all those scheduled to take their second dose should still turn up for their
appointment. The UAE has one of the highest rates of Covid vaccinations
in the world, with more than two million of its 10m population vaccinated so
far. A total of 274,376 cases have been confirmed so far and 783
deaths. Dubai has recently been in the spotlight after a number ofBritish influencers were
pictured holidaying while the UK was under tough restrictions. Earlier this
month it was dropped from the UKâs quarantine-free list amid a spike in cases. Two women who were rescued from Ben Lomond in Scotland have been charged with breaching coronavirus regulations.

""There are so many people that are going to die, and it's not fair."" ""Even before Covid, more than four in 10 people with a learning disability died of a lung condition like pneumonia,"" says Professor Tuffney-Wijne, of Kingston University. ""As a group of people, they really are at risk."" Legal action is being taken against the Department of Health and Social Care, which says it is working hard to vaccinate all those at risk. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said it had made ""a clinical decision to prioritise those with profound and severe learning disabilities within our first six categories"". New border controls in France have come into effect. Anyone from the EU entering France by air or sea
must provide a negative PCR test that has been obtained in the previous 72
hours. However those entering the country by land will not need a
negative test. People arriving in France from outside the EU already
have to provide a negative PCR test result and quarantine for seven days before
taking another test. According to Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari,
about 62,000 people from EU countries enter France by air or sea every week. France has recorded more than three million cases and 72,788
deaths. Prime Minister Jean Castex confirmed about one million
people had already received one dose of the vaccination by Saturday. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
NZ reports first community Covid case in months,"New Zealand has been praised for its handling of the pandemic New Zealand has reported its first case of Covid-19 outside of a quarantine facility in more than two months. Health officials said a 56-year-old woman who had recently returned from Europe tested positive days after completing a compulsory two-week period of managed isolation. Contact tracing efforts are under way, and authorities have published a list of locations the woman visited. New Zealand has been widely praised for its response to the pandemic. The country, with a population of five million, has recorded 1,927 confirmed cases and 25 deaths over the course of the pandemic. How New Zealand went 'hard and early' to beat Covid-19 How New Zealand's film industry thwarted a pandemic The Ministry of Health said the woman had tested negative twice before leaving an isolation facility in Auckland on 13 January. She started developing mild symptoms two days later, which then got progressively worse. She received a positive test result on Saturday and has been isolating at home. In a press conference on Sunday, Health Minister Chris Hipkins said it was too soon to speculate on the ""origin or the strain of the infection"". But the ministry said it was ""working on the assumption any case might be a more transmissible variant and [was] taking appropriate precautions"". Mr Hipkins said it was ""too early"" to comment on any further response. The woman visited a number of places in New Zealand's Northland region after leaving isolation. The Health Ministry published a list of the locations, including supermarkets, restaurants and a gallery. They said anyone who was at these places at the same time was considered a ""casual contact"", and asked them to stay at home and get tested ""out of an abundance of caution"".

Smart motorways 'dangerous' - police chief,"The Department for Transport said ""smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones"" A police and crime commissioner (PCC) has written to the government to say smart motorways are ""inherently unsafe and dangerous and should be abandoned"". South Yorkshire PCC Dr Alan Billings wrote his open letter to Grant Shapps, the Secretary of State for Transport. His comments come after a coronerfound two men had been unlawfully killed on a ""smart"" section of the M1. The Department for Transport said ""smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones"". On 19 January coroner David Urpeth called for a review of the road schemes. Mr Urpeth said smart motorways without a hard shoulder carry ""an ongoing risk of future deaths"". He was speaking following the inquests for Jason Mercer, 44, from Rotherham and Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, of Mansfield, who died when a lorry crashed into their vehicles near Sheffield on 7 June 2019. Coroner calls for smart motorway review over deaths âWrong personâ jailed over M1 deaths, claims widow More stories across Yorkshire Now Labour's Dr Billings has told Grant Shapps: ""I believe smart motorways of this kind - where what would be a hard shoulder is a live lane with occasional refuges - are inherently unsafe and dangerous and should be abandoned. ""The relevant test for us is whether someone who breaks down on this stretch of the motorway, where there is no hard shoulder, would have had a better chance of escaping death or injury had there still been a hard shoulder - and the coroner's verdict makes it clear that the answer to that question is - Yes."" Alexandru Murgeanu (l) and Jason Mercer were killed in the crash on the M1 in South Yorkshire Jason Mercer's widow, Claire, had previously told Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio 5Live she considered a government review of the smart motorway system ""was just a paperwork exercise and a PR exercise."" Talking to BBC Look North Yorkshire after publishing the letter on Sunday, Dr Billings said: ""The Department for Transport and Highways England have argued all along that these sorts of motorways are actually safe, they even go as far as to say they are safer than ordinary motorways, now I think that whatever formula they are using to come to that conclusion is wrong. ""The coroner in his verdict has made it pretty clear that these two particular lives in South Yorkshire would not have come to such a sad end if there had been a hard shoulder there, so I think this is new evidence they have to take into account."" He added: ""If they thought this type of motorway was even smarter, or safer, than a conventional motorway, then why not convert the entire system to smart motorways, making it safer? As soon as you say it, I think you realise it's absurd. ""I think they (smart motorways) were done originally not because it was a safer way of doing a motorway, I think it was done in order to expand the capacity, get the traffic flowing by having an extra lane, but to do it cheaply, and I think we're trading cost - cheapness - for other people's lives."" In response to Dr Billings' open letter, the Department for Transport said: ""The stocktake [of smart motorways] showed that in most ways smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones. ""The Transport Secretary has tasked Highways England with delivering an 18-point action plan to ensure they are safer still, and he has called an urgent meeting with the company to discuss their progress.""

"500 Covid cases at DVLA a 'scandal', union saysMinisters are urged to intervene amid rising Covid infection numbers at the Swansea office.Wales","A Covid outbreak was declared at the DVLA's contact centre in December Staff are scared to work at the UK vehicle licensing agency's contact centre in Swansea where 500 workers have contracted coronavirus since the pandemic began, a union says. The PCS union has urged ministers to intervene and described the numbers as a ""scandal"". A DVLA spokesperson insisted safety was a priority and it followed guidance to ""help keep our offices Covid secure"". The Welsh Government said it had been ""worried about the DVLA for a while"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said he has repeatedly raised concerns over case numbers at the offices. Home working here to stay, say businesses Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Minister Eluned Morgan said the decision tointroduce tougher Covid regulations for workplacesin Wales was made, in part, due to the situation at the DVLA. In December, acoronavirus outbreak was declaredat the centre at Swansea Vale in Llansamlet after 352 cases of Covid-19 in the space of four months. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford: DVLA 'must follow Welsh Covid rules in Wales' The DVLA has about 6,000 staff based in Swansea but said it was currently operating on a ""far reduced capacity"". A DVLA worker, who did not want to be identified, told BBC Wales News that close contacts of people testing positive are not always sent home to self-isolate, social-distancing is not being followed and homeworking is not always possible because of ""archaic"" systems. ""There are certain elements within management who are trying to bend the rules and regulations,"" they said. ""It has been mentioned that you don't need your track and trace [contact tracing app] on. If someone's off with Covid, the people who haven't had their app on haven't been sent home. ""They'll say 'your app hasn't pinged, you're not going home'."" The worker said it was difficult for staff to adhere to the two-metre distancing rule because of the way the office was laid out and some staff had resigned. ""The atmosphere sucks, people are scared. I have heard of some people walking out,"" they said. One worker said two-metres distancing was not always being observed ""I think they have been raising concerns. They probably didn't get the answer they wanted. It's not necessarily the manager's fault, the managers are struggling too."" PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka said: ""It is a scandal that DVLA are not doing more to reduce numbers in the workplace when Covid infections are on the rise. ""Our members are telling us they are scared to enter the workplace for fear of catching Covid 19. ""Minsters must intervene and ensure DVLA are doing their utmost to enable staff to work from home and temporarily cease non-critical services."" DVLA to recruit 400 more staff to clear backlog Drivers furious after waiting months for licences Eluned Morgan told Radio Cymru the Welsh Government has been keeping an eye on the situation at the Swansea offices. Eluned Morgan said the Welsh Government has been concerned at the situation at the DVLA for ""some time"". The wellbeing minister said: ""We've been worried about the DVLA for a while, now. We've been putting pressure on them. ""It comes up time and again from the people who represent Swansea, and we're worried the pressure on people working there hasn't helped. ""The situation is one of the reasons why we've introduced new rules, new legislation, to tighten the restrictions on people at work."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething added: ""We're concerned about anecdotal reports we've heard from the trade union side, individuals, that all of the requirements weren't being followed."" He said there would be questions for management to answer if there had been a breach of the rules. The DVLA said some staff have been able to work from home ""in line with government advice"", though others were required to be in the office due to their roles ""In view of the essential nature of the public services we provide, some operational staff are required to be in the office where their role means they cannot work from home,"" said a spokesman. The DVLA said it has worked closely with Public Health Wales, Swansea council's environmental health staff and union officials to try to make its buildings Covid safe, including opening an additional site in Swansea. However, there were currently four Covid cases across its estate, with none at its contact centre. ""Before Christmas, when transmission infection rates were extremely high in the local community where most of our staff live, we saw a rise in staff testing positive for Covid,"" he said. Swansea MP Carolyn Harris said, during the first lockdown, she was in ""constant contact"" with the DVLA due to concerns raised by workers. ""Since Christmas, I've not been able to get hold of anyone from the DVLA,"" she told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement. ""Last night I spent a long time trying to hold of the chief executive. ""Some of the stuff that I am now reading, and some of the stuff I've had in over the last 24 hours, really worries me."" The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said its inspector had been tackling ""a series of concerns"" since August and had spoken to the PCS, which it said was ""broadly supportive of DVLA's approach"". A spokesperson added: ""Most recently HSE joined Swansea Environmental Health Officers and Public Health Wales for some joint visits to premises, in our role to assist public health to assess the potential of work place transmission as part of their wider work to contain outbreaks.""

Smart motorways 'dangerous' - police chiefThe claim comes after a coroner ruled two deaths on the M1 motorway were avoidable.,"The Department for Transport said ""smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones"" A police and crime commissioner (PCC) has written to the government to say smart motorways are ""inherently unsafe and dangerous and should be abandoned"". South Yorkshire PCC Dr Alan Billings wrote his open letter to Grant Shapps, the Secretary of State for Transport. His comments come after a coronerfound two men had been unlawfully killed on a ""smart"" section of the M1. The Department for Transport said ""smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones"". On 19 January coroner David Urpeth called for a review of the road schemes. Mr Urpeth said smart motorways without a hard shoulder carry ""an ongoing risk of future deaths"". He was speaking following the inquests for Jason Mercer, 44, from Rotherham and Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, of Mansfield, who died when a lorry crashed into their vehicles near Sheffield on 7 June 2019. Coroner calls for smart motorway review over deaths âWrong personâ jailed over M1 deaths, claims widow More stories across Yorkshire Now Labour's Dr Billings has told Grant Shapps: ""I believe smart motorways of this kind - where what would be a hard shoulder is a live lane with occasional refuges - are inherently unsafe and dangerous and should be abandoned. ""The relevant test for us is whether someone who breaks down on this stretch of the motorway, where there is no hard shoulder, would have had a better chance of escaping death or injury had there still been a hard shoulder - and the coroner's verdict makes it clear that the answer to that question is - Yes."" Alexandru Murgeanu (l) and Jason Mercer were killed in the crash on the M1 in South Yorkshire Jason Mercer's widow, Claire, had previously told Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio 5Live she considered a government review of the smart motorway system ""was just a paperwork exercise and a PR exercise."" Talking to BBC Look North Yorkshire after publishing the letter on Sunday, Dr Billings said: ""The Department for Transport and Highways England have argued all along that these sorts of motorways are actually safe, they even go as far as to say they are safer than ordinary motorways, now I think that whatever formula they are using to come to that conclusion is wrong. ""The coroner in his verdict has made it pretty clear that these two particular lives in South Yorkshire would not have come to such a sad end if there had been a hard shoulder there, so I think this is new evidence they have to take into account."" He added: ""If they thought this type of motorway was even smarter, or safer, than a conventional motorway, then why not convert the entire system to smart motorways, making it safer? As soon as you say it, I think you realise it's absurd. ""I think they (smart motorways) were done originally not because it was a safer way of doing a motorway, I think it was done in order to expand the capacity, get the traffic flowing by having an extra lane, but to do it cheaply, and I think we're trading cost - cheapness - for other people's lives."" In response to Dr Billings' open letter, the Department for Transport said: ""The stocktake [of smart motorways] showed that in most ways smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones. ""The Transport Secretary has tasked Highways England with delivering an 18-point action plan to ensure they are safer still, and he has called an urgent meeting with the company to discuss their progress.""

Asia's 'El Chapo' arrested in Amsterdam,"Tse Chi Lop was arrested at Amsterdam airport on Friday Police in the Netherlands have arrested the alleged head of one of the world's biggest drugs gangs, on a warrant issued by Australia. Tse Chi Lop - a Chinese-born Canadian national - is said to be the head of The Company, which dominates a $70bn illegal drugs market across Asia. Listed as one of the world's most wanted fugitives, Mr Tse was detained at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. Australia will now seek his extradition to face trial there. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) believe The Company, also known as the Sam Gor Syndicate, is responsible for up to 70% of all illegal drugs entering the country. The 56-year-old has been compared to the Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman because of the scale of his alleged enterprise. How Mexico's drug kingpin fell victim to his own legend Australian police had reportedly been tracking Mr Tse for more than a decade before he was arrested on Friday as he was about to board a flight to Canada. A police statement, which did not name Mr Tse, saidthe arrest warrant was issued in 2019,external, with police in the Netherlands acting on an Interpol notice. ""He was already on the most-wanted list and he was detained based on intelligence we received,"" a Dutch police spokesman of the arrest Friday. Reuters published a special investigation into Mr Tse in 2019,external- describing him as ""Asia's most wanted man"". The news agency cited UN estimates as saying the syndicate's revenue from methamphetamine sales alone could have been as high as $17bn in 2018. The effort to arrest Mr Tse, Operation Kungur, involved about 20 agencies from continents across the globe with AFP taking the lead, according to Reuters. Allow Twitter content?

The man who invited the world over for dinner,"Jim Haynes was both an icon and a relic of the Swinging Sixties, an American in Paris who was famous for inviting hundreds of thousands of strangers to dinner at his home. He died this month. Last February, I took my last trip abroad before lockdown closed in on us. I bought a last-minute ticket and jumped on the Eurostar to Paris, motivated by a sudden urge to have dinner with a friend. Jim Haynes had entered his late 80s and his health was declining, yet I knew he would welcome a visit. Jim always welcomed visitors. The essence of that trip now feels like the antithesis of Covid times. I was far from the only guest wandering into the warm glow of his atelier in the 14th arrondissement on a wet winter's night. Inside, people were squeezing, shoulder to shoulder, through the narrow kitchen. Strangers struck up conversations, bunched together in groups, balancing their dinners on paper plates and reaching over each other to press the plastic spout on a communal box of wine. Jim had operated open-house policy at his home every Sunday evening for more than 40 years. Absolutely anyone was welcome to come for an informal dinner, all you had to do was phone or email and he would add your name to the list. No questions asked. Just put a donation in an envelope when you arrive. There would be a buzz in the air, as people of various nationalities - locals, immigrants, travellers - milled around the small, open-plan space. A pot of hearty food bubbled on the hob and servings would be dished out on to a trestle table, so you could help yourself and continue to mingle. It was for good reason that Jim was nicknamed the ""godfather of social networking"". He led the way in connecting strangers, long before we outsourced it all to Silicon Valley. A ballet dancer staying with Jim in the late 1970s suggested cooking for him and friends to repay the hospitality; the dinners became weekly for 40-plus years I only knew Jim in his later years, but his entire life was extraordinary. Born in Louisiana in 1933, he had lived in Venezuela as a teenager; founded the alternative culture centre Arts Lab in London, where he mixed with David Bowie, John Lennon and Yoko Ono; ran a sexual liberation magazine in Amsterdam, and all before becoming a university lecturer in sexual politics in Paris, his home since 1969. And yet he was often seen as a son of Scotland, following an influential stint there in the late '50s and late '60s, when he established Edinburgh's first paperback bookshop, co-founded the Traverse Theatre and helped kickstart the Fringe festival. When Jim died, at 87, earlier this month, a Herald obituary called him ""the unofficial agent for the beat generation in Scotland"". While a lot of highly regarded people tend to retreat into their own circles after finding success, Jim never stopped reaching out to new people. The first time I heard from him was an email out of the blue in 2008. I had written a newspaper article from Barcelona - not the one in Spain but the one on the coast of Venezuela - and it had brought back memories for him. His father worked in the oil business and had moved the family there when Jim was in his early teens. My article was about meeting people through the Couchsurfing website,external, where locals opened their homes to strangers for free around the world. This was before AirBnB worked out how to monetise the idea, and the concept of non-commercial cultural exchange was right up Jim's street. ""When you are back in Europe, come to dinner,"" he wrote, promising to tell me about an old travel project of his own that he thought I might like. Intrigued, I headed to Paris soon after my return. I had imagined some sort of intimate dinner party with cultural elites, but what I found was more like a student house party - albeit with more mature attendees and only moderate alcohol consumption. (Jim was teetotal and proceedings ended strictly by 23:00.) Jim never cooked himself, instead he invited guest cooks Jim instantly greeted me like an old friend and, as we chatted, he reached up on to his living room shelves to offer me a book. People to People read the cover line. It was the project he had wanted to tell me about. He explained that, in the late 1980s, he had founded a guidebook series for countries behind the Iron Curtain. Instead of the standard descriptions of sights and hotel listings, the format was like an address book, including the contact details for hundreds of in-country hosts. The idea was that if people could not easily see the Western world themselves, he would bring it to them via travellers. It was ""couchsurfing"", but offline. The hand-sized copy he pressed into my palm centred on Poland. I loved it and decided to travel there to see if the participants were still up for receiving random visitors, even though so much had changed. Jim created the People to People guidebooks for multiple Eastern European countries Each person was filed under the town where they lived, followed by two or three lines, including their address, date of birth, phone number and hobbies. Through a combination of Google and snail-mail, I managed to get hold of several of them. Most had all known Jim either personally or through friends of friends. All had fond memories of the project and all were still willing to act as local guides to show me around. In Gdansk, I asked civil servant Krystyna WrÃ³blewska why she had signed up originally. She told me she had been working as a media fixer, helping reporters cover the anti-communist shipyard strikes. ""They [the media] went looking for women with handkerchiefs on their heads and horses with carts, perpetuating the same old picture. I suppose I wanted to meet people to subvert stereotypes and show that not all the pictures you have in your head are real."" Krystyna Wroblewska signed up in the late 1980s to show travellers around Gdansk ""It surprised me how easy it was,"" Jim insisted to me. He produced guides for Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Baltics and Russia, featuring thousands upon thousands of locals. Some of his contacts came from his personal, multi-volume address books, and he got new sign-ups after placing interviews in local papers and jazz magazines. ""Some of the older people in Russia were scared about being put on a Western list, because they thought it would be easier to be rounded up and carted away,"" he said. ""But a lot of younger people wanted to be in the bookâ¦ I was getting sackfuls of mail. I'm sure the local postman wondered what the hell was going on."" Over the years, the authorities often wondered what was going on at Jim's place. Not least during the period when he started issuing fake passports. It was back in the 1970s, after he had caught wind of an American traveller, who, 20 years before, had renounced his American citizenship and created his own ""world passport"". For Jim, non-national passports seemed to encapsulate his ideals of peace and global freedom. So he turned his home into an ""embassy"" and started producing world passports for anyone who wanted one. The documents were so convincing that some people used them to cross borders. ""Look, you can't do this any more. You have to stop making passports,"" exasperated French police would say when they came to his door. But Jim continued until he ended up in court. Though he was eventually acquitted of fraud and counterfeiting, he was found guilty of ""confusing the public"". Jim always dismissed the idea that it was a naÃ¯ve undertaking, but he was trusting to a fault, according to some of his friends, and this led to financial mistakes and legal troubles over the years. He wouldn't deal with problems, waiting until they blew up instead. ""I often had to stop him signing things. Sometimes he didn't even read them,"" says Jesper, his son, who was born during Jim's marriage to Viveka Reuterskiold in the 1960s. Jim with his son Jesper Jesper grew up in Stockholm after they separated, but visited Paris every summer from the age of 10. ""There were mattresses on every spare bit of floor, people sleeping everywhere,"" he says, as he recalls his earlier visits. ""It was exciting and fun, but sometimes I felt jealous. Lots of people did. People were very possessive of him. People wanted to claim him, but he was unclaimable."" Jesper credits his father with opening the world to him. He used Jim's contacts books extensively as he travelled and he is currently living with his own family in Bangkok, where he briefly replicated the Sunday dinners. ""Just for six months... It was a lot of work."" Listen to Jim talking to BBC Outlook During the 1990s, the crowds started to dwindle at the Paris dinners, as the original hippy crowd aged. But then a new wave of younger visitors started to get in touch. The bloggers had discovered him. ""The internet both ruined and saved the dinners,"" says Seamas McSwiney, a close friend who helped on Sunday evenings for decades. ""It became less spontaneous as people tried to book six months ahead - which was anathema to how Jim travelled and also annoying as those people were more likely to do a no-show - but at the same time, these online articles re-energised the idea. There was a younger crowd and new momentum."" At the dinners' peak, Jim would welcome up to 120 guests, filling his atelier and spilling out into the cobbled back garden. An estimated 150,000 people have come over the years. ""The door was always open,"" says Amanda Morrow, an Australian journalist who stayed with Jim for a year-and-a-half. ""It was a revolving door of guests - some who wanted to stay over, and others who just wanted to say hello. Jim never said no to anyone."" The only thing that really got Jim down was people leaving,"" says Jesper. ""He struggled with that. He didn't like being on his own... Though fortunately there was usually a new person to distract him."" In the final years, Jim would sit quietly, as others gravitated into his orbit. On my last visit, he looked frail and pained by his various ailments, but he also had an air of contentment, clearly never tiring of being the conduit for human interactions. ""I was wondering when you'd come back,"" he said to me, in the rasping American accent he somehow had never lost. Here was a man who had spent time with Lennon and Bowie, who was once friends with Sonia Orwell and used to walk round Paris with Samuel Beckett. And yet he made everyone feel special. Every connection mattered. ""It felt like politician's trick, but it was natural,"" says Seamas. In very recent times, Covid restrictions reduced the dinners' clockwork schedule, but his friends say he was not depressed by the pandemic. He had figured the get-togethers would resume and, until then, had enjoyed a smaller stream of visiting carers and, whenever possible, friends. Amid the outpouring of online tributes since his death in his sleep on 6 January, these words from Jesper stand out: ""His goal from early on was to introduce the whole world to each other. He almost succeeded.""

Meet the UK's vaccine volunteers,"More than five million people in the UK have now received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine - thanks to an army of more than 80,000 volunteers and NHS workers who have been trained to give the jabs. Many of the vaccine volunteers have had no previous medical training and come from all walks of life. So why did they sign up? And how does it feel to stick a needle into a stranger's arm? Callum Finnegan, 23, has been juggling his 40-hour week as a Tesco delivery driver with giving Covid jabs at Manchester's Etihad tennis centre. A St John Ambulance volunteer, he completed extensive online and face-to-face training, which included practising administering jabs on silicon arms before giving them to patients. He says he'd never given an injection before. The biomedical science graduate wanted to get involved in the vaccination effort as soon as the call was put out and says he feels ""grateful and privileged"" to be helping the rollout - an effort he hopes will save as many lives as possible.

Callum, who volunteered for four weeks at London's Nightingale hospital at the beginning of the pandemic, says his first shift giving jabs was ""one of the best days"" he's had since Covid hit. ""They were incredibly emotional,"" he says of the people he has given the jab to. ""You could see their relief. A lot of them have been waiting 10 months without leaving the house, or seeing only one or two people. One of those could have been a Tesco delivery driver - there's a lot of people I deliver to who tell me that I'm the only person they're seeing face-to-face at the minute."" Government pushing to get jabs to front-line roles England delivering 140 jabs a minute - NHS chief Johnson: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allows Kate Donaghy, who runs an IT team for a travel company, was inspired to train as a vaccinator after seeing the impact of the disease first hand. A St John Ambulance volunteer for four years, Kate, 28, spent time at a London hospital last year helping to care for recovering Covid patients - before volunteering at an A&E department. After seeing just how desperate the situation was, she switched her focus to becoming a vaccinator. ""I just thought how can we stop this happening to people in the first place? If we can vaccinate people, that feels like a better way forward to solve the problem, and a great use of my time."" She says she overcame her initial nerves in giving the jabs thanks to some supportive colleagues and has already signed up for shifts at London's ExCel centre most weekends going forward. Her elderly patients were ""so happy it was the beginning of the end to their isolation"". ""It just makes me feel better about the world, especially when it can get you down. It's nice to do something good for other people."" Dr Andy Bates, a 57-year-old dentist from North Yorkshire, recently gave his first vaccinations at Long Lee surgery, in Keighley. He is used to giving injections - albeit in the mouth - but he says helping to protect people against this virus ""did feel good - it felt good to be fighting back"". Dr Bates is working as a paid vaccinator alongside a four-day week at his dental practice. He says both roles have served as a reminder that he could be the first person a patient has seen for months. And he says his day job - particularly calming people who are nervous about lying back in his dentist's chair - has helped him. He says he managed to relax a ""very nervous"" lady in her 90s, who hadn't left the house since last March, by talking about their shared love of alpine cycling. And it's not just Dr Bates and his fellow vaccinators that have stepped up. He says after a ""huge dump"" of snow in the area, the community sprang into action to ensure elderly patients could safely come for their jabs - witha local farmer towing the van delivering the vaccines up the hill,externalto the surgery, and volunteers clearing snow and ice from the car park. When theatres closed last year, Amanda Baldwin's career as a full-time chorus member at London's Royal Opera House came to a ""heartbreaking"" standstill. Stuck at home in south-east London with nothing to do, Amanda and her husband Julian Johnson, 55 - a freelance theatre stage manager - decided to volunteer for the NHS through the GoodSam app, which later connected them with the vaccinator training run by St John Ambulance. Amanda applied shortly after her 84-year-old mother tested positive for the virus - just before she was due to have the vaccine. ""Luckily she came through it, and she wasn't hospitalised. But I just thought this is enough, this has got to stop. I wanted to help all the other elderly people who are so vulnerable to this virus."" Amanda recently passed her full SJA training in London and is now waiting for her first shift as a vaccinator. She thinks her performance background will help keep her nerves in check for when she administers her first jabs - joking that she hopes her patients ""don't wriggle about as much"" as her pet cat did when she had to give it injections for its diabetes. After feeling ""like a part of [her] soul was missing"" when theatres closed, she says training as vaccinator has given her a ""purpose"" again. ""I feel like I've now got [another] skill that can really help people.""

"Vaccinated people may spread Covid, warns Van-Tam","People who have received a Covid-19 vaccine could still pass the virus on to others and should continue following lockdown rules, England's deputy chief medical officer has warned. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalProf Jonathan Van-Tam stressed that scientists ""do not yet know the impact of the vaccine on transmission"". He said vaccines offer ""hope"" but infection rates must come down quickly. Matt Hancock said 75% of over-80s in the UK have now had a first virus jab. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses, and figures so far reflect those given the first dose. The health secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr that around three quarters of care homes had also been vaccinated. Meet the UK's vaccine volunteers How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Why won't vaccinating the vulnerable end lockdown? Prof Van-Tam said ""no vaccine has ever been"" 100% effective, so there is no guaranteed protection. It is possible to contract the virus in the two- to three-week period after receiving a jab, he said - and it is ""better"" to allow ""at least three weeks"" for an immune response to fully develop in older people. ""Even after you have had both doses of the vaccine you may still give Covid-19 to someone else and the chains of transmission will then continue,"" Prof Van-Tam said. ""If you change your behaviour you could still be spreading the virus, keeping the number of cases high and putting others at risk who also need their vaccine but are further down the queue."" Last week, the person coordinating Israel's Covid responsereportedly suggested a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine might not be as effective as reported. Israel has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world against coronavirus, with scientists keenly watching data shared by the country for signs of how effective the vaccine is when given to the whole population. The country's health minister Yuli Edelstein told the Andrew Marr Show that some people ""still get sick"" with coronavirus after getting the first dose of the vaccine, but said there were ""some encouraging signs of less severe diseases, less people hospitalised after the first dose"". Senior doctors havecalled on health officials in England to cut the gap between the first and second dosesof the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The maximum wait was extended from three to 12 weeks in order to get the first jab to more people across the UK. But the British Medical Association said the policy was ""difficult to justify"" and the gap should be reduced to six weeks. Its chair, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, told the BBC there were ""growing concerns"" that the vaccine could become less effective with doses 12 weeks apart. Responding to the criticism, Prof Van-Tam said: ""What none of these (who ask reasonable questions) will tell me is: who on the at-risk list should suffer slower access to their first dose so that someone else who's already had one dose (and therefore most of the protection) can get a second?"" Senior doctors want gap between Covid jabs halved More than 4,000 Covid patients now on ventilators A further 32 vaccine sites are set to open across England this week. More than 5.8 million people in the UK have received their first dose of a vaccine, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,external. NHS England said new vaccine sites were preparing to open across England from Monday. They include Dudley's Black Country Living Museum,which doubled as a set for TV series Peaky Blinders, Plymouth Argyle FC's stadium Home Park and an old Ikea store in Stratford, London. The 32 sites will prioritise health and social care staff on Monday, and other priority patients from Tuesday. They will bring the number of mass vaccination sites across England to 49 - as well as 70 pharmacies, more than 1,000 GP surgeries and 250 hospitals offering the jab. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday thatmore than a third of over-80s had received their first dose of a vaccine. More than half of over-80s in Northern Irelandhave had the jab, though Health Minister Robin Swann said ""it will take time"" for the programme to have a ""major effect."" In Wales, four vaccination centres have been shutas officials brace for more snowy weather. Prof Van-Tam stressed that the UK needs to ""bring the number of cases down as soon as we can whilst we vaccinate our most vulnerable"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? Another 1,348 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test were reported in the UK on Saturday, in addition to 33,552 new infections. There were 4,076 Covid patients were on hospital ventilators in the UK as of Friday,according to government data.,external That is higher than during the first wave, when the peak was 3,301 on 12 April. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week there is ""some evidence""the variant that emerged in the UK may be more deadly- but scientists have since said thisshould not be a ""game changer"" in the UK's response to the pandemic.

"Firms planned 800,000 redundancies last yearDespite the furlough scheme, employers decided to cut a record number of jobs during 2020.Business","British employers made plans to cut 795,000 jobs last year, a record number, as Covid lockdowns took their toll on the economy. More than 10,000 firms planned job cuts, however the pace of planned cuts slowed at the end of the year. Without the government's furlough scheme, designed to protect jobs, the numbers might have been higher still. The figures were obtained in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request to the Insolvency Service. Employers must notify the Insolvency Service when they plan to cut 20 or more jobs, giving an earlier indication of changes in the labour market than waiting for official joblessness statistics. Large parts of the British economy were brought to a standstill for weeks on end during 2020 by the measures imposed to contain Covid-19, and many employers were forced to cut staff as a result. The number of job cuts proposed through the year was well above the 530,000 seen the last time the UK was in recession, in 2010, and higher than any year in the records which go back to 2006. However, in recent months the pace of layoffs has slowed, even though the new Covid variant has seen surging case numbers and new lockdowns imposed across the UK. Last month employers notified government of plans to cut 23,100 job cuts, which is the lowest monthly figure for 2020, though still a third higher than December 2019. What jobs are available at the moment? UK borrowing hits highest December level on record Temporary jobs for UK workers 'surge in December' The decision to extend the furlough scheme, where government pays most of a worker's wages if their employer can't, will have enabled more firms to keep their staff, believes Tony Wilson, Director of the Institute for Employment Studies. ""The question now though is where redundancy figures go next,"" he says. ""If they start to stabilise around these levels, then [job cuts] would be at least one third higher than what we've seen over most of the last decade, and it's possible that a combination of this lockdown and then furlough unwinding from May could see numbers creeping up."" Despite that, Mr Wilson sees the situation as ""pretty positive"". Employers planning to cut 20 or more staff have to notify the Insolvency Service of their plans at the start of the process. These notifications give an earlier indication of the state of the labour market than data published by the Office for National Statistics, which appear with a time lag of a few months. Insolvency Service figures showed record levels in redundancies in June and July, which was confirmed when the ONS published its own figures three months later. The latest figures, for the period from August to October, saw a new record of 370,000 redundancies across the UK. As redundancy processes covering fewer than 20 workers aren't included, the total number of job cuts planned will be higher than the Insolvency Service totals. But individual firms often make fewer cuts than the number they first propose to government. Employers in Northern Ireland file HR1 forms with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and they are not included in these figures.

The man who invited the world over for dinnerThe extraordinary life of an American who invited hundreds of thousands to his Paris home for food.,"Jim Haynes was both an icon and a relic of the Swinging Sixties, an American in Paris who was famous for inviting hundreds of thousands of strangers to dinner at his home. He died this month. Last February, I took my last trip abroad before lockdown closed in on us. I bought a last-minute ticket and jumped on the Eurostar to Paris, motivated by a sudden urge to have dinner with a friend. Jim Haynes had entered his late 80s and his health was declining, yet I knew he would welcome a visit. Jim always welcomed visitors. The essence of that trip now feels like the antithesis of Covid times. I was far from the only guest wandering into the warm glow of his atelier in the 14th arrondissement on a wet winter's night. Inside, people were squeezing, shoulder to shoulder, through the narrow kitchen. Strangers struck up conversations, bunched together in groups, balancing their dinners on paper plates and reaching over each other to press the plastic spout on a communal box of wine. Jim had operated open-house policy at his home every Sunday evening for more than 40 years. Absolutely anyone was welcome to come for an informal dinner, all you had to do was phone or email and he would add your name to the list. No questions asked. Just put a donation in an envelope when you arrive. There would be a buzz in the air, as people of various nationalities - locals, immigrants, travellers - milled around the small, open-plan space. A pot of hearty food bubbled on the hob and servings would be dished out on to a trestle table, so you could help yourself and continue to mingle. It was for good reason that Jim was nicknamed the ""godfather of social networking"". He led the way in connecting strangers, long before we outsourced it all to Silicon Valley. A ballet dancer staying with Jim in the late 1970s suggested cooking for him and friends to repay the hospitality; the dinners became weekly for 40-plus years I only knew Jim in his later years, but his entire life was extraordinary. Born in Louisiana in 1933, he had lived in Venezuela as a teenager; founded the alternative culture centre Arts Lab in London, where he mixed with David Bowie, John Lennon and Yoko Ono; ran a sexual liberation magazine in Amsterdam, and all before becoming a university lecturer in sexual politics in Paris, his home since 1969. And yet he was often seen as a son of Scotland, following an influential stint there in the late '50s and late '60s, when he established Edinburgh's first paperback bookshop, co-founded the Traverse Theatre and helped kickstart the Fringe festival. When Jim died, at 87, earlier this month, a Herald obituary called him ""the unofficial agent for the beat generation in Scotland"". While a lot of highly regarded people tend to retreat into their own circles after finding success, Jim never stopped reaching out to new people. The first time I heard from him was an email out of the blue in 2008. I had written a newspaper article from Barcelona - not the one in Spain but the one on the coast of Venezuela - and it had brought back memories for him. His father worked in the oil business and had moved the family there when Jim was in his early teens. My article was about meeting people through the Couchsurfing website,external, where locals opened their homes to strangers for free around the world. This was before AirBnB worked out how to monetise the idea, and the concept of non-commercial cultural exchange was right up Jim's street. ""When you are back in Europe, come to dinner,"" he wrote, promising to tell me about an old travel project of his own that he thought I might like. Intrigued, I headed to Paris soon after my return. I had imagined some sort of intimate dinner party with cultural elites, but what I found was more like a student house party - albeit with more mature attendees and only moderate alcohol consumption. (Jim was teetotal and proceedings ended strictly by 23:00.) Jim never cooked himself, instead he invited guest cooks Jim instantly greeted me like an old friend and, as we chatted, he reached up on to his living room shelves to offer me a book. People to People read the cover line. It was the project he had wanted to tell me about. He explained that, in the late 1980s, he had founded a guidebook series for countries behind the Iron Curtain. Instead of the standard descriptions of sights and hotel listings, the format was like an address book, including the contact details for hundreds of in-country hosts. The idea was that if people could not easily see the Western world themselves, he would bring it to them via travellers. It was ""couchsurfing"", but offline. The hand-sized copy he pressed into my palm centred on Poland. I loved it and decided to travel there to see if the participants were still up for receiving random visitors, even though so much had changed. Jim created the People to People guidebooks for multiple Eastern European countries Each person was filed under the town where they lived, followed by two or three lines, including their address, date of birth, phone number and hobbies. Through a combination of Google and snail-mail, I managed to get hold of several of them. Most had all known Jim either personally or through friends of friends. All had fond memories of the project and all were still willing to act as local guides to show me around. In Gdansk, I asked civil servant Krystyna WrÃ³blewska why she had signed up originally. She told me she had been working as a media fixer, helping reporters cover the anti-communist shipyard strikes. ""They [the media] went looking for women with handkerchiefs on their heads and horses with carts, perpetuating the same old picture. I suppose I wanted to meet people to subvert stereotypes and show that not all the pictures you have in your head are real."" Krystyna Wroblewska signed up in the late 1980s to show travellers around Gdansk ""It surprised me how easy it was,"" Jim insisted to me. He produced guides for Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Baltics and Russia, featuring thousands upon thousands of locals. Some of his contacts came from his personal, multi-volume address books, and he got new sign-ups after placing interviews in local papers and jazz magazines. ""Some of the older people in Russia were scared about being put on a Western list, because they thought it would be easier to be rounded up and carted away,"" he said. ""But a lot of younger people wanted to be in the bookâ¦ I was getting sackfuls of mail. I'm sure the local postman wondered what the hell was going on."" Over the years, the authorities often wondered what was going on at Jim's place. Not least during the period when he started issuing fake passports. It was back in the 1970s, after he had caught wind of an American traveller, who, 20 years before, had renounced his American citizenship and created his own ""world passport"". For Jim, non-national passports seemed to encapsulate his ideals of peace and global freedom. So he turned his home into an ""embassy"" and started producing world passports for anyone who wanted one. The documents were so convincing that some people used them to cross borders. ""Look, you can't do this any more. You have to stop making passports,"" exasperated French police would say when they came to his door. But Jim continued until he ended up in court. Though he was eventually acquitted of fraud and counterfeiting, he was found guilty of ""confusing the public"". Jim always dismissed the idea that it was a naÃ¯ve undertaking, but he was trusting to a fault, according to some of his friends, and this led to financial mistakes and legal troubles over the years. He wouldn't deal with problems, waiting until they blew up instead. ""I often had to stop him signing things. Sometimes he didn't even read them,"" says Jesper, his son, who was born during Jim's marriage to Viveka Reuterskiold in the 1960s. Jim with his son Jesper Jesper grew up in Stockholm after they separated, but visited Paris every summer from the age of 10. ""There were mattresses on every spare bit of floor, people sleeping everywhere,"" he says, as he recalls his earlier visits. ""It was exciting and fun, but sometimes I felt jealous. Lots of people did. People were very possessive of him. People wanted to claim him, but he was unclaimable."" Jesper credits his father with opening the world to him. He used Jim's contacts books extensively as he travelled and he is currently living with his own family in Bangkok, where he briefly replicated the Sunday dinners. ""Just for six months... It was a lot of work."" Listen to Jim talking to BBC Outlook During the 1990s, the crowds started to dwindle at the Paris dinners, as the original hippy crowd aged. But then a new wave of younger visitors started to get in touch. The bloggers had discovered him. ""The internet both ruined and saved the dinners,"" says Seamas McSwiney, a close friend who helped on Sunday evenings for decades. ""It became less spontaneous as people tried to book six months ahead - which was anathema to how Jim travelled and also annoying as those people were more likely to do a no-show - but at the same time, these online articles re-energised the idea. There was a younger crowd and new momentum."" At the dinners' peak, Jim would welcome up to 120 guests, filling his atelier and spilling out into the cobbled back garden. An estimated 150,000 people have come over the years. ""The door was always open,"" says Amanda Morrow, an Australian journalist who stayed with Jim for a year-and-a-half. ""It was a revolving door of guests - some who wanted to stay over, and others who just wanted to say hello. Jim never said no to anyone."" The only thing that really got Jim down was people leaving,"" says Jesper. ""He struggled with that. He didn't like being on his own... Though fortunately there was usually a new person to distract him."" In the final years, Jim would sit quietly, as others gravitated into his orbit. On my last visit, he looked frail and pained by his various ailments, but he also had an air of contentment, clearly never tiring of being the conduit for human interactions. ""I was wondering when you'd come back,"" he said to me, in the rasping American accent he somehow had never lost. Here was a man who had spent time with Lennon and Bowie, who was once friends with Sonia Orwell and used to walk round Paris with Samuel Beckett. And yet he made everyone feel special. Every connection mattered. ""It felt like politician's trick, but it was natural,"" says Seamas. In very recent times, Covid restrictions reduced the dinners' clockwork schedule, but his friends say he was not depressed by the pandemic. He had figured the get-togethers would resume and, until then, had enjoyed a smaller stream of visiting carers and, whenever possible, friends. Amid the outpouring of online tributes since his death in his sleep on 6 January, these words from Jesper stand out: ""His goal from early on was to introduce the whole world to each other. He almost succeeded.""

Here are some of the main headlines from today:   Today's live page was brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Sophie Williams, Paul Gribben and Lauren Turner. We'll be back with more on Monday morning. Six coronavirus testing centres have been forced to close due to heavy snow in the West Midlands. The weather is also causing travel disruption, with treacherous conditions reported on some of the region's roads. A severe weather warning for snow remains in place until midnight, with another warning for ice issued by the Met Office until Monday morning. Workers for an aid charity have been despatched to support emergency workers and those affected by recent flooding. Read morehere. The Midlands has become the first region in England to administer more than one million first doses of coronavirus vaccine, new figures from NHS England show. The data also shows London still lags behind all other regions in terms of the total number of jabs given. It has delivered around 641,000 jabs since 8 December. Over the last seven days, London also delivered the lowest number of first doses, with 219,350 given between 17 January and 23 January. In the same time period, there were 219,350 in the Midlands. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said he fully expects the capital's numbers to rise. One possible reason for the discrepancy could be that London has a lower average age than the rest of the UK, according to data from Trust for London, and older people are being vaccinated first. Alan JohnstonBBC Middle East analyst Egypt - the Arab world's most populous nation - has begun
the process of vaccinating its more than 100 million citizens against
the coronavirus. The country has recorded nearly 9,000 deaths from the
disease. The first recipients of a vaccine were a doctor and a nurse.
They were given a Chinese-made injection. Vaccines from Britain and Russia will be included in the
inoculation programme as it unfolds. Egyptâs health minister said the country was aiming to
produce an injection locally, with a view to distributing it to the rest of
Africa. There have been warnings that the continent is in danger of being left
behind, as richer parts of the world strike vaccine-supply deals and drive up
prices. Read more: There have now been a total of 6,353,321 people who've received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK, the latest government figures show. In addition, 469,660 have had their second dose. The government is planning to offer a vaccine to everyone in the four most vulnerable categories by 15 February. Another 30,004 positive coronavirus tests have been recorded in the UK, according to government figures just released. It brings the total number of cases so far to 3,647,463. It's the lowest daily number of cases since 19 December. There were an additional 610 deaths recorded today of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths now stands at 97,939. Figures tend to be lower on Sunday and Mondays because of lags in reporting at the weekend.  Portugal has been heading to the polls to vote for the country's president. The election comes as the country continues to see a surge in cases. Portugal has recorded 624,469 cases and 10,194 deaths since the pandemic began. Hospitalisations are at an all-time high according to Reuters news agency. Images from the polls show people wearing PPE, sanitizing their hands and socially distancing while queuing. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: '95% of Scottish care home residents have been vaccinated' Blue envelopes with details of vaccine appointments for those aged 70 to 79 will begin arriving in households across Scotland from Monday. The envelopes being sent out in Fife, Forth Valley, Ayrshire and Arran, Lanarkshire, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Lothian are part of a new booking system being used in six health board areas. According to theScottish government's vaccine deployment plan,,externalthe 470,000 people aged in the 70 and 79 age bracket should receive their first dose by mid-February. But many over-80s have yet to receive their first jab and the government has faced criticism from opposition parties concerned that Scotland is ""lagging behind"" England on the vaccine roll-out. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told theBBC's Andrew Marr Showthat figure had now reached about 40% and the rollout was ""gathering pace every day"". Ms Sturgeon said the rollout to the over-80s has been slower because the Scottish government has ""very deliberately"" focused on vaccinating care home residents first, which is ""more time-consuming and labour intensive"".

and AstraZeneca over a delay in the distribution of vaccines. Both companies have warned they will not be able to deliver
vaccines to the EU as agreed due to production issues. On Saturday a senior Italian health official warned that the
countrywill have to
rethink its vaccination programme if supply issues continue. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the aim of the legal
action would be to secure the doses rather than to seek damages. ""We are working so our vaccine plan programme does not change.
We are activating all channels so the EU Commission does all it can to make
these gentlemen respect their contracts,â he told RAI state television. The head of Italy's Higher Health Council Franco Locatelli
said Pfizer deliveries were 29% lower than planned this week but the levels
were expected to return to those agreed by 1 February.

year olds in order for them to take school exams, the government says. The country has one of the highest vaccination rates in the
world against coronavirus. According to its health ministry, it has administered
at least one dose to more than 25% of its population since 19 December. Vaccines are currently available to those over 40. A spokeswoman for the countryâs education ministry said the
addition of the 16-18 year-olds allows their return to school and the âorderly
holding of examsâ. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is campaigning for

"Vaccinated people may spread Covid, warns Van-TamEngland's deputy chief medical officer urges those who have had the jab to stick to lockdown rules.","People who have received a Covid-19 vaccine could still pass the virus on to others and should continue following lockdown rules, England's deputy chief medical officer has warned. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalProf Jonathan Van-Tam stressed that scientists ""do not yet know the impact of the vaccine on transmission"". He said vaccines offer ""hope"" but infection rates must come down quickly. Matt Hancock said 75% of over-80s in the UK have now had a first virus jab. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses, and figures so far reflect those given the first dose. The health secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr that around three quarters of care homes had also been vaccinated. Meet the UK's vaccine volunteers How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? Why won't vaccinating the vulnerable end lockdown? Prof Van-Tam said ""no vaccine has ever been"" 100% effective, so there is no guaranteed protection. It is possible to contract the virus in the two- to three-week period after receiving a jab, he said - and it is ""better"" to allow ""at least three weeks"" for an immune response to fully develop in older people. ""Even after you have had both doses of the vaccine you may still give Covid-19 to someone else and the chains of transmission will then continue,"" Prof Van-Tam said. ""If you change your behaviour you could still be spreading the virus, keeping the number of cases high and putting others at risk who also need their vaccine but are further down the queue."" Last week, the person coordinating Israel's Covid responsereportedly suggested a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine might not be as effective as reported. Israel has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world against coronavirus, with scientists keenly watching data shared by the country for signs of how effective the vaccine is when given to the whole population. The country's health minister Yuli Edelstein told the Andrew Marr Show that some people ""still get sick"" with coronavirus after getting the first dose of the vaccine, but said there were ""some encouraging signs of less severe diseases, less people hospitalised after the first dose"". Senior doctors havecalled on health officials in England to cut the gap between the first and second dosesof the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The maximum wait was extended from three to 12 weeks in order to get the first jab to more people across the UK. But the British Medical Association said the policy was ""difficult to justify"" and the gap should be reduced to six weeks. Its chair, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, told the BBC there were ""growing concerns"" that the vaccine could become less effective with doses 12 weeks apart. Responding to the criticism, Prof Van-Tam said: ""What none of these (who ask reasonable questions) will tell me is: who on the at-risk list should suffer slower access to their first dose so that someone else who's already had one dose (and therefore most of the protection) can get a second?"" Senior doctors want gap between Covid jabs halved More than 4,000 Covid patients now on ventilators A further 32 vaccine sites are set to open across England this week. More than 5.8 million people in the UK have received their first dose of a vaccine, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,external. NHS England said new vaccine sites were preparing to open across England from Monday. They include Dudley's Black Country Living Museum,which doubled as a set for TV series Peaky Blinders, Plymouth Argyle FC's stadium Home Park and an old Ikea store in Stratford, London. The 32 sites will prioritise health and social care staff on Monday, and other priority patients from Tuesday. They will bring the number of mass vaccination sites across England to 49 - as well as 70 pharmacies, more than 1,000 GP surgeries and 250 hospitals offering the jab. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday thatmore than a third of over-80s had received their first dose of a vaccine. More than half of over-80s in Northern Irelandhave had the jab, though Health Minister Robin Swann said ""it will take time"" for the programme to have a ""major effect."" In Wales, four vaccination centres have been shutas officials brace for more snowy weather. Prof Van-Tam stressed that the UK needs to ""bring the number of cases down as soon as we can whilst we vaccinate our most vulnerable"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Smart motorways are dangerous, says police chief","The Department for Transport said ""smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones"" A police and crime commissioner (PCC) has written to the government to say smart motorways are ""inherently unsafe and dangerous and should be abandoned"". South Yorkshire PCC Dr Alan Billings wrote his open letter to Grant Shapps, the Secretary of State for Transport. His comments come after a coronerfound two men had been unlawfully killed on a ""smart"" section of the M1. The Department for Transport said ""smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones"". On 19 January coroner David Urpeth called for a review of the road schemes. Mr Urpeth said smart motorways without a hard shoulder carry ""an ongoing risk of future deaths"". He was speaking following the inquests for Jason Mercer, 44, from Rotherham and Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, of Mansfield, who died when a lorry crashed into their vehicles near Sheffield on 7 June 2019. Coroner calls for smart motorway review over deaths âWrong personâ jailed over M1 deaths, claims widow More stories across Yorkshire Now Labour's Dr Billings has told Grant Shapps: ""I believe smart motorways of this kind - where what would be a hard shoulder is a live lane with occasional refuges - are inherently unsafe and dangerous and should be abandoned. ""The relevant test for us is whether someone who breaks down on this stretch of the motorway, where there is no hard shoulder, would have had a better chance of escaping death or injury had there still been a hard shoulder - and the coroner's verdict makes it clear that the answer to that question is - Yes."" Alexandru Murgeanu (l) and Jason Mercer were killed in the crash on the M1 in South Yorkshire Jason Mercer's widow, Claire, had previously told Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio 5Live she considered a government review of the smart motorway system ""was just a paperwork exercise and a PR exercise."" Talking to BBC Look North Yorkshire after publishing the letter on Sunday, Dr Billings said: ""The Department for Transport and Highways England have argued all along that these sorts of motorways are actually safe, they even go as far as to say they are safer than ordinary motorways, now I think that whatever formula they are using to come to that conclusion is wrong. ""The coroner in his verdict has made it pretty clear that these two particular lives in South Yorkshire would not have come to such a sad end if there had been a hard shoulder there, so I think this is new evidence they have to take into account."" He added: ""If they thought this type of motorway was even smarter, or safer, than a conventional motorway, then why not convert the entire system to smart motorways, making it safer? As soon as you say it, I think you realise it's absurd. ""I think they (smart motorways) were done originally not because it was a safer way of doing a motorway, I think it was done in order to expand the capacity, get the traffic flowing by having an extra lane, but to do it cheaply, and I think we're trading cost - cheapness - for other people's lives."" In response to Dr Billings' open letter, the Department for Transport said: ""The stocktake [of smart motorways] showed that in most ways smart motorways are as safe as, or safer than, the conventional ones. ""The Transport Secretary has tasked Highways England with delivering an 18-point action plan to ensure they are safer still, and he has called an urgent meeting with the company to discuss their progress.""

Here are some of the main headlines from today:   Today's live page was brought to you by Victoria Lindrea, Sophie Williams, Paul Gribben and Lauren Turner. We'll be back with more on Monday morning. Six coronavirus testing centres have been forced to close due to heavy snow in the West Midlands. The weather is also causing travel disruption, with treacherous conditions reported on some of the region's roads. A severe weather warning for snow remains in place until midnight, with another warning for ice issued by the Met Office until Monday morning. Workers for an aid charity have been despatched to support emergency workers and those affected by recent flooding. Read morehere. The Midlands has become the first region in England to administer more than one million first doses of coronavirus vaccine, new figures from NHS England show. The data also shows London still lags behind all other regions in terms of the total number of jabs given. It has delivered around 641,000 jabs since 8 December. Over the last seven days, London also delivered the lowest number of first doses, with 219,350 given between 17 January and 23 January. In the same time period, there were 219,350 in the Midlands. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has said he fully expects the capital's numbers to rise. One possible reason for the discrepancy could be that London has a lower average age than the rest of the UK, according to data from Trust for London, and older people are being vaccinated first. Alan JohnstonBBC Middle East analyst Egypt - the Arab world's most populous nation - has begun
the process of vaccinating its more than 100 million citizens against
the coronavirus. The country has recorded nearly 9,000 deaths from the
disease. The first recipients of a vaccine were a doctor and a nurse.
They were given a Chinese-made injection. Vaccines from Britain and Russia will be included in the
inoculation programme as it unfolds. Egyptâs health minister said the country was aiming to
produce an injection locally, with a view to distributing it to the rest of
Africa. There have been warnings that the continent is in danger of being left
behind, as richer parts of the world strike vaccine-supply deals and drive up
prices. Read more: There have now been a total of 6,353,321 people who've received their first coronavirus vaccine in the UK, the latest government figures show. In addition, 469,660 have had their second dose. The government is planning to offer a vaccine to everyone in the four most vulnerable categories by 15 February. Another 30,004 positive coronavirus tests have been recorded in the UK, according to government figures just released. It brings the total number of cases so far to 3,647,463. It's the lowest daily number of cases since 19 December. There were an additional 610 deaths recorded today of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths now stands at 97,939. Figures tend to be lower on Sunday and Mondays because of lags in reporting at the weekend.  Portugal has been heading to the polls to vote for the country's president. The election comes as the country continues to see a surge in cases. Portugal has recorded 624,469 cases and 10,194 deaths since the pandemic began. Hospitalisations are at an all-time high according to Reuters news agency. Images from the polls show people wearing PPE, sanitizing their hands and socially distancing while queuing.

The envelopes being sent out in Fife, Forth Valley, Ayrshire and Arran, Lanarkshire, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Lothian are part of a new booking system being used in six health board areas. According to theScottish government's vaccine deployment plan,,externalthe 470,000 people aged in the 70 and 79 age bracket should receive their first dose by mid-February. But many over-80s have yet to receive their first jab and the government has faced criticism from opposition parties concerned that Scotland is ""lagging behind"" England on the vaccine roll-out. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told theBBC's Andrew Marr Showthat figure had now reached about 40% and the rollout was ""gathering pace every day"". Ms Sturgeon said the rollout to the over-80s has been slower because the Scottish government has ""very deliberately"" focused on vaccinating care home residents first, which is ""more time-consuming and labour intensive"".

and AstraZeneca over a delay in the distribution of vaccines. Both companies have warned they will not be able to deliver
vaccines to the EU as agreed due to production issues. On Saturday a senior Italian health official warned that the
countrywill have to
rethink its vaccination programme if supply issues continue. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the aim of the legal
action would be to secure the doses rather than to seek damages. ""We are working so our vaccine plan programme does not change.
We are activating all channels so the EU Commission does all it can to make
these gentlemen respect their contracts,â he told RAI state television. The head of Italy's Higher Health Council Franco Locatelli
said Pfizer deliveries were 29% lower than planned this week but the levels
were expected to return to those agreed by 1 February.

The board meeting in North Wales heard some council staff, not within groups currently being vaccinated, booked appointments by following a link in an email only intended for the recipient. Betsi Cadwaladr health board's chairman Mark Polin said such actions could deprive someone else of a jab. Denbighshire council said it had warned staff the emails were not to be abused. It is not clear if anyone not entitled succeeded in getting a Covid jab, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid. Only front-line social care and health workers, those over 80 and 70 years old, care home residents and their carers are currently being vaccinated. Independent member Jackie Hughes spoke about the matter at Thursday's monthly health board meeting. Answering her query, Dr Chris Stockport, the health board's executive director of primary care and community services, said: ""We are very clear with our local authority partners and teams of what frontline means in the same way we are elsewhere. ""When you arrive [for a vaccine] there's a process of validation. ""The likelihood is they will experience some difficulties working through the booking system [if they try to get into a higher vaccination cohort]. ""It adds complications for a busy team and I would ask them not to do that when it's a clear effort to circumvent the cohort."" At Thursday's daily press briefing the UK Government Home Secretary Priti Patel said people who jumped the queue for the vaccinewere ""morally reprehensible"" as they were putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She said all the UK Government's measures were under review but ""our focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can protect them and obviously protect others in the community"". Mr Polin added: ""Whilst we understand the concerns people should not be doing what they are doing. ""The priority groups have been identified with clear medical guidance and sound reasoning behind it. ""So people jumping the queue are depriving someone else, potentially, of receiving the vaccine at the point at which they should."" He said it was a temporary problem, adding: ""We are changing the booking system, so this opportunity is not going to last much longer."" He said staff were looking out for any inappropriate bookings. Gap between Covid jabs 'unacceptable' When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

Variant 'raises R by up to 0.7',"Researchers have been tracking changes to the ""spike"" of the virus The new variant of Covid-19 is ""hugely"" more transmissible than the virus's previous version, a study has found. It concludes the new variant increases theReproduction or R numberby between 0.4 and 0.7. The UK's latest R number has been estimated at between 1.1 and 1.3. It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling. Prof Axel Gandy of London's Imperial College said the differences between the viruses types was ""quite extreme"". ""There is a huge difference in how easily the variant virus spreads,"" he told BBC News. ""This is the most serious change in the virus since the epidemic began,""  he added. The Imperial College study suggests transmission of the new variant tripled during England's November lockdown while the previous version was reduced by a third. Cases of Covid-19 have begun to increase rapidly during the second spike, and the number of cases recorded in a single day reached a new high on Thursday. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Cases of new variant appear worldwide Early results indicated that the virus was spreading more quickly among under-20s, particularly among secondary school age children. But the very latest data indicates that it was spreading quickly across all age groups, according to Prof Gandy who was a member of the research team. ""One possible explanation is that the early data was collected during the time of the November lockdown where schools were open and the activities of the adult population were more restricted. We are seeing now that the new virus has increased infectiousness across all age groups."" Prof Jim Naismith, of Oxford University, said he believed that the new findings indicated that even tougher restrictions would soon be needed. ""The data from Imperial represent the best analysis to date and imply that the measures we have employed to date, would - with the new virus - fail to reduce the R number to below 1. ""In simpler terms, unless we do something different the new virus strain is going to continue to spread, more infections, more hospitalisations and more deaths."" The R number is the average number of people an infected person infects. If it is above 1 the epidemic is growing. The most chilling finding from this piece of research is that the November lockdown in England, hard though it was for many people, would not have stopped the variant form of the virus spreading. The same severe restrictions that saw cases of the previous version of the virus fall by a third, would see a tripling of the new variant. This is why there has been such a sudden tightening of restrictions across the country. It is unclear whether the current restrictions will be enough to control the spread of the virus. Given the fact that it has taken two lockdowns to stop the earlier version of the virus overwhelming the NHS, many scientists fear that further tightening will be necessary. Infection levels will begin to drop as enough people are vaccinated. But until then it is now more important than ever for people to follow social distancing guidelines, wear masks where required and to regularly wash their hands. The new year brings with it hope of a more normal life in the next few months but also a new form of the virus that all of us will have to combat in the coming days and weeks. Professor Lawrence Young, of Warwick University, said early indications suggested that vaccines would be effective against the new form of the virus. ""Variants virus have been around since the beginning of the pandemic and are a product of the natural process by which viruses develop and adapt to their hosts as they replicate. ""Most of these mutations have no effect on the behaviour of the virus but very occasionally they can improve the ability of the virus to infect and/or become more resistant to the body's immune response."" Further research is needed to understand why the variant is spreading so quickly. But early indications are that vaccines should be effective against it. The new virus has been designated ""Variant of Concern 202012/01"" or VOC by Public Health England. It was detected in November and thought to have originated in the south-east England in September. There is no evidence to suggest that it is more deadly, but it will increase the number of cases which in turn will add further pressure on the NHS. The variant can now be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, as well as south-east and eastern England. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Asian 'El Chapo' arrested in Amsterdam,"Tse Chi Lop was arrested at Amsterdam airport on Friday Police in the Netherlands have arrested the alleged head of one of the world's biggest drugs gangs, on a warrant issued by Australia. Tse Chi Lop - a Chinese-born Canadian national - is said to be the head of The Company, which dominates a $70bn illegal drugs market across Asia. Listed as one of the world's most wanted fugitives, Mr Tse was detained at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. Australia will now seek his extradition to face trial there. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) believe The Company, also known as the Sam Gor Syndicate, is responsible for up to 70% of all illegal drugs entering the country. The 56-year-old has been compared to the Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman because of the scale of his alleged enterprise. How Mexico's drug kingpin fell victim to his own legend Australian police had reportedly been tracking Mr Tse for more than a decade before he was arrested on Friday as he was about to board a flight to Canada. A police statement, which did not name Mr Tse, saidthe arrest warrant was issued in 2019,external, with police in the Netherlands acting on an Interpol notice. ""He was already on the most-wanted list and he was detained based on intelligence we received,"" a Dutch police spokesman of the arrest Friday.

The news agency cited UN estimates as saying the syndicate's revenue from methamphetamine sales alone could have been as high as $17bn in 2018. The effort to arrest Mr Tse, Operation Kungur, involved about 20 agencies from continents across the globe with AFP taking the lead, according to Reuters. Allow Twitter content?
