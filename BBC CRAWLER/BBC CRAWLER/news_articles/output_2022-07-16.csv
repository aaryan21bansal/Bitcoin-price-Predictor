'I've spent 10 days in Sri Lanka petrol queue',"Pratheem, a 43-year-old minibus driver, said he's slept in his car since last week to avoid leaving the queue In Sri Lanka, huge queues of vehicles waiting for fuel have become a common sight, as the country reels from a deep economic crisis that has left it unable to import enough. One queue, beginning in the commercial heart of the capital Colombo, and snaking round alongside a seaside strip of road, continues for 5km. Close to the front, driving a minibus, is 43-year-old Pratheem. He has been waiting in line for 10 days. ""I've been sleeping in the car since last Thursday,"" he tells the BBC as he inches towards the petrol station. ""It's so hard but what can I doâ¦ I won't even get a full tank."" Pratheem works driving tourists around. In the past he would take them across the country, but now he can't do longer journeys and restricts himself to making trips to and from the airport. The petrol he's queued up for, for so long, will allow him to do the journey around three times, before he has to line up once again. Pratheem's son or brother will come and relieve him for a few hours at times to allow him to go home, but others in the queue can't even do that. Sri Lanka seeks way forward after president quits Did green policies cause Sri Lanka unrest? Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? Just behind him are a number of private buses. Conductor Guna and driver Nishantha live too far away, and so have had to rely on public washrooms. ""I've been bathing once every three days,"" says Guna. ""To urinate it costs 20 rupees (5p), to shower it's 80 rupees (19p)."" Bus conductor Guna (L) and driver Nishantha (R) have relied on public washrooms to stay clean while queueing for fuel The men have also been struggling with sharp rises to food prices - inflation is currently over 50%. Since they began queuing, the country has seen dramatic and unprecedented political drama, with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa forced to flee and resign as thousands of angry protesters took to the streets. The country's dire economic situation is partly due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the tourism industry, but analysts say much of the blame lies with a series of disastrous government financial policies including cutting taxes and attempting to hastily ban chemical fertilizers. Sri Lanka is now dangerously low on foreign reserves - needed to pay for imports of fuel and medicine as well as some foods. Guna, the bus conductor, says at one stage he joined the protesters as they forced their way into the Prime Minister's official residence. ""I was shocked at the way he lives,"" he tells the BBC, describing sitting down in one of the padded chairs awe-struck at the gulf between his life and that of the political elite. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC on Wednesday reported from inside the office stormed by protesters in Sri Lanka A little further back in the queue are a group of cousins. One works as a software engineer, others are bankers. They have a rotation system allowing half the group to spend nights at home, whilst others sleep in the cars to move them along the queue and protect them from thieves. ""It's so terrible, I can't express it with words,"" Ewantha tells the BBC. He's been trying to work from nearby cafes or from his laptop inside his car, but also praises the level of camaraderie on display in the queue. Others have complained of frequent fights and scuffles in the heat, but he says there's a spirit of solidarity, with local businesses allowing them to use their bathrooms, for example. The solidarity even at times permeates through those committing acts of crime. ""One time I went to sleep in the car and I left my slippers outside, when I woke up they were gone,"" Ewantha tells the BBC with a smile. In their place the thief had left his own, old pair of torn and ripped slippers for him to use. Ewantha, like many Sri Lankans, is furious at the prospect of the prime minister and current acting President Ranil Wickremesinghe becoming the new leader of the country. ""He's another Rajapaksa,"" adds another of the group, Yunus, referencing the former president and his family dynasty. In Sri Lanka, huge queues of vehicles waiting for fuel have become a common sight Mr Wickremesinghe is currently considered the most likely candidate to be selected by parliament as president next week, though protesters have insisted they will not accept him, and other politicians are also putting themselves forward. Whoever takes charge, trying to resolve this economic crisis will be a massive challenge. The priorities will be to strike a bailout deal with the IMF and to bring more fuel into the country. A new scheme aims to digitally register drivers and allocate them a specific amount of fuel they can collect on certain days of the week, but it will likely take years, and many difficult financial decisions, for the country to recover. Back at the end of the queue, Chandra, working in life insurance, is gearing himself up to stay in his car for the next week. He has barely any petrol left so will likely have to push his car for most of it. ""I'm just wasting my time,"" he tells the BBC despondently.

No, not the weather... the golf! The heat is only going to be cranked up tomorrow, too. St Andrews is set to sizzle again when Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland fight it out for the Claret Jug. And if those two start sweating and melt, one of the chasing pack will be ready to take advantage. Whoever stays coolest will win. The final pairing of McIlroy and Hovland will tee off at 14:50 BST, join us for all the build up from about 13:30. See you there! Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland have dominated the headlines today - and rightly so. The pair take a four-shot lead into the final round of the 150th Open Championship after a scintillating duel over the Old Course. The Ryder Cup team-mates delighted the St Andrews crowd as they both shot six-under-par 66s to lead on 16 under. Read the full lowdown on today's action at St Andrews from our man Peter Scrivener. Here's the state of play going into St Andrews Sunday... -16Rory McIlroy (66), Viktor Hovland (66) -12Cameron Young (71), Cameron Smith (73) -11Si-woo Kim (67), Scottie Scheffler (69) -10Dustin Johnson (71) Full leaderboard McIlroy -16 (66) Rory McIlroy, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: ""The eagle was a bonus but I was pretty proud that I kept my composure over the next few holes, not to drop a shot or get ahead of myself and I played well down the stretch."" Incredible support out there - do you block it out or take it in? ""I certainly appreciate the support. Yeah, I'll take it in, it's great to have the support and I feel it out there but I just have to stay in my own little world. I've done it well for three days so I just have to do it for one more day."" Hovland -16 (66) BBC Radio 5 Live Viktor Hovland was talking to BBC Radio 5 Live: That was a lot of fun. Got off to a good start and to shoot bogey free at a major in these conditions was pretty special. What's the plan for tomorrow? It's about going out there and do the same thing today. I feel I was in way more control of my ball yesterday and hopefully I can hit it a little bit better tomorrow. Hovland -16 (66) Co-leader Viktor Hovland, speaking to Sky Sports: ""It was awesome but it was also a little stressful, even though it might not have looked like it, being bogey-free. I had a lot of short putts for par that I had to make and I was really happy that I was able to go bogey-free."" On his monster birdie putt on four: ""I hit a nice nine-iron in there and was actually surprised it finished that far away, but you're just trying to lag those ones so it was a bonus to see it go in."" How exciting it is to have a chance to win The Open at St Andrews: ""It's pretty outrageous, to be fair. I've never been here before so at the start of the week I was just trying to soak everything in. I had some lousy performances coming in so I'm glad I've turned it around and hopefully I'll make the most of it tomorrow."" Scheffler -11 (69) It sounds like Rory McIlroy has himself a fan in the current world number one. Here's what Scottie Scheffler had to say when asked if there's a crowd favourite a St Andrews: ""Isn't it Rory? I was like, they're chanting his name out there. I think he's definitely a crowd favourite. How can you not root for Rory?"" Respect. Fitzpatrick -9 (69) Well, we've had another brilliant day, but not everyone is enjoying St Andrews as much - including US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick. As we know, Fitzpatrick is a big numbers man and the bumps and bad bounces you get on a dry links track, coupled with tricky pins, isn't to his liking. ""Yeah, I'll be honest, I'm not really a fan,"" Fitzpatrick said of St Andrews. ""I just - you can hit good shots and get bad bounces. And you can hit bad shots and get good bounces. ""Like I say, I felt, for the first seven holes, I didn't really miss a shot. I'm walking off 7th green and I'm plus-1. It's tough to take. It's tough to stay patient. ""I said earlier in the week that it's not my favourite golf course to play. But I think, obviously, with how firm it is, they obviously exaggerate some of the slopes and stuff as well. "" Asked if he thought St Andrews could withstand the modern game without the wind, he replied: ""Probably not. ""If the greens are softer than they are in the morning and there's no wind, I mean, no, I wouldn't say so. Some of the pins, as you can see, are incredibly tucked, just over slopes. ""You see where the pins are this week. A lot of them are incredibly tucked, just to try and protect it as much as possible. ""There's a lot of stuff like that that's been done, obviously, to protect it from going lower, I guess."" McIlroy -16 (66) There's plenty of highlights from Rory McIlroy's round to show you...

""I've got a lot of belief in myself, I've done it before and I know I can do it again. I need to stay in my own little world, shoot a good score and hopefully that will be enough. ""It would mean everything because of everything I've been through in the last few years and trying to get that fifth major. ""I need to keep the same mindset that I had today and the past three days. ""I need to stay in my own little world and I know if I play my game I can shoot scores like this on this golf course.

It shouldâve led to better than a two-putt for par - he started the day as the leader, he ends it four back. Cameron Young toes a similar effort right across the green towards the feet of the spectators, and gets all sorts of advice from the fans as he shapes to play itâ¦ He also closes with a par, this one saved rather than spawned, and will go to sleep tonight knowing he too has four strokes to make up on Sunday. Smith -12 (73), Young -12 (71) A hearty handshake between the two Camerons, who will spend a lot more time together tomorrow.

"Look out for vulnerable in heatwave, public urged","This video can not be played Watch: 'Water, shade and cover' to mitigate heatwave - Barclay Extra measures are being put in place for ambulance services as the UK heatwave approaches, says Health Secretary Steve Barclay. More call handlers and extra capacity for the 111 helpline are among the steps planned for Monday and Tuesday. He urged the public to look out for vulnerable relatives and neighbours. A national emergency has been declared, and the UK's first red extreme heat warning issued, with temperatures possibly reaching 41C (106F). That would be the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK - above the current high of 38.7C in Cambridge in 2019. Mr Barclay said: ""The clear message to the public is to take sensible steps in terms of water, shade and cover. That's the best way of mitigating against the heat. ""We're asking people to keep an eye out for their neighbours and those who may be vulnerable."" On Saturday, temperatures reached 29.1C in Kew Gardens in west London, and Heathrow Airport, with highs of 31C expected in central England on Sunday. In east Kent, hundreds of people were left with either no water or low pressure on Saturday after apower failure on Friday evening. NI high temperature could be topped Hot weather in Wales hits Covid jab clinics and rail travel Scotland heat warning could be extended - minister The extra support for health services also includes extra ambulance capacity, and freeing up space in hospitals so patients are not stuck in ambulances outside, said Mr Barclay. NHS leaders have warned there could be greater demand for ambulances - and said patientsshould not be leftoutside hospitals in hot weather for more than 30 minutes. The new health secretary was speaking after an emergency Cobra meeting held by the government on Saturday. Cabinet Office Minister Kit Malthouse, who chaired it, warned of significant disruption to transport and urged people not to travel unless necessary. ""The heat will affect rails, for example, so the trains have to run slower,"" he said, adding: ""If they don't have to travel, this may be a moment to work from home."" Schools are being given help and guidance to enable them to stay open, Mr Malthouse said. Meanwhile, Labour criticised the prime minister after he reportedly did not attend the meeting. ""Boris Johnson has gone missing in action again,"" said deputy leader Angela Rayner. ""He's back to his old tricks of skipping important Cobra meetings."" The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) told people to take simple steps to stay safe. ""In these exceptionally high temperatures everybody can be affected,"" said Prof Isabel Oliver, its chief scientific officer. ""Last year we didn't reach temperatures anywhere near the ones that are predicted for next week, [and] we saw over 1,600 excess deaths associated with the period of heatwave. So this is why we are keen that everybody knows what they can do to stay safe."" The Met Office red warning - the highest level - is for extreme heat and covers an area including London, Manchester and York on Monday and Tuesday. It is the first time it has been issued since the warning system for heat started last year. Rail passengers in England and Waleshave been warned they should only travel if necessary, and Network Rail said speed restrictions were likely. Some schoolswill also close early next weekandsome hospital appointmentswill be cancelled. The rest of England,Walesand southern Scotland will be under an amber warning for extreme heat - while in Europe, deadly wildfireshave broken out in Portugal, Spain and southwestern France. Train tracks are being painted white in some parts of the country to deflect the heat BBC Weather forecaster Susan Powell said the situation was unprecedented. She said there was an 80% chance the UK would break its current highest temperature record. Temperatures could reach as high as 41C in England on Monday, with 38C quite widely across England and Wales. Tuesday is set to see highs of 40C, or above, in eastern England. Northern Ireland and Scotland could also see their temperature records broken, she said. And on top of that, the temperature overnight on Monday into Tuesday could also hit a new peak - with highs of 25C expected. ""The problem is we have a 48 to 72-hour period where people who are vulnerable have no cooling-off period,"" she said. This video can not be played Susan Powell looks at the high temperatures expected by day and night As well as the Met Office warning, the UKHSA has issued its highest level four heat alert to health and care bodies - warning illness and death could occur ""among the fit and healthy"". Most deaths during a heatwave are usually heart attacks or strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable. By Katharine Da Costa, BBC News health reporter Exposure to extreme temperatures can be fatal. An unprecedented three-week heatwave in northern France in August 2003 resulted in 15,000 excess deaths - those are deaths from all causes that occur above and beyond those expected under ""normal"" conditions. The vast majority of the deaths were among older people, aged 65 and above. In England during the same period, there were more than 2,000 excess deaths, compared to the previous five years. The rise in mortality due to hot weather can happen very quickly, usually within the first couple of days of the temperature rising. So the Met Office red heat warning and the UK Health Security Agency's level four health alert are like warning klaxons for the government, health service and individuals to make necessary preparations now in order to mitigate the risks. Experts say that climate change is making heatwaves more likely as well as more intense and lasting longer. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the latter half of the 18th century, and experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments make steep cuts to emissions. 'I've put ice under my hat' - keeping cool at work What does hot weather do to the body? 10 tips for sleeping in hot weather The hot weather is an ""extra burden"" for care homes, said Mike Padgham, the chair of the Independent Care Group which represents care providers. Carers will make sure curtains are drawn, move residents to cooler areas of the home, use water sprays and ensure everyone stays hydrated, he said. A Queen's Life Guard soldier helping a Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horse stay cool earlier this week in London There is concern that the hot weather might also lead to more people getting into difficulty while swimming - aftera teenage boy died after getting into the waterat a quarry in Lancashire last week. The Canal and River Trust has launched a safety campaign, asking people not to jump into locks or off bridges. She said the water may be shallower or deeper than expected or there could be weeds and plants that can tangle around people's limbs. Meanwhile,firefighters are urging peopleto swap barbeques for picnics, in a bid to avoid triggering wildfires. How are you coping in the heat? Share your experienceshaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Students like me are priced out of graduation,"Jared (right) said he was ""shocked"" to find out how much his graduation would cost Like thousands of others, I went to order my cap and gown this week to celebrate graduating university. But, as the first member of my immediate family to graduate, I had no idea about the costs involved. Cap and gown hire for one day? Â£45. Official photos (which I knew mum would love)? Â£60. Extra ceremony tickets for my nans? Â£20 each. It all started to add up and felt very pricey. Cardiff University said it offered free gowns and photographs to some students. Without taking into account hotel prices or travel costs for my family to get to Cardiff from my hometown of Lichfield in Staffordshire, the day alone would cost me Â£145. 'It's just something that takes over your life' Cost of living is ruining university, students say Should students have to pay for graduation? As a fresh graduate with no stable income, I asked myself ""could I justify this cost for just one day?"" In the end, I decided to bite the bullet as I did not want to miss out on an occasion my nan Eileen described as ""such a proud day for me to share with my grandson"". It turns out, I was not alone. ""There are tonnes of students that have either struggled massively to go or just outright aren't going"" Serenity Davis, 25, is graduating from Cardiff Metropolitan University but is not going because they cannot afford it. ""I have utility bills and rent to pay each month and I'm from a low-income family so I don't get support from them, they can't afford to just come over to Cardiff for a day. ""They've got to book time off work and cover the cost of fuel to drive up here. ""I've fought tooth and nail against my health for three years to do a course and graduate, only to come to the point that it's so expensive I can't go and my family can't come."" ""You have to make graduation something that will be of value for us"" Couple Sian Billington and Rhys Churchill, both 23, have missed four graduation ceremonies between them. Having completed undergraduate and master's degrees at Bangor University, they decided not to attend any of their ceremonies due to the costs involved. Mr Churchill said he thought a lot of students found the price of graduation insulting. ""I've worked hard for four years, getting through a lot of complicated times in life and I've done it to get the qualification, not to get fancy photos or ceremony."" Miss Billington added: ""It's anti-climactic to get your degree in the post, but what they're asking us to pay for graduation is not worth what we're getting in return."" Elliot Dollner, 23, graduated from Cardiff University last year and moved back to his family home in Brighton. He has chosen not to travel back to Cardiff for graduation. ""I don't think the university have considered external costs for people travelling back to Cardiff for graduation. ""Hotel prices are double, sometimes triple, the usual cost for a weekend in Cardiff and the cost of fuel now when travelling a long distance is enough to deter anyone."" Olivia said the cost of her cap and gown was reasonable, but hotel costs proved too much Olivia Morgan, 21, graduated from the University of South Wales last year and attended her graduation ceremony in April. ""I looked to stay at the hotel where my graduation was being held for the night. ""It was on a week day, which is usually less expensive, but they had bumped the price right up."" Despite many students complaining about the costs of graduation, some universities have been praised for their affordable ceremonies. Emma Blackmore, 22, finished her English degree at the University of Exeter in 2021. Now working towards a masters at Cardiff University, she did not have to pay for her undergraduate graduation. ""We also had the opportunity to wear the robes around campus and we were encouraged to take photos free of charge. It was a nice touch."" Newcastle University also provided cap and gowns free of charge for their 2021 graduates. Emma Blackmore felt her graduation at the University of Exeter was incredibly organised Cardiff University said it recognised the current financial situation was difficult for some but was not aware of any graduate who indicated that they were unable to attend graduation because of cost. A spokesman added that it offered a free gowns and photographs package to students who had been supported as care leavers, estranged students, young adult carers, forces veterans or asylum seekers. The University of South Wales also offered funding for care leavers, while Aberystwyth University encouraged students to apply for an award from its university hardship fund. Swansea, Wrexham, Bangor and Cardiff Metropolitan universities have no such support packages on offer but Cardiff Metropolitan said it had encouraged students to contact its student services finance team for support. National Union of Students Wales said it was ""unfair"" students were being priced out and were making ""increasingly tough choices"" because of the cost of living crisis.Â It also called for universities to ""do what they can"" to make graduations more affordable so students did not miss the opportunity to celebrate their achievements with family and friends.Â 'It's just something that takes over your life' Cost of living is ruining university, students say Should students have to pay for graduation?

Prize-winning horse found starving 'back prancing',"A vet said that 23-year-old Prince was in one of the worst states he had ever seen A former prize-winning stallion that was found starving and with overgrown hooves is ""prancing again"", a charity has said. In his youth, 23-year-old Prince won top prizes at the Royal Welsh Show and the Lampeter Stallion Show. But he was found, having wandered into the grounds of a Caerphilly care home, emaciated and with badly damaged teeth. Ann Keating, of the Welsh Pony Rescue & Rehoming Charitable Trust, said Prince's condition was ""disgraceful"". Tougher punishments for animal cruelty crimes Dog owners share heatwave care advice Prince was taken into the charity's care after he was found in the grounds of the care home, in Blackwood, on 5 July and is now on the road to recovery. ""His teeth, well there was no enamel on them, it was just gone, they were deteriorating,"" said Ms Keating. ""The hoof growth, [the vet] said he'd never ever seen a horse like it, it was so bad. He was astonished at the state of it. ""There is nothing at all wrong with him health wise to say that he should be in the condition he's in. It's pure starvation."" Ann Keating said she feared Prince would have died had he not been taken in by the charity Ms Keating added that Prince was in one of the worst conditions she had seen, but that it was unfortunately not an uncommon sight for the charity. She said she believed that Prince had somehow managed to leave where he was being kept, and said she is glad he is now under the charity's care. The vet that took care of Prince said he had never seen hoof growth as bad Ms Keating added that it is especially sad to see Prince in the state he is in because of the accolades he had won in his past. ""He won the Royal Welsh, and Lampeter - and that's a bigger show than the Royal Welsh,"" she said. ""To win Lampeter, you've got to have a good animal, and he has been, he's been proper show quality."" Ms Keating said Prince is getting used to be being ""the famous horse on the yard"" However, Prince has now been officially signed over to the charity, and is already showing signs of recovery. ""He's here now and he's got everything he needs, he's out in the yard with everybody,"" added Ms Keating. ""He's so much happier now, he's trotting around properly now, he's even prancing about showing off. ""Everybody here wants to go out and clean him or brush him, he's getting very used to being the famous horse in the yard. ""He's had a tough time but he'll get to relax now, he's earned it.""

No, not the weather... the golf! The heat is only going to be cranked up tomorrow, too. St Andrews is set to sizzle again when Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland fight it out for the Claret Jug. And if those two start sweating and melt, one of the chasing pack will be ready to take advantage. Whoever stays coolest will win. The final pairing of McIlroy and Hovland will tee off at 14:50 BST, join us for all the build up from about 13:30. See you there! Rory McIlroy and Viktor Hovland have dominated the headlines today - and rightly so. The pair take a four-shot lead into the final round of the 150th Open Championship after a scintillating duel over the Old Course. The Ryder Cup team-mates delighted the St Andrews crowd as they both shot six-under-par 66s to lead on 16 under. Read the full lowdown on today's action at St Andrews from our man Peter Scrivener. Here's the state of play going into St Andrews Sunday... -16Rory McIlroy (66), Viktor Hovland (66) -12Cameron Young (71), Cameron Smith (73) -11Si-woo Kim (67), Scottie Scheffler (69) -10Dustin Johnson (71) Full leaderboard McIlroy -16 (66) Rory McIlroy, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: ""The eagle was a bonus but I was pretty proud that I kept my composure over the next few holes, not to drop a shot or get ahead of myself and I played well down the stretch."" Incredible support out there - do you block it out or take it in? ""I certainly appreciate the support. Yeah, I'll take it in, it's great to have the support and I feel it out there but I just have to stay in my own little world. I've done it well for three days so I just have to do it for one more day."" Hovland -16 (66) BBC Radio 5 Live Viktor Hovland was talking to BBC Radio 5 Live: That was a lot of fun. Got off to a good start and to shoot bogey free at a major in these conditions was pretty special. What's the plan for tomorrow? It's about going out there and do the same thing today. I feel I was in way more control of my ball yesterday and hopefully I can hit it a little bit better tomorrow. Hovland -16 (66) Co-leader Viktor Hovland, speaking to Sky Sports: ""It was awesome but it was also a little stressful, even though it might not have looked like it, being bogey-free. I had a lot of short putts for par that I had to make and I was really happy that I was able to go bogey-free."" On his monster birdie putt on four: ""I hit a nice nine-iron in there and was actually surprised it finished that far away, but you're just trying to lag those ones so it was a bonus to see it go in."" How exciting it is to have a chance to win The Open at St Andrews: ""It's pretty outrageous, to be fair. I've never been here before so at the start of the week I was just trying to soak everything in. I had some lousy performances coming in so I'm glad I've turned it around and hopefully I'll make the most of it tomorrow."" Scheffler -11 (69) It sounds like Rory McIlroy has himself a fan in the current world number one. Here's what Scottie Scheffler had to say when asked if there's a crowd favourite a St Andrews: ""Isn't it Rory? I was like, they're chanting his name out there. I think he's definitely a crowd favourite. How can you not root for Rory?"" Respect. Fitzpatrick -9 (69) Well, we've had another brilliant day, but not everyone is enjoying St Andrews as much - including US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick. As we know, Fitzpatrick is a big numbers man and the bumps and bad bounces you get on a dry links track, coupled with tricky pins, isn't to his liking. ""Yeah, I'll be honest, I'm not really a fan,"" Fitzpatrick said of St Andrews. ""I just - you can hit good shots and get bad bounces. And you can hit bad shots and get good bounces. ""Like I say, I felt, for the first seven holes, I didn't really miss a shot. I'm walking off 7th green and I'm plus-1. It's tough to take. It's tough to stay patient. ""I said earlier in the week that it's not my favourite golf course to play. But I think, obviously, with how firm it is, they obviously exaggerate some of the slopes and stuff as well. "" Asked if he thought St Andrews could withstand the modern game without the wind, he replied: ""Probably not. ""If the greens are softer than they are in the morning and there's no wind, I mean, no, I wouldn't say so. Some of the pins, as you can see, are incredibly tucked, just over slopes. ""You see where the pins are this week. A lot of them are incredibly tucked, just to try and protect it as much as possible. ""There's a lot of stuff like that that's been done, obviously, to protect it from going lower, I guess."" McIlroy -16 (66) There's plenty of highlights from Rory McIlroy's round to show you...

""I've got a lot of belief in myself, I've done it before and I know I can do it again. I need to stay in my own little world, shoot a good score and hopefully that will be enough.

""I need to keep the same mindset that I had today and the past three days. ""I need to stay in my own little world and I know if I play my game I can shoot scores like this on this golf course.

McIlroy -6 (66) Rory McIlroy, who is tied for the lead after shooting a six-under 66 today, speaking to Sky Sports:""I'm really pleased, I missed some chances and had to stay patient.

It shouldâve led to better than a two-putt for par - he started the day as the leader, he ends it four back. Cameron Young toes a similar effort right across the green towards the feet of the spectators, and gets all sorts of advice from the fans as he shapes to play itâ¦ He also closes with a par, this one saved rather than spawned, and will go to sleep tonight knowing he too has four strokes to make up on Sunday. Smith -12 (73), Young -12 (71) A hearty handshake between the two Camerons, who will spend a lot more time together tomorrow.

Disabled rail passenger told to sit by train doors,"Cameron says there is a risk the train doors could open while a wheelchair is parked there A wheelchair user said he was left feeling travel sick and unsafe after being forced to sit next to the train doors on two railway journeys. Cameron Wood, 25, from Hereford, said Transport for Wales staff told him it was the only space to sit due to the lack of available wheelchair bays. He said: ""I ended up sitting by the doors and it was like a rollercoaster. It wasn't a very nice experience."" Transport for Wales (TfW) said it would investigate why this happened. Mr Wood added: ""It does worry me that the doors will accidentally open when at stations while a wheelchair is parked against them if this is allowed to continue."" Disabled woman fined for parking in disabled spot 'Am I human?' - disabled man unable to board train Disabled rail users 'an afterthought' During the first journey on 8 July, from Hereford to Cardiff, he said a pushchair was parked in the wheelchair-only space. ""In the opposite space there was a pushchair and this then led to me being told by a member of Transport for Wales staff to sit by the doors because there was no other wheelchair space at the time,"" Mr Wood explained. ""Every time we stopped at a station - there were maybe three, four, five stops - I had to move because passengers were getting off and on and I was blocking a door through no fault of my own."" Cameron Wood, pictured in a disabled seating area, says such spaces should not be used for luggage or pushchairs as wheelchair users have no choice where to sit The second journey was earlier on Saturday, from Southampton Central to Hereford via Newport. ""I was told by member of train staff at Newport to sit by the doors of the train because the walkway from the door of the train to the wheelchair area was blocked - so I couldn't get there to begin with,"" he said. ""They told me to sit by the doors again but I'm about to say I'm finding that I'm having to do this more and more - you have nothing to anchor yourself with. ""It has made me feel quite travel sick."" He added that although his brakes were on and the wheelchair was switched off, this did not stop him moving about. ""I do want an apology from them, it's unacceptable. They shouldn't allow wheelchair users to sit by the door,"" Mr Wood said. ""They need to use the spaces allocated for wheelchair users."" He is also calling for railway operators to bring in automated announcements to remind other passengers not use wheelchair spaces for their luggage or pushchairs. He added: ""This week I've travelled every day, but normally it's once or twice a month. [Trains] are my lifeline. ""We don't have a choice where we sit and sometimes it can be really, really hard."" Airports told to stop failing disabled passengers Rail replacements 'humiliating' disabled people Airport apologises to disabled woman left on plane A TfW spokesperson said: ""Looking after our customers' well-being and safety is our number one priority. We will investigate the services highlighted to understand why the area by the door was utilised. ""We aim to provide assistance to those who need help when travelling on our network. ""If passengers have not reserved a wheelchair space in advance, this may not be available if another passenger is already using the seat or it is reserved for a passenger later in the journey. If there are no priority seats available, our staff will do their best to help find a seat elsewhere. ""Additionally all our trains are fitted with equipment for our conductors to make announcements."" The spokesperson added it was investing Â£800m in new trains which are being rolled out later this year, increasing capacity by 67%.

Tory rivals clash over tax and spending plans,"This video can not be played WATCH: The first TV debate in 90 seconds Tory leadership frontrunners have clashed over how best to fund public services and control inflation in the contest's first TV debate. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss attacked tax rises introduced under ex-chancellor Rishi Sunak as ""wrong"" and pledged to reverse them. But Mr Sunak said they were needed to fund the NHS, and accused her of believing in economic ""fairy tales"". Rivals also sparred over Boris Johnson, trans rights and trust in politics. All five remaining candidates in the Tory leadership race took part in the Channel 4 TV debate, the first of two this weekend. They come ahead of the next round of MPs' voting on Monday. Tory MPs will whittle the field down to two final contenders next week, before around 160,000 Tory members decide the party's next leader in a postal vote. Who could be the next prime minister? Truss and Mordaunt in bitter fight to stay in Tory race What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? In a lively 90 minutes of exchanges, the economic backdrop loomed large as candidates were pushed on how they would fund public services and help people with the cost of living during a time of soaring inflation. Mr Sunak, currently in pole position among MPs, was forced to defend tax rises introduced during his time as chancellor, including April'shike in National Insuranceto pay for social care and the NHS. Ms Truss, who came third in the latest MPs' voting round on Thursday, said the hike had been ""wrong"" and said she had ""called it out"" in cabinet. She said if she won power she would reverse the rise, as well as removing green levies on energy bills - saying she would pay for it for by spreading the UK's ""Covid debt"" over a longer period. The race to be our next prime minister is reaching a crucial phase. By Wednesday, the shortlist will have been whittled down to two by Conservative MPs, who will then be put to Conservative party members over summer. There is a lot to play for in the next few days - and you could tell in the first TV debate. Three things stuck out for me in the exchanges. Firstly, the Conservative Party is keen to move on from Boris Johnson. Although it's just eight days since Mr Johnson agreed to resign, the candidates to be his successor want the next chapter to start as soon as possible. Read more from Nick here. But Mr Sunak rubbished her proposals, saying there was ""no such thing as Covid debt"" and warned against an ""unfunded spree"" of tax cuts, adding that ""borrowing your way out of inflation isn't a plan, it's a fairy-tale"". Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, currently second in the contest, said her economic blueprint, which involve raising income tax thresholds in line with inflation, was based on better ""growth and competition"". When pressed by Mr Sunak that her plans would also require more borrowing, she denied she had promised to ""reduce a load of taxes"" but said ""people need help now"". ""Next April we are going to be one of the most uncompetitive nations in terms of our tax competitiveness. That cannot be allowed to happen,"" she added. Elsewhere, candidates traded blows over Mr Johnson's legacy and trust in politics after the Partygate and Chris Pincher affairs that played a key role in the Tory revolt that forced the prime minister from office. Mr Tugendhat, the fifth-placed contender among MPs and the only one not to have held a ministerial post under Mr Johnson, said his party needed a ""break from those who sat around the table"" to reset the party's direction. He pitched himself as a ""clean face"" and when asked for a yes or no answer on whether Mr Johnson was honest, Mr Tugendhat was the only candidate to answer with a direct ""no"", which won applause from the crowd. Asked the same question, Ms Badenoch said ""sometimes"", Ms Mordaunt said she was ""not doing a yes or no"" but there had been some ""really severe issues"", while Ms Truss said Mr Johnson ""has been very clear himself that he made mistakes in government"". Mr Sunak said he had tried to give Mr Johnson ""the benefit of the doubt for as long as possible but ultimately I reached the conclusion that I couldn't and that's why I resigned"". Mr Tugendhat later told the debate: ""It's easy to stand up to your enemies - it's sometimes harder to stand up to your friends."" He also said he had not supported the National Insurance rise, calling it a ""tax on jobs"", and accused Mr Sunak of only backing it in office ""because the boss wanted it"". But the backbench MP's interventions received a curt response from fourth-placed contender Kemi Badenoch, a former equalities minister, who said he ""didn't have any responsibilities"" and likened him to a pupil pointing out problems from the ""back of the class"". Elsewhere in the debate: Penny Mordaunt said she took attacks on her in the press from rivals as a ""big fat compliment that no one wants to run against me"" Kemi Badenoch was the only candidate who said she would not recommit to the government's pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 Liz Truss blamed the Bank of England for high inflation, arguing ""we haven't been tough enough on the monetary supply"" This video can not be played WATCH: I don't see myself as a socialist chancellor - Sunak Ms Mordaunt also clashed with Ms Truss and Ms Badenoch over her record on trans rights during her time as an equalities minister. Both Ms Badenoch and Ms Truss accused Ms Mordaunt of supporting ""self-ID"", a process allowing a trans person to legally change their gender without, for example, a medical diagnosis. Ms Mordaunt denied ever supporting the policy, but Ms Badenoch, who previously served as a junior equalities minister in 2020-21, said she found that ""hard to accept"" and her understanding was Ms Mordaunt had pushed for it. Ms Truss, who also had responsibility for equalities alongside her role as foreign secretary, said she had ""changed the outcome"" of a consultation to ensure self-ID was not brought in. While Mr Sunak was not asked about gender identity during the debate, speaking on Saturday he said: ""I'm the father of two young girls and I want to make sure that women's rights are protected, whether that's in sports, in changing rooms or in language. ""But of course I respect everyone's freedom to love who they want and live as they live. But we must be unequivocal, as I am, about protecting women's rights.""

All over 50s to get an autumn Covid boosterMore people than originally planned will be offered the jab in the UK ahead of the coming winter.,"Everyone aged 50 and over will be offered a Covid booster vaccine this autumn to top up their immunity and cut their risk of becoming severely ill. Younger people at high risk from Covid, as well as health and social care staff, will also get the booster. Drug companies have been developing updated vaccines to tackle newer variants, however, it is still uncertain which vaccine will be used. The original plan meant healthy people aged 50-65 would not have been jabbed. However, the immunisation campaign has been expanded as current variants are spreading quickly, it is uncertain how the virus will mutate and it is expected we will be more social this winter than in previous years so the virus will have more chance to spread. The updated advice comes from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises governments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It says the booster should be offered to: health and social care staff everyone aged 50 and over carers who are over the age of 16 people over five whose health puts them at greater risk, this includes pregnant women people over five who share a house with somebody with a weakened immune system The details of the rollout have not been confirmed, however, it is thought immunisation will start with the oldest and most vulnerable from September. For some people it will be their sixth dose of a Covid vaccine. Prof Anthony Harnden, the deputy chairman of the JCVI, said: ""The Covid-19 boosters are highly effective at increasing immunity and, by offering a further dose to those at higher risk of severe illness this autumn, we hope to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalisations and deaths over the winter."" The current wave of Covid - caused by the sub-variants of Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 - demonstrates the speed the virus can spread. It is the third wave of Omicron subvariants this year andone in 18 people in the UKare currently testing positive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Today we have confirmed the next phase in our booster programme to keep our defences strong over autumn and winter. ""Vaccines were our way out of this pandemic, and now they will make sure Covid can never haunt us in the same way again."" The flu vaccine in England will also be offered to all adults aged 50 and over, the usual high-risk groups and now to schoolchildren up to Year 9 in secondary school. The Covid restrictions have meant we have barely had a flu season since the pandemic started. However, the concern is this year could be the first time we face substantial waves of both viruses at the same time. Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency, said: ""Widening the eligibility for the flu vaccine will help reduce the number of people getting seriously ill and ease pressures on the NHS, particularly during the busy winter period.""

Canada gunman's partner describes night of terror,"Lisa Banfield testifies at the inquiry into Canada's worst mass shooting The common-law partner of the gunman behind Canada's worst mass shooting has said she feared for her life. Lisa Banfield, 53, testified before a joint federal and provincial inquiry looking into the April 2020 shooting. The inquiry was launched a few months after the shooting amid fierce criticism of the police response. Ms Banfield was hiding from the gunman in the woods when he began a 13-hour rampage that left 22 people dead. The inquiry has been investigating what happened when Gabriel Wortman, a 51-year-old dental technician, went on a shooting spree across some 100km (62 miles) of the Nova Scotian countryside over two days in April 2020. Public hearings began in February this year. As the first target of the gunman's violence on the initial day of the attack, 18 April, Ms Banfield's testimony helped fill in key details about the first night of the attack, as well as his state of mind in the days and weeks prior. Flanked by her two sisters, she tearfully recounted on Friday how the gunman would hit her, punch her and threaten her life. She said she did not report his illegal weapons to police because she feared for her life. She also said he had threatened to kill her family. ""He... put the gun to my head to scare me. He'd say the he could blow off my head. So I was scared,"" she said. She was severely beaten by the gunman and physically restrained the first night of the attack after an argument with him. The attack left her with bruises and fractured ribs and vertebrae. He dragged her into his decommissioned police cruiser, but she was able to escape and fled into the woods, where she hid throughout the night in the hollow of a tree, only emerging in daylight. She said that she had no idea that he intended to hurt others - she thought he only wanted to hurt her and her family. ""I often think would any of those people have died? So that is something that haunts me all the time,"" she said. Throughout the night, she heard the sounds of gunshots and saw flames coming from nearby homes. She said that at one point she wanted to check to see if people were OK, but she was ""so scared I didn't want to move"". Nova Scotia shooting: 'They had no idea the hell they were going to face' Nova Scotia gunman's first victim was girlfriend, who survived Many of the gunman's victims were people he knew. Some of them, she said, he had had disagreements with, but he had appeared friendly with some of his victims as well. They had socialised with Sean McLeod and Alanna Jenkins, who lived nearby, she said. McLeod even gave the gunman a present of some lobsters for his birthday party, because he couldn't attend himself. Families of the victims have been calling for Ms Banfield to testify, though many are frustrated that she won't face direct questions from their lawyers, a restriction put in place because she is a ""survivor of the perpetrator's violence"". Ms Banfield was with the killer for 19 years, and during that relationship he subjected her to a ""coercive control and abuse that included verbal abuse, psychological intimidation, financial control, and physical violence"", the inquiry said. Ms Banfield has cooperated with police and spoke five times with the inquiry before her public testimony, including to re-enact events on the night of 18 April. In interviews released by the inquiry this week, she describes a partner who could fly into a rage over small slights, and who twice put a gun to her head during arguments. Lisa Banfield re-enacts first night of Canada's worst shooting with police She also described the gunman as becoming ""agitated and paranoid"" in the early weeks of the Covid pandemic. Police had initially charged her and two others with unwittingly helping provide the killer with the guns and ammunition but the case was later referred to restorative justice, meaning the charge will be dropped after she completes a government programme. The move cleared her to testify to the inquiry. In recent days, the inquiry has released information documenting the gunman's history of intimidating, violent, abusive and sexually predatory behaviour. It has also documented a background of domestic abuse, one which spanned generations. The gunman's uncle described a great-grandfather as ""a tyrant who brutalised his family"" and a grandfather who was ""seriously off centre"".

"Cost of living is ruining university, students say","How are students at the University of Essex coping with the rising costs of living? With inflation at its highest rate in 30 years, people are facing rising rents, energy prices and food bills. How are students at one university coping with the rising costs of living? George Curley says he's questioning moving home to save money ""It kind of takes away any kind of experience of a university student,"" says 18-year-old George Curley, who is in his first year at the University of Essex. ""Obviously drinks [prices] are going up in pubs and bars, so I'm kind of less inclined to go out on just a normal Saturday or Sunday night."" Rising rents for halls of residence have also had him questioning whether to move home and save some money. ""It's quite a lot, and kind of questions whether you should stay in halls of residence when you can attend a zoom lecture from home,"" he says. âHow can we afford anything with bills this high?â 'I'll just have to make more sacrifices' Costs rising but finances are stagnant, says mum Having a weekend job is ""essential"" despite the fact his parents have helped him financially. ""You get your grant, you get your funds from the government and such but I think that a job is essential at the weekends as well as your studies to help you through university financially,"" he says University students have been ""robbed of the university experience"" and the rising cost of living has taken a ""huge mental toll"" on him,  he says. ""Going to university five days a week and having a job at weekends and having to save can take a toll on your mental health."" Sophia Bourne works two jobs to try and cover her expenses and have money left to save Psychology student Sophia Bourne, 18, lives at home and says she is worried about saving enough to eventually move into student housing or a flat-share. Despite saving money on rent she says there's ""still a lot of [financial] pressure"" in commuting daily to campus. ""The energy, gas, oil, that's all gone up and therefore with petrol it's a lot harder,"" she says. ""You have a lot of pressure on you to prioritise money, what you should do with it and where it should go. She works two jobs to help cover university costs and give her a little extra to save. She says: ""I don't think you can afford it [university] easily. You definitely have to work, if you want to still go out and have fun. I have two jobs so I'm definitely trying hard to earn money and save. ""It allows me to occasionally go out and buy leisure items."" She says she feels students have been forgotten about when it comes to dealing with the rising costs of living. OrdhÃ¡n Toner says worrying about how to pay bills is causing anxiety for students Ordhan Toner, 18, lives on campus and says he has found managing finances ""tricky"" on his own. ""I remember that first week of buying groceries, I was shocked, telling my mum that was so and so price... it's tricky."" He says he has noticed rising costs during his time at university, especially when it comes to essentials such as food. Next year he wants to move into a shared house but says that knowing energy and water costs are on the rise is ""anxiety provoking"". He also has a job but says more needs to be done to educate young people about the realities of living independently before they start university. ""You do need to look more forward into the future into what your financial situation is going to be,"" he says. ""I think a lot of people overlook that and you're not guaranteed to come out of university and go straight into a job, so you need to have a bit of a nest egg to come out of university.""

"Students like me are priced out of graduationA cap and gown, photos and extra tickets can cost Â£145, before factoring in hotels and travel.Wales","Jared (right) said he was ""shocked"" to find out how much his graduation would cost Like thousands of others, I went to order my cap and gown this week to celebrate graduating university. But, as the first member of my immediate family to graduate, I had no idea about the costs involved. Cap and gown hire for one day? Â£45. Official photos (which I knew mum would love)? Â£60. Extra ceremony tickets for my nans? Â£20 each. It all started to add up and felt very pricey. Cardiff University said it offered free gowns and photographs to some students. Without taking into account hotel prices or travel costs for my family to get to Cardiff from my hometown of Lichfield in Staffordshire, the day alone would cost me Â£145. 'It's just something that takes over your life' Cost of living is ruining university, students say Should students have to pay for graduation? As a fresh graduate with no stable income, I asked myself ""could I justify this cost for just one day?"" In the end, I decided to bite the bullet as I did not want to miss out on an occasion my nan Eileen described as ""such a proud day for me to share with my grandson"". It turns out, I was not alone. ""There are tonnes of students that have either struggled massively to go or just outright aren't going"" Serenity Davis, 25, is graduating from Cardiff Metropolitan University but is not going because they cannot afford it. ""I have utility bills and rent to pay each month and I'm from a low-income family so I don't get support from them, they can't afford to just come over to Cardiff for a day. ""They've got to book time off work and cover the cost of fuel to drive up here. ""I've fought tooth and nail against my health for three years to do a course and graduate, only to come to the point that it's so expensive I can't go and my family can't come."" ""You have to make graduation something that will be of value for us"" Couple Sian Billington and Rhys Churchill, both 23, have missed four graduation ceremonies between them. Having completed undergraduate and master's degrees at Bangor University, they decided not to attend any of their ceremonies due to the costs involved. Mr Churchill said he thought a lot of students found the price of graduation insulting. ""I've worked hard for four years, getting through a lot of complicated times in life and I've done it to get the qualification, not to get fancy photos or ceremony."" Miss Billington added: ""It's anti-climactic to get your degree in the post, but what they're asking us to pay for graduation is not worth what we're getting in return."" Elliot Dollner, 23, graduated from Cardiff University last year and moved back to his family home in Brighton. He has chosen not to travel back to Cardiff for graduation. ""I don't think the university have considered external costs for people travelling back to Cardiff for graduation. ""Hotel prices are double, sometimes triple, the usual cost for a weekend in Cardiff and the cost of fuel now when travelling a long distance is enough to deter anyone."" Olivia said the cost of her cap and gown was reasonable, but hotel costs proved too much Olivia Morgan, 21, graduated from the University of South Wales last year and attended her graduation ceremony in April. ""I looked to stay at the hotel where my graduation was being held for the night. ""It was on a week day, which is usually less expensive, but they had bumped the price right up."" Despite many students complaining about the costs of graduation, some universities have been praised for their affordable ceremonies. Emma Blackmore, 22, finished her English degree at the University of Exeter in 2021. Now working towards a masters at Cardiff University, she did not have to pay for her undergraduate graduation. ""We also had the opportunity to wear the robes around campus and we were encouraged to take photos free of charge. It was a nice touch."" Newcastle University also provided cap and gowns free of charge for their 2021 graduates. Emma Blackmore felt her graduation at the University of Exeter was incredibly organised Cardiff University said it recognised the current financial situation was difficult for some but was not aware of any graduate who indicated that they were unable to attend graduation because of cost. A spokesman added that it offered a free gowns and photographs package to students who had been supported as care leavers, estranged students, young adult carers, forces veterans or asylum seekers. The University of South Wales also offered funding for care leavers, while Aberystwyth University encouraged students to apply for an award from its university hardship fund. Swansea, Wrexham, Bangor and Cardiff Metropolitan universities have no such support packages on offer but Cardiff Metropolitan said it had encouraged students to contact its student services finance team for support. National Union of Students Wales said it was ""unfair"" students were being priced out and were making ""increasingly tough choices"" because of the cost of living crisis.Â It also called for universities to ""do what they can"" to make graduations more affordable so students did not miss the opportunity to celebrate their achievements with family and friends.Â 'It's just something that takes over your life' Cost of living is ruining university, students say Should students have to pay for graduation?

Avoid heatwave deaths by staying safe - health boss,"This video can not be played Watch: 'Water, shade and cover' to mitigate heatwave - Barclay Extra measures are being put in place for ambulance services as the UK heatwave approaches, says Health Secretary Steve Barclay. More call handlers and extra capacity for the 111 helpline are among the steps planned for Monday and Tuesday. He urged the public to look out for vulnerable relatives and neighbours. A national emergency has been declared, and the UK's first red extreme heat warning issued, with temperatures possibly reaching 41C (106F). That would be the highest temperature ever recorded in the UK - above the current high of 38.7C in Cambridge in 2019. Mr Barclay said: ""The clear message to the public is to take sensible steps in terms of water, shade and cover. That's the best way of mitigating against the heat. ""We're asking people to keep an eye out for their neighbours and those who may be vulnerable."" On Saturday, temperatures reached 29.1C in Kew Gardens in west London, and Heathrow Airport, with highs of 31C expected in central England on Sunday. In east Kent, hundreds of people were left with either no water or low pressure on Saturday after apower failure on Friday evening. NI high temperature could be topped Hot weather in Wales hits Covid jab clinics and rail travel Scotland heat warning could be extended - minister The extra support for health services also includes extra ambulance capacity, and freeing up space in hospitals so patients are not stuck in ambulances outside, said Mr Barclay. NHS leaders have warned there could be greater demand for ambulances - and said patientsshould not be leftoutside hospitals in hot weather for more than 30 minutes. The new health secretary was speaking after an emergency Cobra meeting held by the government on Saturday. Cabinet Office Minister Kit Malthouse, who chaired it, warned of significant disruption to transport and urged people not to travel unless necessary. ""The heat will affect rails, for example, so the trains have to run slower,"" he said, adding: ""If they don't have to travel, this may be a moment to work from home."" Schools are being given help and guidance to enable them to stay open, Mr Malthouse said. Meanwhile, Labour criticised the prime minister after he reportedly did not attend the meeting. ""Boris Johnson has gone missing in action again,"" said deputy leader Angela Rayner. ""He's back to his old tricks of skipping important Cobra meetings."" The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) told people to take simple steps to stay safe. ""In these exceptionally high temperatures everybody can be affected,"" said Prof Isabel Oliver, its chief scientific officer. ""Last year we didn't reach temperatures anywhere near the ones that are predicted for next week, [and] we saw over 1,600 excess deaths associated with the period of heatwave. So this is why we are keen that everybody knows what they can do to stay safe."" The Met Office red warning - the highest level - is for extreme heat and covers an area including London, Manchester and York on Monday and Tuesday. It is the first time it has been issued since the warning system for heat started last year. Rail passengers in England and Waleshave been warned they should only travel if necessary, and Network Rail said speed restrictions were likely. Some schoolswill also close early next weekandsome hospital appointmentswill be cancelled. The rest of England,Walesand southern Scotland will be under an amber warning for extreme heat - while in Europe, deadly wildfireshave broken out in Portugal, Spain and southwestern France. Train tracks are being painted white in some parts of the country to deflect the heat BBC Weather forecaster Susan Powell said the situation was unprecedented. She said there was an 80% chance the UK would break its current highest temperature record. Temperatures could reach as high as 41C in England on Monday, with 38C quite widely across England and Wales. Tuesday is set to see highs of 40C, or above, in eastern England. Northern Ireland and Scotland could also see their temperature records broken, she said. And on top of that, the temperature overnight on Monday into Tuesday could also hit a new peak - with highs of 25C expected. ""The problem is we have a 48 to 72-hour period where people who are vulnerable have no cooling-off period,"" she said. This video can not be played Susan Powell looks at the high temperatures expected by day and night As well as the Met Office warning, the UKHSA has issued its highest level four heat alert to health and care bodies - warning illness and death could occur ""among the fit and healthy"". Most deaths during a heatwave are usually heart attacks or strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable. By Katharine Da Costa, BBC News health reporter Exposure to extreme temperatures can be fatal. An unprecedented three-week heatwave in northern France in August 2003 resulted in 15,000 excess deaths - those are deaths from all causes that occur above and beyond those expected under ""normal"" conditions. The vast majority of the deaths were among older people, aged 65 and above. In England during the same period, there were more than 2,000 excess deaths, compared to the previous five years. The rise in mortality due to hot weather can happen very quickly, usually within the first couple of days of the temperature rising. So the Met Office red heat warning and the UK Health Security Agency's level four health alert are like warning klaxons for the government, health service and individuals to make necessary preparations now in order to mitigate the risks. Experts say that climate change is making heatwaves more likely as well as more intense and lasting longer. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the latter half of the 18th century, and experts predict that temperatures will keep rising unless governments make steep cuts to emissions. 'I've put ice under my hat' - keeping cool at work What does hot weather do to the body? 10 tips for sleeping in hot weather The hot weather is an ""extra burden"" for care homes, said Mike Padgham, the chair of the Independent Care Group which represents care providers. Carers will make sure curtains are drawn, move residents to cooler areas of the home, use water sprays and ensure everyone stays hydrated, he said. A Queen's Life Guard soldier helping a Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horse stay cool earlier this week in London There is concern that the hot weather might also lead to more people getting into difficulty while swimming - aftera teenage boy died after getting into the waterat a quarry in Lancashire last week. The Canal and River Trust has launched a safety campaign, asking people not to jump into locks or off bridges. She said the water may be shallower or deeper than expected or there could be weeds and plants that can tangle around people's limbs. Meanwhile,firefighters are urging peopleto swap barbeques for picnics, in a bid to avoid triggering wildfires. How are you coping in the heat? Share your experienceshaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

'I've got ice in my hat': Keeping cool at work,"A couple seen working on their laptops under the shade on a hot and sunny day London Across the UK and elsewhere in Europe people are definitely feeling the heat. But while many of us have the option to seek cover in the shade, others are tasked with spending their working week under the glare of the sun, leading to some innovative ways of keeping cool. At the Tower of London, Yeoman Warder Spike Abbott is fully prepared for the hordes of tourists still wanting guided tours in the heat. ""Our uniform is from the Tudor period, and the Tudors would not have anticipated operating in temperatures like today. I think it is 32C in central London. ""As soon as you put on a Tudor bonnet the heat builds because the hat is quite heavy and insulated. Then you're wearing dark trousers and formal shoes. That's why I put a small ice block under my hat during tours. ""I use a small ice block that you put in a freezer and into your lunch box. They fit perfectly into the hat. But I don't do a full tour with it because it's not particularly safe to have an ice block sitting on top of your head. ""Between tours I take the ice block out and then if you've got it in your hand and put it around your face and that it certainly helps if you're holding something that's cold. ""We have picked this up from many previous Yeoman Warders that have done this. It worked today anyway."" Stephen Barnes has looked after bees for 23 years. There's only one way to avoid bee stings - cover up. ""My father was a beekeeper, and he showed me how to care for them as a teenager, but I wasn't interested. But he must have had a long-term plan, because now I'm hooked, and I look after 40 colonies dotted over Cumbria. ""Beekeeping requires a thick suit to limit the risk of being stung. In this weather, wearing a thick suit is far from ideal. During visits at the moment, I press a damp towel to my neck and I have bought a ventilated suit. ""The suits are a new invention. They started appearing on the market last year in places like India, so I prepared myself and bought one at the start of this season. ""It's made up of three layers. The outer has the vents, then there's a thin membrane of material in the middle, with a third layer that wicks the moisture out, then the bees can't get their stings through. ""I've found there has to be a slight breeze for it to work, which has been a bit challenging at the moment.  If there's no air, you get pretty warm and sweaty. ""I'll take on the heat if it means I can look after the bees."" Performing in a costume holding a puppet panda is hot work but Luke Ansley and his colleagues at Chessington World of Adventures have found a way to face it. ""We perform to up to 600 people in an outdoor arena where the actors wear full body suits, capes, masks and wigs, and some have puppets. Shows are really high energy, with lots of dancing and stage combat, with the characters weaving in and out of the audience. ""The shows range from 15 to 25 minutes, so we're not onstage for too long, but it does get pretty boiling. ""A couple of years ago I had the idea that we should install some paddling pools for the actors to jump into after the show. We can take our costumes off and climb into the pool, and it is an instant relief. ""Luckily for the kids, we have a character that sprays a water pistol around the audience. They love it, and in weather like this, it has the added bonus of keeping them cool.""

'It's just something that takes over your life',"Saeda Dahab decided to find herself a job to help her mother with the rising costs Saeda Dahab is among the young people who say the cost of living crisis has made them anxious about their future. Universities have seen many students reporting mental health or anxiety issues caused by financial pressures. The government has said that support is available to those who need extra help and more is being done. But Seada, 16, from Southampton, said it has become harder to think about the future while ""stressing about the present"". She said the rising costs were a worry for children as much as for parents. A few months ago she decided to find herself a job to help her mother, who is a single parent, cope with the rising bills. ""It feels quite stressful because you are going through a time in your life when you are learning and planning for your future but at the same time the present is quite hard,"" she said. ""I feel like it's just something that takes over your life... and makes you lose that motivation that you should have."" In a bid to save money, she has also recently started to go out with her friends once a month instead of once a week. Describing the impact, she said: ""At times you feel like you are lonely and isolated because there's no point in having friends if you are not able to hang out with them."" The St Anne's Catholic School pupil would like to go to university but she said she might have no choice but to do an apprenticeship instead. Angelica Kanu is worried about the rising cost of food University students like 19-year-old Angelica Kanu, who studies chemistry at the University of Oxford, are among those who say the current situation has caused them stress. She has recently been told she does not qualify for any extra financial support despite being from a working class family that cannot help her financially. The cost of food has become a worry for her in the past few months. ""Every single day is just a battle of being as cheap as possible,"" she said. ""It's just like a constant circle, when in reality I should be focussing on my uni work. I just feel like money just takes too much of a toll on how I am living my life at university."" Vaios Koukouletsos, the president of the students' union at Solent University in Southampton, said more students have recently been asking for information about food banks and food vouchers. The number of students at the University of Reading applying for hardship funds has also gone up, with 305 of 484 applications being successful so far in the current academic year. This is an increase from before the pandemic when 124 and 156 applications were made in 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively. Jade Calder will work for the students' union for a year, but she said she might have to move to a more affordable city in the future Matt Daley, the university's head of student financial support and customer service, said almost every application described mental health or anxiety issues caused by financial struggles. Many also stated they were unable to get support from their families. ""There's a lot of anxiety about being able to afford things,"" Mr Daley said. ""My main concern is that students won't complete their studies. We don't want them to leave because of money."" Students who need help with their finances have access to a number of services, including: Student loans,external, which can be taken out in two parts - for tuition fees (the amount used to pay the university) and a maintenance loan (for living costs) Advice and hardship funds are available at several universities There are additional funds for those who needextra financial help,externalas well as for students with children or dependent adults and students with disabilities Students can also accessgovernment funds,externaldesigned to support residents struggling with the cost of living crisis The rising costs are also a concern for those who are about to graduate. Jade Calder, a history student at the University of Oxford, will graduate next month and has said the cost of living crisis makes her wonder if she will be able to access the right career opportunities in the future. Her family is not be able to support her financially. ""How am I supposed to be optimistic about the future when I know it is going to be difficult?"", she said. ""It is not a good time to be a young person in this country, trying to have a career."" Bianca Capatina started university in 2020 Bianca Capatina, 20, a journalism student at Solent University in Southampton, also said that rising costs and the thought of the future had caused her anxiety. ""It's stressing me out, just the thought of what will happen after university with prices escalating,"" she said. A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) said no student should have to worry unduly about their financial situation while they are focusing on their studies. ""We have asked the Office for Students to protect the Â£256m available to support disadvantaged students and those who need additional help - which is in addition to universities' own hardship funds,"" the spokesperson added. Maximum grants and loans for living costs are set to increase by a further 2.3% next year, while maximum tuition fees are expected to be frozen for the next three years, according to the DfE.
