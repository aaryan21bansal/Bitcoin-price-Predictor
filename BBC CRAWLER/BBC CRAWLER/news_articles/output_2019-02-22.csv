Clashes as Venezuela aid row intensifies,"President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has closed Venezuela's border with Brazil At least two people have been killed and several others injured in clashes near Venezuela's border with Brazil, local media report. Venezuelan security forces opened fire on a group of civilians who tried to prevent them from blocking the border. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has closed the country's border with Brazil amid a row over the delivery of humanitarian aid. The incident came as thousands attended two rival concerts on either side of a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³, who declared himself interim leader last month, attended the Colombian concert along with several Latin American leaders. The clashes occurred when members of the community confronted Venezuelan troops on Friday morning in the southern Venezuelan town of Kumarakapay, AFP news agency reports.

Troops then opened fire on individuals who tried to block a road with the aim of preventing military vehicles from passing, witnesses said. A local woman and her husband were killed (in Spanish),external, according to the human rights group KapÃ© KapÃ©. An ambulance at the scene where deadly clashes erupted in southern Venezuela Venezuela is in the grip of a political and economic crisis. The country's inflation rate has seen prices soar, leaving many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food, toiletries and medicine. Around 2.7 million people have fled the country since 2015. Mr GuaidÃ³ says a lack of basic items has left thousands of others at risk of dying. Humanitarian aid for Venezuela has been arriving at the borders of neighbouring Colombia and Brazil. This video can not be played Venezuelan lawmakers also clashed with soldiers on Thursday Mr GuaidÃ³ and his allies hope to collect the relief gathered there on Saturday, in defiance of President Maduro, who denies any crisis and calls the aid plans a US-orchestrated show. President Maduro has said he could also shut the border with Colombia to stop the opposition bringing in aid. The concerts, being held just 300m (980ft) apart, represent two opposing sides of a power struggle between President Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³, who is recognised as the country's interim leader by dozens of countries, including the US and most Latin American nations. Thousands gathered for the Venezuela Aid Live concert near the Colombian city of CÃºcuta One of the concerts, Venezuela Aid Live, was organised by British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who said Mr GuaidÃ³ had asked him to set it up. It was held near the Tienditas bridge crossing on the Colombian side of the border at CÃºcuta.  Organisers invited 32 artists including Latin stars Rudy Mancuso, Juanes and Despacito singer Luis Fonsi, and Swedish DJ Alesso. A few celebrities - including Venezuelan-American singer and actress Lele Pons and Venezuelan singer Danny Ocean - and politicians took part. Among them were the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay, along with Mr GuaidÃ³ who defied a travel ban by President Maduro. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, Colombian President Ivan Duque, Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido and Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez all attended the Venezuela Live Aid concert. ""This concert is a humanitarian concert; every country, all people in the world want freedom,"" Mr Branson said. ""Anybody that does anything for the right reasons is always going to get criticism. The positive thing is that 99% of people around the world are embracing what is going on here today."" YouTube, Bing and Google services were all temporarily blocked in Venezuela during the Live Aid concert, according to Netblocks - a non-governmental organization that tracks internet blackouts. Following news of the event, President Maduro promised to hold a rival concert on the Venezuelan side of the bridge - a three-day festival which has been dubbed Hands Off Venezuela. The government still has not announced an official line-up for Hands Off Venezuela, but unconfirmed reports claim that about 150 artists are taking part. Richard Branson's concert is happening on the Colombian side of the border While Mr Maduro's is happening not far away on the Venezuelan side Brazil, which recognizes Mr GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's legitimate leader, had previously vowed to make humanitarian aid available in the Brazilian city of Pacaraima, to be collected by opposition supporters.

There are already planes and lorries carrying tonnes of US aid parked on the Colombian side of the Tienditas bridge, and President Maduro has refused to allow it into Venezuela, saying it is part of a ploy by the US to invade the country. Despite denying that there is a humanitarian crisis at all, President Maduro reportedly received a shipment of aid from Russia earlier this week, according to Russian state media. Moscow has accused Washington of using aid as a ""convenient pretext for conducting military action."" According to RIA Novosti, Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told reporters that ""in preparation for the provocation"", America was deploying ""special forces and equipment near Venezuelan territory."" It is not yet clear. Mr GuaidÃ³ has said he plans to get aid into the country on Saturday by urging Venezuelans to mobilise en masse and form ""caravans"" and a ""humanitarian avalanche"" at the borders. Venezuela closes border with Brazil GuaidÃ³ sets up Venezuela aid confrontation But even with this effort, it is uncertain whether or not aid will be allowed in. A spokesman for Mr Branson told the BBC that he was working with the Colombian entrepreneur Bruno Ocampo to organise the concert and sort out the logistics while Mr Ocampo said the details ""remain confidential"".

"Fury at late-night police parking queryAn officer woke a woman at night to talk about her previous bad parking.Beds, Herts & Bucks","Sarah Lester, pictured with daughter Claire Mason, was worried something had happened to one of her two grown-up children A woman said she was given ""the fright of my life"" when a ""vindictive"" police officer knocked on her door at night over her bad parking the previous day. Sarah Lester, who lives alone, feared the worst for her family when police turned up at her house in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, at 01:30 GMT. She agreed she had parked badly earlier but was yet to receive a justification for the officer's early-hours visit. Hertfordshire Police said Ms Lester's complaint was being investigated. ""I live alone and I didn't want to open the door,"" said Ms Lester, who was woken by the doorbell and her dog barking. ""I called 999 and they said 'it's a police car outside and you need to open the door'. ""I almost passed out, I thought something terrible had happened to one of my children; it was horrendous, I just froze."" The officer explained he wanted to talk about how she had parked her car in Bushey on 8 February, the previous evening. She admitted her car had been parked partly on a pavement for just under two hours but it had been in her driveway since 22:30 GMT. ""I said, 'I've nearly had a heart attack, why didn't you put a ticket on the car or something in the post?', and he said, 'I've chosen to deal with it in this way'."" Sarah Lester's car (not pictured) had been parked in School Lane, Bushey, the previous evening Ms Lester complained to police when the officer left but said she was yet to receive an apology or explanation. ""I  feel it was vindictive - surely they can't do this,"" she added ""I haven't had a ticket, just this trauma from them."" A police spokesman said the Professional Standards Department was dealing with the complaint, the officer would be spoken to and Ms Lester would be updated ""in due course"". ""Due to the pending investigation it would be inappropriate for us to comment any further at this stage,"" he added.

Dozens of Tories 'could rebel over no-deal',"Dozens of normally loyal Conservative MPs could rebel against the government in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit, Downing Street has been warned. Leaders of the Brexit Delivery group of MPs, comprising Leavers and Remainers, say up to 30 may back alternatives if the PM's reworked deal isn't voted on. No 10 says talks aimed at getting the changes MPs demand continue ""at pace"". Meanwhile, John McDonnell has suggested Labour is ""moving towards"" backing another Brexit referendum. The shadow chancellortold the Evening Standard,externalhe was warming to the idea of MPs backing a Commons amendment which would approve the Brexit deal but only if it was put to the public in another vote. Theresa May's efforts to win round European leaders will continue at a summit in Egypt over the weekend. Her spokeswoman said the PM would have another ""period of engagement"" on Brexit at an EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm el-Sheikh - including a meeting with European Council president Donald Tusk. But a senior EU official said there would be ""no deal in the desert"", since not all the 27 other EU leaders would be present and the issue required proper preparation. A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame May reaches out to Remainer rebels Threat of no-deal Brexit 'focusing minds' The UK remains on course to leave the European Union on 29 March. But the government has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the UK leaving without a formal deal, in the event that Mrs May cannot get MPs to approve the deal she negotiated with Brussels in time. On Friday, theIrish government published a wide range of emergency measuresto support businesses, protect jobs and essential services that will be enacted if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says ERG members are ""absolutely desperate for a deal, but weâre desperate for the right deal"". Many MPs fear that scenario would be damaging to business and cause chaos at ports. Growing concerns over the prospect of a no-deal exit are set to come to a head next Wednesday when MPs debate Brexit again and, if the UK and EU haven't agreed a deal by then, will vote on future options. The Brexit Delivery Group (BDG) says ""numerous"" Tory MPs are prepared to back an amendment tabled by former minister Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour's Yvette Cooper to give Parliament the opportunity to delay Brexit and prevent a no-deal situation if there is no agreement with the EU by the middle of March. It has been reported that a handful of ministers, including potentially some in the cabinet, could also back the amendment, in what would be a direct challenge to the prime minister's authority. TheBBC's Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Wattsaid a number ""were saying in private they would be prepared to lose their jobs"" to be able to support the amendment. BDG co-chairman Andrew Percy told the BBC that members of his group were becoming ""tired"" of the rival European Research Group faction's refusal to back the prime minister. The ERG of Brexiteers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker, insist the ""no-deal"" option must be preserved as negotiating leverage in Brussels and declined to back the PM in a non-binding vote on the issue recently. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. In a letter to government whips, Mr Percy and his co-chairman Simon Hart write: ""Not only does this risk damaging the national interest, but also... we are putting in jeopardy the very thing many colleagues have spent decades campaigning for; our exit from the European Union."" They believe the main sticking point - MPs' demands for changes to the backstop, the ""insurance policy"" to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border - will be secured. However, they fear it might not be enough to win over some Brexiteers. One ERG member, Nadine Dorries, insisted the group was not ""holding the government to ransom"", telling the BBC's Politics Live that all but one member was ""desperate for a deal"". On Thursday, Mrs May held meetings with senior ministers who have expressed concerns about the impact of a no-deal scenario on business and also leading Remainers in her party, such as Justine Greening and Phillip Lee. The duo have been touted as potential defectors to the newly formed Independent Group of ex-Tory and Labour MPs, which is calling for another EU referendum in return for supporting the PM. This video can not be played Brexit: Can Remainers and Leavers come together? This video can not be played BBC Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth explains what we know so far about The Independent Group Mr Lee told the BBC that although he was staying in his party, there were ""worrying"" signs of a ""populist"" shift in direction and it was time for Mrs May to ""face down"" the ERG. ""There are elements of that group that do not reflect the Conservatism that I joined in 1992 and it's about time that we dealt with it,"" he told Radio 4's Today. The government has described the latest talks in Brussels involving Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier as ""productive"". It says they will move to a ""technical level"", with Mr Barclay and Mr Cox meeting Mr Barnier again early next week.

'MI6 conman' fugitive extradited to UK,"Mark Acklom was placed on a plane in Geneva and was escorted through Bristol Airport One of Britain's most wanted fugitives has been extradited to the UK from Switzerland after being on the run in Europe for years. Mark Acklom, who disappeared in 2012, allegedly posed as an MI6 agent to con a Gloucestershire woman out of her Â£850,000 life savings. The 45-year-old was arrested at a luxury apartment in Zurich last summer. He will appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court on Saturday charged with 20 fraud offences. They include 12 charges of converting or removing criminal property and eight charges of fraud by false representation. Mr Acklom allegedly posed as an MI6 agent and Swiss banker and conned divorcee Carolyn Woods into loaning him the money during a year-long relationship in Bath in 2012. Three years ago a European Arrest Warrant was issued for Mr Acklom who was believed to be in Spain having been released from a Spanish prison over a Â£200,000 property fraud. Carolyn Woods had a year-long relationship with Mark Acklom during which time she said she loaned him thousands of pounds In October 2016 he was among 10 British fugitives named by the National Crime Agency (NCA) as the most wanted in Spain. Chief Insp Gary Haskins, from Avon and Somerset Police, said:  ""No matter where suspected criminals are in the world we will always do everything we can to track them down and bring them back to the UK to face justice. ""This extradition would not have been possible without the support of all our law enforcement partners and I'm extremely grateful for their assistance in helping us bring Acklom home to answer some very serious charges."" Mr Acklom was escorted back to Bristol Airport from Geneva earlier and is currently in police custody.

Men rescue 'dog' from ice - but find wolf,"The ""dog"" was treated by vets at an animal clinic Kind-hearted Estonian workers rushed to rescue a dog in distress from a freezing river on Wednesday - unaware of the fact they were actually about to bundle a wild wolf into their car. The men were working on the Sindi dam on the Parnu river when they spotted the animal trapped in the icy water. After clearing a path through the ice, they took the frozen canine to a clinic for medical care. Only then was it revealed they had been carrying a wolf. The wolf was covered in ice when pulled from the near-frozen water The Estonian Union for the Protection of Animals (EUPA) said the wolf had low blood pressure when it arrived at the veterinarian's office, which may have explained its docile nature after the men carried it to their car to warm it up. Speaking to the Estonian newspaper Postimees, one of the men,external, Rando Kartsepp, said: ""We had to carry him over the slope. He weighed a fair bit."" ""He was calm, slept on my legs. When I wanted to stretch them, he raised his head for a moment,"" he added. Veterinarians had some suspicions over the large dog's true nature, but it was a local hunter, familiar with the region's wolves, who finally confirmed it for what it was: a young male wolf, about a year old. ""He was calm, slept on my legs,"" Mr Kartsepp said of the journey to the vet's office Armed with this new information, clinic staff decided to put the wolf in a cage after treatment - in case it became less docile once it recovered. The EUPA said it paid for the animal's treatment, and that ""luckily, everything turned out well"". EU moves to protect big beasts Danes tag first wolf pack in 200 years France to let wolf population grow The wolf recovered from its brush with death within the day and, after being fitted with a GPS collar by researchers from the national environmental agency, was released back into the wild. ""We are so happy for the outcome of the story, and wish to thank all the participants â especially these men who rescued the wolf and the doctors of the clinic who were not afraid to treat and nurture the wild animal,"" EUPA said. Estonia is home to hundreds of wolves, only a handful of which have been collared in recent years. As a species, they usually avoid humans.

Emergency Irish plan for no-deal Brexit,"This video can not be played Simon Coveney said he hoped the legislation ""proves redundant"" The Irish deputy prime minister has said he hopes that major legislation his government has prepared to manage a no-deal Brexit will never be used. Simon Coveney unveiled the wide-ranging bill on Friday, bringing together work by nine government departments. He said a ""disorderly"" Brexit would be a ""lose, lose, lose"" for the UK, the EU and the Republic of Ireland. His aim for the emergency proposals is to ensure a smooth transition should the UK leave the EU without a deal. Ireland and the EU: A special case What does Ireland do if there's no deal? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The legislation,externalis designed to support businesses and to protect jobs, essential services and citizens' rights. It is envisaged that it will be fast-tracked through the Irish parliament and be signed into law before 29 March, when the UK is due to leave the EU. Mr Coveney said he hoped it ""proves redundant"" and his ""only desire"" was to see it sit ""on the shelf"". ""A no-deal Brexit will be a major shock for the Irish economy,"" he added. Dublin Port has been preparing for a no-deal Brexit scenario A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame May reaches out to Remainer rebels Threat of no-deal Brexit 'focusing minds' ""We cannot offset all the damage it will do, but we are doing everything we can. ""This legislation is the product of a root-and-branch trawl of our laws to determine what changes will be needed if the UK becomes a third country overnight."" The 70-page bill is one of the most elaborate pieces of legislation ever brought forward by an Irish government. But the complexities of Brexit mean that Dublin hopes the hard work will go to waste. Simon Coveney says he still believes there will be a deal between the UK and the EU, but Ireland must be as prepared as possible for the other scenario. The legislation covers matters under the remit of nine ministers - a big range of topics, from energy to extraditions. However, the most tricky issue of all - the future of the land border with Northern Ireland - doesn't feature. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said his government was doing ""all we can to avoid a no deal scenario but we need to be ready in case it does happen"". ""This special law enables us to mitigate against some of the worst effects of no deal by protecting citizens' rights, security and facilitating extra supports for vulnerable businesses and employers,"" he added. Some of the main provisions of the legislation are: Justice - maintaining existing extradition arrangements Health - allowing citizens to be able to continue access services in the other jurisdiction Social welfare - enabling pensions and other benefits to continue to be paid Energy - giving the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities the powers to deal with unusual market activity on the all-Ireland electricity network Transport - allowing cross-border rail and bus services to continue The opposition parties in the Republic of Ireland are to be briefed on the measures, as their support may be necessary to get the bill passed. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said that the absence of a plan for customs checkpoints at the Irish border - ""the sort of border infrastructure that some in Dublin and Brussels have been having nightmares about"" - was proof that there was ""no need for the type of borders we knew"" during the Northern Ireland Troubles. ""No-one is building a so-called hard border or going back to checkpoints with soldiers,"" added the East Antrim politician. ""Such talk was rhetoric designed to ferment fear in genuine communities along both sides of the border."" How is Dublin preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit?

Lonely PM nears Brexit endgame,"Theresa May is a reserved figure who rarely betrays any emotions and certainly never likes to show any signs of weakness. But the defection of Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen - three Conservative MPs from the One Nation wing of the party - may have struck a chord. The prime minister wrote to the trio on Thursday, expressing sadness at their decision - although she did challenge their attack on her leadership. Mrs May also called in two of the trio's political soulmates, the former ministers Justine Greening and Phillip Lee, for lengthy discussions at Number 10. Lee, who was once one of the PM's closest friends at Westminster, had not spoken to her since he resigned as a justice minister in July in protest at her handling of Brexit. Over the last 24 hours, he received texts from the party chairman Brandon Lewis and the chief whip Julian Smith. And then there was the invitation for a 45-minute chat with the prime minister at Number 10 to discuss Brexit and much else beyond. ""Something has happened,"" one source close to Lee says. ""They must be worried."" The odd sign of prime ministerial nerves is explained by the potentially painful challenge facing Mrs May next week. MPs are guaranteed a fresh Brexit vote next Wednesday. If she is unable to satisfy the likes of Mr Lee and Ms Greening, who are determined to rule out a no-deal Brexit, Mrs May could find her hand is forced by Parliament. Before being invited to Number 10 on Thursday, Justine Greening complained multiple requests for meetings had been ignored Former Conservative cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin is understood to be confident that, in such circumstances, he would win a vote on a cross-party amendment that could extend Article 50. The amendment, drawn up with the former Labour cabinet minister Yvette Cooper, would seek to force the PM to avoid a no-deal Brexit by setting aside time for a Parliamentary bill. If she fails to reach a deal with the EU by the middle of March, the bill would oblige the prime minister to: Put a motion before parliament proposing a no-deal exit on 29 March. That is designed to present a stark choice which would be rejected by MPs, Mr Letwin hopes. Or put down a motion proposing an extension to Article 50. A number of ministers are saying in private they would be prepared to lose their jobs to be able to support the Cooper-Letwin amendment. Other ministers believe that, in the end, an insufficient number of their colleagues would resign to allow the amendment to pass. The prime minister is taking no chances and is working hard to secure a revised deal with the EU by next Tuesday, the eve of vote. She met European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Wednesday and will talk to EU leaders in the margins of an EU-Arab League summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday and Monday. Downing Street is looking for changes to Mrs May's Brexit deal on two levels: An assurance, possibly in the form of a legal codicil attached to the withdrawal agreement, that the Northern Ireland backstop would never be permanent. The backstop is designed to avoid the return of physical infrastructure on the Irish border by aligning Northern Ireland closely to the EU in the event of a failure to agree a future UK-EU relationship by the end of the planned transition period. A guarantee in the political declaration, which sets out the framework for the future relationship, that ""alternative arrangements"" - new technology - would be at the heart of the future relationship. This would avoid the need for a ""hard border"". The EU is keen to help but has two concerns. It will not offer any legal guarantees that undermine the withdrawal agreement, and it fears that it could make concessions that are then rejected by MPs. One cabinet minister told me they are confident that the prime minister will secure a deal in time for her to upgrade next week's parliamentary vote to a legally binding ""meaningful"" vote. Another minister tells me: ""There will be a deal... by 29 March. The EU always goes to the line."" But then the minister added: ""Never underestimate the ability of this prime minister to muck things up."" The pointed remarks show that as Brexit nears the endgame, this lonely prime minister struggles to command loyalty even among her ministers.

Judge lifts ban on naming Alesha killer,"This video can not be played Aaron Campbell is facing a life sentence The identity of the teenage boy who raped and murdered six-year-old Alesha MacPhail has been revealed. The judge who presided over the trial has lifted a ban on naming 16-year-old Aaron Campbell. Media outlets, including the BBC, made a case for reversing the court order which had protected his identity because he was under the age of 18. Judge Lord Matthews said: ""I can't think of a case in recent times that has attracted such revulsion."" After hearing the legal arguments on Friday, he said: ""I intend to grant the application. The press may name the accused and publish images of him."" Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' Campbell is facing a life sentence after being found guilty of killing Alesha, who went missing while on a visit to her grandparents on the Isle of Bute on 2 July last year. Alesha MacPhail had been on a holiday on the Isle of Bute On Thursday, Lord Matthews said he had committed some of the ""wickedest, most evil crimes this court has ever heard"". Campbell took Alesha from the bed where she was sleeping and inflicted ""catastrophic"" injuries before dumping her naked body in woodland. Alesha had suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. Aaron Campbell has been named as Alesha MacPhail's killer Like the six-year-old he brutally murdered, Aaron Campbell wanted to be a YouTube star. He posted videos of himself in 2017 showing off his parkour skills on a trampoline. During the trial, jurors watched a different kind of video - CCTV of Campbell carrying a mystery object - believed to be Alesha - near the shoreline at Rothesay on the night she vanished. Another video - recorded by his own mother - showed Campbell coming and going from their home in the early hours of the morning, removing items of clothing and retrieving a torch. The court heard Campbell lifted weights and could bench press 50kg - more than double the 22kg Alesha weighed. CCTV showed Campbell leaving his house with a torch the morning Alesha was found dead Hours before Alesha was killed, the boy had hosted a party for his friends after which he was in a drunk and distressed state. To calm himself down he tried to buy cannabis from Alesha's father Robert MacPhail, as he had done in the past. During the investigation, forensic experts found a Google search on his phone asking ""How do police find DNA?"" The teenager's friends told the court he had a ""dark sense of humour"" and had once told a female friend he might kill one day for the ""lifetime experience"". After Alesha's body was discovered, he produced a selfie-style video in which he revealed his reflection in a mirror with a caption: ""Found the guy who done it."" On Friday, Tony Graham QC, the lawyer representing several news organisations, told the High Court in Glasgow that it would be ""naive"" to think the teenager's identity was not already known among members of the Bute community and at Polmont Young Offenders Institute. He said the name of the boy had been on Facebook and Twitter, and had been available via a Google search since last July. The QC said the attempt to have the restriction lifted was a balancing act of the age, vulnerability and rights of the murderer, and the potential collateral damage to his family, against the public interest due to the nature of his crimes and the nature of his defence. That defence included a failed attempt to incriminate Toni McLachlan, the 19-year-old teenage girlfriend of Alesha McPhail's father, for the crimes. Brian McConnachie QC, representing Campbell, said the fact that Campbell had incriminated another person was no reason to identify him. He said: ""To make an order on the basis that Toni Louise McLachlan was incriminated would simply be tit-for-tat and nothing more than that."" He also argued that the existence of information on social media was not a reason to overrule the prohibition. He added: ""It's little argument to say, well, it's going to happen [his identification] when he's 18 anyway."" Mr McConnachie also told Lord Matthews that his client had been warned there was a ""price on his head"" and that publishing his name could exacerbate the situation as it would increase the number of people aware of his identity. He said: ""It is also important to identify at this stage that there is a history, so far as the accused is concerned, of self harm."" He said Campbell had a history of anxiety and depression and he had been previously tested for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Mr McConnachie was asked if he intended to appeal the decision. He told the judge: ""I am instructed not to appeal."" Alesha's family, including her mother Georgina Lochrane and father Robert MacPhail, were in court to hear the decision. Campbell was back in the dock 24 hours after being convicted. He again showed no emotion as he was led back to the cells. Alesha's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel From his arrest to conviction, Aaron Campbell could not be named - and this would have continued until his 18th birthday next year if Lord Matthews had not lifted the order. Any violation would have been considered a breach of the law and could result in a fine or jail term. In Scotland, it is rare for this restriction to be lifted. The media were given permission to name an underage victim in the Andrew Morton airgun shooting case in 2005 but in other cases applications were refused, including a torture attack on a 14-year-old girl at a shopping centre in Edinburgh. It has happened more often in England. Recent cases include 15-year-old William Cornick who stabbed a teacher to death in 2014 and Kim Edwards and her boyfriend, Lucas Markham, who were both 15 when they convicted of killing Edwards' mother and sister in 2016. Will today's decision set a precedent for future cases in Scotland? Not necessarily. It will be setting a precedent but a judge in any future case is entitled to take a different view. And cases such as Alesha MacPhail's are thankfully rare. Media law lecturer Frank Shennan had earlier told BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme there had been a sense of anger at the killer being ""protected"". He said: ""The reason for not naming under-18s is to protect what is seen as vulnerable people. ""And the reason for applying to have the ban lifted is a sense of outrage that somebody should be able to hide behind this protection when they have been found guilty of committing such a shocking crime. ""Ironically until three years ago, we could have named him because the rule applied to under 16s only and it was changed."" On Thursday a jury at the High Court in Glasgow took three hours to find Campbell guilty unanimously, following a nine-day trial. He showed no emotion as the verdict was read out. Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC, told the court the loss of a child would be hard to bear in any circumstance, but the ""bestial manner"" in which Alesha was murdered was ""simply unfathomable"".

Cabinet trio issue Brexit delay warning,"Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke Brexit should be delayed if Parliament does not approve a deal in the coming days, three cabinet ministers have warned publicly for the first time. Ahead of crucial votes in the Commons, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauketold the Daily Mail,externalthey would be prepared to defy Theresa May and vote for a delay. Downing Street said the trio's views on no deal were ""scarcely a secret"". Conservative Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen called on them to resign. ""They are rejecting government policy and they are threatening to vote against government policy next week,"" the MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""In that case, they should do the honourable thing and resign from the government immediately."" Number 10 said in a statement: ""The PM is working hard to ensure we get a deal with the EU that allows us to deliver on the result of the referendum. ""That is where the cabinet's energy should be focused."" Earlier, Mrs May's spokeswoman said the PM would have another ""period of engagement"" on Brexit at an EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt - including a meeting with European Council president Donald Tusk. The UK remains on course to leave the European Union on 29 March. But the government has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the UK leaving without a formal deal, in the event that Mrs May cannot get MPs to approve the deal she negotiated with Brussels in time. Brexit: A really simple guide May is warned dozens of Tories could rebel Lonely PM nears Article 50 endgame Hammond: 'No deal threat focusing minds' MPs are due to debate Brexit again next Wednesday and are expected to consider an amendment tabled by former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour's Yvette Cooper. That would give Parliament the opportunity to delay Brexit and prevent a no-deal situation if there is no agreement with the EU by the middle of March. Mr Clark, Ms Rudd and Mr Gauke argue if a deal is not endorsed by MPs imminently ""it would be better to seek to extend Article 50 and delay our date of departure rather than crash out of the European Union on March 29"". Mr Clark, the business secretary, along with Ms Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, and the justice secretary, Mr Gauke, said there had been ""months of uncertainty"". They wrote: ""It is time MPs recognised the need to get a deal, accepted that this is the only deal on offer, and supported it."" But they also warned Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG) that Parliament will block the UK leaving without a deal, stating that if there is a delay ""they will have no-one to blame but themselves"". They said: ""Beyond the next few days, there simply will not be time to agree a deal and complete all the necessary legislation before March 29."" Their article comes after the BBC was told dozens of normally loyal Conservatives could back plans to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal if a reworked version of Mrs May's plan does not pass. Mark Francois, Tory MP and vice-chairman of the ERG, told the BBC that ""the prime minister will want to know why three members of her cabinet have decided to publicly decry government policy"" and added that he thought it was ""interesting that the chancellor has not signed the letter"". However Tory MP Nick Boles, who voted Remain but supports Mrs May's deal, said they were ""courageous and principled"" for speaking out to try to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Anna Soubry, who quit the Conservatives this week over Brexit to join the Independent Group, said the move was a sign of the ""complete chaos that's now existing at the top of government"". The MP, who supports another EU referendum, said the trio had to go to the press because ""they can't win the argument in a deeply divided cabinet"". Meanwhile, Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle are planning to put forward an amendment that would allow Mrs May's deal to pass in the Commons, as long as it is then put to the public in another vote. Mr Wilson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his amendment had the support of shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and he hoped to secure the backing of the rest of the Labour front bench. By Vicki Young, BBC chief political correspondent It is a pretty incredible intervention by these three cabinet ministers. Time and time again Theresa May has said the UK is leaving the EU on 29 March, in just five weeks' time. It's a very different message from these three. They've all made it very clear they wouldn't accept a no deal scenario. Now publicly, for the first time, they've said Brexit would have to be delayed if Parliament doesn't back a deal next week. In their article in the Daily Mail they've got a pretty stark warning to their colleagues. This is happening because, on Wednesday, there will be an attempt by MPs to seize control of that Brexit process. These three are suggesting that they will be prepared to resign in order to back that move. This is piling the pressure on Mrs May to get the changes to the deal, to bring it back early next week, but it's also piling the pressure on their colleagues to get behind the deal. Don't be in any doubt, what they are saying is not government policy.

Judge lifts ban on naming Alesha killerAaron Campbell wanted to be a YouTube star but now faces a life sentence for killing the six-year-old.,"This video can not be played Aaron Campbell is facing a life sentence The identity of the teenage boy who raped and murdered six-year-old Alesha MacPhail has been revealed.

""Ironically until three years ago, we could have named him because the rule applied to under 16s only and it was changed."" On Thursday a jury at the High Court in Glasgow took three hours to find Campbell guilty unanimously, following a nine-day trial. He showed no emotion as the verdict was read out. Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC, told the court the loss of a child would be hard to bear in any circumstance, but the ""bestial manner"" in which Alesha was murdered was ""simply unfathomable"".

Killer caught by his mother's CCTV,"Tributes left outside Alesha's grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay ""I've found the wee girl.... she's dead."" Jorge Williams' voice trembled as he broke the devastating news to a 999 call handler. Less than half an hour had passed since he had answered a Facebook appeal to trace a missing six-year-old. It was one of the warmest summers on record and dozens of residents on the tranquil Isle of Bute took to the shoreline and streets. But the search ended abruptly at 08:54 when Mr Williams discovered Alesha's naked body in a wooded area near his home in Ardbeg. The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' Detectives would later establish the child was abducted from her bed and carried to the lonely spot, less than a mile from her grandparents' flat in Rothesay. There, just days into her summer holiday, she was raped and murdered. A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named because he is under 18,was found guilty of the crime. His conviction following a High Court trial in Glasgow would be the culmination of a police investigation which was helped in part by his own mother. Six-year-old Alesha MacPhail was only days into a summer break when she was murdered It was just after 6am on 2 July and Calum MacPhail was getting ready for work. He noticed the door to his granddaughter's room was open then discovered she had vanished. Giving evidence during the nine-day trial, Mr MacPhail told the jury: ""We searched under beds, in wardrobes, but there was no sign of her anywhere."" Alesha had never been missing before and her scooter and bike were still in the garden. At 06:23 the child's grandmother, Angela King, dialled 999. The family alerted staff at the ferry port and locals, including the volunteer Bute Resilience Team, joined the search. In an industrial estate near Glasgow Airport Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team was briefed on the case. Back on Bute Mr MacPhail became alarmed when he saw an ambulance speeding past with its blue light on. It came to a halt near the site of the old Kyles Hydropathic Hotel, which had been cordoned off. Ms King, 47, recalled a conversation with her partner in which he broke off to scream at officers: ""If that's my granddaughter up there then I want to know."" The family were advised to go to Rothesay Police Station for an update, and once inside they were told: ""We've found her, but she has passed."" The murder shocked the island community Alesha was lying on her side when she was discovered by Mr Williams and the killer had made no attempt to conceal her body. It was later calculated that the walking distance from the flat to the spot could be covered in between 15 to 17 minutes. Pathologist Dr John Williams established thecause of deathwas significant pressure being applied to the face and neck. The expert also told the court Alesha had 117 injuries, some of which he described as ""catastrophic"". Crucially, the soles of Alesha's feet were clean, which indicated she had been carried to her death. Detectives made a breakthrough just after midnight on 3 July from an unlikely source. The killer's mother had reviewed CCTV at the family home and spotted her son coming and going in the middle of the night. She believed he may have seen something and contacted the police. The mother quizzed her son and told the jury: ""He was adamant he had nothing to do with it. ""There was no way they would find his DNA because he had been nowhere near this little girl."" In the course of the investigation the killer's phone was forensically examined and experts established he had carried out a Google search for ""How do police find DNA?"" The six-year-old was staying at her grandparents' house before she disappeared Hours before Alesha was killed the boy had hosted a party for his friends which broke up at 00:30. At that point the accused was drunk and in a distressed state. To calm himself down he tried to buy cannabis but Alesha's father, whom he had obtained the drug from in the past, did not respond to his messages. At 01:54 the accused was spotted on CCTV leaving his family home. He went to the MacPhail's flat on Ardbeg Road and found that the key had been left in the lock. The killer entered the property and took Alesha out of bed without waking her or the four adults sleeping in rooms along the hall. The next footage of significance to the inquiry came from two houses on Marine Place. Between 02:25 and 02:26 they captured a figure walking along the shoreline carrying something. The CCTV trail then went cold until 03:35 when the accused was filmed arriving home. Ten minutes later he left wearing a pair of shorts, no top and no shoes. He returned at 03:52 and then departed again six minutes later wearing a grey T-shirt, dark shorts, dark footwear and carrying a torch. The accused arrived home for the final time at 04:07. Locals on Bute staged a candlelit vigil in memory of the schoolgirl The teenager's friends told the court he had a ""dark sense of humour"". The jury also heard evidence about aprivate conversationhe had had with a female friend in which he said he might kill one day for the ""lifetime experience"". A 16-year-old girl said he made the comment in a Facebook Messenger chat in 2017 after she started discussing a crime documentary. The same friend also said he contacted her just three hours after Alesha was found dead. She said: ""During the conversation he started to get anxious and he said the police were going to blame it on him."" In the hours after the body was found there was speculation about the crime on a Snapchat group the teenager was part of. During this time he produced a video in which he walked into his bathroom and then revealed his reflection in the mirror. It was accompanied by the caption: ""Found the guy who done it."" The court also heard the accused lifted weights and could bench press 50kg - more than double the 22kg Alesha weighed. Alesha MacPhail's uncle Calum described the child as the ""brightest thing"" In his defence, the 16-year-old claimed his DNA was planted at the crime scene, but the sheer volume of samples recovered left his astonishing alibi in tatters. Forensic scientist Stuart Bailey found theaccused's profileon intimate swabs taken from Alesha and on the front of her neck The odds of it being from anyone else were more than one in a billion. Additional samples were recovered on the child's body and clothing. Mr Bailey said it was ""highly unlikely"" they had got there through anything other than direct contact. Theaccused was arrestedat 5pm on 4 July and driven to Helen Street police station in Glasgow where he was formally charged with Alesha's murder. Despite what prosecutor Iain McSporran QC described as a ""mountain of evidence"" he compounded the family's agony by forcing them to endure a trial and blamed Alesha's father's girlfiend, Toni  McLachlan, for the crime. In a further twist, heagreed to testifyand dismissed suggestions he was a ""confident liar"". The accused repeatedly denied he was responsible and told the court: ""I have never met Alesha MacPhail."" The most memorable exchange came after Mr McSporran suggested it would have been ""extraordinarily wicked"" for Ms McLachlan to have murdered her boyfriend's daughter. The accused, who appeared completely unfazed by the enormity of the charge facing him, said: ""I agree."" The QC then put it to the 16-year-old that the same description would apply to someone who alleged an innocent person was responsible for such a crime. The teenager locked eyes with the prosecutor across the courtroom and replied: ""It would be evil.""

The little girl with the  big smile,"Tributes to Alesha were left on the Isle of Bute alongside a school photograph of her A 16-year-old boy has been found guilty of the rape and murder of six-year-old Alesha MacPhail. Here we look at what happened in the hours before the brutal killing. When Alesha MacPhail went to bed for the last time she fell asleep watching Peppa Pig. The first day of July had been full of fun for the six-year-old, who was at the start of a three-week summer break on the Isle of Bute. She had travelled by ferry and car to a party on the mainland. And on returning at teatime she was taken to the park to play before watching YouTube videos on her grandmother's old phone until the battery ran out. The killer caught by his mother's CCTV Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder Like most children her age Alesha was mischievous. During the 50-mile drive back from her home town of Airdrie to the ferry terminal in Wemyss Bay she annoyed her grandfather - Calum MacPhail - by repeatedly hitting a balloon onto the back of his head. But that night Alesha burst into his room, jumped on his bed and gave him a cuddle. The final words she said to him were: ""Goodnight, Grandpa."" The six-year-old was staying at her grandparents' house when she was abducted Alesha loved school and had just finished primary two. Wendy Davie, headteacher of Chapelside Primary in Airdrie, said the youngster enjoyed reading and was a perfectionist when it came to her writing. Ms Davie added: ""Alesha was a very considerate child who loved being part of a group and she was popular with all the other children and was a smiley and happy young girl."" Her teacher, Emma Gibson, said she had an infectious personality. Ms Gibson recalled: ""Alesha was a bright and bubbly little girl, she always came into class with that big beautiful smile of hers."" She was due to spend the first half of her summer holidays with her grandparents, her father Robert MacPhail, 26, and his 18-year-old girlfriend, Toni McLachlan. They all lived in a three-bedroom flat on Ardbeg Road in Rothesay, the main town on the island on Scotland's west coast. Alesha had her own room in the flat and a trampoline in the garden. This video can not be played The family of Alesha Macphail say their daughter dreamed of being a YouTube star. Robert and Alesha's mother, Georgina Lochrane, split up when she was three months old but the child travelled from Airdire to the island every second weekend. There was plenty to keep her occupied and the schoolgirl loved to go to the local swimming pool and for walks in the country. Her father told the jury: ""We were never in. We were always doing something."" Alesha dreamed of becoming a YouTube star and her mother later shared a video of the child vlogging about her love of pasta. The youngster was a gentle soul and left a lasting impression on those who met her. Her uncle, Calum MacPhail, said Alesha had a ""great amount of love for absolutely everyone"" and was ""the brightest thing"". Alesha MacPhail was remembered by her headteacher as a ""bright and bubbly"" girl When she arrived on Bute on Thursday 28 June Alesha wanted to go Highland dancing. But by the time they reached the 292 Club the class had finished. Instead, Alesha's grandparents, Calum MacPhail and Angela King, took her to the idyllic beach on Ettrick Bay. During the trial Calum recalled: ""She was in the water and having a great time."" The first major highlight of the holiday was Gala Day on 30 June. Calum said Alesha went on the children's train but especially enjoyed the donkey rides. The following day, 1 July, she and her grandfather headed from the island to a birthday party in Airdrie. But they arrived at the venue 24 hours late. Alesha's grandparents, Calum MacPhail and Angela King, gave evidence during the trial Fortunately, Alesha met a school friend and secured an invite to another celebration at the same place. Calum, 49, said: ""She was over the moon again. ""I don't think she knew the person at all but somebody she knew was attending the party."" They arrived back in Rothesay at about 5.30pm. The balloon she had used to hit her grandfather was let go and she chased it along the beach until it burst. During evidence at the murder trial, Angela, 47, recounted that special moment, telling the jury her granddaughter was a ""beautiful, beautiful, happy girl."" Bute is an island in the Firth of Clyde, easily accessible from the west of Scotland via a regular 35-minute ferry from Wemyss Bay in Inverclyde. It has a population of about 6,500 people and the main town is Rothesay. It established a reputation as a popular tourist destination in the Victorian era. Before package holidays and cheap air travel generations of holidaymakers from the Glasgow area made the trip ""doon the watter"" to Bute on a paddle-steamer. The island hit the headlines in 2003 when fashion designer Stella McCartney - daughter of Beatles icon Sir Paul McCartney - married Alasdhair Willis at Mount Stuart. At about 6.40pm Alesha was dropped in town to meet her father and his girlfriend who took her to a park. Angela picked them up two hours later and they drove home via a local supermarket. Back in the flat Alesha took a slice of the pizza her father was having for dinner. During the trial Angela was asked where Alesha was that night. She replied: ""Everywhere."" Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan with Alesha, aged six Just after 10pm Alesha's father Robert came out of his room and told his daughter to put away the phone she had been playing with. He said: ""Time for bed. You will never sleep."" But Alesha managed to keep the device for a few more minutes until the battery ran out. Calum was watching TV when he heard his granddaughter banging on the wall. Seconds later the child's father went into her room and put on a Peppa Pig DVD. Before he went to sleep Alesha's grandfather reminded Angela that a cartridge for the bubble machine they had bought Alesha as a surprise was due to be delivered the following day. Some time after 11pm Toni McLachlan went into the child's room to turn off her TV. This video can not be played Mourners wore pink in Alesha's memory Asked about their relationship, Toni, whom Alesha affectionately called Toto, told the jury: ""I loved her to pieces."" The teenager broke down as she recalled switching the TV off as the Peppa Pig theme tune played on the menu screen. Toni said: ""She was sleeping and her face was facing the wall and her hair was behind her on the pillow."" She closed the door and went to bed. The next person to open it, just a few hours later, was Alesha's 16-year-old killer.

"Emergency Irish plan for no-deal BrexitThe Irish government hopes its legislation for managing a no-deal Brexit will ""sit on the shelf"".EuropeComments","This video can not be played Simon Coveney said he hoped the legislation ""proves redundant"" The Irish deputy prime minister has said he hopes that major legislation his government has prepared to manage a no-deal Brexit will never be used. Simon Coveney unveiled the wide-ranging bill on Friday, bringing together work by nine government departments. He said a ""disorderly"" Brexit would be a ""lose, lose, lose"" for the UK, the EU and the Republic of Ireland. His aim for the emergency proposals is to ensure a smooth transition should the UK leave the EU without a deal. Ireland and the EU: A special case What does Ireland do if there's no deal? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The legislation,externalis designed to support businesses and to protect jobs, essential services and citizens' rights. It is envisaged that it will be fast-tracked through the Irish parliament and be signed into law before 29 March, when the UK is due to leave the EU. Mr Coveney said he hoped it ""proves redundant"" and his ""only desire"" was to see it sit ""on the shelf"". ""A no-deal Brexit will be a major shock for the Irish economy,"" he added. Dublin Port has been preparing for a no-deal Brexit scenario A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame May reaches out to Remainer rebels Threat of no-deal Brexit 'focusing minds' ""We cannot offset all the damage it will do, but we are doing everything we can. ""This legislation is the product of a root-and-branch trawl of our laws to determine what changes will be needed if the UK becomes a third country overnight."" The 70-page bill is one of the most elaborate pieces of legislation ever brought forward by an Irish government. But the complexities of Brexit mean that Dublin hopes the hard work will go to waste. Simon Coveney says he still believes there will be a deal between the UK and the EU, but Ireland must be as prepared as possible for the other scenario. The legislation covers matters under the remit of nine ministers - a big range of topics, from energy to extraditions. However, the most tricky issue of all - the future of the land border with Northern Ireland - doesn't feature. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said his government was doing ""all we can to avoid a no deal scenario but we need to be ready in case it does happen"". ""This special law enables us to mitigate against some of the worst effects of no deal by protecting citizens' rights, security and facilitating extra supports for vulnerable businesses and employers,"" he added. Some of the main provisions of the legislation are: Justice - maintaining existing extradition arrangements Health - allowing citizens to be able to continue access services in the other jurisdiction Social welfare - enabling pensions and other benefits to continue to be paid Energy - giving the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities the powers to deal with unusual market activity on the all-Ireland electricity network Transport - allowing cross-border rail and bus services to continue The opposition parties in the Republic of Ireland are to be briefed on the measures, as their support may be necessary to get the bill passed. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said that the absence of a plan for customs checkpoints at the Irish border - ""the sort of border infrastructure that some in Dublin and Brussels have been having nightmares about"" - was proof that there was ""no need for the type of borders we knew"" during the Northern Ireland Troubles. ""No-one is building a so-called hard border or going back to checkpoints with soldiers,"" added the East Antrim politician. ""Such talk was rhetoric designed to ferment fear in genuine communities along both sides of the border."" How is Dublin preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit?

Latest MP to quit Labour 'ashamed' of party,"This video can not be played Ian Austin spoke to 5 Live about quitting Labour Ian Austin has become the ninth MP to quit Labour this week, blaming leader Jeremy Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"". He told the BBC the leadership had failed to tackle anti-Semitism and had turned the party into a ""narrow sect"". But the MP for Dudley North said he had no plans to join the new Independent Group of former Labour and Tory MPs. Mr Corbyn denied claims bullying was rife in Labour, tellingSky News,externalany ""bad behaviour"" had been dealt with. Meanwhile, his deputy Tom Watson said Mr Austin's departure was a ""serious blow"" to Labour. A Labour spokesman suggested Mr Austin should stand down and call a by-election in his West Midlands seat, which he won by only 22 votes in 2017. Mr Austin told theExpress & Star newspaper,external, which first broke news of his resignation, that it was the ""most difficult decision"" he had ever had to take. Who is Ian Austin? Who are the new independent MPs? What does it feel like to quit a party? The MP, who has represented the West Midlands constituency since 2005, later told BBC West Midlands that he was ""ashamed"" of the party. ""I grew up listening to my dad, who was a refugee from the Holocaust, teaching me about the evils of hatred and prejudice,"" he said. ""One of the main reasons I joined the Labour Party as a teenager here in Dudley more than 35 years ago was to fight racism and I could never have believed I would be leaving the Labour party because of racism too."" By political correspondent Jonathan Blake Ian Austin (right), campaigning with Harriet Harman and John Prescott in 2010 Another MP resigns, pouring scathing criticism on their leader at the end of a watershed week at Westminster. Ian Austin's decision not to join his former colleagues in the new Independent Group is telling. It shows that he felt strongly enough about the problem of anti-Semitism within Labour to quit the party he has been a member of for 45 years on that basis alone. But it also suggests that Parliament's newest group may be seen above all for what, in the absence of any policies, unites them. That is support for a further referendum on leaving the EU, something Ian Austin would not sign up to. For him the push from a party in which he no longer felt at home was more powerful that the pull of life in a new party on the outside. Other Labour and Conservative MPs who are considering their future will also need to decide whether they're better off out than in, and whether the Independent Group is the place for them. Explaining his decision not to call a by-election, Mr Austin said he had been openly critical of Mr Corbyn during the 2017 election campaign. He said his ""work for the people in this community is going to carry on as it always has"". Tom Watson, Labour's deputy leader, said he was ""deeply saddened"" by his close friend's decision to leave. ""I didn't want him to go, not just because he is a friend but because Labour needs people of his experience, calibre and passion if we are to win,"" he added. Mr Watsonrecently said Labour had been slow to deal with the anti-Semitism row and he ""no longer recognises"" the party. But Mr Corbyn, who has been in Madrid for a meeting of European socialists, took issue with Mr Watson's comments and said he would talk to him about them in the ""near future"". The Labour leader toldSky News:,external""There is no place for harshness, bullying or anything else in the party. I don't believe that it exists on a wide scale. ""Where there is bad behaviour we deal with it. Where there is a problem we deal with it."" Derby North MP Chris Williamson, a close ally of Mr Corbyn, said his departure was ""no loss"". Describing Mr Austin as ""stuck in the 1990s... a New Labour relic"", he told the BBC: ""I for many years wasn't particularly a fan of Tony Blair, but I didn't throw my toys out of the pram."" Mr Austin ""fought the last election under false pretences"", using Labour's brand to get elected, Mr Williamson added. Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months Corbyn's Labour 'an ally' - Jewish group Inan interview with London's Evening Standard,external, conducted before Mr Austin's resignation, shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned people behaving in a way ""construed as anti-Semitic"" that: ""They will be dealt with. Full stop. They are not welcome."" He admitted the leadership let down Jewish MP Luciana Berger, who described the party as ""institutionally anti-Semitic"" when leaving to join the Independent Group. There was not enough support for Ms Berger, ""not enough action"", Mr McDonnell said, before pledging to ""sort it"". Mr Austin was a minister for regional affairs under Gordon Brown and part of Ed Miliband's front-bench team in opposition. He said he ""agreed"" with the eight MPs who left Labour to form the Independent Group earlier this week that things ""have got to change"". However, he wants a Brexit deal concluded, rather than a further referendum on EU membership. While Mr Austin did not rule out joining the group, he told BBC Radio 5 Live he was ""not anticipating doing that any time soon"". Ms Bergertweeted,externalthat she fully understood why he had come to ""this difficult and painful decision"" of leaving Labour. Another of the defectors, Chuka Umunna,tweeted,externalhis ""massive respect"" to Mr Austin, adding: ""It's painful and hard but he has stayed true to his values and what he believes to be the national interest.""

Hillsborough mum describes 'battleground',"The mother of a schoolboy who died at Hillsborough has told a court the pitch ""looked like a battleground"". Dolores Steele's son Philip was among the Liverpool fans who died during a crush at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final. She told Preston Crown Court she heard fans shouting at police to open gates in the terrace fence but ""nothing seemed to be getting done about it"". Match commander David Duckenfield, 74, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. Mrs Steele told the court she had travelled to the game with her husband Les, 15-year-old Philip and his brother Brian, 13. The boys had tickets for the Leppings Lane terrace, beneath the West Stand where Mr and Mrs Steele were sitting. Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans She said shortly after the game began the pens ""suddenly looked very crowded"" and a fan was carried on to the pitch before a jacket was placed over their face. Supporters pleaded for the gates to be opened and told officers people were dying, she told the court. ""I seem to remember about four police officers standing looking in towards the pens but nothing seemed to be getting done about it,"" Mrs Steele said. Philip Steele had travelled to the game with his parents and brother A gate to the pen was opened and people were carried out on to the playing surface, she said. ""Suddenly the football pitch looked like a battleground - there were so many people out there lying around,"" she said. She walked down from the stand with her husband and saw Brian standing on a wall on the concourse looking for his brother, the court heard. Dolores Steele said ""nothing seemed to be getting done about"" overcrowding in the Leppings Lane pens They called an emergency number given to them by a police officer and were driven to Northern General Hospital by the son of a ""very kind lady"" who allowed the couple to use her phone. The jury heard a doctor came in and ""explained that there would be bad or sad news for 11 families"". Mr and Mrs Steele recognised a description of Philip which was read out, before identifying items including a signet ring and watch which belonged to him. Dolores Steele told the court her husband, Les, identified their son's body in a gymnasium at Hillsborough on the day of the disaster They were joined by Brian and taken to a boys' club, where families had gathered, and then back to the gymnasium at Hillsborough stadium where Mr Steele identified Philip's body. The court also heard statements describing the crush. They included one from Liverpool supporter Deborah Routledge who said she was crushed against the fence and was only able to take ""short gasping breaths"". The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster She said: ""I recall someone holding on to one of my ankles. I felt a loose grip for about two minutes and then the hand let go."" Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, is on trial alongside Sheffield Wednesday's ex-club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, who denies a charge related to the stadium safety certificate and a health and safety charge. The trial continues.

Clashes as Venezuela aid row intensifiesAt least one person dies and others are injured as civilians confront troops at the border with Brazil.Latin America & Caribbean,"President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has closed Venezuela's border with Brazil At least two people have been killed and several others injured in clashes near Venezuela's border with Brazil, local media report. Venezuelan security forces opened fire on a group of civilians who tried to prevent them from blocking the border. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has closed the country's border with Brazil amid a row over the delivery of humanitarian aid. The incident came as thousands attended two rival concerts on either side of a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³, who declared himself interim leader last month, attended the Colombian concert along with several Latin American leaders. The clashes occurred when members of the community confronted Venezuelan troops on Friday morning in the southern Venezuelan town of Kumarakapay, AFP news agency reports. Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela? Foreign aid: Genuine help or Trojan horse? Troops then opened fire on individuals who tried to block a road with the aim of preventing military vehicles from passing, witnesses said. A local woman and her husband were killed (in Spanish),external, according to the human rights group KapÃ© KapÃ©. An ambulance at the scene where deadly clashes erupted in southern Venezuela Venezuela is in the grip of a political and economic crisis. The country's inflation rate has seen prices soar, leaving many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food, toiletries and medicine. Around 2.7 million people have fled the country since 2015. Mr GuaidÃ³ says a lack of basic items has left thousands of others at risk of dying. Humanitarian aid for Venezuela has been arriving at the borders of neighbouring Colombia and Brazil. This video can not be played Venezuelan lawmakers also clashed with soldiers on Thursday Mr GuaidÃ³ and his allies hope to collect the relief gathered there on Saturday, in defiance of President Maduro, who denies any crisis and calls the aid plans a US-orchestrated show. President Maduro has said he could also shut the border with Colombia to stop the opposition bringing in aid. The concerts, being held just 300m (980ft) apart, represent two opposing sides of a power struggle between President Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³, who is recognised as the country's interim leader by dozens of countries, including the US and most Latin American nations. Thousands gathered for the Venezuela Aid Live concert near the Colombian city of CÃºcuta One of the concerts, Venezuela Aid Live, was organised by British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who said Mr GuaidÃ³ had asked him to set it up. It was held near the Tienditas bridge crossing on the Colombian side of the border at CÃºcuta.  Organisers invited 32 artists including Latin stars Rudy Mancuso, Juanes and Despacito singer Luis Fonsi, and Swedish DJ Alesso. A few celebrities - including Venezuelan-American singer and actress Lele Pons and Venezuelan singer Danny Ocean - and politicians took part. Among them were the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay, along with Mr GuaidÃ³ who defied a travel ban by President Maduro. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, Colombian President Ivan Duque, Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido and Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez all attended the Venezuela Live Aid concert. ""This concert is a humanitarian concert; every country, all people in the world want freedom,"" Mr Branson said. ""Anybody that does anything for the right reasons is always going to get criticism. The positive thing is that 99% of people around the world are embracing what is going on here today."" YouTube, Bing and Google services were all temporarily blocked in Venezuela during the Live Aid concert, according to Netblocks - a non-governmental organization that tracks internet blackouts. Following news of the event, President Maduro promised to hold a rival concert on the Venezuelan side of the bridge - a three-day festival which has been dubbed Hands Off Venezuela. The government still has not announced an official line-up for Hands Off Venezuela, but unconfirmed reports claim that about 150 artists are taking part. Richard Branson's concert is happening on the Colombian side of the border While Mr Maduro's is happening not far away on the Venezuelan side Brazil, which recognizes Mr GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's legitimate leader, had previously vowed to make humanitarian aid available in the Brazilian city of Pacaraima, to be collected by opposition supporters. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. There are already planes and lorries carrying tonnes of US aid parked on the Colombian side of the Tienditas bridge, and President Maduro has refused to allow it into Venezuela, saying it is part of a ploy by the US to invade the country. Despite denying that there is a humanitarian crisis at all, President Maduro reportedly received a shipment of aid from Russia earlier this week, according to Russian state media. Moscow has accused Washington of using aid as a ""convenient pretext for conducting military action."" According to RIA Novosti, Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told reporters that ""in preparation for the provocation"", America was deploying ""special forces and equipment near Venezuelan territory."" It is not yet clear. Mr GuaidÃ³ has said he plans to get aid into the country on Saturday by urging Venezuelans to mobilise en masse and form ""caravans"" and a ""humanitarian avalanche"" at the borders. Venezuela closes border with Brazil GuaidÃ³ sets up Venezuela aid confrontation But even with this effort, it is uncertain whether or not aid will be allowed in. A spokesman for Mr Branson told the BBC that he was working with the Colombian entrepreneur Bruno Ocampo to organise the concert and sort out the logistics while Mr Ocampo said the details ""remain confidential"".

Hanged girl's 'intentions not known',"Amber Peat was found hanged after going missing from her home in Mansfield The mother and stepfather of a 13-year-old girl who hanged herself gave ""very little, if any, consideration"" to her welfare, a coroner has said. Amber Peat's mum and stepdad also demonstrated little ""emotional warmth"" towards her, Coroner Laurinda Bower added. Returning a narrative conclusion, she said agencies missed 11 opportunities which may have prevented Amber's death. Amber's mother, Kelly Peat, said she had been ""the best parent"" she could. Ms Bower considered whether to return a conclusion of suicide but she could not be sure Amber intended to die. ""Considering Amber's age, her emotional immaturity and her undoubted vulnerability, and the absence of any professional ever having properly assessed Amber's risk of self-harm or suicide, I am not able to determine, on the balance of probabilities, Amber's intention at the time of her death,"" she said. This video can not be played The couple appeared at a press conference in the days following Amber's disappearance Amber Peat was found hanged in a hedgerow in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on 2 June 2015. Three days earlier, on 30 May, she had walked out of her homefollowing an argument with her family about chores. She had previously run away from home and also expressed a wish to die. Amber Peat ""always had a sad face"", according to a former class teacher The inquest heard how Mrs Peat became engaged to Amber's stepfather, Daniel Peat, just 12 weeks after splitting up with Amber's biological father. Amber also had to move house and schools during this time, which was ""further complicated"" by the fact Amber was due to take her SAT examinations. ""There appears to have been very little, if any, consideration of the welfare of Amber and this is a theme to which I shall return,"" the coroner said. In her narrative conclusion, the coroner said education, health and social care agencies all missed opportunities to assess Amber and her family. ""Had those agencies responded to safeguarding concerns in an appropriate manner it is possible Amber would not have died when she did,"" the coroner said. Amber's mother Kelly Peat was at the inquest to hear the verdict The inquest heard evidence from several of Amber's teachers who had concerns about her life at home. Amber told one teacher how her stepfather hadpunished her by making her wear baggy grey jogging bottomsto school and carry her belongings in a plastic bag. Mr and Mrs Peat accepted Amber had gone to school wearing the jogging bottoms and carrying a plastic bag, but said shemust have lied when she blamed her stepfatherfor it. However, the coroner found that Amber had been telling the truth. ""I find as a fact that Amber was made to wear the jogging bottoms to school and to use a carrier bag as punishment by Mr Peat in the full knowledge that she would be humiliated,"" the coroner said. ""This was perhaps borne out of the frustration that he was feeling towards Amber rejecting his attempts to discipline her."" Amber's body was found in Westfield Lane, about a mile from her home in Bosworth Street The inquest heard evidence from a police officer who said Mrs Peat was ""not particularly emotional, as in upset"", when her daughter went missing. The coroner also noted a lack of emotion from Mr and Mrs Peat when they gave evidence at the inquest. ""On more than one occasion, professionals told me how they had witnessed Mr and Mrs Peat demonstrate a lack of emotional warmth towards Amber at times when one would expect emotion to be present, such as Amber returning home after being missing,"" the coroner said. ""Indeed, when they gave evidence to this inquest there was a distinct lack of emotional warmth towards Amber, more so from Mr Peat than Mrs Peat."" Paralegal Amy Robinson read a statement out on behalf of Amber's mother A statement on behalf of Mrs Peat was read out by a lawyer following the inquest. ""Like all parents, Kelly knows she is not perfect but she has been, and continues to be, the best parent she can for her children,"" the statement said. ""Kelly wonders whether things could have been different had Amber and her family received more support and advice for Amber's behaviour. ""She proactively sought help on numerous occasions with Amber, and tried to work with the agencies as much as possible."" The statement said Mrs Peat had been ""subjected to intense media and public scrutiny"" since Amber's death. ""Some of the things that have been said have been very hurtful, not only to Kelly but her family too and they have had a huge impact on their well-being,"" the statement said. Amber's mother ""feels strongly that Amber would not have meant to deliberately harm herself"" The statement said Mrs Peat ""will always wonder"" why Amber did what she did. ""She and her family find it impossible to believe that Amber purposely set out to take her own life,"" the statement said. ""Kelly feels strongly that Amber would not have meant to deliberately harm herself or mean for this to happen."" Aserious case review was launchedfollowing Amber's death and is still to be published. Chris Few, chairman of Nottinghamshire Safeguarding Children Board, said they ""owe it to Amber to learn from what happened"". ""Before we publish the serious case review, it is important for all those involved to take some time to reflect on and consider the coroner's findings and to identify whether there is any further action needed,"" he said.

Royal Mail 'sorry' for stamp price error,"Royal Mail has apologised after announcing a price rise which breaches a cap designed to make the postal service ""affordable"" for all consumers. From 25 March, the price of a second-class stamp will rise by 3p to 61p - breaching Ofcom's current price cap of 60p which is in place until 1 April. The price of a first-class stamp will also increase by 3p to 70p. Royal Mail says it will donate the extra revenue, expected to be Â£60,000, to charity Action for Children. Calls to ban low-level letterboxes Unwanted gift returns 'set to rise' Ofcom set the current price cap in 2012, when it allowed Royal Mail toincrease the price of first and second-class stamps by 14p, following concerns the universal service was at ""severe risk"". The cap was set at 55p and would increase in line with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, making the official cap 60.65p today. Ofcom had announced the cap will increase to 65p from 1 April, and then will rise in line with the annual CPI rate of inflation until April 2024. Royal Mail says it informed Ofcom of its ""error"" before announcing the new 61p price on Friday. ""We apologise for this mistake,"" a spokesman for the company said. ""We are putting this right by donating the revenue that we expect to collect from the error - around Â£60,000 - to our chosen charity Action for Children, which helps disadvantaged children across the UK."" Ofcom says Royal Mail did inform them of the price rise but had not explained how it happened. It added that it is ""urgently seeking clarification from the company"". The newly-announced price increases are the highest for the two stamps together since 2012. Royal Mail says its prices remain good value when compared with other postal operators around Europe. It says on average, the equivalent cost of first-class post in Europe is 99p, while second class costs 77p.

Smollett suspended from Empire TV show,"Jussie Smollett will not appear in the final episodes Jussie Smollett will not appear in the final two episodes of Empire, the show's executive producers have said. In a statement, they said the past few weeks had been ""incredibly emotional"" for the team. They called allegations that Mr Smollett had falsely claimed he was the victim of a hate crime ""disturbing"". The 36-year-old African-American actor is accused of filing a fake police report claiming he was the victim of a homophobic and racist assault. Police say he staged the attack because he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary. US actor's alleged hate hoax 'despicable' Jussie Smollett: A complete timeline In the statement, the Fox production team said: ""The events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. Jussie has been an important member of our Empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. ""While these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out. ""We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show, and to avoid further disruption on set we have decided to remove the role of Jamal from the final two episodes of the season."" It is not clear whether Mr Smollett will return to the show in future seasons. US media reported that the actor was seen at the studio where Empire is filmed on Thursday afternoon. Sources told NBC and CNN Mr Smollett apologised to the cast for any embarrassment caused by the incident but maintained his innocence. This video can not be played Jussie Smollett: What Chicago Police say happened Mr Smollett is accused of paying two brothers to stage the attack. Chicago officials also believe that he sent a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand. At an earlier hearing, a judge set the actor's bail at $100,000 (Â£76,000). Mr Smollett, who was pictured outside the courthouse after posting bail, denies the charge of felony disorderly conduct. His lawyers have said they will ""mount an aggressive defence"" of Mr Smollett, who they described as ""a young man of impeccable character"". Mr Smollett said two white men hurled racist and homophobic insults at him when he went out late at night to buy food from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago on 29 January. He said they then punched him, poured a potentially chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck - a reference to racist lynchings of African-Americans. He also claimed the men said ""this is Maga country"" during the assault, a reference to President Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"". Officers began to grow suspicious when they were unable to find any footage of the incident, despite reviewing more than 50 surveillance cameras. There were also no witnesses. But investigators say they managed to use a ride-sharing app to track and identify two brothers who were filmed near the scene. The men, Ola and Abel Osundairo, flew to Nigeria after the alleged attack. On their return last week, they were held for almost 48 hours. Officials said they were released without charge after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"". One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer, and both had worked as extras on Empire. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson spoke about the Jussie Smollett case Police say they have a cheque, signed by Mr Smollett, which showed that he had agreed to pay the brothers $3,500. Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Mr Smollett told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary on the show.According to the Huffington Post,external, he was being paid $65,000 (Â£49,785) per episode for his starring role. In a press conference, Supt Johnson called the alleged scheme ""shameful"", adding: ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?"" He also accused Mr Smollett of taking ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"". On Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show two people buying materials that were allegedly worn by the actor's attackers. The next day, Mr Smollett turned himself in. His next court date is set for 14 March.

Cathedral City firm to be bought for ÃÂ£975m,"Dairy Crest, whose brands include Cathedral City cheddar and Country Life butter, has agreed to be bought by a Canadian company in a near-Â£1bn deal. Saputo, one of the biggest dairy processors in the world, will pay 620p a share, valuing Dairy Crest at Â£975m. The deal is Saputo's first in Europe and it said Dairy Crest was an ""attractive platform"" for UK growth. Dairy Crest said ""virtually"" all its 1,100 UK jobs are safe, including 150 at its head office in Surrey. However, the Unite union said it would be ""seeking an urgent meeting"" with Saputo about assurances over job security. Dairy Crest's share price, which has risen steadily this week, had jumped almost 12% in late morning trading on Friday. Saputo has expanded rapidly in recent years through acquisitions. In 2017, the company bought Australia's Murray Goulburn Co-operative for $490m (Â£380m), becoming the country biggest milk producer. Saputo has also expanded into China. It said its interest in Dairy Crest had been motivated by a desire to increase its international presence and ""enter the UK market by acquiring and investing in a well-established and successful industry player"". The Canadian company said,externalthat, under its ownership, Dairy Crest would continue to manufacture its products from its existing UK facilities, and that it also intended the management of its UK operations to remain in Surrey.

Outrage after Japan minister three minutes late,"Mr Sakurada, who was appointed to his post last year, has had to repeatedly apologise over a series of gaffes Japan's Olympics Minister, Yoshitaka Sakurada, has publicly apologised after arriving three minutes late to a parliamentary meeting on Thursday. Opposition MPs said his tardiness showed disrespect for his office and boycotted a meeting of the budget committee for five hours in protest. They have been highly critical of Mr Sakurada after a series of gaffes. Last week, he said he felt let down after Olympic swimming hopeful Rikako Ikee was diagnosed with leukaemia. ""She is a potential gold medallist [at the Tokyo 2020 Games], an athlete in whom we have great expectations. I'm really disappointed,"" he was quoted as saying. He was then forced to apologise after being criticised. In 2016, he also came under fire for describing so-called comfort women forced to provide sexual services to Japanese war-time troops as ""professional prostitutes"". And last year,Mr Sakurada, who is also the cyber-security minister, said he had never used a computer, adding he had always delegated the work to his subordinates. The opposition has repeatedly called for his resignation. Timekeeping around the world: How late is too late? Japan's Ikee diagnosed with leukaemia While it is not considered an egregious cultural faux pas to arrive late at meetings in Japan, this latest incident has been picked up by members of the opposition eager to highlight what they see as Mr Sakurada's failings. In a poll asking whether Mr Sakurada was suitable for the job, 65% of respondents said he was not,external, while 13% said he was, according to figures released by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper earlier this week. This video can not be played How late is too late? We asked BBC staff from around the world about time-keeping in their home countries Mr Sakurada was appointed to his post in October last year.

Venezuela closes border with Brazil,"Venezuelan soldiers send people back as they try to cross the border from Brazil Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has closed the border with Brazil amid a row over humanitarian aid. The embattled leader said he could also shut the key border with Colombia to stop the opposition bringing in relief. Venezuela's inflation rate has seen prices soar, leaving many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food, toiletries and medicine. President Maduro denies any crisis and calls the aid delivery plans a US-orchestrated show. His ally Russia has accused the US of trying to arm Venezuela's opposition. Rival concerts will be held on both sides of a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia later on Friday. On the Colombian side, an event will be held to raise money for Venezuela. At the same time, Mr Maduro's government will hold its own concert, just 300m (980ft) away. Venezuela crisis in nine charts Why the military back Maduro Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ and his allies hope to collect food and medicine being gathered in neighbouring Brazil and Colombia on Saturday, in defiance of President Maduro. Head of the National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim leader during anti-government protests last month and is recognised by dozens of countries, including the US and most Latin American nations. The border crossing with Brazil remained closed on Friday morning but local G1 website reported thata group of Venezuelans managed to cross,externalfrom the Brazilian city of Pacaraima on foot using an unofficial route. Mr Maduro announced on Thursday that the border would be closed ""completely and absolutely"" until further notice and said he had been considering a ""total closure"" of the border with Colombia. Brazil had earlier said that, in co-ordination with the US, food and medicine would be available to be collected by ""the government of acting President Juan GuaidÃ³ in Venezuelan trucks driven by Venezuelans"".

British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson has organised a concert near the Tienditas Bridge crossing at CÃºcuta hoping to raise about $100m (Â£77m) to buy food and medicine for Venezuelans. Venezuela Aid Live, he said, has been organised at the request of Mr GuaidÃ³ and another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who is under house arrest. About 250,000 people are expected to attend. Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela? The Venezuelan government has erected a stage on its side of the crossing for its Hands Off Venezuela event. The Branson concert is on the Colombian side of Tienditas Bridge... ... and a Venezuelan government stage has gone up not far away More than three million Venezuelans have fled in recent years as the country grapples with hyperinflation and shortages of essential goods, the UN says. Despite denying there is any humanitarian crisis, Mr Maduro announced this week that 300 tonnes of aid would be shipped from its ally Russia. The men prepared to die for Maduro Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the attempt to deliver aid could spark violence and be used as a pretext by the US to remove Mr Maduro. Citing unspecified information, she also accused the US and its Nato allies of discussing how to arm the Venezuelan opposition and claimed US special forces and equipment were being deployed near the country. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent in Caracas There is no doubt this has become a political issue. Juan GuaidÃ³ and his supporters want to spread the word about how important the foreign humanitarian aid is. President Maduro accuses it of being a Trojan horse. There is a feeling of optimism among many Venezuelans at the moment - an energy that has not existed in the country for a long time. And the hope that Saturday may be the start of a new path. But if the stand-off drags on, the fear is that this positive energy that has revived Mr Maduro's critics will wane, as will the interest of the international community, and that's what Mr GuaidÃ³ needs to achieve regime change. People want to know about a plan B - if indeed Mr GuaidÃ³ has thought of one. Otherwise, the hope here will soon turn to despair. Read more from Katy Mr GuaidÃ³ is leading a convoy that left the capital, Caracas, on Thursday, to CÃºcuta, some 800km (500 miles) away. He has said 600,000 volunteers have already signed up to help carry aid into Venezuela while theVenezuelan government said it would deliver 20,600 of its own food boxes,externalto the Colombian border area. Venezuela's military has so far resisted calls to abandon Mr Maduro, in power since 2013. However, former military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal called on the military to break with the president and to allow aid in. In a video posted online, the congressman recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as ""president in charge"" and issued a stinging rebuke to Mr Maduro. ""You've killed hundreds of young people in the streets for trying to claim the rights you stole - this without even counting the dead for lack of medicines and security."" Mr GuaidÃ³'s aides in Washington said 11 Venezuelan diplomats based in the US had defected and declared their support for him.

Rival concerts staged at Venezuela border,"President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has closed Venezuela's border with Brazil At least two people have been killed and several others injured in clashes near Venezuela's border with Brazil, local media report. Venezuelan security forces opened fire on a group of civilians who tried to prevent them from blocking the border. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has closed the country's border with Brazil amid a row over the delivery of humanitarian aid. The incident came as thousands attended two rival concerts on either side of a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³, who declared himself interim leader last month, attended the Colombian concert along with several Latin American leaders. The clashes occurred when members of the community confronted Venezuelan troops on Friday morning in the southern Venezuelan town of Kumarakapay, AFP news agency reports. Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela? Foreign aid: Genuine help or Trojan horse?

An ambulance at the scene where deadly clashes erupted in southern Venezuela Venezuela is in the grip of a political and economic crisis. The country's inflation rate has seen prices soar, leaving many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food, toiletries and medicine. Around 2.7 million people have fled the country since 2015. Mr GuaidÃ³ says a lack of basic items has left thousands of others at risk of dying.

President Maduro has said he could also shut the border with Colombia to stop the opposition bringing in aid. The concerts, being held just 300m (980ft) apart, represent two opposing sides of a power struggle between President Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³, who is recognised as the country's interim leader by dozens of countries, including the US and most Latin American nations. Thousands gathered for the Venezuela Aid Live concert near the Colombian city of CÃºcuta One of the concerts, Venezuela Aid Live, was organised by British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who said Mr GuaidÃ³ had asked him to set it up. It was held near the Tienditas bridge crossing on the Colombian side of the border at CÃºcuta.  Organisers invited 32 artists including Latin stars Rudy Mancuso, Juanes and Despacito singer Luis Fonsi, and Swedish DJ Alesso. A few celebrities - including Venezuelan-American singer and actress Lele Pons and Venezuelan singer Danny Ocean - and politicians took part. Among them were the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay, along with Mr GuaidÃ³ who defied a travel ban by President Maduro. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, Colombian President Ivan Duque, Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido and Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benitez all attended the Venezuela Live Aid concert. ""This concert is a humanitarian concert; every country, all people in the world want freedom,"" Mr Branson said. ""Anybody that does anything for the right reasons is always going to get criticism. The positive thing is that 99% of people around the world are embracing what is going on here today."" YouTube, Bing and Google services were all temporarily blocked in Venezuela during the Live Aid concert, according to Netblocks - a non-governmental organization that tracks internet blackouts. Following news of the event, President Maduro promised to hold a rival concert on the Venezuelan side of the bridge - a three-day festival which has been dubbed Hands Off Venezuela. The government still has not announced an official line-up for Hands Off Venezuela, but unconfirmed reports claim that about 150 artists are taking part. Richard Branson's concert is happening on the Colombian side of the border While Mr Maduro's is happening not far away on the Venezuelan side Brazil, which recognizes Mr GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's legitimate leader, had previously vowed to make humanitarian aid available in the Brazilian city of Pacaraima, to be collected by opposition supporters.

Why did the dam collapse?," Every day at 08:00, 78-year-old Darcy Dias da Cunha arrives at his local cemetery. It’s on the top of a hill, and as the sun continues to rise, he looks out over the small city of Brumadinho. Darcy Dias da Cunha and his dog Overhead, the deafening sound of helicopter rotor blades fills the air. Rescue workers are being ferried out to the mud that lies like a rust-red scar through the valley. They will not cease their search for bodies until dusk. Darcy, a father of 12, has spent every day at the cemetery since the dam collapsed. Here he sits, waiting for the call that will tell him the body of his 27-year-old daughter Rosaria, a mother of two, has been found beneath the thick, toxic mud. “I'm just waiting for her to arrive,"" he says. “I know the morgue will call the cemetery as soon as they identify her.” Darcy's daughter Rosaria A month on from the collapse, 171 people have been confirmed dead, but the recovery operation continues to search for the bodies of another 141 people - all reported missing by their families. In this tight-knit Catholic city, where almost everyone either worked at the mine or knew someone who did, the community is still in shock. Dozens of matching funeral wreaths are visible across the city, all paid for by the company that owns the mine When Darcy and his wife Helena Sansao heard that their daughter was among the missing, they got in to a friend’s car and drove for two hours to the nearest large hospital in Belo Horizonte. It’s the capital city of the state of Minas Gerais, which directly translates as “general mines”. Rosaria wasn’t there, but the couple - like many others who had rushed to the hospital - were asked to provide DNA samples. So far, more than 530 samples have been collected from those searching for missing family members. When the dam was breached, a tidal wave of red sludge surged through the valley with such force, that everything in its way was crushed. The force tore bodies apart. Due to the number of casualties, Atenaguos Moreira de Jesus only discovered his friend had died on the day of his burial In the cemetery, gravedigger 63-year-old Atenaguos Moreira de Jesus explains that one of the hardest parts of his job is supporting families when body parts rather than whole bodies have been recovered. “My job is to dig holes. But now the biggest hole is in my heart,” he says. “With all the love I have, this is the last thing I can do for my friends. “I worry about the ones who won't be able to bury their relatives. I won't be able to do my job. It’s as if I have failed.” Darcy looks on as other families come to bury their dead.  Sheltering from the warm summer rains, punctuated by thunder, a snaking procession of black umbrellas follows the pace set by a pandeiro, a Brazilian drum. But Darcy continues to wait. He says this is where he feels closest to God and most able to cope with news about his daughter, when and if it comes. “I want to carry her coffin,” he says. “I'm still strong. I do not want to die before doing this.” It was lunchtime on 25 January. Every day, along with a couple of hundred other employees of Vale, the huge Brazilian company that owns the mine, Rosaria bought her lunch from the canteen. She worked in the administration office which was just five minutes by shuttle bus from both the dam and the canteen. But by 12:28 local time, everything was destroyed. The 86m (282ft) high mining dam close to the city of Brumadinho had collapsed. Within 90 seconds, the staff canteen and offices, as well as dozens of heavy vehicles were engulfed by mud. Ana Paula da Silva Mota was a heavy-duty truck driver at the mine. She was proud of her job, transporting more than 90 tonnes of iron ore at a time in her 11m-long truck, from the mine to the train wagons. She was inside her truck,  just 550m from the dam when it broke. ""I was facing the dam. I think I was one of the first people to see [the torrent], I couldn’t believe it,"" says Ana Paula. At first she couldn’t comprehend what was happening. ""I thought there had been an explosion at the mine,"" she says. But only moments later she realised that the dam had burst. ""We thought this dam was dry,” she says. “From above, it looked like a soccer field. It was hard, solid, not made of mud. No-one could have imagined that it looked like that underneath."" Within seconds, 11.7 million cubic metres of liquid waste cascaded down the valley at more than 70km/h (43mph). The canteen building and everyone in it was buried beneath a torrent of mud. Ana Paula grabbed the radio. ""I got on the radio and I started screaming, 'Run, run, the dam has broken’. I later found out there were people who escaped because they had heard a woman crying and shouting on the radio. That was me,"" she says. The wave of toxic mud had come within metres of Ana Paula’s truck before flowing down the valley. She says she has lost more than 20 colleagues in the tragedy, including her aunt. Nearby homes, farms, plantations and forests were engulfed in mud. And in the nearby village of Córrego do Feijão and the neighbourhood of Parque da Cachoeira many houses were completely destroyed. ""The noise was so loud. The trees were cracking as if a fire was coming from the woods,” says local resident 65-year-old, Telmilia Duraes da Rocha. Telmilia Duraes da Rocha and her husband Telmilia and her husband also escaped just in time, but lost everything. “We ran out of the car and saw the avalanche of mud coming towards us destroying everything in front of us. This house was was my life, my dream,” she says. The dam that collapsed contained waste material - “tailings” - from the iron ore operation at the mine just behind it. The cheapest way to store these by-products is to seal them behind a dam. Water is then drained away, so the waste sludge hardens. Grass is even grown on top - hence Ana Paula’s description of a football field. However, if the sludge gets wet, “liquefaction” can occur. The dam near Brumadinho posed an extra risk as its walls were also constructed of layer upon layer of “tailings”. These types of dams, known as “upstream tailings dams”, are susceptible to cracks if they become waterlogged. These cracks can cause the structure to collapse. This design is used by many companies all over the world, including in Canada and Australia. However, these dams need regular monitoring and up-keep. ""They are common in Brazil because they are cheap and quick to build,” says geologist Eduardo Marques, a professor at the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV).  “But they are also the most dangerous. In several other countries they have been banned.” On the day of the collapse the emergency alarm system, designed to give people enough time to escape, did not go off. Many grieving residents believe that had the warning system worked, far fewer people would have died. ""Those alarms didn’t go off - I’ve never even heard them before,"" says Geraldo Vilaça from Parque da Cachoeira, which was engulfed by sludge. Geraldo lost his brother-in-law in the disaster. He, himself, only had three minutes to abandon his house and run. Vale is Brazil’s biggest mining company and the world’s number-one producer of iron ore. Within Brazil, it produces 80% of the ore for export. In 2017, its revenue totalled $34bn (£26bn; €30bn). Shortly after the collapse, the company’s president Fabio Schvartsman said at a press conference that the break-up of the dam caused the alarm itself to be “engulfed” by mud. In a statement later sent to the BBC, Vale said: “The speed of dam breach and the lack of any signs prevented the activation of the emergency system that would have sounded the dam sirens.” However, Sergio Medici de Eston, professor of mining engineering at the University of São Paulo, rejects this explanation. “To say that the siren didn't sound because the incident happened so fast is a joke,” he says. “The alarm should sound when things start to become critical, sometimes weeks ahead so that people are on the alert.” In the wake of such tragedies, people understandably look for answers. In Brumadinho, all eyes are on Vale. But first, people must find their loved ones. Manoeuvring along the Paraopeba River in an inflatable rescue boat, Eduardo wears a red-and-black neoprene suit and a hard yellow helmet. It’s the distinctive uniform of the “bombeiros”, Brazil’s military firefighters. Following a report phoned in by two researchers taking samples from the river to measure toxicity, Eduardo scans the riverbank. Suffocated by the toxic red sludge, the river is dying. Dead fish with open mouths can be seen floating, and even the mosquitoes have dispersed. Then he sees it - a broken body caught in the riverbank. With immense care, Eduardo and his two fellow bombeiros lift it into the boat. Clasping a hand in his own, Eduardo is relieved because fingerprints mean the remains can be identified and returned to the family. The rescue operation is huge. Nearly 400 military personnel, police officers, firefighters and members of the special forces work around the clock in the mud, with the support of helicopters, tractors and sniffer dogs. In some places, they report working in mud up to 15m deep. After hours of digging and trudging through the contaminated mud, rescuers are hosed down with a mixture of bleach and antibacterial detergent. Junior “I was able to find two bodies today,” says Junior, a young bombeiro waiting in the queue after his shift. “They were in a very poor condition, as they had started to decompose. But I have faith in God that they will be identified and their families will be able to give them a decent funeral.” It’s a race against time. Very soon the bodies will begin to decompose fully, and the rescue dogs will be less effective. Every day, thunderstorms and heavy rain slows the bombeiros’ progress. “[Rain] hinders the movement of aircraft, reduces the visibility of pilots and may move mud that is still in the dam,” says Lt Gen Anderson Passos, the commander in charge of the rescue operation. Lt Gen Anderson Passos The teams must work quickly but carefully. The risk that another dam in the area will collapse is a growing threat. Just days after the iron ore dam collapsed, the warning alarms rang out for two other dams in the area. Their status was escalated to “at high risk of collapse”. Some 700 people from the surrounding villages were evacuated, while the bombeiros forged on. Within 24 hours, a special investigation task force had been set up, consisting of both state and federal prosecutors, police, and military. It was split into three specialities: civil, environmental and criminal. Overseeing all of this is senior prosecutor for the state of Minas Gerais, Andressa Lanchotti. Andressa Lanchotti On the 10th floor of a tall, grey concrete office block in central Belo Horizonte, the nearest big city to Brumadinho, Lanchotti sits in front of a huge whiteboard covered with notes, lists of names and plans to do with the investigation. “Not for you,” she says smiling, while quickly flipping it over. Lanchotti is amenable, but straight-talking. The tragedy is all too familiar. Just over three years ago in November 2015, another upstream tailings dam collapsed killing 19 people. It happened in the same state, close to the city of Mariana, just 75km away from Brumadinho. More than 50m cubic metres of toxic sludge cascaded into a river and spread all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. It was the worst environmental disaster in Brazil’s history. The mine's owner Samarco was a joint venture between Vale and Australian-based company BHP. The aftermath at Mariana Two months after the tragedy in Mariana, while authorities were still trying to control the spread of mud, the state passed a new law, enabling “fast-track” licences. This made it easier - not harder - for companies to acquire permits to mine in areas of environmental concern. In Brazil, and particularly in the mineral-rich state of Minas Gerais, mining lobbyists wield huge amounts of influence and power. The fast-track licence was the opposite of what Lanchotti and her team had been working on in the aftermath of the collapse at Mariana - a bill proposing stricter laws around the construction and expansion of dams close to residential areas. “We presented the bid to the local assembly with more than 55,000 signatures of support from the community,” says Lanchotti. “Unfortunately it was not approved.” Samarco is appealing against a fine of 350.7m Brazilian reais (about $93.5m) for activities resulting in environmental damage. Manslaughter charges have also been brought against 19 executives from both Vale and BHP Billiton, but the trials have not yet gone ahead. “The justice system is very complicated,” says Lanchotti. “It’s not just about the prosecutors or judges. It’s also that the system allows numerous appeals, which can delay the final results.” She reels off a list of problems from a lack of monitoring to political commitment, until finally concluding: “As long as these issues are not solved, I cannot guarantee that new tragedies like this won’t happen in Brazil.” Just four days after the breach in Brumadinho, Lanchotti led the task force in making its first arrests - three employees from Vale, and two engineers from German company TÜV SÜD. These engineers had been hired by Vale to make the regular, legally required safety inspections of the dam, as well as signing off any safety certificates. A few days after the arrests, Vale’s lawyers had secured the release of all five men. Then, a little over a week later, parts of the men’s interviews were leaked to the Brazilian media outlet, Globo. Part of the leak was an email exchange from just two days before the breach, discussing irregular readings on automated monitoring equipment next to the dam. One of the arrested engineers from TÜV SÜD, Makoto Namba, was asked by police, given those readings, what he would do if his son was working at the site of the dam. He replied: “After confirming the readings, I would immediately call my son to evacuate the place as well as calling the emergency department at Vale, responsible for triggering the emergency action plan.” In his testimony, Makoto Namba also said he felt under pressure from a Vale employee to sign off the dam’s safety report back in June 2018. He said he told the employee he would only sign if safety recommendations were addressed. Both Vale and TÜV SÜD told the BBC they could not comment on the specifics of the investigation until the facts had been verified by the authorities. An employee of the mine, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that water from a natural spring on a hill above the dam had been seeping on to it. He said a pipe that had been installed at the spring to carry the water away safely had been leaking. “There was a spring above the dam, but the pipe was broken,” he says. “The water was falling directly on to the dam. So much so that the middle of the dam was no longer dry. This was more than a month ago.” Prof Carlos Martinez, an expert on mining dams, says that this would be a reason to immediately evacuate the area. “This would be unacceptable. Constant water flow coming from a spring would increase the pressure in the dam,” he says. “The remains of iron ore that exist in these dams normally bond with the sand and prevent water from draining properly. It clogs the filters, it turns it into something similar to a pressure cooker. The area should have been evacuated.” The Brazilian press has also reported that federal police were investigating suggestions that water might have found its way into the dam from natural springs. In a statement to the BBC, Vale said: “There was no record of an increase in the water level in the dam mass. On the contrary, the data indicates a reduction in the water level in the main section of the structure.” For Lanchotti one of the key problems is that big businesses are allowed to self-regulate when it comes to safety and risk management. “Often the government agencies do not carry out inspections, but instead delegate this responsibility back to the companies themselves, to monitor their own activities. “Unfortunately, recent events have shown that this form of self-monitoring is simply not effective.” With just 35 government inspectors for more than 1,000 active and non-active mines across Brazil, most companies hire their own private inspectors to sign off the paperwork. In the case of Vale, it was the German company TÜV SÜD. Lanchotti argues that more effective government inspection is needed. State prosecutor André Sperling is in charge of the civil branch of the investigation. One of his main jobs is to negotiate with Vale how much compensation should be paid to those who have lost their jobs, their homes and their loved ones. Since the disaster, he says he has averaged about four hours sleep a night. André Sperling “Vale is trying to accelerate the process of paying for damages before the real impact of the disaster has been established. It wants to get rid of the problem as fast as possible,” he says. While Sperling says that “Vale knew about the risks” he also recognises the conflict felt by both the government and local residents. This colossal, wealthy company has long been the main source of income for the 37,000 people living in and around Brumadinho. Vale is the biggest employer and taxpayer in the city, and without it, employment, commerce, and even the public sector would come to a standstill. “We don't want Vale to stop its activities in the state. This would make the local crisis even worse. But they need to pay damages and ensure this never happens again.” Two weeks after the breach at Brumadinho, sirens rang out in the middle of the night at two other dams in the state of Minas Gerais, warning of a possible collapse. One, near the town of Barão de Cocais, more than 120km from Brumadinho, is owned by Vale. The other, close to the village of Itatiaiuçu and only 30km away from Brumadinho, is owned by another mining company, ArcelorMittal. Overnight 700 people were evacuated. Then, just days later, two more alarms and yet more evacuations within the state. This time from two dams close to the small mining city of Nova Lima, just 40km away from Brumadinho. In the wake of the tragedy, people all over Brazil have woken up to the vast scale of the problem. There are at least 790 tailings dams across the country, many of which are directly uphill from towns and cities. They have all been categorised by their “potential for damage”. This rating scale does not measure how likely they are to collapse, but how much damage they would do if they did. Source: Agência Nacional de Mineração (National Mining Agency),  Agência Nacional de Águas (National Water Agency). Map created using Carto. More than 200 have been classified as “high potential for damage”. It means these dams are either located uphill from a town or a city or are positioned near to a main river or ecosystem. Both Mariana and Brumadinho were classified as “low risk of collapse” by government inspectors, but of  “high potential for damage” because of the number of people living close by, and the potential risk to the environment. A specialist engineer who was working as part of the recovery operation at Brumadinho and wants to remain anonymous, says that the approach taken by mining companies when assessing risk has long been problematic. He believes anything with a “high potential for damage” should never have been built. When comparing the mining industry with other heavy industries in which he had worked, he says: “First you run your worst-case scenario on a computer simulation. Then you design your site around that.  For example, on an oil rig, you would locate your offices and sleeping quarters well way from any potential dangers such as a fire or explosions, even if the likelihood of such events is extremely low.” He points out that in Brumadinho, the offices and staff canteen were sited below the dam. Vale bought the mine and its offices from another company, but kept the layout of the site. Nowhere in Brazil feels more at risk than the state of Minas Gerais, which produces 53% of the country’s total iron ore output. Source: Agência Nacional de Mineração (National Mining Agency),  Agência Nacional de Águas (National Water Agency). Map created using Carto. It has more mines and more tailings dams than any other, many of which sit directly uphill from towns or cities. Nova Lima is one of the three cities partially evacuated late last week after an alarm rang out warning of a possible collapse. The city, which has a population of just over 93,500, is surrounded by 26 mining dams. Itabira, where Vale was founded in 1942, has a population of nearly 120,000 and is surrounded by 19 mining dams. In some neighbourhoods, gardens back on to a tailings dam. The five tailings dams closest to the city hold back a total of 423m cubic metres of toxic sludge. That’s the equivalent of 33 times the amount released last month by the dam near to Brumadinho. Tragedy struck Mariana in 2015. The city, with a population of 60,000, is surrounded by 15 dams. On its outskirts, in a province called Bento Rodrigues, 600 people live in the shadow of five dams. While on the campaign trail, Brazil’s new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, pledged to relax environmental laws, arguing that they “bring endless problems” and “hinder mayors, governors and presidents from developing infrastructure”. Since the disaster, the government has announced a ban on new “upstream” tailings dams. The 87 that are currently in operation - 10 of them owned by Vale - will be decommissioned by 2021. But even after a mine is decommissioned, safety inspections must continue, as the waste sludge will sit inside a dam forever. The government has also said it would put pressure on companies to ensure daily checks are more rigorous. However, there has been no mention of increasing the number of government inspectors. These daily checks would still rely on the current system, whereby companies effectively monitor their own activities. “Mariana, never again.” These were the words Vale CEO, Fabio Schvartsman, spoke in a speech to his colleagues on the day he became president of the company in May 2017. Two days after the disaster in Brumadinho, he promised in a television interview to “guarantee this never happens again”. For the people of Minas Gerais and state prosecutors, this is not their first attempt at holding Vale to account. They worry that taking on an influential company will be neither quick nor simple. But, so far, some judges and politicians seem to be listening. Court orders have already suspended some of Vale’s most profitable operations and frozen 12.6bn reais, or about $3.2bn of the company’s assets. Late last week, a further eight Vale employees, including two executives, were arrested. Search warrants were also served for four people from Germany’s TÜV SÜD. Residents look on as community leaders and state prosecutors (R) demand answers from representatives of Vale Back in Brumadinho, the residents’ fight for justice and the rebuilding of their lives has only just begun. Under a huge white marquee, erected as part of the rescue effort, more than 400 people are sitting waiting for representatives from Vale to turn up. For weeks, many of these families have been living in temporary shelters, surviving off ration packs and bottled water, all funded by the company. Food parcels are distributed to the hundreds of families left homeless With many local schools still closed, the sound of 30 or more children playing football drifts through from the back of the marquee. A pop-up classroom has been set up by church volunteers offering face painting, a reading corner and a cushioned chill-out space. For generations, Vale has been the main source of income and stability for the people living in and around Brumadinho. But with more than 300 people missing or confirmed dead, and hundreds more left homeless and jobless, the community’s anger has become inseparable from its grief. Finally, after nearly an hour’s wait, three representatives from the company appear.  But the debate over emergency shelter, food and compensation quickly descends into a shouting match. “To kill, you are fast,” shouts a woman in the crowd. “You killed my brother in 10 seconds and now you're going to wait how many months to ease what my mother is feeling?” Vale’s response is business-like: “At this moment, we can’t take responsibility for something that is still being evaluated. First, we need to understand the extent of the problem,” says one of the company’s representatives. “We do not yet have sufficient information to respond to these requests.” Weeks later, Vale agreed to pay “emergency income” to families equivalent to the salaries of those who died. Absent from the proceedings is Brumadinho’s Mayor Avimar de Melo Barcelos. Days before, he told journalists that Brumadinho is a city that “lives off the ore”. “About 60% or more of our revenue comes from taxes paid by iron ore mining. And most of that is paid by Vale,” he says. “If these payments were to be interrupted after the tragedy, the city would literally stop. ""We have health care units, hospitals, schools, all of which we would not be able to sponsor any more. “Unfortunately, this is the reality.” A volunteer sits with one of the many children left homeless Edmundo Netto Junior is a federal prosecutor working with the investigations task force. He’s spent every day of the past month talking to the families of those who have been confirmed dead, or are still missing. One of these families included seven-year William, who had tagged along with his aunt. On the day they met, William had spent the morning painting. In the middle of his picture was a bright blue and yellow rescue helicopter, but dangling from the bottom was a large net - the type used to recover bodies found in the mud. “He gave this picture to one of the bombeiros [rescue firefighters] and asked them to find his grandfather,” says Netto Junior. William’s painting also showed a dark red scar cutting through the landscape. “It’s a community that has been scarred forever,” says Netto Junior. “It will carry these psychological bruises for life.” Correction: This story has been amended to reflect that the villages of Córrego do Feijão and Parqueda Cachoeira were not completely destroyed; only some of the houses in the villages were destroyed.

Flypast honours bomber-crash crew,"This video can not be played The flypast was watched by Tony Foulds, who tends the memorial to the 10 men who died Thousands of people cheered a flypast honouring 10 airmen who died when their plane crashed in a park 75 years ago. The US bomber came down in Endcliffe Park, Sheffield on 22 February 1944, killing everyone on board. A campaign for a flypast started after a chance meeting between BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Tony Foulds, who tends a park memorial. A tearful Mr Foulds was given a rousing round of applause as the planes flew over. He said: ""This is unbelievable."" Relatives of the aircrew and thousands of people from across Britain paid their respects as the planes roared over the memorial at about 08:45 GMT. Remember The Ten flypast: Live updates Speaking onBBC Breakfast,external, Mr Foulds told the crowds: ""Thank you very much for coming, it's lovely to see you."" Mr Foulds also met the families of some of the airmen who lost their lives in the crash 75 years ago and said they were ""lovely, lovely people"". He added: ""I never thought I would ever meet any of the families of this pilot and crew."" The flypast proved an emotional moment for Mr Walker, who is currently training for a Sport Relief Challenge in Tanzania. He managed to watch the event and tweeted: ""I can't talk.""

The flypast involved military aircraft from Britain and the United States, who set off from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk - home to the largest US Air Force base in the UK. Speaking in Tanzania, Mr Walker told Mr Foulds: ""The last six weeks have been remarkable from my point of view. ""I know you jokingly asked everybody for a tenner who are there at the park today, but it's not about the money, it's never been about you. ""Tony, it's always been about those 10 men who you think saved your life 75 years ago."" Tony Foulds waved at the aircraft as they flew past Endclliffe Park Thousands of people gathered to watch the flypast Six terms related to the flypast - Tony Foulds, Endcliffe Park, #TonyGotAFlypast #RememberTheTen #MiAmigo75th and #sheffieldflypast - trended on Twitter on Friday. Mr Foulds said he and the other children were in the park 75 years ago because boys from two rival junior schools were fighting. Of the airmen on board the B-17 Flying Fortress, known as Mi Amigo, he said: ""If it hadn't been for them, I wouldn't be here with my family. ""It's more than bravery, what they did. They saved me, and I mean saved me. ""These are now part of my family, my ashes are going to be put by the memorial. I might as well stay with them, you know."" All 10 airmen who were on board the B-17 Flying Fortress were killed on 22 February 1944 Mr Walker, who met Mr Foulds while he was walking his dog in the park, described him as an ""amazing man"" after hearing his story in early January. Mr Foulds was eight when he witnessed Mi Amigo crash and explode in the park as the pilot apparently tried to avoid him and his friends. A social media-led campaign subsequently went transatlantic and a flypast was successfully organised along with new steps and a flagpole for the crash memorial. As the flypast took place wreaths were laid at the graves of three of the American airmen who died in the crash. Three of the 10 crew of the B-17 Flying Fortress, Mi Amigo, are interred at Cambridge American Cemetery. The headstones of Staff Sergeant Harry W Estabrooks, Sergeant Maurice D Robbins and Sergeant Charles H Tuttle were dressed on Friday with sand from Omaha Beach in Normandy, France. Huge crowds gathered in Endcliffe Park Mr Foulds said he felt responsible, because the plane was trying to avoid crashing into him. Referring to his regular visits to the memorial, he said: ""They are my family. I love them to pieces. ""If I go on holiday I always make sure my son goes to visit. I always tell them how I am, what I'm doing, what the weather's like."" Crashed bomber fly-past campaign starts Fly-past planned to mark crashed bomber Flying Fortress crash memorial held Julia Johnson, who was among the crowds, said she had cried when she heard Mr Foulds' story and travelled up from London for the event. Ms Johnson said: ""I saw the article on the BBC website about Tony and the hard work and felt I really wanted to be here on the day, regardless of the flypast."" The florist said she had also offered to make a wreath for the servicemen who died in the crash. Mr Foulds regularly tends to the park's memorial and regards the American men who lost their lives as ""family"" Pilot Lt John Kriegshauser, pilot from Missouri 2nd Lt Lyle Curtis, co-pilot from Idaho 2nd Lt John Humphrey, navigator from Illinois Melchor Hernandez, bombardier from California Harry Estabrooks, engineer and gunner from Kansas Charles Tuttle, gunner from Kentucky Robert Mayfield, radio operator from Illinois Vito Ambrosio, gunner from New York Malcolm Williams, gunner from Oklahoma Maurice Robbins, gunner from Texas Capt Lauren Schlichting, a F-15E Strike Eagle pilot who took part in the flypast, said: ""We definitely don't take it lightly to be able to honour those who came before us and we're happy to do it.""

Botswana mulls using elephants for pet food,"This video can not be played How would re-introducing elephant hunting affect communities and the economy in Botswana? A report by cabinet ministers in Botswana has recommended lifting a four-year hunting ban and the introduction of elephant culling. After months of public meetings and consultations, the report by ministers also recommends the ""establishment of elephant meat canning"" for pet food. The number of elephants in Botswana is estimated to be about 130,000, which some argue is too many for the ecosystem - there is increasing conflict between wildlife and people. But others say the country's tourism has grown dramatically since the ban came into place and that lifting it would affect the country's international reputation for conservation. Africa Live: More on this and other news The war on elephants 'Elephant refugee' problem in Africa Dozens of elephants killed near Botswana wildlife sanctuary Shortly after coming into office in April 2018, President Mokgweetsi Masisi asked ministers to review the hunting ban which was implemented by his predecessor Ian Khama in 2014. Public meetings were held and organisations, communities and individuals were asked to comment. The report's findings recommend that: the hunting ban should be lifted the elephant population should be managed ""within its historic range"" wildlife migratory routes ""not beneficial to the country's conservation efforts"" should be closed game ranches be demarcated to ""serve as buffers between communal and wildlife areas"" ""regular but limited elephant culling"" should be introduced This video can not be played How to turn poachers into gamekeepers President Masisi welcomed the report which will go through further consultation before being implemented. ""I can promise you and the nation that we will consider it. A white paper will follow and it will be shared with the public,"" he said. ""If needs be, we will give an opportunity to parliament to also interrogate it, and also allow them the space to intervene before we make a final determination."" Surveys have shown that the elephant ""range"" - how far the elephants travel - has been expanding. The director of Department of Wildlife and National Parks, Otisitwe Tiroyamodimo, said there were many factors involved, including climate change. Elephants are straying outside their historic habitat ""We started seeing that as soon as the rain started decreasing, the vegetation started deteriorating and then the elephants naturally migrated outside their natural range because they were getting very little water and very little feed,"" he said. ""The number of the elephants has increased - at the same time the human population also increased, and there has been demand for more land. Infrastructure development has also caused the elephants to migrate."" But the latest survey of wildlife in northern Botswana suggests their numbers are not increasing as many rural people suspect. Those living close to elephants support the re-introduction of hunting, arguing the amount of conflict has increased since the ban was introduced. Elephants can be very destructive when they encroach onto farmland and move though villages - destroying crops and sometimes killing people. Those previously employed by hunting safari companies lost their jobs and say they would welcome the change. Hunting can be used as a conservation tool, by utilising wilderness that is not suitable for the high-end photographic safaris that Botswana is famous for. But many conservationists are against the idea of culling elephants or hunting them and warn there may be a backlash from international tourists. Tourism is Botswana's second largest source of foreign income after diamond mining. With an election due in October, the government has to balance lifting the hunting ban to win rural votes, against the impact it may have on Botswana's international reputation as a luxury safari destination.

Who is Ian Austin?,"Ian Austin has been the Labour MP for Dudley North since 2005, having previously been a councillor in the town. The adoptive son of Czech Jewish refugees, he has been critical of attempts to tackle anti-Semitism within the party. He was a minister for regional affairs under Gordon Brown. The role came after a stint serving the former PM as a parliamentary aide. He has also held several roles as a shadow minister, most recently for work and pensions in 2013. He has described the decision to leave the party as the ""hardest decision I have ever had to take"". Labour MP Ian Austin quits party Labour drops probe into MP Austin Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group A vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn, he has said that with a ""decent leader"" Labour could be twenty points ahead in the opinion polls. ""I certainly don't believe he's fit to be prime minister"", he told BBC WM shortly after quitting. He retained his seat in the 2017 general election by the narrow margin of just 22 votes. ""This is one of the seats that Theresa May called the election to win"", hesaid after his triumph. He was investigated by Labour after a confrontation with party chairman Ian Lavery in the House of Commons in July 2018, which he called the party's code of conduct on anti-Semitism a ""disgrace"". He had criticised the party's decision at the time not to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and all its examples - a move that was subsequently reversed. The investigation was later dropped, with Mr Austin complaining that the party's handling of the case had been ""appalling"". Although he backed Remain in 2016, he is opposed to the idea of holding another EU referendum. This sets him apart from the eight Labour MPs who quit earlier this week to join the new breakaway Independent Group. Mr Austin says he will not be joining the new group, although he has previously expressed sympathy with their aims.

The MPs leaving their parties,"After months of rumours swirling around Westminster that Labour MPs might break away, seven resigned from the party in one go, and an eighth followed suit a day later. They were then joined by three MPs from the Conservative backbenches. The three Conservative MPs blamed ""a shift to the right"" in their party and the government's ""disastrous handling of Brexit"" as reasons for their departure. Labour MPs also cited their party's Brexit stance along with the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism. Divisions in Labour cannot be contained The last big Labour breakaway The newly-formed ""Independent Group"" - which at the moment remains a grouping in Parliament not an official political party - says it represents ""the centre ground of British politics"". But who are the MPs within it? Former party:Conservative Constituency:MP for Cambridgeshire South since 2015 Majority in the last election:15,952 Referendum result:38% Leave, 62% Remain Positions:She sits on the Work and Pensions committee, but has not held any government posts. Before becoming an MP she worked for ExxonMobil, the Royal Mail and ran a manufacturing business. Ms Allen has campaigned repeatedly, and with some success, for changes to new benefits system Universal Credit. She is a vocal supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a further referendum on EU membership. Former party:Labour Constituency:MP for Liverpool Wavertree since 2010 Majority in the last election:29,466 Referendum result:35% Leave, 65% Remain Positions:Shadow minister for energy and climate change between October 2010 and October 2013; shadow minister for public health between October 2013 and September 2015; shadow minister for mental health between September 2015 and June 2016 Ms Berger has previously worked for management consultancy company Accenture and the NHS Confederation, a body representing healthcare organisations. She recently faced the threat of a no confidence votefrom local Labour members for criticising Jeremy Corbyn, but it was withdrawn after individuals in the constituency party were accused of ""bullying"" her. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said any attempts to deselect her had been a result of her association with a breakaway party. She attended a protest against anti-Semitism in the Labour Party in Westminster's Parliament Square in March 2018, and has campaigned vigorously on the issue. Former party:Labour Constituency:MP for Stockport since 1992 Majority in the last election:14,477 Referendum result:47% Leave, 53% Remain Positions:Opposition whip between January 1995 and January 1996; shadow spokeswoman for health between January 1996 and June 1997 Along with fellow MP Margaret Hodge, Ms Coffey put forward a no confidence motion against Mr Corbyn in 2016. Prior to being elected as an MP, she was a senior social worker. Former party:Labour Constituency:MP for Ilford South since 1992 Majority in the last election:31,647 Referendum result:43% Leave, 57% Remain Positions:Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee between 2005 and 2010 A Europhile and a founding member of the Clause Four Group in 1974, Mr Gapes has long disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn on a number of issues. He recently launched an attack on the Labour leader for refusing to meet Prime Minister Theresa May for Brexit talks and has publicly disagreed with his stance on foreign policy. The Jewish Chronicle reported in August 2018 that Mr Gapes was set to quit, with him describing the party as a ""horrible place to be"".

Labour 'an ally' - Jewish group,"A network of Jewish Labour members has backed Jeremy Corbyn over claims the party has become ""institutionally anti-Semitic"" under his leadership. Some 200 Labour supporters signed aJewish Voice for Labour letter,externalcalling Mr Corbyn's party a ""crucial ally in the fight against bigotry"". Anti-Semitism on the left is ""abhorrent but relatively rare"", it argues. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the view ran ""counter to the experiences of Jewish Labour members"". On Wednesday, Labour front-bench MP Barry Gardiner made an emotional apology to Jewish people ""let down"" by the party. ""We will not stop working until we have once again become a safe and welcoming political home for people from the Jewish community as from every other,"" Labour's international trade spokesman told the Commons. Seven MPs leave Labour in Corbyn protest Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger quit the party for the new Independent Group on Monday,saying she had been subjected to ""thousands of messages of anti-Semitic abuse and hate"". Telling MPs she had been met with ""obfuscation, smears, inaction and denial"" after raising the problem, Ms Berger said she arrived at the ""sickening conclusion"" that the Labour Party was ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". But the letter drafted by Jewish Voice for Labour, which describes itself as offering ""a space to explore and debate the many questions that are important to us as progressive Labour Jews"", rejects the suggestion. ""The Labour Party under the progressive leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is a crucial ally in the fight against bigotry and reaction,"" says the letter,published in the Guardian,external. ""His lifetime record of campaigning for equality and human rights, including consistent support for initiatives against anti-Semitism, is formidable. His involvement strengthens this struggle."" The group says the letter was signed by filmmaker Mike Leigh, writer Michael Rosen and author Gillian Slovo, as well as several academics and Walter Wolfgang, 93, who fled Nazi Germany as a child. It backs the Labour Party's endorsement of freedom of expression on Israel and on the rights of Palestinians. However, Board of Deputies President Marie van der Zyl said: ""The usual bunch of anti-Semitism deniers have written to the Guardian to declare that anti-Jewish hate in the Labour Party is rare."" She said the letter was ""particularly disrespectful"" to Ms Berger who had suffered ""years of anti-Semitic abuse, much of it from fellow party members"". ""This crisis will only be ended once the denial stops and Labour takes this problem seriously. Our community cannot have any confidence in Labour until the leadership commits to action."" Jewish Voice for Labour was formed in 2017 and has consistently backed Mr Corbyn's leadership. It is separate to the Jewish Labour Movement, formed in 1903, which has called extraordinary general meetings for 6 March, reportedly to discuss ending its 99-year affiliation with the Labour Party.

Hillsborough pitch 'like a battleground',"The mother of a schoolboy who died at Hillsborough has told a court the pitch ""looked like a battleground"". Dolores Steele's son Philip was among the Liverpool fans who died during a crush at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final. She told Preston Crown Court she heard fans shouting at police to open gates in the terrace fence but ""nothing seemed to be getting done about it"". Match commander David Duckenfield, 74, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. Mrs Steele told the court she had travelled to the game with her husband Les, 15-year-old Philip and his brother Brian, 13. The boys had tickets for the Leppings Lane terrace, beneath the West Stand where Mr and Mrs Steele were sitting. Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans She said shortly after the game began the pens ""suddenly looked very crowded"" and a fan was carried on to the pitch before a jacket was placed over their face. Supporters pleaded for the gates to be opened and told officers people were dying, she told the court. ""I seem to remember about four police officers standing looking in towards the pens but nothing seemed to be getting done about it,"" Mrs Steele said. Philip Steele had travelled to the game with his parents and brother A gate to the pen was opened and people were carried out on to the playing surface, she said. ""Suddenly the football pitch looked like a battleground - there were so many people out there lying around,"" she said. She walked down from the stand with her husband and saw Brian standing on a wall on the concourse looking for his brother, the court heard. Dolores Steele said ""nothing seemed to be getting done about"" overcrowding in the Leppings Lane pens They called an emergency number given to them by a police officer and were driven to Northern General Hospital by the son of a ""very kind lady"" who allowed the couple to use her phone. The jury heard a doctor came in and ""explained that there would be bad or sad news for 11 families"". Mr and Mrs Steele recognised a description of Philip which was read out, before identifying items including a signet ring and watch which belonged to him. Dolores Steele told the court her husband, Les, identified their son's body in a gymnasium at Hillsborough on the day of the disaster They were joined by Brian and taken to a boys' club, where families had gathered, and then back to the gymnasium at Hillsborough stadium where Mr Steele identified Philip's body. The court also heard statements describing the crush. They included one from Liverpool supporter Deborah Routledge who said she was crushed against the fence and was only able to take ""short gasping breaths"". The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster She said: ""I recall someone holding on to one of my ankles. I felt a loose grip for about two minutes and then the hand let go."" Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, is on trial alongside Sheffield Wednesday's ex-club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, who denies a charge related to the stadium safety certificate and a health and safety charge. The trial continues. Liverpool fan focused on 'staying alive' 'No discussion' over Hillsborough gate Officer 'feared fatal crush at turnstiles' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Bin collections disrupted across Halton as âworsening weatherâ continues Plans for new police station approved amid praise for design Police issue warning after Land Rover flips on its side Number of schools confirm closures due to snow and ice ALL Wirral train lines currently suspended due to bad weather Stars including Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench need help of Liverpool residents to speed up ban on trophy hunting imports in Parliament New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours': Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Man stabbed to death at London youth club,"Police found the man in Minet Road at 18:45 GMT A 23-year-old man has died after being stabbed in a south London youth club. Police were called to Minet Road, Brixton, at about 18:45 GMT on Thursday where the victim was given first aid by officers at the scene. He was pronounced dead at 19:27. His next of kin have been informed and no arrests have been made, police said. Det Ch Insp Mick Norman said: ""This was an appalling attack on a young man in a youth centre - a place where he was entitled to feel safe."" ""All the early indications are that this attack was premeditated and targeted"", he added. Sandra Smith, whose son was friends with the victim, said her ""heart bleeds"". ""He is a good boy, he is not the sort of boy who goes out and gives trouble,"" she said. Police believe the attack was ""premeditated and targeted"" Maxine Dawson, 46, said she had been outside and seen children as young as seven leaving the centre after the attack. ""I can only imagine the way they were traumatised,"" she added. Pastor and community campaigner Lorraine Jones, whose 20-year-old son Dwayne Simpson was stabbed to death in Brixton in 2014, said the youth club was one of only two in the area serving about 8,000 children. ""The club has been going for many, many years. They have done a huge amount of work, hundreds of thousands if not millions of hours with young people and they need help."" Children as young as seven are believed to have witnessed the attack Police want to hear from those who were at the youth centre either before, during or after the attack. ""The youth centre was open at the time and sadly many young people present would have witnessed what unfolded,"" Det Ch Insp Norman said. The killing brings this year's homicide rate up to 14, nine of which were fatal stabbings. Between October 2017 and September 2018 the number of knife crimes in London hit an eight year high,according to figures from the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS). Across England and Wales there were285 killings by a knife or sharp instrumentin the year ending March 2018, the highest since records began in 1946.

Fly-past honours bomber-crash crew,"This video can not be played The flypast was watched by Tony Foulds, who tends the memorial to the 10 men who died Thousands of people cheered a flypast honouring 10 airmen who died when their plane crashed in a park 75 years ago. The US bomber came down in Endcliffe Park, Sheffield on 22 February 1944, killing everyone on board. A campaign for a flypast started after a chance meeting between BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Tony Foulds, who tends a park memorial. A tearful Mr Foulds was given a rousing round of applause as the planes flew over. He said: ""This is unbelievable."" Relatives of the aircrew and thousands of people from across Britain paid their respects as the planes roared over the memorial at about 08:45 GMT. Remember The Ten flypast: Live updates Speaking onBBC Breakfast,external, Mr Foulds told the crowds: ""Thank you very much for coming, it's lovely to see you."" Mr Foulds also met the families of some of the airmen who lost their lives in the crash 75 years ago and said they were ""lovely, lovely people"". He added: ""I never thought I would ever meet any of the families of this pilot and crew."" The flypast proved an emotional moment for Mr Walker, who is currently training for a Sport Relief Challenge in Tanzania. He managed to watch the event and tweeted: ""I can't talk.""

The flypast involved military aircraft from Britain and the United States, who set off from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk - home to the largest US Air Force base in the UK. Speaking in Tanzania, Mr Walker told Mr Foulds: ""The last six weeks have been remarkable from my point of view. ""I know you jokingly asked everybody for a tenner who are there at the park today, but it's not about the money, it's never been about you. ""Tony, it's always been about those 10 men who you think saved your life 75 years ago."" Tony Foulds waved at the aircraft as they flew past Endclliffe Park Thousands of people gathered to watch the flypast Six terms related to the flypast - Tony Foulds, Endcliffe Park, #TonyGotAFlypast #RememberTheTen #MiAmigo75th and #sheffieldflypast - trended on Twitter on Friday. Mr Foulds said he and the other children were in the park 75 years ago because boys from two rival junior schools were fighting. Of the airmen on board the B-17 Flying Fortress, known as Mi Amigo, he said: ""If it hadn't been for them, I wouldn't be here with my family. ""It's more than bravery, what they did. They saved me, and I mean saved me. ""These are now part of my family, my ashes are going to be put by the memorial. I might as well stay with them, you know."" All 10 airmen who were on board the B-17 Flying Fortress were killed on 22 February 1944 Mr Walker, who met Mr Foulds while he was walking his dog in the park, described him as an ""amazing man"" after hearing his story in early January. Mr Foulds was eight when he witnessed Mi Amigo crash and explode in the park as the pilot apparently tried to avoid him and his friends. A social media-led campaign subsequently went transatlantic and a flypast was successfully organised along with new steps and a flagpole for the crash memorial. As the flypast took place wreaths were laid at the graves of three of the American airmen who died in the crash. Three of the 10 crew of the B-17 Flying Fortress, Mi Amigo, are interred at Cambridge American Cemetery. The headstones of Staff Sergeant Harry W Estabrooks, Sergeant Maurice D Robbins and Sergeant Charles H Tuttle were dressed on Friday with sand from Omaha Beach in Normandy, France. Huge crowds gathered in Endcliffe Park Mr Foulds said he felt responsible, because the plane was trying to avoid crashing into him. Referring to his regular visits to the memorial, he said: ""They are my family. I love them to pieces. ""If I go on holiday I always make sure my son goes to visit. I always tell them how I am, what I'm doing, what the weather's like."" Crashed bomber fly-past campaign starts Fly-past planned to mark crashed bomber Flying Fortress crash memorial held Julia Johnson, who was among the crowds, said she had cried when she heard Mr Foulds' story and travelled up from London for the event. Ms Johnson said: ""I saw the article on the BBC website about Tony and the hard work and felt I really wanted to be here on the day, regardless of the flypast."" The florist said she had also offered to make a wreath for the servicemen who died in the crash. Mr Foulds regularly tends to the park's memorial and regards the American men who lost their lives as ""family"" Pilot Lt John Kriegshauser, pilot from Missouri 2nd Lt Lyle Curtis, co-pilot from Idaho 2nd Lt John Humphrey, navigator from Illinois Melchor Hernandez, bombardier from California Harry Estabrooks, engineer and gunner from Kansas Charles Tuttle, gunner from Kentucky Robert Mayfield, radio operator from Illinois Vito Ambrosio, gunner from New York Malcolm Williams, gunner from Oklahoma Maurice Robbins, gunner from Texas Capt Lauren Schlichting, a F-15E Strike Eagle pilot who took part in the flypast, said: ""We definitely don't take it lightly to be able to honour those who came before us and we're happy to do it."" Lt Andrew Knighten, weapons systems officer in the F-15E, said: ""It's pretty humbling, honestly, just for everyone that's gone before us and for us to get to fly over and just honour them.""

Judge lifts ban on naming Alesha killerA judge ruled Aaron Campbell could be named following an application from media outlets.Glasgow & West Scotland,"This video can not be played Aaron Campbell is facing a life sentence The identity of the teenage boy who raped and murdered six-year-old Alesha MacPhail has been revealed. The judge who presided over the trial has lifted a ban on naming 16-year-old Aaron Campbell. Media outlets, including the BBC, made a case for reversing the court order which had protected his identity because he was under the age of 18. Judge Lord Matthews said: ""I can't think of a case in recent times that has attracted such revulsion."" After hearing the legal arguments on Friday, he said: ""I intend to grant the application. The press may name the accused and publish images of him."" Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' Campbell is facing a life sentence after being found guilty of killing Alesha, who went missing while on a visit to her grandparents on the Isle of Bute on 2 July last year. Alesha MacPhail had been on a holiday on the Isle of Bute On Thursday, Lord Matthews said he had committed some of the ""wickedest, most evil crimes this court has ever heard"". Campbell took Alesha from the bed where she was sleeping and inflicted ""catastrophic"" injuries before dumping her naked body in woodland. Alesha had suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. Aaron Campbell has been named as Alesha MacPhail's killer Like the six-year-old he brutally murdered, Aaron Campbell wanted to be a YouTube star. He posted videos of himself in 2017 showing off his parkour skills on a trampoline. During the trial, jurors watched a different kind of video - CCTV of Campbell carrying a mystery object - believed to be Alesha - near the shoreline at Rothesay on the night she vanished. Another video - recorded by his own mother - showed Campbell coming and going from their home in the early hours of the morning, removing items of clothing and retrieving a torch. The court heard Campbell lifted weights and could bench press 50kg - more than double the 22kg Alesha weighed. CCTV showed Campbell leaving his house with a torch the morning Alesha was found dead Hours before Alesha was killed, the boy had hosted a party for his friends after which he was in a drunk and distressed state. To calm himself down he tried to buy cannabis from Alesha's father Robert MacPhail, as he had done in the past. During the investigation, forensic experts found a Google search on his phone asking ""How do police find DNA?"" The teenager's friends told the court he had a ""dark sense of humour"" and had once told a female friend he might kill one day for the ""lifetime experience"". After Alesha's body was discovered, he produced a selfie-style video in which he revealed his reflection in a mirror with a caption: ""Found the guy who done it."" On Friday, Tony Graham QC, the lawyer representing several news organisations, told the High Court in Glasgow that it would be ""naive"" to think the teenager's identity was not already known among members of the Bute community and at Polmont Young Offenders Institute. He said the name of the boy had been on Facebook and Twitter, and had been available via a Google search since last July. The QC said the attempt to have the restriction lifted was a balancing act of the age, vulnerability and rights of the murderer, and the potential collateral damage to his family, against the public interest due to the nature of his crimes and the nature of his defence. That defence included a failed attempt to incriminate Toni McLachlan, the 19-year-old teenage girlfriend of Alesha McPhail's father, for the crimes. Brian McConnachie QC, representing Campbell, said the fact that Campbell had incriminated another person was no reason to identify him. He said: ""To make an order on the basis that Toni Louise McLachlan was incriminated would simply be tit-for-tat and nothing more than that."" He also argued that the existence of information on social media was not a reason to overrule the prohibition. He added: ""It's little argument to say, well, it's going to happen [his identification] when he's 18 anyway."" Mr McConnachie also told Lord Matthews that his client had been warned there was a ""price on his head"" and that publishing his name could exacerbate the situation as it would increase the number of people aware of his identity. He said: ""It is also important to identify at this stage that there is a history, so far as the accused is concerned, of self harm."" He said Campbell had a history of anxiety and depression and he had been previously tested for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Mr McConnachie was asked if he intended to appeal the decision. He told the judge: ""I am instructed not to appeal."" Alesha's family, including her mother Georgina Lochrane and father Robert MacPhail, were in court to hear the decision. Campbell was back in the dock 24 hours after being convicted. He again showed no emotion as he was led back to the cells. Alesha's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel From his arrest to conviction, Aaron Campbell could not be named - and this would have continued until his 18th birthday next year if Lord Matthews had not lifted the order. Any violation would have been considered a breach of the law and could result in a fine or jail term. In Scotland, it is rare for this restriction to be lifted. The media were given permission to name an underage victim in the Andrew Morton airgun shooting case in 2005 but in other cases applications were refused, including a torture attack on a 14-year-old girl at a shopping centre in Edinburgh. It has happened more often in England. Recent cases include 15-year-old William Cornick who stabbed a teacher to death in 2014 and Kim Edwards and her boyfriend, Lucas Markham, who were both 15 when they convicted of killing Edwards' mother and sister in 2016. Will today's decision set a precedent for future cases in Scotland? Not necessarily. It will be setting a precedent but a judge in any future case is entitled to take a different view. And cases such as Alesha MacPhail's are thankfully rare. Media law lecturer Frank Shennan had earlier told BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme there had been a sense of anger at the killer being ""protected"". He said: ""The reason for not naming under-18s is to protect what is seen as vulnerable people. ""And the reason for applying to have the ban lifted is a sense of outrage that somebody should be able to hide behind this protection when they have been found guilty of committing such a shocking crime. ""Ironically until three years ago, we could have named him because the rule applied to under 16s only and it was changed."" On Thursday a jury at the High Court in Glasgow took three hours to find Campbell guilty unanimously, following a nine-day trial. He showed no emotion as the verdict was read out. Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC, told the court the loss of a child would be hard to bear in any circumstance, but the ""bestial manner"" in which Alesha was murdered was ""simply unfathomable"".

The victims of the disaster dam," Every day at 08:00, 78-year-old Darcy Dias da Cunha arrives at his local cemetery. It’s on the top of a hill, and as the sun continues to rise, he looks out over the small city of Brumadinho. Darcy Dias da Cunha and his dog Overhead, the deafening sound of helicopter rotor blades fills the air. Rescue workers are being ferried out to the mud that lies like a rust-red scar through the valley. They will not cease their search for bodies until dusk. Darcy, a father of 12, has spent every day at the cemetery since the dam collapsed. Here he sits, waiting for the call that will tell him the body of his 27-year-old daughter Rosaria, a mother of two, has been found beneath the thick, toxic mud. “I'm just waiting for her to arrive,"" he says. “I know the morgue will call the cemetery as soon as they identify her.” Darcy's daughter Rosaria A month on from the collapse, 171 people have been confirmed dead, but the recovery operation continues to search for the bodies of another 141 people - all reported missing by their families. In this tight-knit Catholic city, where almost everyone either worked at the mine or knew someone who did, the community is still in shock. Dozens of matching funeral wreaths are visible across the city, all paid for by the company that owns the mine When Darcy and his wife Helena Sansao heard that their daughter was among the missing, they got in to a friend’s car and drove for two hours to the nearest large hospital in Belo Horizonte. It’s the capital city of the state of Minas Gerais, which directly translates as “general mines”. Rosaria wasn’t there, but the couple - like many others who had rushed to the hospital - were asked to provide DNA samples. So far, more than 530 samples have been collected from those searching for missing family members. When the dam was breached, a tidal wave of red sludge surged through the valley with such force, that everything in its way was crushed. The force tore bodies apart. Due to the number of casualties, Atenaguos Moreira de Jesus only discovered his friend had died on the day of his burial In the cemetery, gravedigger 63-year-old Atenaguos Moreira de Jesus explains that one of the hardest parts of his job is supporting families when body parts rather than whole bodies have been recovered. “My job is to dig holes. But now the biggest hole is in my heart,” he says. “With all the love I have, this is the last thing I can do for my friends. “I worry about the ones who won't be able to bury their relatives. I won't be able to do my job. It’s as if I have failed.” Darcy looks on as other families come to bury their dead.  Sheltering from the warm summer rains, punctuated by thunder, a snaking procession of black umbrellas follows the pace set by a pandeiro, a Brazilian drum. But Darcy continues to wait. He says this is where he feels closest to God and most able to cope with news about his daughter, when and if it comes. “I want to carry her coffin,” he says. “I'm still strong. I do not want to die before doing this.” It was lunchtime on 25 January. Every day, along with a couple of hundred other employees of Vale, the huge Brazilian company that owns the mine, Rosaria bought her lunch from the canteen. She worked in the administration office which was just five minutes by shuttle bus from both the dam and the canteen. But by 12:28 local time, everything was destroyed. The 86m (282ft) high mining dam close to the city of Brumadinho had collapsed. Within 90 seconds, the staff canteen and offices, as well as dozens of heavy vehicles were engulfed by mud. Ana Paula da Silva Mota was a heavy-duty truck driver at the mine. She was proud of her job, transporting more than 90 tonnes of iron ore at a time in her 11m-long truck, from the mine to the train wagons. She was inside her truck,  just 550m from the dam when it broke. ""I was facing the dam. I think I was one of the first people to see [the torrent], I couldn’t believe it,"" says Ana Paula. At first she couldn’t comprehend what was happening. ""I thought there had been an explosion at the mine,"" she says. But only moments later she realised that the dam had burst. ""We thought this dam was dry,” she says. “From above, it looked like a soccer field. It was hard, solid, not made of mud. No-one could have imagined that it looked like that underneath."" Within seconds, 11.7 million cubic metres of liquid waste cascaded down the valley at more than 70km/h (43mph). The canteen building and everyone in it was buried beneath a torrent of mud. Ana Paula grabbed the radio. ""I got on the radio and I started screaming, 'Run, run, the dam has broken’. I later found out there were people who escaped because they had heard a woman crying and shouting on the radio. That was me,"" she says. The wave of toxic mud had come within metres of Ana Paula’s truck before flowing down the valley. She says she has lost more than 20 colleagues in the tragedy, including her aunt. Nearby homes, farms, plantations and forests were engulfed in mud. And in the nearby village of Córrego do Feijão and the neighbourhood of Parque da Cachoeira many houses were completely destroyed. ""The noise was so loud. The trees were cracking as if a fire was coming from the woods,” says local resident 65-year-old, Telmilia Duraes da Rocha. Telmilia Duraes da Rocha and her husband Telmilia and her husband also escaped just in time, but lost everything. “We ran out of the car and saw the avalanche of mud coming towards us destroying everything in front of us. This house was was my life, my dream,” she says. The dam that collapsed contained waste material - “tailings” - from the iron ore operation at the mine just behind it. The cheapest way to store these by-products is to seal them behind a dam. Water is then drained away, so the waste sludge hardens. Grass is even grown on top - hence Ana Paula’s description of a football field. However, if the sludge gets wet, “liquefaction” can occur. The dam near Brumadinho posed an extra risk as its walls were also constructed of layer upon layer of “tailings”. These types of dams, known as “upstream tailings dams”, are susceptible to cracks if they become waterlogged. These cracks can cause the structure to collapse. This design is used by many companies all over the world, including in Canada and Australia. However, these dams need regular monitoring and up-keep. ""They are common in Brazil because they are cheap and quick to build,” says geologist Eduardo Marques, a professor at the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV).  “But they are also the most dangerous. In several other countries they have been banned.” On the day of the collapse the emergency alarm system, designed to give people enough time to escape, did not go off. Many grieving residents believe that had the warning system worked, far fewer people would have died. ""Those alarms didn’t go off - I’ve never even heard them before,"" says Geraldo Vilaça from Parque da Cachoeira, which was engulfed by sludge. Geraldo lost his brother-in-law in the disaster. He, himself, only had three minutes to abandon his house and run. Vale is Brazil’s biggest mining company and the world’s number-one producer of iron ore. Within Brazil, it produces 80% of the ore for export. In 2017, its revenue totalled $34bn (£26bn; €30bn). Shortly after the collapse, the company’s president Fabio Schvartsman said at a press conference that the break-up of the dam caused the alarm itself to be “engulfed” by mud. In a statement later sent to the BBC, Vale said: “The speed of dam breach and the lack of any signs prevented the activation of the emergency system that would have sounded the dam sirens.” However, Sergio Medici de Eston, professor of mining engineering at the University of São Paulo, rejects this explanation. “To say that the siren didn't sound because the incident happened so fast is a joke,” he says. “The alarm should sound when things start to become critical, sometimes weeks ahead so that people are on the alert.” In the wake of such tragedies, people understandably look for answers. In Brumadinho, all eyes are on Vale. But first, people must find their loved ones. Manoeuvring along the Paraopeba River in an inflatable rescue boat, Eduardo wears a red-and-black neoprene suit and a hard yellow helmet. It’s the distinctive uniform of the “bombeiros”, Brazil’s military firefighters. Following a report phoned in by two researchers taking samples from the river to measure toxicity, Eduardo scans the riverbank. Suffocated by the toxic red sludge, the river is dying. Dead fish with open mouths can be seen floating, and even the mosquitoes have dispersed. Then he sees it - a broken body caught in the riverbank. With immense care, Eduardo and his two fellow bombeiros lift it into the boat. Clasping a hand in his own, Eduardo is relieved because fingerprints mean the remains can be identified and returned to the family. The rescue operation is huge. Nearly 400 military personnel, police officers, firefighters and members of the special forces work around the clock in the mud, with the support of helicopters, tractors and sniffer dogs. In some places, they report working in mud up to 15m deep. After hours of digging and trudging through the contaminated mud, rescuers are hosed down with a mixture of bleach and antibacterial detergent. Junior “I was able to find two bodies today,” says Junior, a young bombeiro waiting in the queue after his shift. “They were in a very poor condition, as they had started to decompose. But I have faith in God that they will be identified and their families will be able to give them a decent funeral.” It’s a race against time. Very soon the bodies will begin to decompose fully, and the rescue dogs will be less effective. Every day, thunderstorms and heavy rain slows the bombeiros’ progress. “[Rain] hinders the movement of aircraft, reduces the visibility of pilots and may move mud that is still in the dam,” says Lt Gen Anderson Passos, the commander in charge of the rescue operation. Lt Gen Anderson Passos The teams must work quickly but carefully. The risk that another dam in the area will collapse is a growing threat. Just days after the iron ore dam collapsed, the warning alarms rang out for two other dams in the area. Their status was escalated to “at high risk of collapse”. Some 700 people from the surrounding villages were evacuated, while the bombeiros forged on. Within 24 hours, a special investigation task force had been set up, consisting of both state and federal prosecutors, police, and military. It was split into three specialities: civil, environmental and criminal. Overseeing all of this is senior prosecutor for the state of Minas Gerais, Andressa Lanchotti. Andressa Lanchotti On the 10th floor of a tall, grey concrete office block in central Belo Horizonte, the nearest big city to Brumadinho, Lanchotti sits in front of a huge whiteboard covered with notes, lists of names and plans to do with the investigation. “Not for you,” she says smiling, while quickly flipping it over. Lanchotti is amenable, but straight-talking. The tragedy is all too familiar. Just over three years ago in November 2015, another upstream tailings dam collapsed killing 19 people. It happened in the same state, close to the city of Mariana, just 75km away from Brumadinho. More than 50m cubic metres of toxic sludge cascaded into a river and spread all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. It was the worst environmental disaster in Brazil’s history. The mine's owner Samarco was a joint venture between Vale and Australian-based company BHP. The aftermath at Mariana Two months after the tragedy in Mariana, while authorities were still trying to control the spread of mud, the state passed a new law, enabling “fast-track” licences. This made it easier - not harder - for companies to acquire permits to mine in areas of environmental concern. In Brazil, and particularly in the mineral-rich state of Minas Gerais, mining lobbyists wield huge amounts of influence and power. The fast-track licence was the opposite of what Lanchotti and her team had been working on in the aftermath of the collapse at Mariana - a bill proposing stricter laws around the construction and expansion of dams close to residential areas. “We presented the bid to the local assembly with more than 55,000 signatures of support from the community,” says Lanchotti. “Unfortunately it was not approved.” Samarco is appealing against a fine of 350.7m Brazilian reais (about $93.5m) for activities resulting in environmental damage. Manslaughter charges have also been brought against 19 executives from both Vale and BHP Billiton, but the trials have not yet gone ahead. “The justice system is very complicated,” says Lanchotti. “It’s not just about the prosecutors or judges. It’s also that the system allows numerous appeals, which can delay the final results.” She reels off a list of problems from a lack of monitoring to political commitment, until finally concluding: “As long as these issues are not solved, I cannot guarantee that new tragedies like this won’t happen in Brazil.” Just four days after the breach in Brumadinho, Lanchotti led the task force in making its first arrests - three employees from Vale, and two engineers from German company TÜV SÜD. These engineers had been hired by Vale to make the regular, legally required safety inspections of the dam, as well as signing off any safety certificates. A few days after the arrests, Vale’s lawyers had secured the release of all five men. Then, a little over a week later, parts of the men’s interviews were leaked to the Brazilian media outlet, Globo. Part of the leak was an email exchange from just two days before the breach, discussing irregular readings on automated monitoring equipment next to the dam. One of the arrested engineers from TÜV SÜD, Makoto Namba, was asked by police, given those readings, what he would do if his son was working at the site of the dam. He replied: “After confirming the readings, I would immediately call my son to evacuate the place as well as calling the emergency department at Vale, responsible for triggering the emergency action plan.” In his testimony, Makoto Namba also said he felt under pressure from a Vale employee to sign off the dam’s safety report back in June 2018. He said he told the employee he would only sign if safety recommendations were addressed. Both Vale and TÜV SÜD told the BBC they could not comment on the specifics of the investigation until the facts had been verified by the authorities. An employee of the mine, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that water from a natural spring on a hill above the dam had been seeping on to it. He said a pipe that had been installed at the spring to carry the water away safely had been leaking. “There was a spring above the dam, but the pipe was broken,” he says. “The water was falling directly on to the dam. So much so that the middle of the dam was no longer dry. This was more than a month ago.” Prof Carlos Martinez, an expert on mining dams, says that this would be a reason to immediately evacuate the area. “This would be unacceptable. Constant water flow coming from a spring would increase the pressure in the dam,” he says. “The remains of iron ore that exist in these dams normally bond with the sand and prevent water from draining properly. It clogs the filters, it turns it into something similar to a pressure cooker. The area should have been evacuated.” The Brazilian press has also reported that federal police were investigating suggestions that water might have found its way into the dam from natural springs. In a statement to the BBC, Vale said: “There was no record of an increase in the water level in the dam mass. On the contrary, the data indicates a reduction in the water level in the main section of the structure.” For Lanchotti one of the key problems is that big businesses are allowed to self-regulate when it comes to safety and risk management. “Often the government agencies do not carry out inspections, but instead delegate this responsibility back to the companies themselves, to monitor their own activities. “Unfortunately, recent events have shown that this form of self-monitoring is simply not effective.” With just 35 government inspectors for more than 1,000 active and non-active mines across Brazil, most companies hire their own private inspectors to sign off the paperwork. In the case of Vale, it was the German company TÜV SÜD. Lanchotti argues that more effective government inspection is needed. State prosecutor André Sperling is in charge of the civil branch of the investigation. One of his main jobs is to negotiate with Vale how much compensation should be paid to those who have lost their jobs, their homes and their loved ones. Since the disaster, he says he has averaged about four hours sleep a night. André Sperling “Vale is trying to accelerate the process of paying for damages before the real impact of the disaster has been established. It wants to get rid of the problem as fast as possible,” he says. While Sperling says that “Vale knew about the risks” he also recognises the conflict felt by both the government and local residents. This colossal, wealthy company has long been the main source of income for the 37,000 people living in and around Brumadinho. Vale is the biggest employer and taxpayer in the city, and without it, employment, commerce, and even the public sector would come to a standstill. “We don't want Vale to stop its activities in the state. This would make the local crisis even worse. But they need to pay damages and ensure this never happens again.” Two weeks after the breach at Brumadinho, sirens rang out in the middle of the night at two other dams in the state of Minas Gerais, warning of a possible collapse. One, near the town of Barão de Cocais, more than 120km from Brumadinho, is owned by Vale. The other, close to the village of Itatiaiuçu and only 30km away from Brumadinho, is owned by another mining company, ArcelorMittal. Overnight 700 people were evacuated. Then, just days later, two more alarms and yet more evacuations within the state. This time from two dams close to the small mining city of Nova Lima, just 40km away from Brumadinho. In the wake of the tragedy, people all over Brazil have woken up to the vast scale of the problem. There are at least 790 tailings dams across the country, many of which are directly uphill from towns and cities. They have all been categorised by their “potential for damage”. This rating scale does not measure how likely they are to collapse, but how much damage they would do if they did. Source: Agência Nacional de Mineração (National Mining Agency),  Agência Nacional de Águas (National Water Agency). Map created using Carto. More than 200 have been classified as “high potential for damage”. It means these dams are either located uphill from a town or a city or are positioned near to a main river or ecosystem. Both Mariana and Brumadinho were classified as “low risk of collapse” by government inspectors, but of  “high potential for damage” because of the number of people living close by, and the potential risk to the environment. A specialist engineer who was working as part of the recovery operation at Brumadinho and wants to remain anonymous, says that the approach taken by mining companies when assessing risk has long been problematic. He believes anything with a “high potential for damage” should never have been built. When comparing the mining industry with other heavy industries in which he had worked, he says: “First you run your worst-case scenario on a computer simulation. Then you design your site around that.  For example, on an oil rig, you would locate your offices and sleeping quarters well way from any potential dangers such as a fire or explosions, even if the likelihood of such events is extremely low.” He points out that in Brumadinho, the offices and staff canteen were sited below the dam. Vale bought the mine and its offices from another company, but kept the layout of the site. Nowhere in Brazil feels more at risk than the state of Minas Gerais, which produces 53% of the country’s total iron ore output. Source: Agência Nacional de Mineração (National Mining Agency),  Agência Nacional de Águas (National Water Agency). Map created using Carto. It has more mines and more tailings dams than any other, many of which sit directly uphill from towns or cities. Nova Lima is one of the three cities partially evacuated late last week after an alarm rang out warning of a possible collapse. The city, which has a population of just over 93,500, is surrounded by 26 mining dams. Itabira, where Vale was founded in 1942, has a population of nearly 120,000 and is surrounded by 19 mining dams. In some neighbourhoods, gardens back on to a tailings dam. The five tailings dams closest to the city hold back a total of 423m cubic metres of toxic sludge. That’s the equivalent of 33 times the amount released last month by the dam near to Brumadinho. Tragedy struck Mariana in 2015. The city, with a population of 60,000, is surrounded by 15 dams. On its outskirts, in a province called Bento Rodrigues, 600 people live in the shadow of five dams. While on the campaign trail, Brazil’s new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, pledged to relax environmental laws, arguing that they “bring endless problems” and “hinder mayors, governors and presidents from developing infrastructure”. Since the disaster, the government has announced a ban on new “upstream” tailings dams. The 87 that are currently in operation - 10 of them owned by Vale - will be decommissioned by 2021. But even after a mine is decommissioned, safety inspections must continue, as the waste sludge will sit inside a dam forever. The government has also said it would put pressure on companies to ensure daily checks are more rigorous. However, there has been no mention of increasing the number of government inspectors. These daily checks would still rely on the current system, whereby companies effectively monitor their own activities. “Mariana, never again.” These were the words Vale CEO, Fabio Schvartsman, spoke in a speech to his colleagues on the day he became president of the company in May 2017. Two days after the disaster in Brumadinho, he promised in a television interview to “guarantee this never happens again”. For the people of Minas Gerais and state prosecutors, this is not their first attempt at holding Vale to account. They worry that taking on an influential company will be neither quick nor simple. But, so far, some judges and politicians seem to be listening. Court orders have already suspended some of Vale’s most profitable operations and frozen 12.6bn reais, or about $3.2bn of the company’s assets. Late last week, a further eight Vale employees, including two executives, were arrested. Search warrants were also served for four people from Germany’s TÜV SÜD. Residents look on as community leaders and state prosecutors (R) demand answers from representatives of Vale Back in Brumadinho, the residents’ fight for justice and the rebuilding of their lives has only just begun. Under a huge white marquee, erected as part of the rescue effort, more than 400 people are sitting waiting for representatives from Vale to turn up. For weeks, many of these families have been living in temporary shelters, surviving off ration packs and bottled water, all funded by the company. Food parcels are distributed to the hundreds of families left homeless With many local schools still closed, the sound of 30 or more children playing football drifts through from the back of the marquee. A pop-up classroom has been set up by church volunteers offering face painting, a reading corner and a cushioned chill-out space. For generations, Vale has been the main source of income and stability for the people living in and around Brumadinho. But with more than 300 people missing or confirmed dead, and hundreds more left homeless and jobless, the community’s anger has become inseparable from its grief. Finally, after nearly an hour’s wait, three representatives from the company appear.  But the debate over emergency shelter, food and compensation quickly descends into a shouting match. “To kill, you are fast,” shouts a woman in the crowd. “You killed my brother in 10 seconds and now you're going to wait how many months to ease what my mother is feeling?” Vale’s response is business-like: “At this moment, we can’t take responsibility for something that is still being evaluated. First, we need to understand the extent of the problem,” says one of the company’s representatives. “We do not yet have sufficient information to respond to these requests.” Weeks later, Vale agreed to pay “emergency income” to families equivalent to the salaries of those who died. Absent from the proceedings is Brumadinho’s Mayor Avimar de Melo Barcelos. Days before, he told journalists that Brumadinho is a city that “lives off the ore”. “About 60% or more of our revenue comes from taxes paid by iron ore mining. And most of that is paid by Vale,” he says. “If these payments were to be interrupted after the tragedy, the city would literally stop. ""We have health care units, hospitals, schools, all of which we would not be able to sponsor any more. “Unfortunately, this is the reality.” A volunteer sits with one of the many children left homeless Edmundo Netto Junior is a federal prosecutor working with the investigations task force. He’s spent every day of the past month talking to the families of those who have been confirmed dead, or are still missing. One of these families included seven-year William, who had tagged along with his aunt. On the day they met, William had spent the morning painting. In the middle of his picture was a bright blue and yellow rescue helicopter, but dangling from the bottom was a large net - the type used to recover bodies found in the mud. “He gave this picture to one of the bombeiros [rescue firefighters] and asked them to find his grandfather,” says Netto Junior. William’s painting also showed a dark red scar cutting through the landscape. “It’s a community that has been scarred forever,” says Netto Junior. “It will carry these psychological bruises for life.” Correction: This story has been amended to reflect that the villages of Córrego do Feijão and Parqueda Cachoeira were not completely destroyed; only some of the houses in the villages were destroyed.

"Men rescue 'dog' from ice, find wolf","The ""dog"" was treated by vets at an animal clinic Kind-hearted Estonian workers rushed to rescue a dog in distress from a freezing river on Wednesday - unaware of the fact they were actually about to bundle a wild wolf into their car. The men were working on the Sindi dam on the Parnu river when they spotted the animal trapped in the icy water. After clearing a path through the ice, they took the frozen canine to a clinic for medical care. Only then was it revealed they had been carrying a wolf. The wolf was covered in ice when pulled from the near-frozen water The Estonian Union for the Protection of Animals (EUPA) said the wolf had low blood pressure when it arrived at the veterinarian's office, which may have explained its docile nature after the men carried it to their car to warm it up. Speaking to the Estonian newspaper Postimees, one of the men,external, Rando Kartsepp, said: ""We had to carry him over the slope. He weighed a fair bit."" ""He was calm, slept on my legs. When I wanted to stretch them, he raised his head for a moment,"" he added. Veterinarians had some suspicions over the large dog's true nature, but it was a local hunter, familiar with the region's wolves, who finally confirmed it for what it was: a young male wolf, about a year old. ""He was calm, slept on my legs,"" Mr Kartsepp said of the journey to the vet's office Armed with this new information, clinic staff decided to put the wolf in a cage after treatment - in case it became less docile once it recovered. The EUPA said it paid for the animal's treatment, and that ""luckily, everything turned out well"". EU moves to protect big beasts Danes tag first wolf pack in 200 years France to let wolf population grow The wolf recovered from its brush with death within the day and, after being fitted with a GPS collar by researchers from the national environmental agency, was released back into the wild. ""We are so happy for the outcome of the story, and wish to thank all the participants â especially these men who rescued the wolf and the doctors of the clinic who were not afraid to treat and nurture the wild animal,"" EUPA said. Estonia is home to hundreds of wolves, only a handful of which have been collared in recent years. As a species, they usually avoid humans.

"Men rescue 'dog' from ice, find wolfOne man described taking the large dog to the vet in his car - before realising the mistake.Europe","The ""dog"" was treated by vets at an animal clinic Kind-hearted Estonian workers rushed to rescue a dog in distress from a freezing river on Wednesday - unaware of the fact they were actually about to bundle a wild wolf into their car. The men were working on the Sindi dam on the Parnu river when they spotted the animal trapped in the icy water. After clearing a path through the ice, they took the frozen canine to a clinic for medical care. Only then was it revealed they had been carrying a wolf. The wolf was covered in ice when pulled from the near-frozen water The Estonian Union for the Protection of Animals (EUPA) said the wolf had low blood pressure when it arrived at the veterinarian's office, which may have explained its docile nature after the men carried it to their car to warm it up. Speaking to the Estonian newspaper Postimees, one of the men,external, Rando Kartsepp, said: ""We had to carry him over the slope. He weighed a fair bit."" ""He was calm, slept on my legs. When I wanted to stretch them, he raised his head for a moment,"" he added. Veterinarians had some suspicions over the large dog's true nature, but it was a local hunter, familiar with the region's wolves, who finally confirmed it for what it was: a young male wolf, about a year old. ""He was calm, slept on my legs,"" Mr Kartsepp said of the journey to the vet's office Armed with this new information, clinic staff decided to put the wolf in a cage after treatment - in case it became less docile once it recovered. The EUPA said it paid for the animal's treatment, and that ""luckily, everything turned out well"". EU moves to protect big beasts Danes tag first wolf pack in 200 years France to let wolf population grow The wolf recovered from its brush with death within the day and, after being fitted with a GPS collar by researchers from the national environmental agency, was released back into the wild. ""We are so happy for the outcome of the story, and wish to thank all the participants â especially these men who rescued the wolf and the doctors of the clinic who were not afraid to treat and nurture the wild animal,"" EUPA said. Estonia is home to hundreds of wolves, only a handful of which have been collared in recent years. As a species, they usually avoid humans. It was picked as Estonia's national animal last yearby a group of nature organisations,external.

Threat to food as biodiversity declines,"The plants, animals, and micro-organisms that are the bedrock of food production are in decline, according to a UN study. If these critical species are lost, the report says, it ""places the future of our food system under severe threat"". The study says that land-use changes, pollution, and climate change are all causing biodiversity loss. While species friendly policies are increasing, they are not growing quickly enough, the scientists add. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), who've put the report together using data gathered in 91 countries, say it is the first such study of its kind. Insect decline may see 'plague of pests' Ban gas grid for new homes 'in six years' Lab-grown meat may have climate cost This is essentially the diversity of plants, animals, and other organisms, both wild and domesticated, that provide us with food, fuel and fibre. And it includes those organisms that provide essential services, such as bees and other pollinators, and worms, mangroves, sea grasses and fungi which work to keep soils fertile and purify the air and water. The report, called theState of the World's Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture,external, highlights two key messages. The first is that the world is relying on an ever smaller number of foodstuffs to feed a growing population that's expected to rise to around 10 billion people by 2050. Of the 6,000 plant species cultivated for food, just nine account for 66% of total crop production. The world's livestock production is based on around 40 species with only a handful providing the vast majority of meat, milk and eggs. The second key point is that many of these species that support food and agriculture are under threat or declining. Around a thousand wild food species, mainly plants, fish and mammals are decreasing in abundance. ""Biodiversity is critical for safeguarding global food security, underpinning healthy and nutritious diets, improving rural livelihoods, and enhancing the resilience of people and communities,"" said FAO's Director-General JosÃ© Graziano da Silva. ""We need to use biodiversity in a sustainable way, so that we can better respond to rising climate change challenges and produce food in a way that doesn't harm our environment."" According to the study, the lack of biodiversity can leave food production much more vulnerable to shocks, such as outbreaks of disease and pests. The report highlights what can happen in worst-case scenarios like the Irish potato famine of the 1840s. A red-eyed tree frog in Costa Rica As Irish tenant farmers used their land to mainly grow grain to pay their rents, they became increasingly dependent on the potato as their main source of sustenance. When a disease caused by a fungus destroyed the potato crop for several years in a row, it led to the the deaths of a million people from starvation and illness. While nothing on the scale of famine is now predicted, the new study highlights a number of examples where the loss of biodiversity is impacting people's lives and diets. The Gambia says that large losses of wild foods have forced communities to turn to industrially processed foods to supplement their diets Several countries including Ireland, Norway, Poland and Switzerland report declines in bumblebees. In Oman, the loss of pollinator populations due to extreme heat associated with climate change has seen the decline of wild food, including figs and berries. The report says that there are several significant causes or drivers of biodiversity loss. The main ones are: Changes in land and water use and management Pollution Overexploitation and overharvesting Climate change Population growth and urbanisation ""We see that in the tropics and sub-tropics the expansion of large scale agriculture accounted for 40% of forest loss between 2010 and 2015,"" said Julie Belanger, who co-ordinated the report for the FAO. ""Other major negative drivers that countries reported include climate change, pollution and inappropriate use of inputs as well as overexploitation."" Yes - the report highlights a number of what it terms ""biodiversity friendly practices"" that are on the rise. Some 80% of the countries reporting say that they follow one or more of these approaches. Some examples include: In Argentina, some 560,000 home gardens and 12,000 school and community gardens have been created and are providing food for an estimated 2.8 million people In California, farmers are now allowing their rice fields to be flooded after harvest instead of burning them, opening 111,000 hectares of surrogate wetlands and open space for 230 bird species. Farmers in Ghana are planting cassava plants on field margins which produce huge amounts of nectar, attracting bees and other species, leading to higher yields. While these are lauded, the problem according to the FAO is that these changes aren't happening quickly enough. ""It is very positive to see that countries are adopting more and more practices that contribute to sustainable food production across the globe,"" said Julie Belanger. ""However, sometimes increased adoption is coming from a very low starting point indeed."" In common with many environmental problems, consumers have enormous power to drive change. The FAO says that the general public can opt for more sustainably grown products from farmers' markets, for example, or boycott foods that are seen to be unsustainable. ""Something that came out strongly was the importance of the role of citizen scientists,"" said Julie Belanger. ""People who are involved in volunteer work for biodiversity-monitoring and also for conservation work - these are playing a very important role in a number of countries.""

Venezuela closing border with Brazil,"Venezuelan soldiers send people back as they try to cross the border from Brazil Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has closed the border with Brazil amid a row over humanitarian aid. The embattled leader said he could also shut the key border with Colombia to stop the opposition bringing in relief. Venezuela's inflation rate has seen prices soar, leaving many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food, toiletries and medicine. President Maduro denies any crisis and calls the aid delivery plans a US-orchestrated show. His ally Russia has accused the US of trying to arm Venezuela's opposition. Rival concerts will be held on both sides of a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia later on Friday. On the Colombian side, an event will be held to raise money for Venezuela. At the same time, Mr Maduro's government will hold its own concert, just 300m (980ft) away. Venezuela crisis in nine charts Why the military back Maduro Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ and his allies hope to collect food and medicine being gathered in neighbouring Brazil and Colombia on Saturday, in defiance of President Maduro. Head of the National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim leader during anti-government protests last month and is recognised by dozens of countries, including the US and most Latin American nations. The border crossing with Brazil remained closed on Friday morning but local G1 website reported thata group of Venezuelans managed to cross,externalfrom the Brazilian city of Pacaraima on foot using an unofficial route. Mr Maduro announced on Thursday that the border would be closed ""completely and absolutely"" until further notice and said he had been considering a ""total closure"" of the border with Colombia. Brazil had earlier said that, in co-ordination with the US, food and medicine would be available to be collected by ""the government of acting President Juan GuaidÃ³ in Venezuelan trucks driven by Venezuelans"".

British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson has organised a concert near the Tienditas Bridge crossing at CÃºcuta hoping to raise about $100m (Â£77m) to buy food and medicine for Venezuelans. Venezuela Aid Live, he said, has been organised at the request of Mr GuaidÃ³ and another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who is under house arrest. About 250,000 people are expected to attend. Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela? The Venezuelan government has erected a stage on its side of the crossing for its Hands Off Venezuela event. The Branson concert is on the Colombian side of Tienditas Bridge... ... and a Venezuelan government stage has gone up not far away More than three million Venezuelans have fled in recent years as the country grapples with hyperinflation and shortages of essential goods, the UN says. Despite denying there is any humanitarian crisis, Mr Maduro announced this week that 300 tonnes of aid would be shipped from its ally Russia. The men prepared to die for Maduro Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the attempt to deliver aid could spark violence and be used as a pretext by the US to remove Mr Maduro. Citing unspecified information, she also accused the US and its Nato allies of discussing how to arm the Venezuelan opposition and claimed US special forces and equipment were being deployed near the country. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent in Caracas There is no doubt this has become a political issue. Juan GuaidÃ³ and his supporters want to spread the word about how important the foreign humanitarian aid is. President Maduro accuses it of being a Trojan horse. There is a feeling of optimism among many Venezuelans at the moment - an energy that has not existed in the country for a long time. And the hope that Saturday may be the start of a new path. But if the stand-off drags on, the fear is that this positive energy that has revived Mr Maduro's critics will wane, as will the interest of the international community, and that's what Mr GuaidÃ³ needs to achieve regime change. People want to know about a plan B - if indeed Mr GuaidÃ³ has thought of one. Otherwise, the hope here will soon turn to despair. Read more from Katy Mr GuaidÃ³ is leading a convoy that left the capital, Caracas, on Thursday, to CÃºcuta, some 800km (500 miles) away. He has said 600,000 volunteers have already signed up to help carry aid into Venezuela while theVenezuelan government said it would deliver 20,600 of its own food boxes,externalto the Colombian border area. Venezuela's military has so far resisted calls to abandon Mr Maduro, in power since 2013. However, former military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal called on the military to break with the president and to allow aid in. In a video posted online, the congressman recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as ""president in charge"" and issued a stinging rebuke to Mr Maduro. ""You've killed hundreds of young people in the streets for trying to claim the rights you stole - this without even counting the dead for lack of medicines and security."" Mr GuaidÃ³'s aides in Washington said 11 Venezuelan diplomats based in the US had defected and declared their support for him.

PTSD affects 'one in 13 by age of 18',"One in 13 young people in England and Wales experiences post-traumatic stress disorder by the age of 18, the first research of its kind suggests. A study of more than 2,000 18-year-olds found nearly a third had experienced trauma in childhood. And a quarter of these then developed PTSD, which can cause insomnia, flashbacks and feelings of isolation. Researchers say, with many young people not receiving the support they need, the study should be a ""wake-up call"". Thestudy, published in The Lancet Psychiatry,external, found slightly more than half of those who had had PTSD - an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events  - had also experienced a major depressive episode and one in five had attempted suicide. But only the same proportion - one in five - had been seen by a mental health professional in the past year. Improving child mental health 'years off' Youth mental health report in charts Child mental health referrals 'up 26%' Lead researcher Dr Stephanie Lewis, a Medical Research Council-funded researcher at the King's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, said: ""Providing effective treatments early on could prevent mental health problems continuing into adulthood."" Flo Sharman had life-saving surgery as a baby, which doctors now believe led to her PTSD Flo Sharman, 20, had a breakdown at the age of eight that left her housebound. But it was only when she was 16 that neurologists concluded that breakdown was linked to something that had happened to her as a baby. At four months old, Flo had a life-saving operation to remove parts of her stomach - to treat her serious acid reflux, which affected her ability to breathe. The condition had led to her needing to be resuscitated on many occasions, Flo said. Doctors now believe her breakdown was caused by PTSD, a delayed reaction to the trauma she experienced as a baby, even though she has no conscious memory of what happened. She says: ""When I had that life-saving surgery and the traumatic experiences in hospital, my parents weren't told you could have post-traumatic stress disorder because of the surgery and the time in hospital. ""They had no idea that this mental breakdown would happen. It was a real shock."" Flo still has PTSD, which she says many people wrongly think affects only those in the armed forces. ""People don't really associate PTSD with a young child - and that has to change,"" she adds. Participants in the study were judged to have had PTSD only if they had had all of the following symptoms for at least a month: reliving traumatic events through distressing memories or nightmares avoiding anything reminding them of their trauma feelings of guilt, isolation or detachment irritability, impulsivity or difficulty concentrating Experiences of childhood trauma included assault, sexual assault, injury or an event that had affected someone they knew but they had not directly witnessed. Senior researcher Prof Andrea Danese, from the King's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, said: ""Our findings should serve as a wake-up call. ""Childhood trauma is a public-health concern - yet trauma-related disorders often go unnoticed. ""Young people with PTSD are falling through the gaps in care and there is a pressing need for better access to mental health services."" Being caught up in a traumatic event that is overwhelming, frightening and life-threatening can lead to PTSD The symptoms usually start within a few weeks of the trauma but they can start later After the traumatic event, people can feel grief-stricken, depressed, anxious, guilty and angry People may have flashbacks and nightmares People may be 'on guard' - staying alert all the time Physical symptoms can be aches and pains, diarrhoea, irregular heartbeats, headaches, feelings of panic and fear, depression People may start drinking too much alcohol or using drugs (including painkillers) Source:Royal College of Psychiatrists,external Prof Danese said people should not be ""alarmed"" by the study's findings and it was normal to have some psychological symptoms after trauma. In the ""vast majority"" of cases, these symptoms would recede in a matter of days or weeks, he said. But if children and young people had them for over a month, parents should seek help from their GP. PTSD can be successfully treated - even when it develops many years after a traumatic event - with treatments including talking therapies and antidepressants. Dr Tim Dalgleish, from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the research, said the results of the ""landmark study"" were ""sobering"". ""Of particular concern is the relatively small proportion of affected youth who go on to access formal support or mental health services and the findings are a further wake-up call that service provision in the UK for children and adolescents dealing with the aftermath of trauma is woefully inadequate,"" he said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""The NHS Long Term Plan has committed to prioritising increasing the funding for children and young people's mental health services faster than all other funding. ""As a result, 345,000 more children and young people have access to mental health services and support in schools and colleges, young adults will receive better support until the age of 25 and crisis care will be provided through NHS 111, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.""

How it feels to quit a party,"What will the MPs who have quit their parties to form a new centrist group in Parliament be feeling right now? Scared? Relieved? Excited? Or filled with sadness and even a touch of regret? It was easy to see all of those emotions on display at the press conferences - two days apart - in which seven Labour MPs and then three Conservatives announced that they were quitting (the 11th member of the group, Joan Ryan, did not hold a press conference of her own). But the tone of the two events was different. The Labour defectors all spoke about what the Labour Party meant to them, how they had joined it as young people, filled with idealism and a desire to improve the lives of working people. But, they said, the party had changed beyond all recognition under Jeremy Corbyn and they could no longer be part of it. In other words: ""It's not me, it's you."" Three Tory MPs join breakaway group Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group Minor tremor or political earthquake? Mike Gapes: Labour to my core Mike Gapes - Labour MP for Ilford South since 1992 and a party member since 1968 - was, perhaps understandably, the most visibly moved by the occasion. ""I have always considered myself Labour to my core. I grew up in a working-class family, in a council house in Chigwell, in Essex,"" he told the audience. He spoke about his father, ""a postman and trade union branch secretary"", and how he had served the party ""at every level"" in his long career. Angela Smith spoke at length about her working-class parents and how as a young girl she had cheered for then Labour leader Harold Wilson in 1966, when the rest of the country had been cheering England on in the World Cup. Others were less sentimental about Labour. Chuka Umunna said he was fed up with the ""old tribal politics"", adding: ""You don't join a political party to spend years and years fighting the people in it."" Heidi Allen: I feel excited There were mixed emotions at the Conservative event too, with Anna Soubry clearly finding it difficult at times, but there was a lot of laughter too, and less talk about family and background. Heidi Allen, who opened the event, was upbeat and business-like, as if she was leaving a job rather than breaking up a family. ""I feel excited, so excited. In a way that I haven't felt since I was first elected - and a sense of liberation,"" said the former Tory MP, who described the breakaway group as the ""three Amigos"". Ms Allen does not have deep roots in the Conservative Party - she joined it in 2011 - after a successful career in business. The Conservative Party - rather than a creed or a way of life - had been a career choice for her, she said. And she had been inspired to ""serve my country"" by the 2011 London riots, having previously had no interest in politics. Like fellow defector, Sarah Wollaston Ms Allen was a product of David Cameron's efforts to open up the Conservative Party to a more diverse and interesting range of MPs, with real-life experience. Dr Wollaston, a GP, was the first Conservative MP to be selected in a US-style open primary, a postal ballot of everyone in her Totnes constituency, in 2009. Anna Soubry: A considerable amount of heartache Ms Allen also took part in an open primary, in South East Cambridgeshire, which she narrowly lost, before being selected to replace the retiring Andrew Lansley in South Cambridgeshire. Both have proved to be far too independent-minded for the Conservative Party whips, perhaps feeling they owe their first loyalty to their constituents rather than the party. And Dr Wollaston said she would not put herself forward as a Tory candidate now - because the party had changed so much. The open primary system, meanwhile, appears to have been dropped. And it was clear from Anna Soubry's speech that all three believe Mr Cameron's attempt to modernise the Conservative Party is equally dead in the water. Mr Cameron - in a rare public comment - said he had backed open primaries and he respected the decision of Dr Wollaston and Ms Allen to quit the party but he disagreed with them. ""We need strong voices at every level of the party calling for the modern, compassionate Conservatism that saw the Conservative Party return to office,"" said the former Tory leader. Anna Soubry told the Times Red Box podcast Mr Cameron made a last-ditch bid to try to stop the three from quitting, sending them a text saying: ""Is it too late to persuade you to stay?"" Ms Soubry - who first joined the Conservatives as a student in the 1970s - was more sentimental about the party, in her speech. ""You don't leave a political party you have called home, without a great deal of thought and a considerable amount of heartache,"" she said. But, she added, she had always been a member of the pro-EU ""one-nation"" Tory faction and now the party was entirely run by the ""awkward squad"" of hard Brexiteers in the European Research Group. What does Theresa May make of it all? The ERG, which is headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, is arguably far more in tune with the Conservative Party membership - who, polls suggest, are a Eurosceptic bunch (although the defectors say this is because local branches are being ""infiltrated"" by former UKIP members). What Theresa May makes of all this is anybody's guess. As Tom McTaguepointed out in a piece for Politico,external, even her closest associates have trouble working out what she thinks. But she is someone who puts a high value on party loyalty. To a far greater extent, perhaps, than the MPs who have now walked out of it, the Conservative Party has been her life. She met her husband, Philip, at a Tory party dance, at Oxford University, and she is thought to do most of her socialising with fellow party members. Leaving a political party because you profoundly disagree with the direction it is taking might seem an obvious thing to do for those of us who have never been a member of one, let alone an MP. But it is not as straightforward as that for some. And factors such as family tradition, loyalty to friends, and the sheer amount of time and work devoted to the cause - even if you no longer believe in it -  will be playing on the minds of MPs thinking of joining the breakaway group in the coming days.

Political tremor or earthquake?,"Are the tectonic plates of British politics moving with the formation of a new ""centrist"" group in Parliament - or are we experiencing a minor tremor? It's too soon to say - but that won't stop some MPs and commentators declaiming as though they were expert political seismologists. So let's stand back and examine the landscape. A split is quite an easy thing to understand. Three Tory MPs join breakaway group Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group But currently there are fissures that run all the way through British politics and which makes the future look far from stable. The addition of three Conservative MPs to the ranks of eight Labour defectors could, on the surface, look like the breaking of the British political mould. But let's examine the multiple fissures more closely. Momentum - the influential group of Labour left wingers - has denounced the nascent political grouping as neo-liberal Blairites and Tories. Yet not many ""Blairites"" or centrists have, as yet, signed up to this project. One reason is Brexit - the primary reason for the breakaway, according to defecting former Labour MP Chris Leslie. Senior members of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum - who most people would regard as ardent supporters of the last Labour government - pleaded for months with Chuka Umunna not to set up a breakaway group before Brexit had been settled one way or another. They did not want People's Vote to be seen as a de facto new party because they felt this might breed suspicion among left-wing Labour Party members who are far more pro-EU than their party leader. Leading lights in the People's Vote campaign wanted to detach these Labour members from Mr Corbyn, so that they could back a new referendum without feeling disloyal. But the defectors have gone over the top now - they have formed what looks like the beginning of a new party. They might have been able to take more ""centrists"" with them had they waited. But timing and tactics aren't the only divisions amongst the so-called ""centrists"" in Parliament. This is an over simplification but essentially the centrists split in to two groups. First, the defectors, along with those who are all but ready to defect or for whom it wouldn't take much to push over the brink that they have precariously occupied. And secondly, those who will ""stay and fight"". The success of the breakaway will - in part - depend on how many will move from group two to group one. Essentially, the current fissure is based on those for whom ""stop Corbyn"" is their overriding objective - and those whose fundamental deep seated raison d'etre is to Stop the Tories. And the sight today of former Labour MP Ann Coffey chatting away, in apparently chummy terms, to former Conservative Sarah Wollaston on the same Parliamentary bench will make it more difficult, not less, for the Independents to attract further Labour support. Having said that, I still expect to see a few more defectors - the Labour leadership expect a dozen in total to go. Incidentally, it may also limit the appeal to those Labour voters long uncomfortable with Mr Corbyn but who have felt they had nowhere else to go. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told me the story of when he canvassed a voter very disillusioned with his party on a number of issues including immigration. ""I was thinking of backing the BNP then I thought 'naw, that would just let the Tories in'"", said the voter. In some parts of the country a group which takes in former Labour and Conservative MPs could be seen as refreshing - but in others it will be toxic. The Conservative defections have also allowed abrasive left wingers to say they were right all along to paint Chuka Umunna and chums as ""red Tories"". There is a debate in Labour leadership circles about whether to call another confidence vote in the government, in the hope that the new group will vote with Theresa May and be depicted not so much as red Tories but actual Tories. One prominent ""centrist"" Labour MP told me privately he was pleased some of his colleagues had gone as he would no longer himself be ""tarred"" with the accusation that he would leave - or that his loyalty wasn't first and foremost to the party. But there are also divisions within the Left on how to handle this. Is it better to be conciliatory and try to address not just the defections but the causes of them? This is the approach favoured not only by Dave Prentis - the general secretary of Britain's largest union Unison - but privately by some much closer to Mr Corbyn. But others want to ""clean out the stables"" and step up the de-selection of the Corbyn critics who remain in the party. Some close to the leadership do not want this to happen - but admit that controlling some of the activists who have joined the party in recent times isn't an easy task. One left-wing insider told me that they had been genuinely shocked at some of the examples of anti-Semitism in the party but trying to convince some rank and file members that the allegations and investigations were not part of an anti-Corbyn plot was a forlorn task. So the number of future defectors may depend on how disciplined and measured the reaction is from the Labour leadership's supporters in local parties. Some MPs could yet feel ""forced out"". Where the Left is united is in calling for the defectors to stand down as MPs and fight by-elections. Many of those MPs have large majorities and, don't forget, many of them would - as we revealed at the last election - have barely mentioned the Labour leader in their 2017 campaign literature and instead punted the message that Theresa May needed reining in. And both Shirley Williams and Roy Jenkins scored spectacular (but short lived) by-election victories in the early days of the Social Democratic Party, which broke away from Labour in the early 1980s. So the Left may have to be careful what they wish for. A couple of members of the new Independent Group are said to be considering putting themselves in front of the electorate. But this is high risk. So far, we know more about what this new group is against than for. ( Indeed although they are currently all pro EU some of their potential future members are much more Eurosceptic.) And possibly for former Labour MPs the biggest risk in a by-election would not be defeat by their old party but so dividing the centre-left vote that a Conservative wins. That might do more to herd some potential defectors back in to their Labour fold. Any anti-Brexit former Tories would face a brutal campaign which would seek to rally pro-Brexit voters by portraying the defectors as part of a political establishment which would betray the verdict of the people. But perhaps the way the new Independent Group might change the political dynamic is this - their mere existence tells the leadership of the traditional parties that if they don't listen to the concerns of their parliamentarians they - and some their voters - really do have somewhere else to go. So they present a challenge to those at the top of the existing parties. How - and if - the leaderships of these parties change could determine whether the defections eventually register on the political Richter scale.

'Sit-on-shelf' hope for Irish no-deal plan,"This video can not be played Simon Coveney said he hoped the legislation ""proves redundant"" The Irish deputy prime minister has said he hopes that major legislation his government has prepared to manage a no-deal Brexit will never be used. Simon Coveney unveiled the wide-ranging bill on Friday, bringing together work by nine government departments. He said a ""disorderly"" Brexit would be a ""lose, lose, lose"" for the UK, the EU and the Republic of Ireland. His aim for the emergency proposals is to ensure a smooth transition should the UK leave the EU without a deal. Ireland and the EU: A special case What does Ireland do if there's no deal? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The legislation,externalis designed to support businesses and to protect jobs, essential services and citizens' rights. It is envisaged that it will be fast-tracked through the Irish parliament and be signed into law before 29 March, when the UK is due to leave the EU. Mr Coveney said he hoped it ""proves redundant"" and his ""only desire"" was to see it sit ""on the shelf"". ""A no-deal Brexit will be a major shock for the Irish economy,"" he added. Dublin Port has been preparing for a no-deal Brexit scenario A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame May reaches out to Remainer rebels Threat of no-deal Brexit 'focusing minds' ""We cannot offset all the damage it will do, but we are doing everything we can. ""This legislation is the product of a root-and-branch trawl of our laws to determine what changes will be needed if the UK becomes a third country overnight."" The 70-page bill is one of the most elaborate pieces of legislation ever brought forward by an Irish government. But the complexities of Brexit mean that Dublin hopes the hard work will go to waste. Simon Coveney says he still believes there will be a deal between the UK and the EU, but Ireland must be as prepared as possible for the other scenario. The legislation covers matters under the remit of nine ministers - a big range of topics, from energy to extraditions. However, the most tricky issue of all - the future of the land border with Northern Ireland - doesn't feature. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said his government was doing ""all we can to avoid a no deal scenario but we need to be ready in case it does happen"". ""This special law enables us to mitigate against some of the worst effects of no deal by protecting citizens' rights, security and facilitating extra supports for vulnerable businesses and employers,"" he added. Some of the main provisions of the legislation are: Justice - maintaining existing extradition arrangements Health - allowing citizens to be able to continue access services in the other jurisdiction Social welfare - enabling pensions and other benefits to continue to be paid Energy - giving the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities the powers to deal with unusual market activity on the all-Ireland electricity network Transport - allowing cross-border rail and bus services to continue The opposition parties in the Republic of Ireland are to be briefed on the measures, as their support may be necessary to get the bill passed. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said that the absence of a plan for customs checkpoints at the Irish border - ""the sort of border infrastructure that some in Dublin and Brussels have been having nightmares about"" - was proof that there was ""no need for the type of borders we knew"" during the Northern Ireland Troubles. ""No-one is building a so-called hard border or going back to checkpoints with soldiers,"" added the East Antrim politician. ""Such talk was rhetoric designed to ferment fear in genuine communities along both sides of the border."" How is Dublin preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit?

Australian jailed for car rampage murders,"James Gargasoulas drove his car into pedestrians in Melbourne in 2017 An Australian man has been sentenced to life in jail for murdering six people and injuring 27 more in a vehicle attack in Melbourne. James Gargasoulas, 29, deliberately ploughed a stolen car into pedestrians in the city centre in January 2017. He later told a court in a confusing speech that he had carried out the attack after receiving a premonition. On Friday, a judge described it as one of the worst mass murders in Australian history. ""You made no attempt to avoid people or to slow down. You simply ploughed through them, quite deliberately,"" Justice Mark Weinberg said, according toa report by Seven News,external. The attack killed three-month-old Zachary Bryant, Thalia Hakin, 10, Jess Mudie, 22, Yosuke Kanno, 25, Bhavita Patel, 33, and Matthew Si, 33. Gargasoulas will be eligible for parole after 46 years. This video can not be played Footage showed Gargasoulas driving erratically before the attack He had pleaded not guilty to the attack on busy Bourke St, but later admitted to carrying it out. During his trial last year, a jury was shown graphic footage of Gargasoulas, also known by the name Dimitrious, targeting pedestrians at speeds of more than 60km/h (37mph). His youngest victim, Zachary Bryant, was struck alongside his sister in a double pram. Miraculously, two-year-old Zara somehow survived being thrown 150m (500ft) through the air. Other footage showed Gargasoulas driving erratically beforehand, as dozens of bystanders watched on. Gargasoulas testified that he had received a premonition from God directing him to drive into pedestrians. When asked whether he knew he would kill people, he said: ""In a sense, yes."" He also read a two-page statement - cut down from 25 pages - in which he apologised for his actions, but also rambled about subjects such as the ""Illuminati"" and government ""oppression"". A jury took less than an hour to convict him last year, after what prosecutors called ""the clearest case of criminal liability that you will ever come across"". This video can not be played Can vehicle attacks be prevented? In his sentencing remarks, Justice Weinberg said Gargasoulas's actions were not caused by mental illness, noting the killer had been in a drug-induced psychosis at the time. ""You knew full well what you were doing,"" Justice Weinberg said. Several relatives of the victims had spoken of their devastation in court. Zachary's father, Matthew Bryant, said: ""I listened to his heartbeat and held him for the last time trying desperately to hold onto the moment. He had a lifetime of firsts taken from him and all the joys that come with it."" Masayuki and Minako Kanno said they were living in ""deep pain and sorrow"" after the death of their son, Yosuke, a Japanese student who had been studying in Melbourne. A makeshift memorial in 2017 featuring photos of victims Matthew Si and Jess Mudie The city later installed concrete bollardsand added more security measures, howeverit was rocked by another vehicle attack in December 2017. Three months ago,Bourke St was the scene of an unrelated terror incidentthat left one victim dead and two others injured.

Japan probe touches down on asteroid,"Artwork: Hayabusa-2 successfully touched down on asteroid Ryugu A Japanese spacecraft has touched down on an asteroid in an attempt to collect a sample of rock from the surface. The Hayabusa-2 probe was trying to grab the sample from a pre-chosen site on the asteroid Ryugu just before 23:00 GMT on 21 February. The spacecraft reached asteroid Ryugu in June 2018 after a three-and-a-half-year journey from Earth. Hayabusa-2 is expected to return to Earth in 2020 along with its rocky hoard. During sample collection, the spacecraft approached the 1km-wide asteroid with an instrument called the sampler horn. On touchdown, a 5g ""bullet"" made of the metal tantalum was fired into the rocky surface at 300m/s. The particles kicked up by the impact should have been be caught by the sampler horn. ""We made a successful touchdown, including firing a bullet,"" said Hayabusa-2 project manager Yuichi Tsuda. ""We made the ideal touchdown in the best conditions,"" he said. There were celebrations in the control room in Sagamihara, Japan The spacecraft began descending from its ""home position"" of 20km above the asteroid's surface in the early hours of 21 February (GMT) - several hours later than planned. Japan sets date for asteroid 'rock grab' Ryugu belongs to a particularly primitive type of space rock known as a C-type. The near-Earth asteroid (NEA) is a relic left over from the early days of our Solar System. The red arrow shows the location of the target marker on the surface Prof Alan Fitzsimmons, from Queen's University Belfast, told BBC News: ""We think we understand how carbon-rich asteroids migrate from the asteroid belt to become near-Earth asteroids, but the samples from Ryugu will allow its history to be explored. ""After the Rosetta mission, it's now clear that most of Earth's water did not come from comets in the early days of the Solar System. We believe carbon-rich (C-type) asteroids may have significant amounts of water locked up in their rocks. It's possible such asteroids may have brought to Earth both the water and the organic material necessary for life to start. ""These samples will be crucial in investigating this possibility.""

Hayabusa-2 had earlier dropped a small, reflective, beanbag-like ""target marker"" on to Ryugu. This was used as a guide as the spacecraft descended to the rough surface of the asteroid. Controllers were aiming for the centre of a circle, some 6m in diameter, located about 4-5m away from the target marker. The Japanese space agency (Jaxa) had originally planned to carry out the touchdown operation in October last year. But the asteroid's surface was found to be much more rugged than expected, with numerous, hefty boulders making it hard to find a location that was large and flat enough to sample. Controllers had hoped they would have an area of about 100m in diameter to target. But because of the surface properties, this had to be reduced to a 6m circle for what team members are calling a ""pinpoint touchdown"". The sampler horn that extends out from the bottom of the spacecraft has a length of 1m. It's therefore vital that there are no boulders more than 50cm in height at the landing site, to reduce the chances that the body of the spacecraft could hit a rock. The sampler horn will be used to collect material for delivery to Earth in 2020 Unexpected surface properties also have the potential to affect the amount of material collected. Before arriving at Ryugu, researchers had expected the surface to be covered in a powdery layer of fine-grained material - the regolith. In fact, the upper layer turned out to be akin to gravel, consisting of rocky chunks that are centimetre-sized or larger. Prof Fitzsimmons told BBC News: ""This was a surprise, as other near-Earth asteroids we have visited previously have shown areas dominated by small particles. ""It might be due to the carbon-rich composition, as the previous NEAs are composed of silicate rock, which are more Earth-like. But the shape of Ryugu also implies it was spinning much faster in the past, so it's possible this could have affected the particles' sizes in some fashion."" Scientists carried out additional tests in Japan to determine whether the sample material could still be gathered by the spacecraft. They used a container of artificial gravel with a similar size distribution to that on Ryugu. In a vacuum chamber, they fired a tantalum bullet identical to that used by Hayabusa-2 into the gravel.

According to Jaxa, the results of the test exceeded expectations, with the tantalum projectile yielding fragments of rock in size ranges that should easily pass through the sampler horn. This suggests that Hayabusa-2 should have been able to collect a sample. In September, Hayabusa-2 deployed two robotic ""hoppers"" that propelled themselves across the surface of Ryugu, sending back images and other data. Then, in October, the ""mothership"" despatched a French-German instrument package called Mascot to the surface. Later this year, perhaps in March or April, Jaxa plans to detonate an explosive charge that will punch a crater into the surface of Ryugu. Hayabusa-2 would then descend into the crater to collect fresh samples of material that have not been altered by aeons of exposure to space. ""We know that the surfaces of asteroids are changed over time by bombardment with energetic particles from the Sun and interstellar space,"" said Alan Fitzsimmons. ""Yet studies with telescopes show that this 'space weathering' affects the surfaces of carbon-rich asteroids differently to those mostly made from more rock-like silicate minerals. We don't know why this is, and the fresh sub-surface samples from Ruygu will play a very important role in understanding how this happens.""

Fly-past honours bomber-crash crewThe Remember The Ten fly-past in Sheffield was organised after a BBC presenter's chance meeting in a park.Sheffield & South Yorkshire,"This video can not be played The flypast was watched by Tony Foulds, who tends the memorial to the 10 men who died Thousands of people cheered a flypast honouring 10 airmen who died when their plane crashed in a park 75 years ago. The US bomber came down in Endcliffe Park, Sheffield on 22 February 1944, killing everyone on board. A campaign for a flypast started after a chance meeting between BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Tony Foulds, who tends a park memorial. A tearful Mr Foulds was given a rousing round of applause as the planes flew over. He said: ""This is unbelievable."" Relatives of the aircrew and thousands of people from across Britain paid their respects as the planes roared over the memorial at about 08:45 GMT. Remember The Ten flypast: Live updates Speaking onBBC Breakfast,external, Mr Foulds told the crowds: ""Thank you very much for coming, it's lovely to see you."" Mr Foulds also met the families of some of the airmen who lost their lives in the crash 75 years ago and said they were ""lovely, lovely people"". He added: ""I never thought I would ever meet any of the families of this pilot and crew."" The flypast proved an emotional moment for Mr Walker, who is currently training for a Sport Relief Challenge in Tanzania. He managed to watch the event and tweeted: ""I can't talk.""

The flypast involved military aircraft from Britain and the United States, who set off from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk - home to the largest US Air Force base in the UK. Speaking in Tanzania, Mr Walker told Mr Foulds: ""The last six weeks have been remarkable from my point of view. ""I know you jokingly asked everybody for a tenner who are there at the park today, but it's not about the money, it's never been about you. ""Tony, it's always been about those 10 men who you think saved your life 75 years ago."" Tony Foulds waved at the aircraft as they flew past Endclliffe Park Thousands of people gathered to watch the flypast Six terms related to the flypast - Tony Foulds, Endcliffe Park, #TonyGotAFlypast #RememberTheTen #MiAmigo75th and #sheffieldflypast - trended on Twitter on Friday. Mr Foulds said he and the other children were in the park 75 years ago because boys from two rival junior schools were fighting. Of the airmen on board the B-17 Flying Fortress, known as Mi Amigo, he said: ""If it hadn't been for them, I wouldn't be here with my family. ""It's more than bravery, what they did. They saved me, and I mean saved me. ""These are now part of my family, my ashes are going to be put by the memorial. I might as well stay with them, you know."" All 10 airmen who were on board the B-17 Flying Fortress were killed on 22 February 1944 Mr Walker, who met Mr Foulds while he was walking his dog in the park, described him as an ""amazing man"" after hearing his story in early January. Mr Foulds was eight when he witnessed Mi Amigo crash and explode in the park as the pilot apparently tried to avoid him and his friends. A social media-led campaign subsequently went transatlantic and a flypast was successfully organised along with new steps and a flagpole for the crash memorial. As the flypast took place wreaths were laid at the graves of three of the American airmen who died in the crash. Three of the 10 crew of the B-17 Flying Fortress, Mi Amigo, are interred at Cambridge American Cemetery. The headstones of Staff Sergeant Harry W Estabrooks, Sergeant Maurice D Robbins and Sergeant Charles H Tuttle were dressed on Friday with sand from Omaha Beach in Normandy, France. Huge crowds gathered in Endcliffe Park Mr Foulds said he felt responsible, because the plane was trying to avoid crashing into him. Referring to his regular visits to the memorial, he said: ""They are my family. I love them to pieces. ""If I go on holiday I always make sure my son goes to visit. I always tell them how I am, what I'm doing, what the weather's like."" Crashed bomber fly-past campaign starts Fly-past planned to mark crashed bomber Flying Fortress crash memorial held Julia Johnson, who was among the crowds, said she had cried when she heard Mr Foulds' story and travelled up from London for the event. Ms Johnson said: ""I saw the article on the BBC website about Tony and the hard work and felt I really wanted to be here on the day, regardless of the flypast."" The florist said she had also offered to make a wreath for the servicemen who died in the crash.

"PTSD affects 'one in 13 by age of 18'Researchers say, with many young people not receiving support, the study should be a ""wake-up call"".Health","One in 13 young people in England and Wales experiences post-traumatic stress disorder by the age of 18, the first research of its kind suggests. A study of more than 2,000 18-year-olds found nearly a third had experienced trauma in childhood. And a quarter of these then developed PTSD, which can cause insomnia, flashbacks and feelings of isolation. Researchers say, with many young people not receiving the support they need, the study should be a ""wake-up call"". Thestudy, published in The Lancet Psychiatry,external, found slightly more than half of those who had had PTSD - an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events  - had also experienced a major depressive episode and one in five had attempted suicide. But only the same proportion - one in five - had been seen by a mental health professional in the past year. Improving child mental health 'years off' Youth mental health report in charts Child mental health referrals 'up 26%' Lead researcher Dr Stephanie Lewis, a Medical Research Council-funded researcher at the King's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, said: ""Providing effective treatments early on could prevent mental health problems continuing into adulthood."" Flo Sharman had life-saving surgery as a baby, which doctors now believe led to her PTSD Flo Sharman, 20, had a breakdown at the age of eight that left her housebound. But it was only when she was 16 that neurologists concluded that breakdown was linked to something that had happened to her as a baby. At four months old, Flo had a life-saving operation to remove parts of her stomach - to treat her serious acid reflux, which affected her ability to breathe. The condition had led to her needing to be resuscitated on many occasions, Flo said. Doctors now believe her breakdown was caused by PTSD, a delayed reaction to the trauma she experienced as a baby, even though she has no conscious memory of what happened. She says: ""When I had that life-saving surgery and the traumatic experiences in hospital, my parents weren't told you could have post-traumatic stress disorder because of the surgery and the time in hospital. ""They had no idea that this mental breakdown would happen. It was a real shock."" Flo still has PTSD, which she says many people wrongly think affects only those in the armed forces. ""People don't really associate PTSD with a young child - and that has to change,"" she adds. Participants in the study were judged to have had PTSD only if they had had all of the following symptoms for at least a month: reliving traumatic events through distressing memories or nightmares avoiding anything reminding them of their trauma feelings of guilt, isolation or detachment irritability, impulsivity or difficulty concentrating Experiences of childhood trauma included assault, sexual assault, injury or an event that had affected someone they knew but they had not directly witnessed. Senior researcher Prof Andrea Danese, from the King's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, said: ""Our findings should serve as a wake-up call. ""Childhood trauma is a public-health concern - yet trauma-related disorders often go unnoticed. ""Young people with PTSD are falling through the gaps in care and there is a pressing need for better access to mental health services."" Being caught up in a traumatic event that is overwhelming, frightening and life-threatening can lead to PTSD The symptoms usually start within a few weeks of the trauma but they can start later After the traumatic event, people can feel grief-stricken, depressed, anxious, guilty and angry People may have flashbacks and nightmares People may be 'on guard' - staying alert all the time Physical symptoms can be aches and pains, diarrhoea, irregular heartbeats, headaches, feelings of panic and fear, depression People may start drinking too much alcohol or using drugs (including painkillers) Source:Royal College of Psychiatrists,external Prof Danese said people should not be ""alarmed"" by the study's findings and it was normal to have some psychological symptoms after trauma. In the ""vast majority"" of cases, these symptoms would recede in a matter of days or weeks, he said. But if children and young people had them for over a month, parents should seek help from their GP. PTSD can be successfully treated - even when it develops many years after a traumatic event - with treatments including talking therapies and antidepressants. Dr Tim Dalgleish, from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the research, said the results of the ""landmark study"" were ""sobering"". ""Of particular concern is the relatively small proportion of affected youth who go on to access formal support or mental health services and the findings are a further wake-up call that service provision in the UK for children and adolescents dealing with the aftermath of trauma is woefully inadequate,"" he said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""The NHS Long Term Plan has committed to prioritising increasing the funding for children and young people's mental health services faster than all other funding. ""As a result, 345,000 more children and young people have access to mental health services and support in schools and colleges, young adults will receive better support until the age of 25 and crisis care will be provided through NHS 111, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.""

Churches can get rid of Sunday services,"Churches such as St Mark's in Englefield, Berkshire, will no longer have to stage a Sunday service A weekly Sunday service will no longer be compulsory for churches after a vote to change a 400-year-old law was passed by the Church of England's ruling body. The General Synod voted to end the law - dating back to 1603 - which required priests to hold a Sunday service in every church they looked after. The Bishop of Willesden, who proposed the change, called it ""out of date"". Meanwhile, the General Synod has introduced six ""pastoral principles"" to improve the treatment of LGBT people. 'Let us pay' - churches try contactless First female bishop takes new role Church service to mark gender transition Decades of falling church attendances have left some priests looking after up to 20 rural churches. Previously, a rural priest would need to apply for permission from a bishop to not hold a Sunday service in each church. The Bishop of Willesden - the Right Reverend Pete Broadbent - chairs the Simplification Task Force formed in 2014 to improve the process of the Church of England. He said changing the law reflected the current practice of priests who look after multiple churches. Following the vote, he said: ""You're meant to get a dispensation from the bishop - this just changes the rules to make it easier for people to do what they're already doing. It stops the bureaucracy. ""This was just one (amendment) where we said, 'Out of date, doesn't work, we're operating differently in the countryside now, therefore let's find a way of making it work.'"" When asked if the decision would affect elderly churchgoers in rural locations, who might have to travel further to attend a service, Rev Broadbent said: ""No, because at the moment this is already regularised and it's already happening."" Rev Hudson-Wilkin: ""Thursday is the new Sunday"" The Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, a chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, said although it was ""wonderful"" to have ""that one day where everyone can concentrate"", the Church had to be realistic about people's day to day lives. ""Times are changing - it is not just about a shortage of clergy but also the fact that people work on a Sunday,"" she said. ""There is no use in crying over spilt milk. We need to find creative ways to worship."" She added that at her churches ""Thursday is the new Sunday"". This video can not be played Young, gay and Christian At the meeting of the General Synod on Thursday, a document outlining six principles to help improve the treatment of LGBT people was released. It said the Church had been ""found wanting in its welcome and treatment of LGBTI+ people"". The ""pastoral principles"" aim to encourage churches to see ""difference as a gift rather than a problem"", and build ""trust"" and ""generosity"". The principles encourage people to acknowledge their prejudice, make churches places of welcome, conduct theological discussions with respect, ""cast out"" fear, extend courtesy and kindness to all and refuse to exploit power over others. The document added that adopting the six principles ""could be transformative for the Church"" but would ""require a change of culture in terms of the quality of our relationships"".

May meets Remainer rebels,"Theresa May has held meetings with leading Tory Remainers, amid speculation about further defections. Justine Greening and Phillip Lee say Mrs May has ignored requests from pro-EU Tory MPs in favour of Brexiteers. The pair had separate meetings with the PM in Downing Street. Meanwhile, one ex-Labour member of the new Independent Group of MPs has said it could help keep Mrs May in power on condition that she agreed to another EU referendum with Remain as an option. However, the PM was focused on her own party on Thursday, as she met cabinet ministers David Gauke and Greg Clark. The pair have warned of the dangers to business of leaving the EU without a formal deal, an option which Brexiteers in the European Research Group of Conservative MPs insist must be preserved as negotiating leverage in Brussels. Thegovernment said on Thursday that talks would continue ""urgently""at a technical level, following ""productive"" meetings involving Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? What does it feel like to quit a party? Nicholas Watt: A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame In the UK, ex-Labour MP Gavin Shukertold The Huffington Post,externalmembers of the new Independent Group had first made the offer of a potential confidence and supply agreement - like the one the DUP has with the government - last month in a meeting with the PM's second-in-command David Lidington. Then-Labour MPs Chris Leslie, Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, along with then-Tory Anna Soubry, who have all joined the group this week, were also at the meeting. Mr Shuker said he had told Mr Lidington he would support any type of deal provided there was a ""confirmatory referendum"" to get public backing but that the offer was rejected. Phillip Lee met Theresa May for talks in Downing Street The leaders of both main parties are battling to prevent more defections after eight Labour MPs and three Tories broke away to form a new ""centrist"" group in Parliament. Theresa May has written to the three Tory defectors - Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston - to reject what she describes as the ""picture they paint of the party"", saying its record on the NHS, employment and diversity proved it was ""moderate"" and ""open-hearted"". The prime minister offered to ""continue to work together on issues"" where they agree - but told the three she rejected ""the parallel you draw with the way Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left have warped a once-proud Labour Party"". In response to their claim that local Tory associations are being taken over by former UKIP members, Mrs May said: ""An open, broad party should always welcome new members and supporters with a range of views, including those who have previously supported other parties.""

But she said local party branches had been warned to ensure new members support the party's ""values and objectives"". Ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen, one of the three defectors from the party, told ITV's Peston programme ""a third"" of Conservative MPs were fed up with the party's direction. Ms Greening and Mr Lee, who quit as a justice minister over Brexit, have been named by Ms Allen as potential future defectors to the Independent Group. The Right to Vote group, which is chaired by Mr Lee, said he had discussed the campaign's calls for a pause in the Brexit process and a possible second referendum with Mrs May. ""Talks were open and we are encouraged she listened to our case,"" the group said. This video can not be played ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the EU"" Mr Lee has said one of the reasons the Tory MPs decided to quit the party was the access the Brexiteer European Research Group got to the prime minister, who he said had refused to meet his wing of the party. Justine Greening - a former education secretary - told the Today programme she had been tempted to break away from the Conservative Party and join the Independent Group. ""It is something that I have considered, but I have reached a different conclusion for the moment,"" Ms Greening told Today. ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the European Union."" The Independent Group was set up by eight defecting Labour MPs unhappy with their party's handling of Brexit and anti-Semitism. They were later joined by three pro-Remain Tories - who accuse the Conservative leadership of allowing right-wing hardliners to shape the party's approach to Brexit and other matters. Labour's Ian Austin also expressed sympathy with the Independent Group's aims, saying he would think ""long and hard"" about his future in the Labour Party. Shadow home Secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I am very sad that the Labour members of this new independent organisation have gone. ""Up until the last minute, people were talking to them, trying to persuade them not to take the step they have taken."" She said she hoped they would continue to work with Labour on issues like homelessness, the benefit system, the NHS and ""most of all fighting this Tory Brexit"". Meanwhile, Labour have contacted the Information Commissioner over alleged attempts to access personal data held by the party. It is understood there are concerns an MP accessed party systems to contact members after reports of their resignation on Tuesday night. Enfield North MP Joan Ryan, who announced she was quitting Labour in an interview with the Times published on Tuesday evening, said: ""Neither I nor my office have accessed or used any Labour Party data since I resigned the Labour Whip and my membership of the Labour Party.""

Will funding changes limit student places?Universities warn courses may close if tuition fees are cut and not replaced with government money.Family & Education,"Universities will have to offer fewer places if cuts in tuition fees are not replaced by government money, say leading research universities. A funding review of post 18 study is expected to be published next month. The Russell Group, and seven charities, want ministers to rule out an overall drop in funding. The government says job prospects and drop out rates are as important as fair access. An independent panel, led by Philip Augar, has been asked to look at whether the current system offers value for money for students and taxpayers in England. Tuition fees are now the main source of funding for universities. Universities receive Â£9,250 a year per student, up front - to meet teaching costs. The Russell Group of research focused universities argues that some courses will close if tuition fees are cut, and not replaced with taxpayer funding. Colin Bailey, the Principal of Queen Mary University in London, says they break even overall on the cost of teaching home students under the current system, but if tuition fees were reduced that would change. ""We would have to reduce our places, because there are only so many courses you can run at a loss. ""Therefore there would be a de facto cap on numbers. There will be some courses which would be under pressure."" Universities already receive top up cash from the government for courses that are very expensive to teach, such as engineering and medicine. That is likely to continue whatever the panel recommends. Universities are worried about potential tuition fee reductions in subjects such as English, history or languages, which might not attract a government top up. In a statement backed by seven charities that help low income students into university, the Russell Group says a reduction in places could lead to fewer students from poorer backgrounds getting places. ""The more privileged students will get the places, because some of the poorer students may not get the three As or have the same family support"", says Colin Bailey from Queen Mary University. Labour pledges to protect universities Rich students save by paying fees up front University a 'false promise' for too many Anand Shukla is the chief executive of Brightside, one of the charities that has also signed the statement. ""We are concerned that if a cut to tuition fees leads to an overall cut in university funding, then efforts to improve social mobility will go into reverse. "" These arguments are likely to face a strong push back from the government, which has ruled out any cap on numbers. Ministers may also point to recent data on graduate earnings. While a degree from a high profile university, such as those in the Russell Group, can lead to a significant increase in how much you earn - that's not the case across all universities, or degree subjects. The figures published last year suggest thata third of men are going to universities which have a negligible impact on their earningsby the age of 29. In response to the Russell Group's joint statement, the government says there are now record numbers of disadvantaged students and the review is intended to make sure there are no barriers to going to university. The Department for Education said: ""We need the access and participation work done by universities to ensure all parts of society have fair access."" ""But participation also has to mean successful participation and that means focusing not just on admissions but on progression, dropout rates and ultimately employment."" The Labour Party is committed to getting rid of tuition fees and funding universities directly. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: ""A small cut in tuition fees with no replacement in funding would be the worst of all worlds. ""Students will still face tens of thousands of pounds of debt and those with low incomes would see no benefit at all."" ""Meanwhile, universities will see a sharp cut to their funding, which could create a crisis in the sector"". Tuition fees are the most politically contentious issue being considered by the review panel, but its remit is far wider. Further education colleges in England have been the most cash starved part of education under successive governments, and are also pressing for a rethink on their funding.

US actor's alleged hate hoax 'despicable',"This video can not be played Jussie Smollett: What Chicago Police say happened A Chicago judge has said charges that US actor Jussie Smollett staged a hoax hate crime against himself are ""utterly outrageous"" and ""despicable"" if true. The 36-year-old African-American actor is accused of filing a fake police report claiming he was the victim of a homophobic and racist assault. Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, who is also black, said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose. Police say he staged the attack because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"". The star's lawyers issued a strongly-worded statement after the hearing, calling it an ""organised law enforcement spectacle"" and describing Mr Smollett as ""a young man of impeccable character"". Jussie Smollett emerged from the Cook County Court complex after posting 10% of a $100,000 bond in Chicago ""That symbol conjures up such evil in this country's history,"" Judge Lyke said of a rope that Mr Smollett claimed the attackers had hung round his neck,according to the Chicago Tribune,external. The judge's comments at Thursday's court appearance alluded to the racist lynchings of thousands of black Americans in the post-American Civil War era. Mr Smollett, who stars on the TV series Empire, is suspected of paying two brothers to stage the attack on himself. The siblings are co-operating with the investigation, police say. This video can not be played Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson: ""Smollett dragged city's reputation through mud"" Chicago officials say Mr Smollett also sent a racist letter to himself at a Fox studio before staging the attack. Judge Lyke set Mr Smollett's bail at $100,000 (Â£76,000), which requires him to submit a bond of $10,000 and surrender his passport. Mr Smollett denies the charge of felony disorderly conduct. His lawyers said they would ""mount an aggressive defence"". Timeline of events 'I'm the gay Tupac' Jack Prior, one of the actor's attorneys, told the court the accusations were ""inconsistent with Mr Smollett's character"" and that the actor ""wants nothing more than to clear his name"". If convicted, he could be sentenced to three years in prison and made to pay for the cost of the police investigation. In a news conference earlier on Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lashed out at the ""shameful"" scheme. ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?"" he said. ""How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?"" Supt Johnson accused Mr Smollett of taking ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"". CCTV image released earlier by Chicago police He said Mr Smollett had betrayed the city of Chicago, and said ""this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve"". The ""hoax"", he said, ""received national attention for weeks"", and may deter future hate crime victims from coming forward for fear that their allegations may be met with scepticism. He called upon the actor ""to apologise to this city that he smeared"". ""Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor,"" said Supt Johnson, with palpable anger. ""I'm left hanging my head and asking why,"" he added, describing Mr Smollett's actions as a ""slap in the face"" to Chicagoans. They dismissed Thursday's proceedings as ""an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system"". A statement from the actor's legal team added: ""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election. ""Mr Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing."" Celebrity websites TMZ and Page Six saidthe actor was back on the set of Empire,externalafter the bail hearing. Rallies were held after Mr Smollett first announced the alleged ""attack"" The gay actor said he had gone out to buy food late at night on 29 January from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago city centre when two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults at him. He said they also punched him, poured a chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck. Mr Smollett also claimed the men had told him ""this is Maga country"", referring to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. An outpouring of support followed, including from Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell. In an interview last week with ABC's morning TV show, Mr Smollett tearfully said he had been ""forever changed"" by the alleged incident. Mr Smollett has been a vocal social activist for years But suspicions mounted as police were unable to find any video footage of the incident from over 50 surveillance cameras they reviewed. There were also no witnesses. Investigators managed to track and identify two men who appeared on video footage near where the actor said he had been attacked through a ride-sharing app. The men - Ola and Abel Osundairo - had left the US for Nigeria following the alleged attack and were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned last week. They were released without charges after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"", police said. One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire, a hit Fox show that depicts the lives of a music mogul and his family in Chicago. Police say they have a cheque that Mr Smollett signed and that he had agreed to pay $3,500 for the brothers' participation. Supt Johnson said that Mr Smollett had told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary from Fox. According to the Huffington Post,external, Mr Smollett was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role in Empire, which has about 18 episodes per season. Jussie Smollett (left) pictured in an episode of Empire Investigators said on Thursday that some minor scrapes on Mr Smollett's face were probably self-inflicted. Supt Johnson said Mr Smollett first ""attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language"" to himself at Fox studios. Police had confirmed in early February that white powder - later identified as aspirin - was in the letter. During another news conference on Thursday, police said Mr Smollett had also claimed that three days before the attack he received an unidentified phone call from a man who uttered a homophobic slur then hung up. He told police that incident happened near a surveillance camera. It was the same camera that police say Mr Smollett would later point out to the Osundairo brothers in preparation for the alleged hoax attack. On Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show two people buying materials, including balaclavas, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers. Mr Smollett turned himself in early on Thursday. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which make Empire, issued a statement on Thursday saying they were ""evaluating the situation"" and ""considering our options."" In the aftermath of the attack, Democratic White House hopefuls Cory Booker and Kamala Harris both called the incident a ""modern-day lynching"". Ms Harris, a California senator, on Thursday said she was ""sad, frustrated, and disappointed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Government challenged on children's rights,"The guidance also covers support for runaways A children's charity is taking High Court action against the government over its claims that some protections of children in care are ""myths"". The Article 39 charity is seeking a judicial review of Department for Education guidance to English councils responsible for vulnerable children. The ""myth-busting guide"" suggests some duties around social worker visits, protections for missing children and care leavers' support can be cut back. DfE lawyers approved the guide. The guide, which was published last summer, came from the DfE's innovation unit, which encourages new ways of working in children's social care. It covers the interpretation of legal protections for children in care, care leavers, children who are in custody on remand, and children who go missing or run away. It comes at a time when local authorities are struggling to pay for support for children in need of protection, with a predicted Â£2bn shortfall in children's services budgets by 2020. Release from some of these duties may save them money in the short term, but campaigners say they are important statutory protections which cover some of the most vulnerable children in society. Last year, 50 organisations and social work experts wrote to children's minister Nadhim Zahawi with a detailed analysis of discrepancies between the guide and the statutory position. They asked him to withdraw the guide, but he refused - saying neither the legislation nor the statutory guidance had changed. Director of Article 39, Carolyne Willow, said: ""This document overwrites key obligations within our children's social care system, which were crafted over many years and subject to detailed public consultations. ""The protections the guide presents as mythical exist in our legislation and statutory guidance because of the real needs of children and young people."" Brexit 'could risk children's safety', warn commissioners More children in England at risk of abuse or neglect Â£13m scheme to help vulnerable children She added that nothing in the guidance was about giving children more support. Legal experts at Simpson Millar, acting on behalf of the charity, lodged the High Court action this week. It seeks to have the guidance quashed and removed from circulation. Solicitor Oliver Studdert said: ""In following this guide, local authorities will be denying fundamental support and protection, set out in law, to large numbers of children and young people."" He said it could lead to local authorities acting unlawfully and weaken the protections given to vulnerable children and young people. The parts of the guidance being challenged include: Councils not having to offer a return home interview to children who have run away or gone missing Councils not having to appoint separate social workers to foster carers and children on long-term foster placements Allowing personal advisers to take on local authority duties in respect of young people who continue to live with their foster carers beyond the age of 18 Reductions in the number of social worker visits to children in some foster placements Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Just for Kids Law charity, said: ""We know from our casework that local authorities all too often fail to meet their legal obligations to children and young people, and it should be the government's first priority to ensure that they do, rather than publishing misleading information that could result in even more unlawful behaviour on the part of statutory services."" The Department for Education would not comment directly on the case, but said it had received the application. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said it supported giving experienced professionals the flexibility to try new approaches, as long is it is scrutinised and regulated. He said the guidance had provided helpful advice on where councils could able to do things differently if they felt this was in the best interests of children. And he added: ""But it is important that any questions around the accuracy of elements of this advice are clarified as soon as possible, so that councils and their residents can be confident that any action taken is fully in line with current legislation and guidance.""

Will funding changes limit student places?Universities warn courses may close if tuition fees are cut and not replaced with government money.,"Universities will have to offer fewer places if cuts in tuition fees are not replaced by government money, say leading research universities. A funding review of post 18 study is expected to be published next month. The Russell Group, and seven charities, want ministers to rule out an overall drop in funding. The government says job prospects and drop out rates are as important as fair access. An independent panel, led by Philip Augar, has been asked to look at whether the current system offers value for money for students and taxpayers in England. Tuition fees are now the main source of funding for universities. Universities receive Â£9,250 a year per student, up front - to meet teaching costs. The Russell Group of research focused universities argues that some courses will close if tuition fees are cut, and not replaced with taxpayer funding. Colin Bailey, the Principal of Queen Mary University in London, says they break even overall on the cost of teaching home students under the current system, but if tuition fees were reduced that would change. ""We would have to reduce our places, because there are only so many courses you can run at a loss. ""Therefore there would be a de facto cap on numbers. There will be some courses which would be under pressure."" Universities already receive top up cash from the government for courses that are very expensive to teach, such as engineering and medicine. That is likely to continue whatever the panel recommends. Universities are worried about potential tuition fee reductions in subjects such as English, history or languages, which might not attract a government top up. In a statement backed by seven charities that help low income students into university, the Russell Group says a reduction in places could lead to fewer students from poorer backgrounds getting places. ""The more privileged students will get the places, because some of the poorer students may not get the three As or have the same family support"", says Colin Bailey from Queen Mary University. Labour pledges to protect universities Rich students save by paying fees up front University a 'false promise' for too many Anand Shukla is the chief executive of Brightside, one of the charities that has also signed the statement. ""We are concerned that if a cut to tuition fees leads to an overall cut in university funding, then efforts to improve social mobility will go into reverse. "" These arguments are likely to face a strong push back from the government, which has ruled out any cap on numbers. Ministers may also point to recent data on graduate earnings. While a degree from a high profile university, such as those in the Russell Group, can lead to a significant increase in how much you earn - that's not the case across all universities, or degree subjects. The figures published last year suggest thata third of men are going to universities which have a negligible impact on their earningsby the age of 29. In response to the Russell Group's joint statement, the government says there are now record numbers of disadvantaged students and the review is intended to make sure there are no barriers to going to university. The Department for Education said: ""We need the access and participation work done by universities to ensure all parts of society have fair access."" ""But participation also has to mean successful participation and that means focusing not just on admissions but on progression, dropout rates and ultimately employment."" The Labour Party is committed to getting rid of tuition fees and funding universities directly. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: ""A small cut in tuition fees with no replacement in funding would be the worst of all worlds. ""Students will still face tens of thousands of pounds of debt and those with low incomes would see no benefit at all."" ""Meanwhile, universities will see a sharp cut to their funding, which could create a crisis in the sector"". Tuition fees are the most politically contentious issue being considered by the review panel, but its remit is far wider. Further education colleges in England have been the most cash starved part of education under successive governments, and are also pressing for a rethink on their funding.

Fly-past due to honour bomber-crash crew,"This video can not be played The flypast was watched by Tony Foulds, who tends the memorial to the 10 men who died Thousands of people cheered a flypast honouring 10 airmen who died when their plane crashed in a park 75 years ago. The US bomber came down in Endcliffe Park, Sheffield on 22 February 1944, killing everyone on board. A campaign for a flypast started after a chance meeting between BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Tony Foulds, who tends a park memorial. A tearful Mr Foulds was given a rousing round of applause as the planes flew over. He said: ""This is unbelievable."" Relatives of the aircrew and thousands of people from across Britain paid their respects as the planes roared over the memorial at about 08:45 GMT. Remember The Ten flypast: Live updates Speaking onBBC Breakfast,external, Mr Foulds told the crowds: ""Thank you very much for coming, it's lovely to see you."" Mr Foulds also met the families of some of the airmen who lost their lives in the crash 75 years ago and said they were ""lovely, lovely people"". He added: ""I never thought I would ever meet any of the families of this pilot and crew."" The flypast proved an emotional moment for Mr Walker, who is currently training for a Sport Relief Challenge in Tanzania. He managed to watch the event and tweeted: ""I can't talk.""

The flypast involved military aircraft from Britain and the United States, who set off from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk - home to the largest US Air Force base in the UK. Speaking in Tanzania, Mr Walker told Mr Foulds: ""The last six weeks have been remarkable from my point of view. ""I know you jokingly asked everybody for a tenner who are there at the park today, but it's not about the money, it's never been about you. ""Tony, it's always been about those 10 men who you think saved your life 75 years ago."" Tony Foulds waved at the aircraft as they flew past Endclliffe Park Thousands of people gathered to watch the flypast Six terms related to the flypast - Tony Foulds, Endcliffe Park, #TonyGotAFlypast #RememberTheTen #MiAmigo75th and #sheffieldflypast - trended on Twitter on Friday. Mr Foulds said he and the other children were in the park 75 years ago because boys from two rival junior schools were fighting. Of the airmen on board the B-17 Flying Fortress, known as Mi Amigo, he said: ""If it hadn't been for them, I wouldn't be here with my family. ""It's more than bravery, what they did. They saved me, and I mean saved me. ""These are now part of my family, my ashes are going to be put by the memorial. I might as well stay with them, you know."" All 10 airmen who were on board the B-17 Flying Fortress were killed on 22 February 1944 Mr Walker, who met Mr Foulds while he was walking his dog in the park, described him as an ""amazing man"" after hearing his story in early January. Mr Foulds was eight when he witnessed Mi Amigo crash and explode in the park as the pilot apparently tried to avoid him and his friends. A social media-led campaign subsequently went transatlantic and a flypast was successfully organised along with new steps and a flagpole for the crash memorial. As the flypast took place wreaths were laid at the graves of three of the American airmen who died in the crash. Three of the 10 crew of the B-17 Flying Fortress, Mi Amigo, are interred at Cambridge American Cemetery. The headstones of Staff Sergeant Harry W Estabrooks, Sergeant Maurice D Robbins and Sergeant Charles H Tuttle were dressed on Friday with sand from Omaha Beach in Normandy, France. Huge crowds gathered in Endcliffe Park Mr Foulds said he felt responsible, because the plane was trying to avoid crashing into him. Referring to his regular visits to the memorial, he said: ""They are my family. I love them to pieces. ""If I go on holiday I always make sure my son goes to visit. I always tell them how I am, what I'm doing, what the weather's like."" Crashed bomber fly-past campaign starts Fly-past planned to mark crashed bomber Flying Fortress crash memorial held Julia Johnson, who was among the crowds, said she had cried when she heard Mr Foulds' story and travelled up from London for the event. Ms Johnson said: ""I saw the article on the BBC website about Tony and the hard work and felt I really wanted to be here on the day, regardless of the flypast."" The florist said she had also offered to make a wreath for the servicemen who died in the crash. Mr Foulds regularly tends to the park's memorial and regards the American men who lost their lives as ""family"" Pilot Lt John Kriegshauser, pilot from Missouri 2nd Lt Lyle Curtis, co-pilot from Idaho 2nd Lt John Humphrey, navigator from Illinois Melchor Hernandez, bombardier from California Harry Estabrooks, engineer and gunner from Kansas Charles Tuttle, gunner from Kentucky Robert Mayfield, radio operator from Illinois Vito Ambrosio, gunner from New York Malcolm Williams, gunner from Oklahoma Maurice Robbins, gunner from Texas Capt Lauren Schlichting, a F-15E Strike Eagle pilot who took part in the flypast, said: ""We definitely don't take it lightly to be able to honour those who came before us and we're happy to do it.""

Venezuela to close border with Brazil,"Venezuelan soldiers send people back as they try to cross the border from Brazil Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has closed the border with Brazil amid a row over humanitarian aid. The embattled leader said he could also shut the key border with Colombia to stop the opposition bringing in relief. Venezuela's inflation rate has seen prices soar, leaving many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food, toiletries and medicine. President Maduro denies any crisis and calls the aid delivery plans a US-orchestrated show. His ally Russia has accused the US of trying to arm Venezuela's opposition. Rival concerts will be held on both sides of a bridge linking Venezuela and Colombia later on Friday. On the Colombian side, an event will be held to raise money for Venezuela. At the same time, Mr Maduro's government will hold its own concert, just 300m (980ft) away. Venezuela crisis in nine charts Why the military back Maduro Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ and his allies hope to collect food and medicine being gathered in neighbouring Brazil and Colombia on Saturday, in defiance of President Maduro. Head of the National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim leader during anti-government protests last month and is recognised by dozens of countries, including the US and most Latin American nations. The border crossing with Brazil remained closed on Friday morning but local G1 website reported thata group of Venezuelans managed to cross,externalfrom the Brazilian city of Pacaraima on foot using an unofficial route. Mr Maduro announced on Thursday that the border would be closed ""completely and absolutely"" until further notice and said he had been considering a ""total closure"" of the border with Colombia. Brazil had earlier said that, in co-ordination with the US, food and medicine would be available to be collected by ""the government of acting President Juan GuaidÃ³ in Venezuelan trucks driven by Venezuelans"".

British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson has organised a concert near the Tienditas Bridge crossing at CÃºcuta hoping to raise about $100m (Â£77m) to buy food and medicine for Venezuelans. Venezuela Aid Live, he said, has been organised at the request of Mr GuaidÃ³ and another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who is under house arrest. About 250,000 people are expected to attend. Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela? The Venezuelan government has erected a stage on its side of the crossing for its Hands Off Venezuela event. The Branson concert is on the Colombian side of Tienditas Bridge... ... and a Venezuelan government stage has gone up not far away More than three million Venezuelans have fled in recent years as the country grapples with hyperinflation and shortages of essential goods, the UN says. Despite denying there is any humanitarian crisis, Mr Maduro announced this week that 300 tonnes of aid would be shipped from its ally Russia. The men prepared to die for Maduro Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the attempt to deliver aid could spark violence and be used as a pretext by the US to remove Mr Maduro. Citing unspecified information, she also accused the US and its Nato allies of discussing how to arm the Venezuelan opposition and claimed US special forces and equipment were being deployed near the country. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent in Caracas There is no doubt this has become a political issue. Juan GuaidÃ³ and his supporters want to spread the word about how important the foreign humanitarian aid is. President Maduro accuses it of being a Trojan horse. There is a feeling of optimism among many Venezuelans at the moment - an energy that has not existed in the country for a long time. And the hope that Saturday may be the start of a new path. But if the stand-off drags on, the fear is that this positive energy that has revived Mr Maduro's critics will wane, as will the interest of the international community, and that's what Mr GuaidÃ³ needs to achieve regime change. People want to know about a plan B - if indeed Mr GuaidÃ³ has thought of one. Otherwise, the hope here will soon turn to despair. Read more from Katy Mr GuaidÃ³ is leading a convoy that left the capital, Caracas, on Thursday, to CÃºcuta, some 800km (500 miles) away. He has said 600,000 volunteers have already signed up to help carry aid into Venezuela while theVenezuelan government said it would deliver 20,600 of its own food boxes,externalto the Colombian border area. Venezuela's military has so far resisted calls to abandon Mr Maduro, in power since 2013. However, former military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal called on the military to break with the president and to allow aid in. In a video posted online, the congressman recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as ""president in charge"" and issued a stinging rebuke to Mr Maduro. ""You've killed hundreds of young people in the streets for trying to claim the rights you stole - this without even counting the dead for lack of medicines and security."" Mr GuaidÃ³'s aides in Washington said 11 Venezuelan diplomats based in the US had defected and declared their support for him.

Woman dies after Michelin-starred mealAnother 28 people who ate at the RiFF restaurant in Valencia also fell ill.Europe,"The woman ate at RiFF restaurant in Valencia with her husband and son Update 24 January 2020: In December 2019, a judge at the Superior Court of Justice of the Valencian Community (TSJCV) ruled that the death of the female diner was due to natural causes and the investigation into RiFF restaurant was closed. A woman has died and 28 more diners fell ill after eating at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Spain. The diner went to RiFF in Valencia with her husband and son, 12, both of whom also had diarrhoea and vomiting. The restaurant is now closed while public health officials investigate the exact cause of the outbreak. RiFF, which has one Michelin star and is described by the guide as serving ""innovative cuisine"", has issued an apology to its customers. Officials tracked down 75 people who ate at the restaurant between 13 and 16 February, and learned that a total of 29 had suffered food poisoning, including three families. This included a 46-year-old woman who ate out with her family on Saturday night and died at home in the early hours of Sunday morning. Tiny beach restaurant wins top award Chef's shock at being back in Michelin The business behind Michelin stars A spokesperson from Valencia's regional ministry of health told BBC News that food safety officers inspected RiFF on Monday but were unable to find an obvious cause. Samples of some of the dishes that were served as part of a tasting menu have now been sent to the National Toxicology Institute for analysis, they added. Some reports have suggested that morel mushrooms may have been to blame, but officials told local media they were waiting for the test results to come back before singling out any particular ingredient. RiFF's owner and head chef Bernd KnÃ¶ller said in a statement that he was working with health officials to establish the facts. ""Regardless of the reason that may have caused this situation, I want to convey my deep regret for what happened, hoping that soon all these facts can be clarified,"" he added. ""I have made the decision that the restaurant remains closed until the causes of what happened are established."" Tiny beach restaurant wins top award What this Michelin chef wants to change.

R Kelly faces fresh sexual abuse claimsTwo more women come forward with claims of misconduct by the R&B singer after a concert in the 1990s.US & Canada,"Rochelle Washington (l), and Latresa Scaff (r) are being represented by lawyer Gloria Allred Two more women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the R&B singer R Kelly. Rochelle Washington and Latresa Scaff told a news conference they were given drink and drugs at an after-concert party in Baltimore in the 1990s. They said the singer then cornered them in a hotel room and demanded sex. Kelly, 52, has been accused of decades of sexual abuse against women. He has never been convicted and denies all the allegations. Addressing journalists in New York, the two women said they were teenagers when Kelly's security staff picked them out of a concert audience. They were unable to give the exact year but said it was either 1995 or 1996. The history of allegations against R Kelly R Kelly's daughter: He's a monster Is R Kelly's music being shut down? Ms Scaff, 40, said that at the party they were given cocaine, marijuana and alcohol and invited to wait for the singer in his hotel room. Once there, they were told that he was about to arrive and that they should pull up their dresses, she said. The singer arrived with his penis exposed, Ms Scaff said, and invited the girls to a threesome. R Kelly has strongly denied all the allegations against him Ms Washington, now 39, refused and went to the bathroom while Ms Scaff stayed and had sex with him ""even though I did not have the capacity to consent"" because of the drink and drugs, she added. Ms Scaff said she had decided to come forward ""because of all of the other victims"". The two women are represented by high-profile lawyer Gloria Allred who said they would be speaking to the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York on Thursday. Ms Allred also represents several other women who have made allegations against Kelly. Referring to the star she said: ""You have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. You have been able to get away with your predatory misconduct for far too long."" R Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has faced claims of sexual abuse for more than 20 years. A recent documentary, Surviving R Kelly, shown on the US channel Lifetime, contained detailed accounts of his alleged physical and emotional abuse of women. It claimed the singer ran an ""abusive cult"" in which he allegedly kept women captive. Kelly's lawyers dismissed the documentary as ""another round of stories"" being used to ""fill reality TV time"". Lady Gaga breaks her silence on R Kelly The history of R.

Jailed gangster's trainers sold for ÃÂ£5K,"Four pairs of Christian Louboutin trainers each went for more than Â£250 Dozens of pairs of designer trainers that were seized after a gangster was arrested have sold for nearly Â£5,000 at auction. Isaiah Hanson-Frost is serving a six-year jail sentence for shooting a gun at a car containing rival gang members. The 55 pairs of trainers, were valued at about Â£18,500 and included brands such as Christian Louboutin, Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo and Gucci. The money raised will go towards helping to prevent crime. Lee Baldwin of AMS Auctions said the response was ""exceptional"", and the sale attracted bids from as fair afield as Australia, USA, Trinidad and Romania. He added: ""Based on our initial valuation of the shoes AMS are delighted with the sale result which has ensured a healthy return to the Gloucestershire constabulary in a transparent and justified manner."" These trainers are by the Italian designer Giacomo Morelli During a hearing last November, Hanson-Frost denied possession of criminal property but agreed to hand over his collection of trainers. Under the Police Property Act, the Gloucestershire force was able to auction off the trainers, which fetched Â£4,738. Hanson-Frost was jailed in Aprilafter admitting violent disorder and possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence in relation to the shooting, which happened on the Chase Lane Industrial Estate in Gloucester. The 22-year-old, who was cleared of possession of criminal property when the prosecution chose not to proceed with the case, was allowed to keep any Nike trainers valued at less than Â£100.

"Japan trade deal will be late, says Fox","This video can not be played Trade Secretary Liam Fox rejected calls to rule out a no-deal Brexit The UK won't be able to roll over an EU trade deal with Japan in time for a no-deal Brexit, Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said. It was one of the most important EU trade deals the UK hoped to replicate ahead of the 29 March withdrawal date. The trade department also said it would not be able to roll over the EU's customs union deal with Turkey on time. In 2017, Mr Fox said the UK would be able to replicate 40 EU free trade deals by Brexit day. But so far the department has only been able to finalise ""continuity agreements"" with seven of the 69 countries and regions with which the EU has trade deals. Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? UK farmers promised 'no deal' tariff protection These include Switzerland, Chile, the Faroe Islands, Eastern and Southern Africa, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The UK also has mutual recognition agreements signed with the US, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Fox, who was a prominent Leave campaigner, told the BBC: ""Of course, we will get access to all the EU's free trade agreements if we leave the EU with a deal, which is the government's policy, and for all those who don't want any disruption, there's one easy way to avoid that, which is to vote for the deal which the Prime Minister has."" Industry group the CBI said deals with Japan and Turkey not being concluded on time would be ""an unwelcome surprise"" for business. EU trade deals offer UK companies benefits like reduced tariffs on goods, enhanced access to markets for services and common standards on intellectual property. British exports to Japan are worth Â£9.9bn per year. ""Many companies are unaware it is not just their relationships with EU customers at risk from a no-deal Brexit, but those across the globe,"" said CBI director of international trade Ben Digby. ""Individual businesses trading with markets outside the EU would face tariffs worth millions of pounds being slapped on them instantaneously. ""It is vital no-deal is taken off the table to unlock transition, allowing the UK to remain part of these deals and provide space to agree new arrangements."" People's Vote supporter and Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: ""Brexiters promised that voting Leave would mean a bonanza of new international trade deals that would make up for lost trade with the EU. ""Instead, Brexit is costing us the global trade deals we already have as EU members. ""Liam Fox is now finally admitting that his promise to roll over all existing EU trade deals in time for Brexit is going to be broken."" What trade deals has the UK done so far?

"Looking for bodies, looking for answers"," Every day at 08:00, 78-year-old Darcy Dias da Cunha arrives at his local cemetery. It’s on the top of a hill, and as the sun continues to rise, he looks out over the small city of Brumadinho. Darcy Dias da Cunha and his dog Overhead, the deafening sound of helicopter rotor blades fills the air. Rescue workers are being ferried out to the mud that lies like a rust-red scar through the valley. They will not cease their search for bodies until dusk. Darcy, a father of 12, has spent every day at the cemetery since the dam collapsed. Here he sits, waiting for the call that will tell him the body of his 27-year-old daughter Rosaria, a mother of two, has been found beneath the thick, toxic mud. “I'm just waiting for her to arrive,"" he says. “I know the morgue will call the cemetery as soon as they identify her.” Darcy's daughter Rosaria A month on from the collapse, 171 people have been confirmed dead, but the recovery operation continues to search for the bodies of another 141 people - all reported missing by their families. In this tight-knit Catholic city, where almost everyone either worked at the mine or knew someone who did, the community is still in shock. Dozens of matching funeral wreaths are visible across the city, all paid for by the company that owns the mine When Darcy and his wife Helena Sansao heard that their daughter was among the missing, they got in to a friend’s car and drove for two hours to the nearest large hospital in Belo Horizonte. It’s the capital city of the state of Minas Gerais, which directly translates as “general mines”. Rosaria wasn’t there, but the couple - like many others who had rushed to the hospital - were asked to provide DNA samples. So far, more than 530 samples have been collected from those searching for missing family members. When the dam was breached, a tidal wave of red sludge surged through the valley with such force, that everything in its way was crushed. The force tore bodies apart. Due to the number of casualties, Atenaguos Moreira de Jesus only discovered his friend had died on the day of his burial In the cemetery, gravedigger 63-year-old Atenaguos Moreira de Jesus explains that one of the hardest parts of his job is supporting families when body parts rather than whole bodies have been recovered. “My job is to dig holes. But now the biggest hole is in my heart,” he says. “With all the love I have, this is the last thing I can do for my friends. “I worry about the ones who won't be able to bury their relatives. I won't be able to do my job. It’s as if I have failed.” Darcy looks on as other families come to bury their dead.  Sheltering from the warm summer rains, punctuated by thunder, a snaking procession of black umbrellas follows the pace set by a pandeiro, a Brazilian drum. But Darcy continues to wait. He says this is where he feels closest to God and most able to cope with news about his daughter, when and if it comes. “I want to carry her coffin,” he says. “I'm still strong. I do not want to die before doing this.” It was lunchtime on 25 January. Every day, along with a couple of hundred other employees of Vale, the huge Brazilian company that owns the mine, Rosaria bought her lunch from the canteen. She worked in the administration office which was just five minutes by shuttle bus from both the dam and the canteen. But by 12:28 local time, everything was destroyed. The 86m (282ft) high mining dam close to the city of Brumadinho had collapsed. Within 90 seconds, the staff canteen and offices, as well as dozens of heavy vehicles were engulfed by mud. Ana Paula da Silva Mota was a heavy-duty truck driver at the mine. She was proud of her job, transporting more than 90 tonnes of iron ore at a time in her 11m-long truck, from the mine to the train wagons. She was inside her truck,  just 550m from the dam when it broke. ""I was facing the dam. I think I was one of the first people to see [the torrent], I couldn’t believe it,"" says Ana Paula. At first she couldn’t comprehend what was happening. ""I thought there had been an explosion at the mine,"" she says. But only moments later she realised that the dam had burst. ""We thought this dam was dry,” she says. “From above, it looked like a soccer field. It was hard, solid, not made of mud. No-one could have imagined that it looked like that underneath."" Within seconds, 11.7 million cubic metres of liquid waste cascaded down the valley at more than 70km/h (43mph). The canteen building and everyone in it was buried beneath a torrent of mud. Ana Paula grabbed the radio. ""I got on the radio and I started screaming, 'Run, run, the dam has broken’. I later found out there were people who escaped because they had heard a woman crying and shouting on the radio. That was me,"" she says. The wave of toxic mud had come within metres of Ana Paula’s truck before flowing down the valley. She says she has lost more than 20 colleagues in the tragedy, including her aunt. Nearby homes, farms, plantations and forests were engulfed in mud. And in the nearby village of Córrego do Feijão and the neighbourhood of Parque da Cachoeira many houses were completely destroyed. ""The noise was so loud. The trees were cracking as if a fire was coming from the woods,” says local resident 65-year-old, Telmilia Duraes da Rocha. Telmilia Duraes da Rocha and her husband Telmilia and her husband also escaped just in time, but lost everything. “We ran out of the car and saw the avalanche of mud coming towards us destroying everything in front of us. This house was was my life, my dream,” she says. The dam that collapsed contained waste material - “tailings” - from the iron ore operation at the mine just behind it. The cheapest way to store these by-products is to seal them behind a dam. Water is then drained away, so the waste sludge hardens. Grass is even grown on top - hence Ana Paula’s description of a football field. However, if the sludge gets wet, “liquefaction” can occur. The dam near Brumadinho posed an extra risk as its walls were also constructed of layer upon layer of “tailings”. These types of dams, known as “upstream tailings dams”, are susceptible to cracks if they become waterlogged. These cracks can cause the structure to collapse. This design is used by many companies all over the world, including in Canada and Australia. However, these dams need regular monitoring and up-keep. ""They are common in Brazil because they are cheap and quick to build,” says geologist Eduardo Marques, a professor at the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV).  “But they are also the most dangerous. In several other countries they have been banned.” On the day of the collapse the emergency alarm system, designed to give people enough time to escape, did not go off. Many grieving residents believe that had the warning system worked, far fewer people would have died. ""Those alarms didn’t go off - I’ve never even heard them before,"" says Geraldo Vilaça from Parque da Cachoeira, which was engulfed by sludge. Geraldo lost his brother-in-law in the disaster. He, himself, only had three minutes to abandon his house and run. Vale is Brazil’s biggest mining company and the world’s number-one producer of iron ore. Within Brazil, it produces 80% of the ore for export. In 2017, its revenue totalled $34bn (£26bn; €30bn). Shortly after the collapse, the company’s president Fabio Schvartsman said at a press conference that the break-up of the dam caused the alarm itself to be “engulfed” by mud. In a statement later sent to the BBC, Vale said: “The speed of dam breach and the lack of any signs prevented the activation of the emergency system that would have sounded the dam sirens.” However, Sergio Medici de Eston, professor of mining engineering at the University of São Paulo, rejects this explanation. “To say that the siren didn't sound because the incident happened so fast is a joke,” he says. “The alarm should sound when things start to become critical, sometimes weeks ahead so that people are on the alert.” In the wake of such tragedies, people understandably look for answers. In Brumadinho, all eyes are on Vale. But first, people must find their loved ones. Manoeuvring along the Paraopeba River in an inflatable rescue boat, Eduardo wears a red-and-black neoprene suit and a hard yellow helmet. It’s the distinctive uniform of the “bombeiros”, Brazil’s military firefighters. Following a report phoned in by two researchers taking samples from the river to measure toxicity, Eduardo scans the riverbank. Suffocated by the toxic red sludge, the river is dying. Dead fish with open mouths can be seen floating, and even the mosquitoes have dispersed. Then he sees it - a broken body caught in the riverbank. With immense care, Eduardo and his two fellow bombeiros lift it into the boat. Clasping a hand in his own, Eduardo is relieved because fingerprints mean the remains can be identified and returned to the family. The rescue operation is huge. Nearly 400 military personnel, police officers, firefighters and members of the special forces work around the clock in the mud, with the support of helicopters, tractors and sniffer dogs. In some places, they report working in mud up to 15m deep. After hours of digging and trudging through the contaminated mud, rescuers are hosed down with a mixture of bleach and antibacterial detergent. Junior “I was able to find two bodies today,” says Junior, a young bombeiro waiting in the queue after his shift. “They were in a very poor condition, as they had started to decompose. But I have faith in God that they will be identified and their families will be able to give them a decent funeral.” It’s a race against time. Very soon the bodies will begin to decompose fully, and the rescue dogs will be less effective. Every day, thunderstorms and heavy rain slows the bombeiros’ progress. “[Rain] hinders the movement of aircraft, reduces the visibility of pilots and may move mud that is still in the dam,” says Lt Gen Anderson Passos, the commander in charge of the rescue operation. Lt Gen Anderson Passos The teams must work quickly but carefully. The risk that another dam in the area will collapse is a growing threat. Just days after the iron ore dam collapsed, the warning alarms rang out for two other dams in the area. Their status was escalated to “at high risk of collapse”. Some 700 people from the surrounding villages were evacuated, while the bombeiros forged on. Within 24 hours, a special investigation task force had been set up, consisting of both state and federal prosecutors, police, and military. It was split into three specialities: civil, environmental and criminal. Overseeing all of this is senior prosecutor for the state of Minas Gerais, Andressa Lanchotti. Andressa Lanchotti On the 10th floor of a tall, grey concrete office block in central Belo Horizonte, the nearest big city to Brumadinho, Lanchotti sits in front of a huge whiteboard covered with notes, lists of names and plans to do with the investigation. “Not for you,” she says smiling, while quickly flipping it over. Lanchotti is amenable, but straight-talking. The tragedy is all too familiar. Just over three years ago in November 2015, another upstream tailings dam collapsed killing 19 people. It happened in the same state, close to the city of Mariana, just 75km away from Brumadinho. More than 50m cubic metres of toxic sludge cascaded into a river and spread all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. It was the worst environmental disaster in Brazil’s history. The mine's owner Samarco was a joint venture between Vale and Australian-based company BHP. The aftermath at Mariana Two months after the tragedy in Mariana, while authorities were still trying to control the spread of mud, the state passed a new law, enabling “fast-track” licences. This made it easier - not harder - for companies to acquire permits to mine in areas of environmental concern. In Brazil, and particularly in the mineral-rich state of Minas Gerais, mining lobbyists wield huge amounts of influence and power. The fast-track licence was the opposite of what Lanchotti and her team had been working on in the aftermath of the collapse at Mariana - a bill proposing stricter laws around the construction and expansion of dams close to residential areas. “We presented the bid to the local assembly with more than 55,000 signatures of support from the community,” says Lanchotti. “Unfortunately it was not approved.” Samarco is appealing against a fine of 350.7m Brazilian reais (about $93.5m) for activities resulting in environmental damage. Manslaughter charges have also been brought against 19 executives from both Vale and BHP Billiton, but the trials have not yet gone ahead. “The justice system is very complicated,” says Lanchotti. “It’s not just about the prosecutors or judges. It’s also that the system allows numerous appeals, which can delay the final results.” She reels off a list of problems from a lack of monitoring to political commitment, until finally concluding: “As long as these issues are not solved, I cannot guarantee that new tragedies like this won’t happen in Brazil.” Just four days after the breach in Brumadinho, Lanchotti led the task force in making its first arrests - three employees from Vale, and two engineers from German company TÜV SÜD. These engineers had been hired by Vale to make the regular, legally required safety inspections of the dam, as well as signing off any safety certificates. A few days after the arrests, Vale’s lawyers had secured the release of all five men. Then, a little over a week later, parts of the men’s interviews were leaked to the Brazilian media outlet, Globo. Part of the leak was an email exchange from just two days before the breach, discussing irregular readings on automated monitoring equipment next to the dam. One of the arrested engineers from TÜV SÜD, Makoto Namba, was asked by police, given those readings, what he would do if his son was working at the site of the dam. He replied: “After confirming the readings, I would immediately call my son to evacuate the place as well as calling the emergency department at Vale, responsible for triggering the emergency action plan.” In his testimony, Makoto Namba also said he felt under pressure from a Vale employee to sign off the dam’s safety report back in June 2018. He said he told the employee he would only sign if safety recommendations were addressed. Both Vale and TÜV SÜD told the BBC they could not comment on the specifics of the investigation until the facts had been verified by the authorities. An employee of the mine, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that water from a natural spring on a hill above the dam had been seeping on to it. He said a pipe that had been installed at the spring to carry the water away safely had been leaking. “There was a spring above the dam, but the pipe was broken,” he says. “The water was falling directly on to the dam. So much so that the middle of the dam was no longer dry. This was more than a month ago.” Prof Carlos Martinez, an expert on mining dams, says that this would be a reason to immediately evacuate the area. “This would be unacceptable. Constant water flow coming from a spring would increase the pressure in the dam,” he says. “The remains of iron ore that exist in these dams normally bond with the sand and prevent water from draining properly. It clogs the filters, it turns it into something similar to a pressure cooker. The area should have been evacuated.” The Brazilian press has also reported that federal police were investigating suggestions that water might have found its way into the dam from natural springs. In a statement to the BBC, Vale said: “There was no record of an increase in the water level in the dam mass. On the contrary, the data indicates a reduction in the water level in the main section of the structure.” For Lanchotti one of the key problems is that big businesses are allowed to self-regulate when it comes to safety and risk management. “Often the government agencies do not carry out inspections, but instead delegate this responsibility back to the companies themselves, to monitor their own activities. “Unfortunately, recent events have shown that this form of self-monitoring is simply not effective.” With just 35 government inspectors for more than 1,000 active and non-active mines across Brazil, most companies hire their own private inspectors to sign off the paperwork. In the case of Vale, it was the German company TÜV SÜD. Lanchotti argues that more effective government inspection is needed. State prosecutor André Sperling is in charge of the civil branch of the investigation. One of his main jobs is to negotiate with Vale how much compensation should be paid to those who have lost their jobs, their homes and their loved ones. Since the disaster, he says he has averaged about four hours sleep a night. André Sperling “Vale is trying to accelerate the process of paying for damages before the real impact of the disaster has been established. It wants to get rid of the problem as fast as possible,” he says. While Sperling says that “Vale knew about the risks” he also recognises the conflict felt by both the government and local residents. This colossal, wealthy company has long been the main source of income for the 37,000 people living in and around Brumadinho. Vale is the biggest employer and taxpayer in the city, and without it, employment, commerce, and even the public sector would come to a standstill. “We don't want Vale to stop its activities in the state. This would make the local crisis even worse. But they need to pay damages and ensure this never happens again.” Two weeks after the breach at Brumadinho, sirens rang out in the middle of the night at two other dams in the state of Minas Gerais, warning of a possible collapse. One, near the town of Barão de Cocais, more than 120km from Brumadinho, is owned by Vale. The other, close to the village of Itatiaiuçu and only 30km away from Brumadinho, is owned by another mining company, ArcelorMittal. Overnight 700 people were evacuated. Then, just days later, two more alarms and yet more evacuations within the state. This time from two dams close to the small mining city of Nova Lima, just 40km away from Brumadinho. In the wake of the tragedy, people all over Brazil have woken up to the vast scale of the problem. There are at least 790 tailings dams across the country, many of which are directly uphill from towns and cities. They have all been categorised by their “potential for damage”. This rating scale does not measure how likely they are to collapse, but how much damage they would do if they did. Source: Agência Nacional de Mineração (National Mining Agency),  Agência Nacional de Águas (National Water Agency). Map created using Carto. More than 200 have been classified as “high potential for damage”. It means these dams are either located uphill from a town or a city or are positioned near to a main river or ecosystem. Both Mariana and Brumadinho were classified as “low risk of collapse” by government inspectors, but of  “high potential for damage” because of the number of people living close by, and the potential risk to the environment. A specialist engineer who was working as part of the recovery operation at Brumadinho and wants to remain anonymous, says that the approach taken by mining companies when assessing risk has long been problematic. He believes anything with a “high potential for damage” should never have been built. When comparing the mining industry with other heavy industries in which he had worked, he says: “First you run your worst-case scenario on a computer simulation. Then you design your site around that.  For example, on an oil rig, you would locate your offices and sleeping quarters well way from any potential dangers such as a fire or explosions, even if the likelihood of such events is extremely low.” He points out that in Brumadinho, the offices and staff canteen were sited below the dam. Vale bought the mine and its offices from another company, but kept the layout of the site. Nowhere in Brazil feels more at risk than the state of Minas Gerais, which produces 53% of the country’s total iron ore output. Source: Agência Nacional de Mineração (National Mining Agency),  Agência Nacional de Águas (National Water Agency). Map created using Carto. It has more mines and more tailings dams than any other, many of which sit directly uphill from towns or cities. Nova Lima is one of the three cities partially evacuated late last week after an alarm rang out warning of a possible collapse. The city, which has a population of just over 93,500, is surrounded by 26 mining dams. Itabira, where Vale was founded in 1942, has a population of nearly 120,000 and is surrounded by 19 mining dams. In some neighbourhoods, gardens back on to a tailings dam. The five tailings dams closest to the city hold back a total of 423m cubic metres of toxic sludge. That’s the equivalent of 33 times the amount released last month by the dam near to Brumadinho. Tragedy struck Mariana in 2015. The city, with a population of 60,000, is surrounded by 15 dams. On its outskirts, in a province called Bento Rodrigues, 600 people live in the shadow of five dams. While on the campaign trail, Brazil’s new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, pledged to relax environmental laws, arguing that they “bring endless problems” and “hinder mayors, governors and presidents from developing infrastructure”. Since the disaster, the government has announced a ban on new “upstream” tailings dams. The 87 that are currently in operation - 10 of them owned by Vale - will be decommissioned by 2021. But even after a mine is decommissioned, safety inspections must continue, as the waste sludge will sit inside a dam forever. The government has also said it would put pressure on companies to ensure daily checks are more rigorous. However, there has been no mention of increasing the number of government inspectors. These daily checks would still rely on the current system, whereby companies effectively monitor their own activities. “Mariana, never again.” These were the words Vale CEO, Fabio Schvartsman, spoke in a speech to his colleagues on the day he became president of the company in May 2017. Two days after the disaster in Brumadinho, he promised in a television interview to “guarantee this never happens again”. For the people of Minas Gerais and state prosecutors, this is not their first attempt at holding Vale to account. They worry that taking on an influential company will be neither quick nor simple. But, so far, some judges and politicians seem to be listening. Court orders have already suspended some of Vale’s most profitable operations and frozen 12.6bn reais, or about $3.2bn of the company’s assets. Late last week, a further eight Vale employees, including two executives, were arrested. Search warrants were also served for four people from Germany’s TÜV SÜD. Residents look on as community leaders and state prosecutors (R) demand answers from representatives of Vale Back in Brumadinho, the residents’ fight for justice and the rebuilding of their lives has only just begun. Under a huge white marquee, erected as part of the rescue effort, more than 400 people are sitting waiting for representatives from Vale to turn up. For weeks, many of these families have been living in temporary shelters, surviving off ration packs and bottled water, all funded by the company. Food parcels are distributed to the hundreds of families left homeless With many local schools still closed, the sound of 30 or more children playing football drifts through from the back of the marquee. A pop-up classroom has been set up by church volunteers offering face painting, a reading corner and a cushioned chill-out space. For generations, Vale has been the main source of income and stability for the people living in and around Brumadinho. But with more than 300 people missing or confirmed dead, and hundreds more left homeless and jobless, the community’s anger has become inseparable from its grief. Finally, after nearly an hour’s wait, three representatives from the company appear.  But the debate over emergency shelter, food and compensation quickly descends into a shouting match. “To kill, you are fast,” shouts a woman in the crowd. “You killed my brother in 10 seconds and now you're going to wait how many months to ease what my mother is feeling?” Vale’s response is business-like: “At this moment, we can’t take responsibility for something that is still being evaluated. First, we need to understand the extent of the problem,” says one of the company’s representatives. “We do not yet have sufficient information to respond to these requests.” Weeks later, Vale agreed to pay “emergency income” to families equivalent to the salaries of those who died. Absent from the proceedings is Brumadinho’s Mayor Avimar de Melo Barcelos. Days before, he told journalists that Brumadinho is a city that “lives off the ore”. “About 60% or more of our revenue comes from taxes paid by iron ore mining. And most of that is paid by Vale,” he says. “If these payments were to be interrupted after the tragedy, the city would literally stop. ""We have health care units, hospitals, schools, all of which we would not be able to sponsor any more. “Unfortunately, this is the reality.” A volunteer sits with one of the many children left homeless Edmundo Netto Junior is a federal prosecutor working with the investigations task force. He’s spent every day of the past month talking to the families of those who have been confirmed dead, or are still missing. One of these families included seven-year William, who had tagged along with his aunt. On the day they met, William had spent the morning painting. In the middle of his picture was a bright blue and yellow rescue helicopter, but dangling from the bottom was a large net - the type used to recover bodies found in the mud. “He gave this picture to one of the bombeiros [rescue firefighters] and asked them to find his grandfather,” says Netto Junior. William’s painting also showed a dark red scar cutting through the landscape. “It’s a community that has been scarred forever,” says Netto Junior. “It will carry these psychological bruises for life.” Correction: This story has been amended to reflect that the villages of Córrego do Feijão and Parqueda Cachoeira were not completely destroyed; only some of the houses in the villages were destroyed.

PM reaches out to Remainer rebels,"Theresa May has held meetings with leading Tory Remainers, amid speculation about further defections. Justine Greening and Phillip Lee say Mrs May has ignored requests from pro-EU Tory MPs in favour of Brexiteers. The pair had separate meetings with the PM in Downing Street. Meanwhile, one ex-Labour member of the new Independent Group of MPs has said it could help keep Mrs May in power on condition that she agreed to another EU referendum with Remain as an option. However, the PM was focused on her own party on Thursday, as she met cabinet ministers David Gauke and Greg Clark. The pair have warned of the dangers to business of leaving the EU without a formal deal, an option which Brexiteers in the European Research Group of Conservative MPs insist must be preserved as negotiating leverage in Brussels. Thegovernment said on Thursday that talks would continue ""urgently""at a technical level, following ""productive"" meetings involving Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? What does it feel like to quit a party? Nicholas Watt: A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame In the UK, ex-Labour MP Gavin Shukertold The Huffington Post,externalmembers of the new Independent Group had first made the offer of a potential confidence and supply agreement - like the one the DUP has with the government - last month in a meeting with the PM's second-in-command David Lidington. Then-Labour MPs Chris Leslie, Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, along with then-Tory Anna Soubry, who have all joined the group this week, were also at the meeting. Mr Shuker said he had told Mr Lidington he would support any type of deal provided there was a ""confirmatory referendum"" to get public backing but that the offer was rejected. Phillip Lee met Theresa May for talks in Downing Street The leaders of both main parties are battling to prevent more defections after eight Labour MPs and three Tories broke away to form a new ""centrist"" group in Parliament. Theresa May has written to the three Tory defectors - Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston - to reject what she describes as the ""picture they paint of the party"", saying its record on the NHS, employment and diversity proved it was ""moderate"" and ""open-hearted"". The prime minister offered to ""continue to work together on issues"" where they agree - but told the three she rejected ""the parallel you draw with the way Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left have warped a once-proud Labour Party"". In response to their claim that local Tory associations are being taken over by former UKIP members, Mrs May said: ""An open, broad party should always welcome new members and supporters with a range of views, including those who have previously supported other parties.""

But she said local party branches had been warned to ensure new members support the party's ""values and objectives"". Ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen, one of the three defectors from the party, told ITV's Peston programme ""a third"" of Conservative MPs were fed up with the party's direction. Ms Greening and Mr Lee, who quit as a justice minister over Brexit, have been named by Ms Allen as potential future defectors to the Independent Group. The Right to Vote group, which is chaired by Mr Lee, said he had discussed the campaign's calls for a pause in the Brexit process and a possible second referendum with Mrs May. ""Talks were open and we are encouraged she listened to our case,"" the group said. This video can not be played ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the EU"" Mr Lee has said one of the reasons the Tory MPs decided to quit the party was the access the Brexiteer European Research Group got to the prime minister, who he said had refused to meet his wing of the party. Justine Greening - a former education secretary - told the Today programme she had been tempted to break away from the Conservative Party and join the Independent Group. ""It is something that I have considered, but I have reached a different conclusion for the moment,"" Ms Greening told Today. ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the European Union."" The Independent Group was set up by eight defecting Labour MPs unhappy with their party's handling of Brexit and anti-Semitism. They were later joined by three pro-Remain Tories - who accuse the Conservative leadership of allowing right-wing hardliners to shape the party's approach to Brexit and other matters. Labour's Ian Austin also expressed sympathy with the Independent Group's aims, saying he would think ""long and hard"" about his future in the Labour Party. Shadow home Secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I am very sad that the Labour members of this new independent organisation have gone. ""Up until the last minute, people were talking to them, trying to persuade them not to take the step they have taken."" She said she hoped they would continue to work with Labour on issues like homelessness, the benefit system, the NHS and ""most of all fighting this Tory Brexit"". Meanwhile, Labour have contacted the Information Commissioner over alleged attempts to access personal data held by the party. It is understood there are concerns an MP accessed party systems to contact members after reports of their resignation on Tuesday night. Enfield North MP Joan Ryan, who announced she was quitting Labour in an interview with the Times published on Tuesday evening, said: ""Neither I nor my office have accessed or used any Labour Party data since I resigned the Labour Whip and my membership of the Labour Party.""

Corbyn backs 'right to return',"This video can not be played Corbyn: Begum has 'right to return' to UK Shamima Begum, who left the UK to join the Islamic State group in Syria aged 15, has a ""right to return to Britain"", Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said. Ms Begum has had her UK citizenship revoked by Home Secretary Sajid Javid - a move Mr Corbyn said was ""extreme"". The leader of the oppositiontold ITV News,externalthe 19-year-old should return to the UK to face questioning. Ms Begum toldSky News,externalon Thursday she was ""willing to change"" and called for ""mercy"" from British politicians. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? IS bride 'is not Bangladeshi citizen' 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' UK nationals can only have their citizenship revoked if they are eligible for citizenship elsewhere. It is thought Ms Begum could be a Bangladeshi citizen because her mother is believed to be one. However, Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has saidMs Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizenand there was ""no question"" of her being allowed into the country. Mr Corbyn, who iscurrently in Brussels to discuss his Brexit proposals, said: ""She obviously has, in my view, a right to return to Britain. ""On that return she must obviously face a lot of questions about everything she has done and at that point any action may or may not be taken. ""But I think the idea of stripping somebody of their citizenship when they were born in Britain is a very extreme manoeuvre indeed. ""Indeed, I questioned the right of the home secretary to have these powers when the original law was brought in by Theresa May when she was home secretary."" This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Mr Javid has defended the move, which followed a debate over whether the teenager should be able to return to the UK after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp. Ms Begum, who left east London in 2015, said she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and now simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. The home secretary said he would not leave an individual stateless, which is illegal under international law. But the Begum family's lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, who is preparing an appeal, has said he is considering whether she has been left stateless. Ms Begum gave birth to a boy in a Syrian refugee camp at the weekend, who the home secretary has suggested could still be British, despite the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship. ""Children should not suffer. So, if a parent does lose their British citizenship, it does not affect the rights of their child,"" he told the Commons. Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Mr Akunjee toldthe Guardian,externalhe planned to travel to the Syrian refugee camp ""as soon as possible"" to ask for Ms Begum's consent to bring her newborn son back to Britain, while her legal case is resolved. ""We can't do anything against her will, so I would hope that I would be able to outline the options for her, explain things to her,"" he said. But Ms Begum told Sky News her son was unwell and she would not allow him to travel to the UK without her. Ms Begum has previously said she had two children who both died.

No-deal Brexit 'focusing minds',"The threat of a no-deal Brexit is ""focusing minds"" and encouraging compromise, the chancellor has said. Philip Hammond said the government was ""determined to get a deal"" before leaving the EU on 29 March but a ""very bad"" no deal outcome remained possible. The government said talks on Thursday were ""productive"" and would ""continue urgently at a technical level"". Jeremy Corbyn, who met EU negotiator Michel Barnier earlier, again accused the PM of ""running down the clock"". Theresa May met the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker to discuss changes to the existing deal to win MPs' support on Wednesday. May sees progress in EU backstop talks Tories 'manipulated by Brexit zealots' UK expectations meet EU reality on Brexit The prime minister said progress had been made on Wednesday over legally binding guarantees about the Irish backstop - the insurance policy to stop a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - but ""time is of the essence"". However, Mr Juncker said he was ""not very optimistic"" about securing a deal. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox were in Brussels on Thursday for talks with Mr Barnier. They focused on ""guarantees relating to the backstop that underline once again its temporary nature and give appropriate legal assurance to both sides, as well as alternative arrangements and the political declaration (the document setting out future UK-EU relations)"", a government statement said. Mr Barclay and Mr Cox will meet Mr Barnier again early next week, it added. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, his Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer and shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti were also in Brussels to discuss their proposals, which include a permanent customs union and a close relationship with the single market. Speaking after a meeting with Mr Barnier, Mr Corbyn urged Theresa May to ""take the threat of no deal off the table"", adding that the EU was ""very worried about the consequences of it"". He did not rule out further meetings with Theresa May to discuss Labour's Brexit plans, which he says could get the backing of the House of Commons, but he added: ""It is very clear that this prime minister, by refusing to change her red lines, is simply running down the clock"". The backstop has become the main sticking point of the prime minister's proposals - with critics fearing the policy would leave the UK tied to a customs union indefinitely - and it played a large part in her plan being voted down by a historic margin in January. Earlier this month, Parliament voted for Mrs May to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to replace the backstop but the EU has consistently said it will not re-open the withdrawal agreement - the ""divorce"" deal where it features. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hammond said government policy on Brexit was ""very clear"". ""We are determined to get a deal. We recognise that a no-deal Brexit would be a very bad outcome for the UK and we are doing everything we can to avoid that,"" he said. ""There is always a possibility of no deal as an outcome and that is why the government is carrying out appropriate contingency planning."" However, the chancellor said that the risk was helping push some people towards agreeing with the government's plan. ""I fully recognise that it is very uncomfortable that we are as close to the wire as we are but I am afraid that is just a feature of this kind of negotiation. We are making progress,"" he added. Former Tory MP and new member of The Independent Group, Sarah Wollaston, predicted a third of the cabinet would resign if there was a no-deal Brexit. Mr Hammond would not reveal if he was among that number but said: ""My job is to avoid [a no-deal Brexit] and to make sure the government is focused entirely on avoiding that outcome."" Speaking from the European Commission on Thursday, Mr Juncker said he could not rule out a no-deal Brexit, which would have ""terrible economic and social consequences both in Britain and the EU"". He added: ""The worst can be avoided but I'm not very optimistic when it comes to this issue."" Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker met in Brussels on Wednesday On Sunday, Mrs May will be attending a two-day EU-League of Arab States summit in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh with about 20 EU leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. She is expected to hold a series of one-to-one meetings as she continues to push for her deal. How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Brexit: Will Britons in the EU still get healthcare?
