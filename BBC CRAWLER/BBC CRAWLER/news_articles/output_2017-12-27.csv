Man City go 15 points clear with win at Newcastle,"Manchester City last dropped points in the Premier League in August's 1-1 draw with Everton Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said it is ""difficult to play"" against ultra-defensive teams after his side moved 15 points clear at the top of the Premier League with a win at Newcastle. Raheem Sterling scored the only goal in a dominant display by the visitors to St James' Park in which they clocked up 78% of possession and 21 shots to Newcastle's six. ""We did absolutely everything but it is difficult to play when the other team doesn't want to play,"" said Guardiola. ""In the last minutes we played in their rhythm and then it was not easy because it is not over at 1-0 - we created enough chances to win 2-0, 3-0, 4-0. ""As a manager I have to adapt. We have played teams who high press, low press, attack us. Any manager and team can play how they want. And you have to find a way to beat them."" England winger Sterling poked home from Kevin de Bruyne's lobbed pass after Sergio Aguero had twice hit the woodwork in the opening half hour. Rolando Aarons saw a shot cleared off the line by Nicolas Otamendi in a rare Newcastle raid forward before the break, but City should have been well clear after De Bruyne thumped the post and then side-footed wide in the second half. The hosts showed more ambition late on and Christian Atsu teed up fellow substitute Dwight Gayle to head wide in the final five minutes. Reaction from St James' Park as leaders City march on City were not to be denied an 18th successive league victory however as they extended an English top-flight record. The Magpies' fifth successive home defeat leaves them a point off the relegation zone. Raheem Sterling has scored 17 goals in all competitions this season With the very first kick of the match, Jonjo Shelvey thumped a shot at goal which was easily gathered by Ederson. But for the next 30 minutes Newcastle did not get close to another. Instead the hosts sat so deep they were practically subterranean with lone striker Joselu playing 15 yards inside his own half. City, brimming with confidence and well used to such tactics, sniffed out space and carved out chances regardless. Between being denied by the frame, Aguero brought a superb one-handed stop from Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot. WhenVincent Kompany pulled up injured,Pep Guardiola felt confident enough to replace the defender with striker Gabriel Jesus. The home fans were reduced to cheering throw-ins as their side's possession statistic stayed stubbornly south of 20%. To hold out would have been one of the great rearguard actions. De Bruyne ensured it wasn't to be. Allowed space and time 40 yards from goal, the Belgian scooped a sublime pass onto Sterling's instep for his team-mate's 13th Premier League goal of the season. Manchester City - whose first-half attacking heat map is on the right - had 85% of possession before the break. Newcastle, on the left, rarely entered City's half This video can not be played Benitez pleased Newcastle stayed in the game After surviving a raft of City chances, Newcastle gave the leaders some concerns in the final 15 minutes. Manager Rafael Benitez brought on Gayle and Atsu, urged his side to press higher and generally threw caution to the wind. A home point would have been a heist of the highest order. Benitez is the most streetwise of tacticians but the Spaniard is hamstrung by a squad that lacks the quality that comes with serious, sustained investment. The prospect of relegation hangs over thetakeover talksbetween owner Mike Ashley and British businesswoman Amanda Staveley that could be the key to a new era. Club legend Alan Shearer, watching for BBC Radio 5 live, described his former team as ""a Championship side playing in the Premier League"". Encounters against all-conquering City are unlikely to decide Newcastle's fate, but their next three league matches - against Brighton, Stoke and Swansea - will provide a better indication of which side of the relegation divide they will end up in May. Guardiola won three successive German titles with Bayern Munich Another win, another milestone for Manchester City. This was their 11th consecutive away victory, matching the record for the English top flight set by Chelsea between April and December 2008. Next on the horizon is one of their manager's own. Beating Crystal Palace away on Sunday would equal the 19 successive wins that Bayern Munich strung together in the 2013-14 season under Guardiola. No team in the English, Italian, German, Spanish or French top flights have ever managed more than that. De Bruyne set up four chances including Sterling's decisive goal Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez:""We had some chances at the end, and we expected to have to defend and play counter-attack. We needed to stay compact and defend well to play like that. ""In the last 20 minutes we did what was expected, being on top of them and expecting to press high. I am really pleased with the team in terms of organisation, but we discussed we could be better on the ball in the first half. ""We have to bring someone in to help the team but still have a lot of confidence in the team."" Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola:""Any manager can decide what he wants - I prefer to try to play but I respect a lot what opponents do and we have to try to discover how to attack against them. This video can not be played Newcastle didnât want to play - Guardiola ""Always you have to expect this kind of situation - and it is not always easy to maintain that level. ""Raheem Sterling is scoring a lot and is playing good - so we are happy with that."" Newcastle have lost five consecutive home league matches for the first time since October 1953. Nicolas Otamendi completed 122 passes for Man City in this match - seven more than all the outfield players of Newcastle managed combined (115). Rafael Benitez has now lost six of his past 10 home Premier League matches - he had lost six of his previous 110 before this run; 38% of Benitez's total home Premier League defeats have come this season, six of 16. Since his Premier League debut for Manchester City, Kevin de Bruyne has 36 assists - four more than any other player. In all competitions this season, only Harry Kane (24) has scored more goals than Raheem Sterling (17) among English Premier League players. The Magpies have collected 18 points from their 20 Premier League matches this season - just one more than they managed after 20 games in the 2015-16 season, when they were relegated. Newcastle play Brighton at home at 15:00 GMT on Saturday, with Manchester City travelling to Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve at 12:00. How do your team rate this season?

Ex-Trump aide accused of sexual assault,"Corey Lewandowski pictured on Donald Trump's campaign trail in 2016 A US singer has filed a sexual assault claim against President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Joy Villa says Mr Lewandowski hit her twice on the backside during an event in Washington last month. She told the US media she spoke to the police on Christmas Eve, having been persuaded to launch a formal complaint by friends. Mr Lewandowski has not responded to US media's requests for comment. The accusations are the latest in a long line of sexual harassment and assault claims linked to celebrities, politicians and companies, which have gathered pace in the past year, particularly followingthe downfall of film mogul Harvey Weinstein. ""I was initially fearful to come forward with this,"" she said, according to the Associated Press news agency. She said she did not want to embarrass Mr Lewandowski's family or hers. Ms Villa, who is a vocal Trump supporter and wore a ""Make America Great Again"" dressto the 2017 Grammy Awards, was at a gathering at Trump International Hotel when she posed for a photograph with Mr Lewandowski, whom, she says, she had never met before. She alleges he hit her once on the buttocks, and when she asked him to stop and joked about reporting him for sexual harassment, he did it again. She said he laughed, adding ""I work in the private sector"". She said the hard slaps felt ""disgusting and shocking and demeaning"". Allow Twitter content?

Ukraine and rebels in big prisoner swap,"This video can not be played Ukrainian soldiers have been reunited with their families Ukraine and separatist rebels in the east of the country have exchanged hundreds of prisoners, in one of the biggest swaps since the conflict began in 2014. Some 230 people were sent to rebel-held areas in return for 74 prisoners who had been held by pro-Russia rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It was the first swap in 15 months. The release and exchange of prisoners was one of the points in the Minsk peace agreement, signed in 2015. The deal has stalled since and analysts say the swap does not signify wider progress. Both sides continue to hold other prisoners. The number of prisoners swapped was lower than initially announced after dozens of people who were meant to be returned to rebel-held territory refused to go to the other side. ""Some of them have already been released and the charges against them have been cleared by the Ukrainian authorities and then they prefer to stay in the government-controlled side,"" Miladin Bogetic, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Ukraine, told the BBC. Eastern Ukraine conflict: A new, bloody chapter Ukraine country profile The operation was carried out amid tight security Two Ukrainians - a man and a woman - opted to stay on the rebel side, AFP news agency reports. The months-long negotiations for the exchange saw the involvement of presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine, as well as the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. Buses and other vehicles carrying the prisoners assembled at the Mayorsk checkpoint near the city of Horlivka in Donetsk for the swap. It took months of negotiations for the exchange to happen Historian Igor Kozlovskiy, 63, who was captured by Donetsk rebels on suspicion of storing weapons, told AFP: ""I was in captivity for two years... Still a lot of prisoners remain [in Donetsk]."" The UK government said the prisoner swap was a ""welcome step towards meeting the commitments all sides have made"". The conflict in eastern Ukraine erupted in April 2014, soon after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. The UN says more than 10,000 people have died in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Ten injured in Russia supermarket blast,"The supermarket in St Petersburg was quickly evacuated by police and emergency services At least 10 people have been injured in an explosion at a supermarket in the Russian city of St Petersburg. One person was said to be in serious condition after the detonation of an improvised explosive device (IED). President Vladimir Putin described the blast, at the Perekrestok supermarket chain late on Wednesday, as a terrorist act. No group has said it carried out the attack, which officials say produced a blast equivalent to 200g (7oz) of TNT. Russia's investigative committee said the home-made device was packed with lethal components. The blast took place in an area of the shop that housed lockers for storing bags. Investigators said they were treating the incident as an attempted murder The property was quickly evacuated and there were no reports of a fire, but images circulating on social media in Russia showed extensive damage in an area of the store close to the tills. Mr Putin commented on the blast at a military awards ceremony on Thursday. Officials had earlier suggested the attack was being treated as attempted murder. Earlier this month, the Russian president and his US counterpart Donald Trump spoke by phone after information provided by the CIA helped Russian security services foil an attack on St Petersburg's Kazan cathedral. At the time, Russia's Interfax news agency reported that a group had been planning attacks at a number of sites. Several people were reportedly detained. In April, an explosion on the St Petersburg metro system killed at least 13 peopleand injured more than 50 others.

Shoplifters taking under Â£200 'not pursued',"Retailers are warning that a sharp rise in shoplifting is being fuelled partly by police forces not investigating the theft of items worth less than Â£200. The Daily Telegraph says persistent offenders are exploiting a change in the law that allows for more minor cases to be dealt with by post. The government said it did not diminish the seriousness of the crimes. Police chiefs said their focus on prolific offenders and organised crime networks was working. The Â£200 threshold was introduced in England and Wales in theAnti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014.,external The act allows anyone stealing goods costing less than Â£200 to plead guilty by post - or face the magistrates' court. They might then face a fine or up to a year in prison. But Chris Noice, from the Association of Convenience Stores, said criminals were getting savvy as to how much they could get away with, and only half of those caught were paying their fines. He also said there was concern that police forces were not sharing information and those that were stealing to fund a drug or alcohol addiction might not be getting the necessary help. In February,the ACS estimated that convenience storeswere losing on average Â£2,600 a year due to shoplifting - a record high. Last year,one shop owner in Harwich, Essexresorted to screening CCTV footage on Facebook to ""shame"" shoplifters, and almost completely cut out thefts. Nottinghamshire Police is among those forces that say they are no longer able to investigate shoplifting unless violence is involved. The area's Labour Police and Crime Commissioner, Paddy Tipping, blamed government cuts, saying: ""We can't do the job that we used to do when you've got 25% less resources. ""There are tough choices that need to be made and we need to have a debate about what can be expected of the police going forward."" A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said: ""Police focus on targeting prolific offenders and organised crime networks as well as prevention measures by businesses are working. ""Forces will continue to work closely with retailers to deter shoplifters and prevent thefts from taking place."" A government spokesperson said shoplifting was not a ""victimless crime"", coming at a cost to businesses and consumers, and should be reported. The police were expected to take all reported crimes seriously, for these to be investigated and where appropriate, for the offenders to be taken through the courts, they added.

Drug-smuggling Briton in 'bad prison',"Laura Plummer was arrested on 9 October A British woman convicted of smuggling painkiller tablets into Egypt has already been transferred to a notorious jail, her family has said. Laura Plummer, 33, from Hull, was arrested after she was found with the Tramadol tablets in her suitcase on 9 October. The shop worker was jailed for three yearsin Egypt on Boxing Day. The prison move had left Plummer's mother no chance to say goodbye to her daughter, her family said. Plummer was detained on arriving at the Red Sea resort of Hurghada for a holiday with her Egyptian partner Omar Caboo. She was found to be carrying almost 300 Tramadol tablets in her suitcase, a painkiller which is legal on prescription in the UK but banned in Egypt. Plummer claimed the painkiller was to treat her Mr Caboo's back pain and has previously saidshe had ""no idea"" the tablets were illegal. Laura Plummer said the prescription pills were for her partner Omar Caboo Plummer's sister Rachel said their mother Roberta Synclair had been told her daughter would be held in police cells so she could visit her. But the family said Ms Synclair went to the cells only to find that Plummer had already been transferred to a prison in Qena. ""Obviously that's even more devastating for my mum because she's not got to say goodbye to Laura,"" Rachel Plummer said. ""No prisons are nice but I think Qena's the bad one."" Plummer's lawyer Mohamed Othman told the BBC he was applying for her to be moved to Qanater prison, which is closer to Cairo, and has ""better conditions"" ahead of an appeal against her conviction. This video can not be played Laura Plummer's sister Jayne Sinclair: ""She's on the verge of a mental breakdown"" However, reports her sister had been attacked in prison were not true, Rachel said. She said during the trial, Plummer told her mother she couldn't wait to get back to work and ""was speaking like she was coming home"". ""All the evidence was presented to show that this was a massive mistake and Laura's intentions were as she said, just to treat Omar's back pain,"" Rachel added. But, she said, after two hours the judges came back with the judgement and ""Laura collapsed crying, she got led away, she got taken away in this cage"". A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We are continuing to provide assistance to Laura and her family following the court ruling in Egypt."" Tramadol is a strong painkiller used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is a class C drug and is only available in the UK with a prescription from a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional. As a class C drug, it is illegal for anyone else to supply Tramadol, to have it or to give it away, even to friends.

LA-Tokyo flight U-turn over 'wrong ticket',"Chrissy Teigen live tweeted the ordeal to her 9.2 million followers A Tokyo-bound flight carrying the model Chrissy Teigen and her musician husband John Legend turned back to LA after someone reportedly boarded in error. According to Ms Teigen, the passenger boarded at LAX airport with a ticket for a different airline, although this was not confirmed by authorities. The plane turned back four hours into the flight, over the Pacific Ocean. The airline, All Nippon Airways (ANA), said only that there had been a problem with a customer's ""flight arrangement"". LA-Tokyo U-turn: How can you fly without a ticket? Adonis Cutchlow, of the LAX Police, told the LA Times there had been no criminal or illegal activity on board the plane, and it was not clear why it had turned back. The plane should have flown 11 hours to Tokyo. Instead, passengers spent eight hours in the air only to return to the same airport. According to a series of tweets posted by Ms Teigen to her 9.2 million followers from the plane, the passenger in question boarded the ANA flight with a ticket from United Airlines.

Murray's brother-in-law reaches South Pole,"Scott Sears arrived at the South Pole on Christmas Day Tennis star Andy Murray's brother-in-law believes he has become the youngest person to reach the South Pole solo. Scott Sears, a lieutenant in the First Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, pulled a sled and supplies for 38 days through 150mph winds in temperatures of -50c. His 702-mile trek ended at the South Pole on Christmas Day, more than 12 days sooner than he had anticipated. The Guinness Book of Records has yet to confirm whether the 27-year-old's feat will make it into the record books. Lt Sears, from east London, is the brother of Murray's wife, Kim. From a family of tennis players, he played the sport on the international circuit until the age of 19. Several years later, he went on to join the Army. The first part of the journey from Hercules Inlet where sea ice meets land in Antarctica is considered the most dangerous part, as the ground is riddled with crevasses. Travelling alone meant Lt Sears was not roped up to a teammate who could stop him falling down them, and he used skis to cross the ice instead. In a blog post,externalfrom his five-week expedition, he described unexpectedly hitting a wall with just 38km (24 miles) to go on Christmas Eve, his penultimate day. ""I couldn't have asked for better weather but well and truly hit a wall midway through the day,"" he wrote. ""I've never experienced anything like it, I would take a couple of steps and just stop, everything was just saying 'no more, not one more step'. ""It was bizarre as I've genuinely been feeling pretty good."" But after some juice, biltong, chocolate and music on his iPod, he was back on his way. That night, Lt Sears hung his socks up as makeshift stockings, but said he feared Santa might give them a miss because of the ""state and stench"" of them. Allow Twitter content?

The following day, he reached the pole in blue skies, and wrote saying he was ""absolutely chuffed to pieces"". He told the Daily Telegraph,externalon Tuesday that he expected it would take a few weeks for the experience to sink in. ""I've been alone in a tent for nearly six weeks so it's all a bit overwhelming,"" he said. ""I can't wait to have a shower and get some food in me. I've been dreaming about it since day three!""

Acid attacker hid phone in crutch in jail,"Arthur Collins admitted one charge of possession of a prohibited item while in prison A man jailed for throwing acid across a packed nightclub has pleaded guilty to hiding a mobile phone inside a crutch while in prison. Arthur Collins, 25, also hid two Sim cards and two USB sticks in the medical aid while on remand at HMP Thameside. He was being held there prior to his trial over the acid attack at a London nightclub, which injured 22 people. Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, appeared via video link at Bromley Magistrates' Court. He admitted one charge of possession of a prohibited item while in prison and will be sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court at a later date. The court heard Collins obtained the phone to make private calls to Miss McCann. At the time Miss McCann was heavily pregnant with their daughter, who was born in November. This video can not be played CCTV of the acid attack in London club Collins' lawyer, Audrey Mogan, told the court: ""He did not have the phone for any sinister purpose."" She said Collins wanted to use the mobile rather than a legitimate phone he had access to in his cell which records calls. Collins and Miss McCann - who have since split - were being ""hounded by the media"" and feared recorded calls would be leaked, Ms Morgan said. The court heard evidence was later found on the phone of calls and messages to family and friends. The acid attack happened in Mangle E8 in Dalston in April Collins threw acid at revellers in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 Apriland was sentenced for the attack on 19 December. He was being held at HMP Thameside prior his trial over the acid attack. The court heard the phone, Sim cards and USB sticks were found on 10 September when a prison officer removed the rubber stopper from the bottom of the crutch in his private shower during a cell search. Prosecutor Samantha Mitchell said: ""He had been using the crutch because of an ankle injury."" Collins was injured trying to evade police while on the run for the acid attack, which left 16 people with chemical burns and temporarily blinded three people, one of whom still suffers from blurred vision in one eye. He told his trial at Wood Green Crown Court he did not know the bottle contained acid and said he believed it to contain a liquid date rape drug which he had snatched from two men after overhearing them planning to spike a girl's drink. But the jury convicted him of five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent and nine counts of actual bodily harm in November.

HMRC goes quackers over tax returns,"Risking the accusation that the taxman himself has gone quackers, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has employed some farmyard ducks to encourage people to file their tax returns on time. The online and billboard adverts feature a man in the bath, being niggled by a duck. Instead of quacking, the duck repeats the word ""tax"". HMRC confirmed that real ducks posed for the photos, before being retired to a bird sanctuary in Oxfordshire. ""With the January 31 deadline edging closer we want to help remind our customers to get it done so they can alleviate that niggling feeling, ensuring they can relax and not have to worry about doing their tax return,"" explained Angela MacDonald, HMRC's director general for customer services. In the meantime HMRC revealed that more than 16,000 people spent part of their Christmas filing a tax return: On Christmas Eve 6,033 completed a return, including 92 between 11pm and midnight. On Christmas Day 2,590 sent in a return On Boxing Day 7,655 sent a return Eleven million people in the UK need to file self-assessment tax returns - including those who are self-employed or who have significant savings income. Those who fail to complete a return by 31 January face an automatic fine of Â£100. After that interest is charged on late payments. Anyone who wants to pay their bill through their PAYE code must complete a return by 30 December. Earlier this month HMRCannounced plansto phase out fines for one-off offenders, although this will not be in place for several years.

Cook stars for resurgent England,"This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: Cook shines as England dominate day two Fourth Ashes Test, Melbourne Cricket Ground (day two of five) Australia 327 (119 overs):Warner 103, Smith 76, Broad 4-51 England 192-2 (57 overs):Cook 104*, Root 49* Scorecard Alastair Cook made his first Ashes century for almost seven years to lead England's resurgence on day two of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. The 33-year-old, in his 151st Test, reached his hundred in the final over of the day to take the tourists to 192-2, a deficit of 135 runs. That came after Stuart Broad claimed 4-51 as the home side were bowled out for 327. Australia, who have already secured the Ashes, looked set to push on from anovernight 244-3,with Steve Smith (76) and Shaun Marsh (61) extending their partnership past 100. But when captain Smith became Tom Curran's first Test wicket, it began a slide that saw the hosts lose their last seven wickets for 67 runs. On a slow surface, Cook blunted an Australia attack already without the injured Mitchell Starc and further weakened by a stomach upset suffered by Pat Cummins. The left-hander passed 50 for the first time in six Tests, then had the good fortune of being dropped by Smith on 66. When England won the Ashes down under in 2010-11, Cook piled on 766 runs but has not reached three figures against Australia since the final Test of that series. Here, he played with increasing freedom as a crowd of 67,882 gradually emptied to leave the Barmy Army singing the former captain's name. Cook shared an unbroken stand of 112 with successor Joe Root, who is 49 not out. On day three, it will be the goal of the third-wicket pair, and the rest of England's batting, to earn a lead large enough to negate batting last on a surface on which the bounce could get lower. Reaction: Broad holds no grudges after criticism How day two unfolded at the MCG The failure of England's senior players on this tour has been a key factor in relinquishing the urn. Before this Test, Broad had taken only five wickets and Cook had mustered 83 runs in six innings. Indeed, ex-captain Michael Vaughan had questioned Broad's place in the side, while former spinnerGraeme Swann doubted the ""longevity""left in Cook's international career. Broad, though, responded by picking up his best figures for a year and Cook showed his trademark patience, composure and judgement to sap Australia's bowlers in temperatures in the mid-30s. The result is a turnaround in a fourth Test where Australia were 102-0 on the first day and later, at the close, in a position from which they could have batted England out of the contest. Even if they still have plenty of work to do, England have a real opportunity to end an eight-match losing streak in Australia and escape the humiliation of another whitewash. Day-night Ashes Test in 2019 'unlikely' - ECB chief The Baggy Green - an Australian icon (podcast) Test Match Special's Christmas quiz (podcast) England have been guilty of squandering strong positions throughout the series and they lost two wickets in very different circumstances. Opener Mark Stoneman made 15 before offering a leading edge to off-spinner Nathan Lyon, who took a wonderful, one-handed return catch above his right shoulder. And James Vince was lbw to Josh Hazlewood in the second over after tea for 17, with replays showing that he would have been reprieved by an inside edge had he asked for a review. Cook, however, stood firm at the other end, moving his feet with certainty and showing an intent to score. The left-hander played wonderfully straight, but also punished anything short to accumulate square on both sides of the wicket. Cook's moment of fortune arrived when wicketkeeper Paine came up to the stumps to Mitchell Marsh and, from the next delivery, he edged to slip. Smith tumbled and made two grabs for the ball before it hit the turf. Root, meanwhile, busily earned his runs off the pads and behind square on the off side. On 93 as the final over the day began, Cook was greeted by Smith's part-time leg-spin. He bunted a full-toss for four, scampered two more, then pulled a century-clinching boundary. Alastair Cook was congratulated on his century by Australian players at the close Earlier, England got their rewards in the field with the help of some good fortune and poor Australian batting. The lack of pace in the pitch was highlighted by three players chopping the ball on to their own stumps, the first of which was Smith. The skipper, 65 not out overnight, began in ominous touch and looked nailed on for a fourth successive century in Boxing Day Tests. But, to Curran's second delivery of the day, he tried to force an innocuous short ball through the off side and disturbed his own stumps to be dismissed in Melbourne for the first time since 2014. Broad bowled with good pace on a full length and was rewarded when Shaun Marsh, who passed 50 for the third time in the series, was given out lbw on review. Australia's tail has so often frustrated England, but after Tim Paine's breezy 24 was ended with a play-on off James Anderson, the hosts lost their last three wickets for only two runs. Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""It has been a tough tour for the senior pros but for the first time the experienced batsmen have been at the crease for a few hours. ""Throughout the whole day Cook had a mindset of challenging the bowler. The pitch played beautifully in the afternoon session. ""England are in a fantastic position and have won day two convincingly. Can they win day three? ""From what I have seen from this Australia attack and the pitch, England should have plenty to see the day out and get in front but we can't get ahead of ourselves with this England side."" Ex-England batsman Ed Smith:""The sadness is this shows Australia's weakness. It shows if England had performed earlier they could have been beaten."" Alastair Cook was dropped at slip by Steve Smith on 66 Australia's Josh Hazlewood, speaking to ABC:""They are a little on top. We were a little inconsistent but it is a very good wicket. We could have bowled straighter and dried the scoring up. ""We should have pushed on to 400-plus but we lost wickets early. We definitely left runs out there."" Asked if Australia were complacent with the bat, he said: ""You could say that. Lazy is another way. A few of the boys know that they need to be better.""

Stricken ship 'to move to Southampton',"The Mekhanik Yartsev lost some of its load off Worthing before becoming stricken in the Solent Coastguards are continuing to monitor a Russian cargo ship with a ""significant list"" in the Solent. The Mekhanik Yartsev got into difficulties off Lee-on-the-Solent on Tuesday morning. The 13 crew members are reported to be safe and well and remain on board the vessel, which is carrying wooden pallets. Surveyors have assessed the ship and it is expected to sail to Southampton Harbour on Thursday. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said preparations were being made to ""facilitate the arrival"" of the ship. It had been expected to sail on Tuesday night but the move was hampered by poor weather. This video can not be played The 13 crew members are reported to be safe and well (Video: @SolentShipping) Although the vessel, which is currently off Hill Head, has developed a 20-degree list, it has power and is stable, the MCA said. It added it was issuing navigational safety broadcasts every half hour to warn shipping in the area. Les Chapman, the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention, said the ship lost some pallets overboard before ""limping"" into sheltered water in the Solent. ""There does not appear to be any danger at all at the moment - there's no pollution, she's in a safe, stable position at a safe anchorage with a tug in attendance and a lifeboat in attendance,"" he said. He added the weather was expected to improve and the ship would then be taken to Southampton where its cargo would be unloaded in a bid to ""right"" the ship. The MCA said further pieces of cargo were lost from the vessel during the early hours of Wednesday and it has warned some may wash ashore.

Tesla chief reveals future vehicle plans,"Elon Musk tweeted about Tesla's future plans over a six hour period Tesla's chief has pledged to make a pick-up truck as part of future plans for the electric vehicle-maker. Elon Musk made the promise on Twitter after asking his followers forsuggestions about how the firm could,externalimprove. He said the open-backed truck would follow the Model Y - a yet-to-be detailed car, which is expected to bebased on its Model 3,externalsedan. But experts note Tesla has suffered repeated delivery delays. That has led some to question whether the loss-making company can meet its existing commitments - which also include aforthcoming articulated lorry and sports car. Mr Musk also made several promises about new features Tesla intends to add to its existing vehicles, including intelligent windscreen wipers. Allow Twitter content?

Pick-up trucks are particularly popular in the US, with sales by the three leading manufacturers currently totalling about $90bn (Â£67bn) a year,according to data from Morningstar Equity Research,external. Demand for thetrucks has also risen,externalover the past 12 months, despite a drop for other types of ""light vehicle"". Mr Musk had previously hinted at his plans when an image showing an obscured pick-up was briefly shown being carried on the back of its Semi lorry at a press conference in November. An artist's drawing of a pick-up truck was displayed at the unveiling of the Tesla Semi In his tweets, Mr Musk said the vehicle would likely be ""slightly bigger"" than Ford's bestselling F-150 pick-up to allow it to contain an unspecified ""game-changing"" feature.

Hammond challenged to release Brexit studies,"Philip Hammond said releasing his analysis now would ""deeply unhelpful"" A group of Labour MPs are trying to keep pressure on the government to publish reports about how Brexit will affect the economy. The 25 pro-Remain politicians have written to Chancellor Philip Hammond saying people ""have a right to know what the impact of Brexit will be for them and for their families"". Mr Hammond has said it would be ""deeply unhelpful"" to release his analysis now. Opposition MPs have been pursuing the ""Brexit impact assessments"" for months. But the government has said the sector-by-sector assessments they have been demanding do not exist, and has instead provided MPs with a series of documents it calls ""sectoral analyses"". Davis says Brexit impact assessments don't exist How to handle Brexit conversations over Christmas Watch a political review of 2017 So far, MPs' efforts have mostly focused on Brexit Secretary David Davis. This video can not be played David Davis questioned over Brexit impact assessments Now, a group of Labour MPs who are supporters of the pro-EU Open Britain group have turned their attention to the Treasury. Mr Hammond said earlier this month that a ""whole range of potential alternative structures between the EU and the UK"" have been assessed. The MPs say in their letter to the chancellor: ""Without access to the latest taxpayer-funded analysis and research, Parliament will be hamstrung in its ability to scrutinise the government's approach and to present the facts to our constituents. ""It is vital that light is shed on the modelling and analysis that the Treasury has carried out. The best way to achieve that would be for the analysis to be published in its entirety."" Brexit: All you need to know Hammond plays down Brexit rift reports Brexit 'could be model for Turkey' Signatories to the letter to Mr Hammond include Chris Leslie, Maria Eagle, Stella Creasy and Alison McGovern. Stella Creasy signed the letter to the chancellor In response, the Treasury pointed to Mr Hammond's remarks at the time - where he said that when a final Brexit deal has been negotiated and is going before MPs, ""the maximum amount of analysis being placed in the public domain would be helpful"". However, at this stage it would be ""deeply unhelpful"" for the Treasury's analysis to be made public, he added.

Sick evacuated from besieged Damascus area,"This video can not be played Critically ill children are evacuated from the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta, outside Damascus Medical evacuations are taking place from a rebel-held area on the outskirts of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Four critically-ill patients were taken out of the Eastern Ghouta overnight by the International Committee of the Red Cross and Syrian Arab Red Crescent. Another 25 should be evacuated in the coming days as part of a deal agreed by the government and rebels, though hundreds more are in need of treatment. Some 400,000 residents have been under siege by government forces since 2013. The Eastern Ghouta has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by Russia and Iran, the government's main allies, along with Turkey, which backs the opposition. But hostilities intensified six weeks ago, when the Syrian military stepped up air and artillery attacks on the enclave in response to a rebel offensive, reportedly killing dozens of civilians. There are also severe shortages of food, fuel and medicines, and the cold winter weather is threatening to worsen the hardship.

It gave no further details, but the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) later confirmed that four people with critical medical conditions had been taken with their families to hospitals in Damascus, and that it hoped that a total of 29 people would be evacuated ""over the coming few days"". ""The operation is clearly a positive step that will give some respite to the people in Eastern Ghouta, especially those who are in dire need of life-saving medical treatment,"" spokeswoman Anastasia Isyuk told the BBC. ""We hope this medical evacuation will only be the beginning of more to come, as there many more people in need. It is also vital for humanitarian organisations to reach people in Eastern Ghouta with aid on a regular basis and without conditions."" The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a medical relief organisation that supports hospitals in rebel-held Syria, saidthe 29 patients included 18 children and four women suffering from heart disease, cancer, kidney failure, and blood diseases,external. The seven other patients require advanced surgery. SARC official Ahmed al-Saour told AFP news agency that the first four patients to be evacuated were ""a girl with haemophilia, a child with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, a child suffering from leukaemia, and a man in need of a kidney transplant"". The main rebel group in the Eastern Ghouta, Jaysh al-Islam, meanwhile said on Twitter that the government had agreed to the evacuations in exchange for the release of 29 of its prisoners.

Grenfell firm to pass powers to council,"The firm that managed Grenfell Tower says it will hand over responsibility for thousands of properties to the local council by the end of January. Kensington & Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (TMO) said it would ""temporarily"" give control to London's Kensington and Chelsea Council. The council voted in September to end the contract, a month after the TMO was stripped of responsibility for managing homes in the estate around the tower. The TMO managed almost 10,000 homes. It was heavily criticised after the 14 June fire, in which 71 people died. Why no-one heard the Grenfell blogger's warnings Grenfell Tower: The 21st floor In August, it wasstripped of its responsibilityfor the management of properties in the Lancaster West housing estate, including Grenfell Tower. Then in September Kensington and Chelseacouncillors unanimously voted to end the contractwith the TMO, saying the firm ""no longer has the trust of residents in the borough"". The following month, the TMO and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) said they were working together to secure an ""orderly transition"". In a letter to residents, dated 22 December, chairwoman Fay Edwards said the TMO's board had ""reluctantly decided"" it could ""no longer guarantee that it can fulfil its obligations"" in regards to its contract with the council. ""The board has decided that it would be in the best interests of all residents that the services which the TMO currently provides are temporarily handed back to the council while it carries out consultation with you about the future management of its housing stock,"" she said. She said the consultation ""will take some time"" and said the handover of responsibilities will take place by 31 January. The letter continued: ""The TMO will continue to exist as an independent corporate entity and the board will continue to be accountable to its members."" Residents demonstrated outside Kensington Town Hall after the fire, criticising the management company and the council But Joe Delaney, who lived in a block formerly managed by the TMO and is a member of the council's Grenfell recovery scrutiny committee, criticised the decision. He said: ""My main concern at the moment is capacity - [the council] hasn't even shown the capacity to deal with the Grenfell disaster, so how can they demonstrate that they have got capacity to bring stuff in-house at this time?"" He added: ""And also, what precisely is KCTMO going to do during this time? It is still going to be getting money from the council to keep itself up and running, but it won't have a job."" A council spokesman said: ""We are aware of the update from the TMO to residents and we will be writing to all residents to make sure they have clarity on next steps. ""We are clear, though, that this is only an interim measure."" In a letter which will be sent to residents, deputy council leader Kim Taylor-Smith said they would decide how ""you want your homes managed in future"".

Wrecked reef 'biggest of its kind',"Flame shell beds act as a nursery for other marine life such as scallops A rare marine feature wrecked by a dredging boat has been identified as the biggest known reef of its kind. Divers have estimated that about 250 million flame shells exist on the bed of Loch Carron in Wester Ross. Ministers will now seek to make the emergency measures put in place to protect the reef permanent. In April, a scallop dredger dragged its gear through the reef on two occasions causing damage from which it is likely to take decades to recover. Fishing on Loch Carron was immediately banned and divers have been assessing the size of the reef. They have discovered it is two-and-a-half times larger thana similar feature in Loch Alsh, previously thought to be the biggest. Fishermen have urged caution on the widespread use of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) which prevent them operating in sensitive areas. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ""This is an astonishing find and I think that we would be completely remiss not to take notice of it and to do what we can to protect it. ""The measures that get put in place for MPAs we put in place in consultation with the fishermen to make sure they are reasonable and appropriate."" The reef, which is inhabited by numerous other creatures, is much larger than previously thought Dredging involves towing gear across the seabed to scrape-up the scallops which live there. They can also be caught in smaller numbers by divers. The dredger which damaged the Loch Carron reef was operating legally because no protection measures existed at the time. Nick Underdown, from Open Seas, said: ""Flame shells are highly sensitive to damaging fishing activities like scallop dredging and prawn trawling.  It just does not make sense to tow across these fragile habitats."" Fishermen's groups have distanced themselves from the skipper's actions, saying he did not belong to any industry organisation. Bertie Armstrong, from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF), said: ""The Scottish Fishermen's Federation is foursquare behind environmental protection.  We are working closely with Marine Scotland on the identification, designation and management measures for the MPA network seeking a balance with sustainable economic activity. ""Flame shells are already covered by a number of representative areas.  Inclusion of additional examples of any feature will always be considered carefully, again taking due account of all the needs of fishing communities. ""SFF member associations have no objection to formalising the emergency provisions for the Loch Carron flame shell bed."" Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has conducted a series of dives at the site to establish the extent of the damage and the size of the reef. The vibrant red flame shells are not normally visible as they live a few centimetres into the sand. Their beds are nursery grounds for young scallops. After the dredger had crossed the reef, flame shells were uprooted and scattered across the loch. Ben James,  from SNH, said: ""They used to be much more widely distributed and the habitat, whilst it's a firm mesh if you like, it's like fabric and it's very sensitive and easily ripped and torn apart. ""They sort of ripped the beds up and all the flame shells were exposed, and once they're exposed the flame shells die.""

Acid attacker admits hiding phone in jail,"Arthur Collins admitted one charge of possession of a prohibited item while in prison A man jailed for throwing acid across a packed nightclub has pleaded guilty to hiding a mobile phone inside a crutch while in prison. Arthur Collins, 25, also hid two Sim cards and two USB sticks in the medical aid while on remand at HMP Thameside. He was being held there prior to his trial over the acid attack at a London nightclub, which injured 22 people. Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, appeared via video link at Bromley Magistrates' Court. He admitted one charge of possession of a prohibited item while in prison and will be sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court at a later date. The court heard Collins obtained the phone to make private calls to Miss McCann. At the time Miss McCann was heavily pregnant with their daughter, who was born in November. This video can not be played CCTV of the acid attack in London club Collins' lawyer, Audrey Mogan, told the court: ""He did not have the phone for any sinister purpose."" She said Collins wanted to use the mobile rather than a legitimate phone he had access to in his cell which records calls. Collins and Miss McCann - who have since split - were being ""hounded by the media"" and feared recorded calls would be leaked, Ms Morgan said. The court heard evidence was later found on the phone of calls and messages to family and friends. The acid attack happened in Mangle E8 in Dalston in April Collins threw acid at revellers in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 Apriland was sentenced for the attack on 19 December. He was being held at HMP Thameside prior his trial over the acid attack. The court heard the phone, Sim cards and USB sticks were found on 10 September when a prison officer removed the rubber stopper from the bottom of the crutch in his private shower during a cell search. Prosecutor Samantha Mitchell said: ""He had been using the crutch because of an ankle injury."" Collins was injured trying to evade police while on the run for the acid attack, which left 16 people with chemical burns and temporarily blinded three people, one of whom still suffers from blurred vision in one eye. He told his trial at Wood Green Crown Court he did not know the bottle contained acid and said he believed it to contain a liquid date rape drug which he had snatched from two men after overhearing them planning to spike a girl's drink. But the jury convicted him of five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent and nine counts of actual bodily harm in November.

Wage growth 'will be flat in 2018',"The UK's pay squeeze will end next year, but a meaningful rise in wages remains out of sight, an influential research group has warned. The Resolution Foundation, which campaigns for fair pay, predicted inflation would no longer outpace wage growth by the end of 2018. But it said real wage growth would still be flat and that many households were pessimistic about their finances. The Treasury said it was ""helping families to earn more"". The Office of Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's economic watchdog, projects that when the full figures for 2017 are confirmed they will show that wages have fallen by 0.4% in real terms asinflation has soared to more than 3%. The squeeze, caused by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, has contributed to weaker consumer spending and a slowdown in the housing market. The Resolution Foundation, which based its outlook on OBR data, said the trend would worsen in the first few months of next year before levelling out. This would result in ""zero real wage growth"" in 2018 - an improvement on 2017, but worse than any year in the three decades leading up to the financial crisis. Torsten Bell, director of the research group, said 2017 had been ""a tough year for living standards"". ""The good news is that things will get better next year. The bad news is we may only go from backwards to standing still, with prospects for a meaningful pay recovery still out of sight."" Referencing Bank of England data, the research group added that 27% of working age households thought their financial positions would worsen in the coming 12 months - roughly the same as those who think it will get better. However, it noted the lowest paid workers were set for a pay rise of 4.3% in April as the National Living Wage reached Â£7.83. Overall, it said UK workers would not see a ""noticeable"" pay rise until December 2018. A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We are helping families to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Our National Living Wage is delivering the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years and we are cutting taxes for millions of people.""

Londoners rail at commuter trains,"Londoners think national suburban rail services have got worse More than a third of Londoners think commuter trains have deteriorated over the last year, a new survey suggests. The YouGov poll which surveyed 1,087 people found 37% said national rail services had worsened while eight per cent said they had improved. The findings have been described as a ""damning indictment"" of rail companies. Network Rail, which manages rail infrastructure, claims Londoners will benefit from a ""huge increase in rail capacity"" in the coming months. A Network Rail spokesperson said this was due to new services, new rolling stock and a Â£10bn taxpayer-funded investment. The spokesperson added: ""We have the safest, fastest growing network in Europe and the railway is more reliable now than it has ever been."" The poll was released ahead of an average rail fare increase of 3.4% -the biggest in five years- coming into effect. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""These latest figures are a damning indictment of the continuing failure of train operating companies to provide an adequate service for passengers. ""Londoners are fed up with repeated delays, cancelations and overcrowding. ""Growing dissatisfaction with private train companies shows why a further hike in rail fares this January is simply unjustifiable."" The mayor claimed the ""only viable long-term solution"" was for suburban rail services to be devolved to Transport for London (TfL). That idea was backed by 61% of respondents as well as the Campaign for Better Transport. The group's chief executive, Stephen Joseph, said the survey's findings ""chime with our own and others' research which shows that the rail services TfL controls consistently outperform most other London rail services"". The Department for Transport (DfT)said in Novemberit would ""work with TfL to explore options for transferring selected services such as the West London line to TfL"". Network Rail said ""improved working with TfL at times of disruption to the rail network would be helpful in redirecting passengers to other stations where they can complete their journeys."" A DfT spokesperson said decisions on devolution were made ""based on what will make journeys better for passengers"". Rail fare rise biggest for five years Devolution? Don't hold your breath Rail passengers 'happier with train firms' 'No progress' on rail travel satisfaction Commuters 'back TfL rail devolution' The trouble with our trains Takeover call for south London rail SE rail passengers 'most delayed' Network Rail Transport for London Department for Transport Campaign For Better Transport Mayor of London The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Bach manuscript among items worth more than Â£45 million donated to UK museums Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 Supply Teaching Assistant - Kingston Arrest after woman killed in drive-by shooting outside church Police concerned for 'vulnerable' missing man with autism last seen in north London At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

LA-Tokyo flight u-turn over 'wrong ticket',"Chrissy Teigen live tweeted the ordeal to her 9.2 million followers A Tokyo-bound flight carrying the model Chrissy Teigen and her musician husband John Legend turned back to LA after someone reportedly boarded in error. According to Ms Teigen, the passenger boarded at LAX airport with a ticket for a different airline, although this was not confirmed by authorities. The plane turned back four hours into the flight, over the Pacific Ocean. The airline, All Nippon Airways (ANA), said only that there had been a problem with a customer's ""flight arrangement"". LA-Tokyo U-turn: How can you fly without a ticket? Adonis Cutchlow, of the LAX Police, told the LA Times there had been no criminal or illegal activity on board the plane, and it was not clear why it had turned back. The plane should have flown 11 hours to Tokyo. Instead, passengers spent eight hours in the air only to return to the same airport. According to a series of tweets posted by Ms Teigen to her 9.2 million followers from the plane, the passenger in question boarded the ANA flight with a ticket from United Airlines.

'Critical point' in Eastern Ghouta,"Food shortages have led to the acute malnutrition rate among children rising to 11.9% The situation in a besieged rebel-held area near Syria's capital has reached a ""critical point"", the International Committee of the Red Cross has warned. Scores of civilians have been killed or injured in the Eastern Ghouta in the past month andlife is slowly becoming ""impossible"", the organisation says,external. About 500 people are waiting to be evacuated for life-saving medical care. There are also shortages of food, fuel and medicines, and the cold weather threatens to worsen the hardship. ""Chronic disease sufferers and people with severe injuries are struggling to access care,"" said the ICRC's Middle East director, Robert Mardini. ""The sick and injured must not be used as pawns in negotiations between the different parties involved in the fighting. Medical attention must be promptly given to those who need it irrespective of who they are."" UN rebukes Russia and Iran over Eastern Ghouta Why is there a war in Syria? The 400,000 people trapped in the Eastern Ghouta are also facing a ""frightening"" food shortage and a huge increase in food prices, according to the ICRC. ""Some families can afford to eat only one meal a day, an especially sad situation for people with children. As a result, most people have been relying entirely on aid from humanitarian organisations,"" Mr Mardini said. This video can not be played Children in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta are among those suffering The Eastern Ghouta has been under siege by government forces since 2013. The area has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by Russia and Iran, the government's main allies, along with Turkey, which supports the opposition. But hostilities intensified on 14 November, when the Syrian military stepped up air and artillery attacks on the enclave in response to a rebel offensive.

UN rebukes Russia and Iran,"This video can not be played Children in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta are among those suffering The UN's humanitarian co-ordinator for Syria has rebuked Russia and Iran for not doing more to give aid agencies access to a besieged rebel enclave. Jan Egeland told the BBC the failure to persuade the Syrian government, their ally, to allow desperately ill children to be evacuated from the Eastern Ghouta showed ""complete impotence"". Another two civilians died this week while waiting for permission to leave. Some 400,000 people are trapped in the area, which is just outside Damascus. Dozens of civilians are also reported to have been killed in air and artillery attacks by government forces in the past month, though a ceasefire is now in place. Food shortages have led to the acute malnutrition rate among children in the Eastern Ghouta rising to 11.9% - five or six times what was reported in January, and the highest so far recorded in the country since the civil war began in 2011. Limited electricity, fuel, safe drinking-water and basic sanitation services are meanwhile increasing the risk of outbreaks of diarrheal diseases. How much success has Russia had in Syria? Why is there a war in Syria? The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says Mr Egeland was visibly angry when discussing the inability of the UN and its partners to evacuate people with life-threatening medical conditions from an area only 30 minutes' drive from Damascus. He listed examples of children who he said would die unless they got medical help - Noor, two months old, with a rare form of cancer; and Mohammed, 45 days old, with kidney failure. ""We made the lists of patients. We submitted the first ones in May. We resubmitted in September, October, and in November we got Russians and Iranians and Chinese and Americans and others to say they would work on this. We have collectively failed. It's not good,"" Mr Egeland said. Mr Egeland, who is secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said he would press the cases of the 494 men, women and children in urgent need of medical evacuation in meetings with Russian, Iranian and US officials in Geneva. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed by government bombardment in recent weeks ""My message to them is the following: if you're spending billions and billions of roubles, you have Iranian resources, and you have thousands of soldiers on the ground, and you're flying airplanes in the air, you have to be able to deliver this."" ""If not, in my view, [you] show complete impotence, and you also show a lack of interest in humanitarian law and in saving civilian life."" Joint UN and Syrian Red Crescent aid convoys have only been able to deliver enough food and medical supplies for 68,000 of the 400,000 civilians trapped in the Eastern Ghouta over the past two months. That is despite the area, which has been besieged since 2013, being designated as a ""de-escalation zone"" by Russia, Iran and Turkey, which supports the opposition.

Prince Harry edits Today programme,"This video can not be played Prince Harry: ""It's been a big learning curve"" Prince Harry says he will go on using his position to ""shine a spotlight"" on issues close to his heart. He was speaking as he guest edited BBC Radio 4's Today programme, which focused on the armed forces, mental health, youth crime and climate change. He interviewed former US president Barack Obama and his own father, Prince Charles, as part of the radio show. He also said his fiancee Meghan Markle had enjoyed spending Christmas with the family ""she's never had"". Ahead of his wedding in May, Prince Harry said he was determined 2018 would be a ""fantastic year"". He said: ""Post-Christmas... I just hope everyone out there has had a chance to just think about the things that really matter and the difference that every single one of us can make. ""Part of my role and part of my job is to shine a spotlight on issues that need that spotlight, whether it's people, whether it's causes, issues, whatever it is. ""So I will continue to play my part in society and do my job to the best of my abilities so that I can wake up in the morning and feel energised."" Download podcasts from Prince Harry's Today programme In the interviews,Mr Obama said irresponsible use of social media was distorting the public's understanding of complex issues, while the Prince of Wales said climate change was causing ""untold horrors"" in different part of the world. As the programme ended, presenters Justin Webb and Sarah Montague turned the microphone on the fifth in line to the throne, who spent Christmas at Sandringham with members of the Royal Family and his fiancÃ©e. This video can not be played Prince Harry discusses Meghan Markle's first Christmas with the Royal Family Prince Harry said he had an ""amazing time"" - Ms Markle ""really enjoyed it and the family really loved having her there"" although there were ""plenty"" of family traditions he needed to explain. The 33-year-old said they had a ""great time"" with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and ""running around with the kids"". American actress Ms Markle's presence at Sandringham was the first time someone yet to marry into the Royal Family has been invited to join their Christmas celebrations. Prince Harry said: ""She's done an absolutely amazing job, she's getting in there and it's the family that I suppose she's never had"". Meanwhile, boxer Anthony Joshua, who was a guest on the programme, tweeted a picture of himself with Prince Harry and offered to be his best man. The world heavyweight champion wrote: ""Back to work this morning! Congrats on everything this year and no pressure on the R4 guest edit! P.S. Need a best man?"" Allow Twitter content?

BBC royal editor Nicholas Witchell said the prince had previously expressed doubts about his public role but the programme showed that was no longer the case and he ""wants to make a real difference in the work that he does"". However, he added Prince Harry was not able to ask genuinely probing questions in the interviews because, as a member of the Royal Family, he has to avoid areas that might be deemed to be political. It is the 14th year public figures have been in control of Today's output between Christmas and New Year. Prince Harry in the Today studio with presenters Justin Webb and Sarah Montague Other guest editors include a robot, Bletchley Park code-breaker Baroness Trumpington, Tamara Rojo of the English National Ballet and poet and novelist Benjamin Okri. Prince Harry's programme also featured an audio diary recordedin Toronto at the Invictus Games,the Paralympic-style competition for injured service personnel he launched in 2014. And he conducted aninterview with British artificial intelligence entrepreneurDemis Hassabis. Another section saw Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick interviewed live in the studio as Prince Harry sat in the editor's chair. Prince Harry chose Abdurahman Sayed, from the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in North Kensington, which has been helping people affected by June's fire at nearby Grenfell Tower, to speak in Today's Thought for the Day spot. On his editing role, Prince Harry said: ""I haven't done that many interviews but it was quite fun, especially interviewing President Obama. ""It's been a big learning curve, but also these are incredibly important topics that I think we all need to think about that need to be discussed and I'm incredibly fortunate to have a platform like this."" By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent One claims to speak for the nation and one claims to speak to the nation. On Radio 4's Today, the Royal Family and the BBC came together in a cosy embrace. Few of the prince's causes were unrepresented and he was himself dotted through the programme, encouraging and enthusing about nearly everything. He is clearly bouncing towards the new year, a time he insisted would be full of ""great change - good things are going to happen in 2018"". There was little in the way of actual hard news - former US President Barack Obama has more time on his hands; the Prince of Wales - ""Pa"" as Harry called him - is concerned about the environment; Harry doesn't drink coffee, or much of it. But there were glimpses of the gilded cage. A note of wistfulness in his voice when he asked Mr Obama about ""stepping off the treadmill"" of constant exposure. Prince Harry, who was in the Army for 10 years, said he wanted the armed forces to feature because ""there's a huge role they play and we must make sure it's not sympathy but respect we show"".

Prince Harry grills Barack Obama on his likes and dislikes In his interview, the Prince of Wales said he had ""bored you [the prince] to tears over so many years"" with discussions on the environment but the public was ""beginning to realise that what I was trying to say may not have been as dotty as they thought"". Prince Charles said he wanted to ""ensure that you and your children, my grandchildren...  have a world fit to live in, that provides them with opportunity"".

Obama warns on harmful social media use,"This video can not be played Barack Obama opens up about how he felt after Donald Trump's inauguration Former US President Barack Obama has warned against the irresponsible use of social media, in a rare interview since stepping down in January. He warned that such actions were distorting people's understanding of complex issues, and spreading misinformation. ""All of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can recreate a common space on the internet,"" he said. Mr Obama was quizzed by Prince Harry on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Prince Harry, fifth in line to the throne, is one of several prominent figures who are guest-editing the programmeover the Christmas period. The former president expressed concern about a future where facts are discarded and people only read and listen to things that reinforce their own views. ""One of the dangers of the internet is that people can have entirely different realities. They can be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases. ""The question has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a multiplicity of voices, allows a diversity of views, but doesn't lead to a Balkanisation of society and allows ways of finding common ground,"" he said. Mr Obama's successor Donald Trump is a prolific user of Twitter, but Mr Obama did not mention him by name. What promises has Trump kept as president? Is Donald Trump winning? 'Don't take away our healthcare' Mr Trump has been accused of overusing Twitter and following only a narrow range of users, though he maintains it allows him to connect directly with the American people. This video can not be played Boxers or briefs? Prince Harry grills Barack Obama on his likes and dislikes Mr Obama suggested face-to-face contact would help counteract extreme views. ""Social media is a really powerful tool for people of common interests to convene and get to know each other and connect. ""But then it's important for them to get offline, meet in a pub, meet at a place of worship, meet in a neighbourhood and get to know each other. ""Because the truth is that on the internet, everything is simplified and when you meet people face-to-face it turns out they're complicated."" ""It's hard, being in the public eye is unpleasant in a lot of ways.  It is challenging in a lot of ways. ""Your loved ones are made vulnerable in ways that might not have been true 20 years ago or 30 years ago. ""So it is a sacrifice that I think everybody has to be at peace with when they decide to go into politics.  But, ultimately, I think the rewards of bringing about positive change in this world make it worthwhile."" Mr Obama pays tribute to the support of his family, especially his wife Michelle, describing how glad he is that she was ""my partner throughout that whole process"". Mixed feelings given ""all the work that was still undone"". ""Concerns about how the country moves forward but, you know, overall there was serenity there,"" he added. Mr Obama compared his time in office to being a relay runner. ""Serenity"" on leaving office - Obama's last White House press conference in January ""If you ran hard, you did your best and you were able to pass that baton successfully and the world was a little better then you had done your job."" He cites Obamacare - ensuring more people can afford basic healthcare - as a major achievement. ""What an enormous blessing it is to say that 20 million Americans have health insurance that didn't have it before."" Without dismissing the problems faced by the world, he remains an optimist. ""If we take responsibility for being involved in our own fate, if we participate, if we engage, if we speak out, if we work in our communities, if we volunteer, then all the problems that we face are solvable despite all the terrible news that you see. ""If you had to choose a moment in human history in which you'd want to be born you'd choose today because the fact is that the world is healthier, wealthier, better educated and more tolerant, more sophisticated and less violent."" As well as editing, Prince Harry was himself interviewed on Today. ""I haven't done that many interviews but it was quite fun, especially interviewing President Obama despite the fact he wanted to interview me. ""It's been a big learning curve but also these are incredibly important topics we all need to think about and need to be discussed."" The prince's programme focused on issues such as the armed forces, mental health, youth crime and climate change. Harry's jokey warm-up for Obama interview.

Real wages 'will be flat in 2018',"The UK's pay squeeze will end next year, but a meaningful rise in wages remains out of sight, an influential research group has warned. The Resolution Foundation, which campaigns for fair pay, predicted inflation would no longer outpace wage growth by the end of 2018. But it said real wage growth would still be flat and that many households were pessimistic about their finances. The Treasury said it was ""helping families to earn more"". The Office of Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's economic watchdog, projects that when the full figures for 2017 are confirmed they will show that wages have fallen by 0.4% in real terms asinflation has soared to more than 3%. The squeeze, caused by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, has contributed to weaker consumer spending and a slowdown in the housing market. The Resolution Foundation, which based its outlook on OBR data, said the trend would worsen in the first few months of next year before levelling out. This would result in ""zero real wage growth"" in 2018 - an improvement on 2017, but worse than any year in the three decades leading up to the financial crisis. Torsten Bell, director of the research group, said 2017 had been ""a tough year for living standards"". ""The good news is that things will get better next year. The bad news is we may only go from backwards to standing still, with prospects for a meaningful pay recovery still out of sight."" Referencing Bank of England data, the research group added that 27% of working age households thought their financial positions would worsen in the coming 12 months - roughly the same as those who think it will get better. However, it noted the lowest paid workers were set for a pay rise of 4.3% in April as the National Living Wage reached Â£7.83. Overall, it said UK workers would not see a ""noticeable"" pay rise until December 2018. A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We are helping families to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Our National Living Wage is delivering the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years and we are cutting taxes for millions of people.""

"Cook stars for resurgent EnglandAlastair Cook hits an unbeaten century as England close on 192-2 on the second day of the fourth Test, 135 runs behind Australia.8m9 minutes agoBBC SportComments","This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: Cook shines as England dominate day two Fourth Ashes Test, Melbourne Cricket Ground (day two of five) Australia 327 (119 overs):Warner 103, Smith 76, Broad 4-51 England 192-2 (57 overs):Cook 104*, Root 49* Scorecard Alastair Cook made his first Ashes century for almost seven years to lead England's resurgence on day two of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. The 33-year-old, in his 151st Test, reached his hundred in the final over of the day to take the tourists to 192-2, a deficit of 135 runs. That came after Stuart Broad claimed 4-51 as the home side were bowled out for 327. Australia, who have already secured the Ashes, looked set to push on from anovernight 244-3,with Steve Smith (76) and Shaun Marsh (61) extending their partnership past 100. But when captain Smith became Tom Curran's first Test wicket, it began a slide that saw the hosts lose their last seven wickets for 67 runs. On a slow surface, Cook blunted an Australia attack already without the injured Mitchell Starc and further weakened by a stomach upset suffered by Pat Cummins. The left-hander passed 50 for the first time in six Tests, then had the good fortune of being dropped by Smith on 66. When England won the Ashes down under in 2010-11, Cook piled on 766 runs but has not reached three figures against Australia since the final Test of that series. Here, he played with increasing freedom as a crowd of 67,882 gradually emptied to leave the Barmy Army singing the former captain's name. Cook shared an unbroken stand of 112 with successor Joe Root, who is 49 not out. On day three, it will be the goal of the third-wicket pair, and the rest of England's batting, to earn a lead large enough to negate batting last on a surface on which the bounce could get lower. Reaction: Broad holds no grudges after criticism How day two unfolded at the MCG The failure of England's senior players on this tour has been a key factor in relinquishing the urn. Before this Test, Broad had taken only five wickets and Cook had mustered 83 runs in six innings. Indeed, ex-captain Michael Vaughan had questioned Broad's place in the side, while former spinnerGraeme Swann doubted the ""longevity""left in Cook's international career. Broad, though, responded by picking up his best figures for a year and Cook showed his trademark patience, composure and judgement to sap Australia's bowlers in temperatures in the mid-30s. The result is a turnaround in a fourth Test where Australia were 102-0 on the first day and later, at the close, in a position from which they could have batted England out of the contest. Even if they still have plenty of work to do, England have a real opportunity to end an eight-match losing streak in Australia and escape the humiliation of another whitewash. Day-night Ashes Test in 2019 'unlikely' - ECB chief The Baggy Green - an Australian icon (podcast) Test Match Special's Christmas quiz (podcast) England have been guilty of squandering strong positions throughout the series and they lost two wickets in very different circumstances. Opener Mark Stoneman made 15 before offering a leading edge to off-spinner Nathan Lyon, who took a wonderful, one-handed return catch above his right shoulder. And James Vince was lbw to Josh Hazlewood in the second over after tea for 17, with replays showing that he would have been reprieved by an inside edge had he asked for a review. Cook, however, stood firm at the other end, moving his feet with certainty and showing an intent to score. The left-hander played wonderfully straight, but also punished anything short to accumulate square on both sides of the wicket. Cook's moment of fortune arrived when wicketkeeper Paine came up to the stumps to Mitchell Marsh and, from the next delivery, he edged to slip. Smith tumbled and made two grabs for the ball before it hit the turf. Root, meanwhile, busily earned his runs off the pads and behind square on the off side. On 93 as the final over the day began, Cook was greeted by Smith's part-time leg-spin. He bunted a full-toss for four, scampered two more, then pulled a century-clinching boundary. Alastair Cook was congratulated on his century by Australian players at the close Earlier, England got their rewards in the field with the help of some good fortune and poor Australian batting. The lack of pace in the pitch was highlighted by three players chopping the ball on to their own stumps, the first of which was Smith. The skipper, 65 not out overnight, began in ominous touch and looked nailed on for a fourth successive century in Boxing Day Tests. But, to Curran's second delivery of the day, he tried to force an innocuous short ball through the off side and disturbed his own stumps to be dismissed in Melbourne for the first time since 2014. Broad bowled with good pace on a full length and was rewarded when Shaun Marsh, who passed 50 for the third time in the series, was given out lbw on review. Australia's tail has so often frustrated England, but after Tim Paine's breezy 24 was ended with a play-on off James Anderson, the hosts lost their last three wickets for only two runs. Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""It has been a tough tour for the senior pros but for the first time the experienced batsmen have been at the crease for a few hours. ""Throughout the whole day Cook had a mindset of challenging the bowler. The pitch played beautifully in the afternoon session. ""England are in a fantastic position and have won day two convincingly. Can they win day three? ""From what I have seen from this Australia attack and the pitch, England should have plenty to see the day out and get in front but we can't get ahead of ourselves with this England side."" Ex-England batsman Ed Smith:""The sadness is this shows Australia's weakness. It shows if England had performed earlier they could have been beaten."" Alastair Cook was dropped at slip by Steve Smith on 66 Australia's Josh Hazlewood, speaking to ABC:""They are a little on top. We were a little inconsistent but it is a very good wicket. We could have bowled straighter and dried the scoring up. ""We should have pushed on to 400-plus but we lost wickets early. We definitely left runs out there."" Asked if Australia were complacent with the bat, he said: ""You could say that. Lazy is another way. A few of the boys know that they need to be better.""

Why no-one heard the Grenfell blogger's warnings,"When fire engulfed Grenfell Tower nearly six months ago, with the loss of 71 lives, many were astonished that a London tower block could burn so quickly and with such devastating results. But one of the building's residents foresaw it all too clearly - he just couldn't find anyone to listen to his warnings. Last November, on a grey Sunday with the rain drizzling constantly outside his window, a man sat at his computer on the 16th floor of his West London tower block and began to write a blog. ""It is our conviction that a serious fire in a tower block... is the most likely reason that those who wield power at the KCTMO [Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation] will be found out and brought to justice!"" Six months later, on 14 June, London woke up to the news that a fire had blazed through Grenfell Tower on the Lancaster West estate in North Kensington, killing dozens of residents. By the following night the blog had received more than two million hits. ""You know when you just get the pen and just write?"" says the blog's author. ""That's what happened that day, and looking back it's like a premonition that's so awful. I would never have written that had I known what was going to happen."" The man behind the blog is Edward Daffarn, a 55-year-old social worker who had lived on the estate for 16 years. He was in his flat two-thirds of the way up Grenfell Tower when the fire took hold. Luckily, a neighbour called him in time and urged him to get out. He wrapped a wet towel around his head and ran into the smoke that had already filled the building. That night he lost his home, all his possessions, and the community he loved. Edward Daffarn lost everything in the fire Daffarn is understandably emotional when reflecting on the last few months, but more than that he is angry. Angry with the way he feels Grenfell residents were treated by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation - the people who were entrusted to maintain the estate and keep its residents safe. Angry with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council, which was meant to scrutinise the KCTMO. Angry with a society which didn't seem to care about people like him - people who live on housing estates - until it was too late. ""The reality is if you're on a housing estate it's indifference and neglect, two words that sum up everything about the way we were treated,"" he says. ""They weren't interested in providing housing services, keeping us safe, maintaining the estate. They were just interested in themselves."" Daffarn and fellow Grenfell resident Francis O'Connor had been blogging on behalf of the Grenfell Action Group since 2012. They wrote about issues that concerned their tight-knit community - air pollution, the closure of the local public library, and their fears that corners were being cut during the refurbishment of the tower. ""We wanted to record for history how a community on a housing estate in the fifth richest country in the world could be ignored, neglected, treated with indifference. We never thought we could make change. We just wanted to record what was happening,"" he says. Daffarn and O'Connor shared a theory that Kensington and Chelsea - a London borough more widely known for its museums, designer shops and flower shows - actually wanted its council estates to go into decline, so that the residents would leave and expensive flats could be built in this sought-after location. For this they were described as fantasists. ""We weren't fantasists,"" he says, visibly hurt. ""We were trying to raise genuine concerns about how our community was being run down."" The natural consequence, he concluded, would be loss of life. Which is why on 20 November 2016, frustrated and desperate, Edward wrote the blog postKCTMO - Playing with fire!,external ""It is a truly terrifying thought but the Grenfell Action Group firmly believe that only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord."" A few months earlier a fire had ripped through five floors of a tower block in Shepherd's Bush, just down the road. Edward was worried that if a fire broke out in his tower block residents wouldn't know what to do. They had been given no proper fire safety instructions from the KCTMO. There were no instructions on individual floors on how residents should act in the event of a fire, there was only a recent newsletter saying residents should remain in their flats - advice which in the case of the Shepherd's Bush fire would have led to fatalities. In March 2017 the KCTMO installed fire safety instruction notices in the entrance hallway to Grenfell Tower and outside the lifts on every floor of the building, again urging residents to ""stay put"" unless the fire was ""in or affecting your flat"". It wasn't the first time the Grenfell blog's authors had raised concerns about fire safety. Before the blog began, when a school was built on the only green space the residents had, they wrote to the borough pointing out that access for fire and emergency vehicles had been compromised. Later they blogged about the blocking of a fire exit with mattresses during the refurbishment and the power surges in 2013 that manifested in flickering lights, computers and stereos blowing up, and entire rooms filling with smoke. These continued for three weeks, Daffarn says. ""We were tenants we weren't fire safety specialists but we were switched on enough to feel this was important and it was not being dealt with on our estate and that's why we were blogging. It wasn't for us to tell the council what they should be doing., We were just trying to raise an alarm."" An alarm that went unanswered. The November 2016 blog post represented the last moment at which something might have been done to avert the disaster which followed six months later. But why didn't anyone heed or investigate Daffarn's claims? The other side of Kensington and Chelsea - a golden Ferrari parked outside Chanel on Sloane Street Hidden within the story of the Grenfell blog is another story of the decline of local media. There simply was no local press on the ground in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea scrutinising the authorities and helping to amplify the voice of people like Edward Daffarn. The last time he had the attention of a local journalist was in 2014 when Camilla Horrox, the reporter for the Kensington and Chelsea Chronicle ran front page stories about Grenfell residents' concerns regarding the possible presence of asbestos on the site of the new school and about the power surges. She had met Daffarn several times, and had been concerned about KCTMO's dealings with the residents of the properties it managed. But when the newspaper was closed down later that year Horrox was made redundant and all her Grenfell articles disappeared from the web. The Kensington and Chelsea Chronicle was incorporated into a website that reports on 29 west London districts. Horrox's replacement was expected to report on three boroughs - Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and Hammersmith and Fulham - while based in Surrey, an hour's drive away. Some residents of the borough might have been under the mistaken impression that they did have a local newspaper. In 2015 a free paper, The Kensington and Chelsea News, was established to fill the gap left by the closing of the Chronicle. But when I tracked down its reporter he explained that he was the sole reporter working on the paper, and on two other local newspapers - his salary was Â£500 a week and he did almost all his reporting from home in Dorset, 150 miles away. He made it to the borough only twice in two-and-a-half years, and the one story he ever published about Grenfell was from a council press release about the installation of the new cladding. Local News: What Are We Missing?was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.Listen againon iPlayer. Though he always searched for a ""good front page splash"" for each of the three editions, he also made sure to find two pages of royal stories and two pages of entertainment stories. Edward Daffarn didn't take his concerns to the media in November 2016 because he no longer thought anyone would listen. But the blog was out there for everyone to see, he points out, if only they had been looking. ""We'd been blogging for three or four years and you go back over that time there's a lot of abusive behaviour evidenced forensically about what was happening to our community, but it wasn't sexy so it never got picked up."" For Edward, what was going on at Grenfell wasn't just a local story, but a national one. A story about invisible people in a society that cared more about celebrity and wealth than its most vulnerable residents. Close to tears, he admonishes the nation's journalists. ""If you look back now our whole community of North Kensington, the policy that the local authority was taking every public space and privatising it, that that could be missed by the BBC, by Channel Four, by these wider news agencies... The question should be for you, why did you miss it? ""Why aren't our lives important enough for you?"" Responding to Edward Daffarn's allegations, a spokesman for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council said: ""The Tenant Management Organisation was responsible for managing and maintaining Grenfell Tower. Our residents deserve answers about what went wrong and the public inquiry will help provide these. ""We're changing our Council and the way we work with our communities, ensuring residents are at the heart of everything we do. We will provide all households from Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk with the best offer of new housing possible - and we are listening to what they want and moving at their pace."" A spokesman for the Tenant Management Organisation declined to respond to specific allegations because of the public inquiry and police investigation into the tragic events at Grenfell Tower. He added: ""As a resident-led organisation we want to fully understand what happened at Grenfell Tower.  We recognise our responsibility to ensure that the public inquiry and police investigation processes are not hampered or undermined in any way; to that end we are co-operating fully with them and are determined to continue to help with these processes.""

Drug-smuggling Briton jailed in Egypt,"This video can not be played Karl Turner MP: ""This is a... decent, honest, hard-working Hull woman, who was simply naive"" A British woman has been convicted of smuggling 300 painkiller tablets into Egypt and jailed for three years. Laura Plummer, 33, was arrested after she was found with the Tramadol tablets in her suitcase, on 9 October. Plummer, from Hull, claimed the painkiller, legal on prescription in the UK but banned in Egypt, was to treat her Egyptian partner's back pain. Her family said her lawyers had lodged an appeal. Plummer previously saidshe had ""no idea"" the tablets were illegal. Plummer's mother Roberta Synclair, who was in court for the hearing, told the BBC: ""I'm still in shock after today's verdict. It's difficult and I can't believe it after waiting for two months."" She said her daughter has now been moved to another police station ahead of her move to prison. Laura Plummer said the prescription pills were for her partner Omar Caboo The family has previously said Plummer had no idea that what she was doing was illegal and was just ""daft"". They said she did not try to hide the medicine, which she had been given by a friend, and thought it was a joke when she was taken aside by officials. Plummer was detained on arriving at the Red Sea resort of Hurghada for a holiday with her partner, Omar Caboo. Her sister Rachel Plummer said: ""My mum's obviously devastated. She's out there by herself."" It is not clear when an appeal against her sentence might be heard. She said: ""We're just hoping. Even half of that would be better. Anything less than three years. She doesn't deserve that."" What is Tramadol? Tramadol is a strong painkiller used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is a class C drug and is only available in the UK with a prescription from a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional. As a class C drug, it is illegal for anyone else to supply Tramadol, to have it or to give it away, even to friends. Source: NHS/FRANK Her other sister Jayne Synclair said Plummer had only been trying to help her partner. ""She was taking those tablets to help her man who had been in an accident,"" she said. ""He did not even know she was bringing them. She was doing it to be kind. How can you be sentenced to three years just for being kind?"" This video can not be played Jayne Sinclair, sister: ""She's on the verge of a mental breakdown"" Reacting to news of the sentence, Karl Turner, MP for Hull East, said the court's decision was ""devastating"" for Plummer and her family. He said: ""Laura, most of all, will be absolutely devastated. She's not been well lately, she's sleep deprived and she's been very anxious ""I think it's a damning indictment about good sense and fair play."" Mr Turner accepted Plummer had been naive but was ""decent, honest and hard-working"". ""[She was] going to visit her partner in Egypt, taking what she thought was a painkiller and no more than that,"" he said. ""It clearly is a banned substance and whilst we must respect the law of other countries there must be good sense and fair play as well."" A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ""We will continue to provide assistance to Laura and her family following the court ruling in Egypt, and our embassy is in regular contact with the Egyptian authorities.""

"Real wages 'will be flat in 2018'Britain's pay squeeze will end, but a meaningful pay rise remains out of sight, says research group.2h2 hours agoBusiness","The UK's pay squeeze will end next year, but a meaningful rise in wages remains out of sight, an influential research group has warned. The Resolution Foundation, which campaigns for fair pay, predicted inflation would no longer outpace wage growth by the end of 2018. But it said real wage growth would still be flat and that many households were pessimistic about their finances. The Treasury said it was ""helping families to earn more"". The Office of Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's economic watchdog, projects that when the full figures for 2017 are confirmed they will show that wages have fallen by 0.4% in real terms asinflation has soared to more than 3%. The squeeze, caused by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, has contributed to weaker consumer spending and a slowdown in the housing market. The Resolution Foundation, which based its outlook on OBR data, said the trend would worsen in the first few months of next year before levelling out. This would result in ""zero real wage growth"" in 2018 - an improvement on 2017, but worse than any year in the three decades leading up to the financial crisis. Torsten Bell, director of the research group, said 2017 had been ""a tough year for living standards"". ""The good news is that things will get better next year. The bad news is we may only go from backwards to standing still, with prospects for a meaningful pay recovery still out of sight."" Referencing Bank of England data, the research group added that 27% of working age households thought their financial positions would worsen in the coming 12 months - roughly the same as those who think it will get better. However, it noted the lowest paid workers were set for a pay rise of 4.3% in April as the National Living Wage reached Â£7.83. Overall, it said UK workers would not see a ""noticeable"" pay rise until December 2018. A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We are helping families to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Our National Living Wage is delivering the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years and we are cutting taxes for millions of people.""

Is a new diesel car more toxic than an old one?," I have a memory of my dad from the 1980s. Every summer we would drive to France, taking the ferry from Portsmouth to Le Havre. As we were about to dock, people would get into their cars and start their engines. There would be a 10-or-15-minute delay before the doors opened and the cars started down the gangplank on to French soil. Until that happened, exhaust fumes began to fill the car deck. My dad would rail against the practice. He would tap on people's windows and ask them to turn off their engines. In those days there was lead in petrol, but the main problem was carbon monoxide. Dad was a surgeon and here were people needlessly filling their bodies with toxins from their exhausts. All because they couldn't wait to turn that key in the ignition. Tom and his parents on a ferry to France in the 1980s At the time I was embarrassed. Why were we always the last ones to turn our engine on? It's more than 30 years since those Townsend Thoresen ferry crossings. And today what gets me is this - these days my dad drives a diesel. Tom and his dad, Hubert Diesels are in the newspapers nearly every day. They are killing thousands of people in the UK every year, we read. The diesel driver is a new kind of bogeyman. But when I ask my dad when he's going to scrap his car for the good of humanity, he looks at me with a mixture of surprise and annoyance. “Why would I do that?” Three weeks later I am near Wandsworth Bridge, stuck in a line of traffic that jerks forward a foot or two at a time. It is early July, London is in the grip of a heatwave and Melvyn, my 23-year-old petrol-fuelled VW Golf, has no air-con. I have my window open and you can almost chew the 30C air - a soupy sludge made from the exhaust gases of the cars, buses and vans around us. Beth, my partner, asks me to close the window for the sake of our 11-week-old baby asleep in the back. We start to argue about which is worse for our daughter - overheating or exhaust fumes. Beth wins. The windows are shut, the car gets warmer, but at least we are keeping the noxious gases out. Or some of them. These two experiences will lead, months later, to a family experiment. Father and son, two cars, and the same type of emissions test that rumbled VW. We want to find out whose car is worst for human health. The result is interesting. But the real surprise is that few people really know what their cars are doing to us, and that some new cars are far, far worse than others, and even worse than some old cars. I'd been thinking about London's air ever since Beth and I moved back from a year in the French countryside. In January 2017, a month after our return, London briefly overtook Beijing for levels of particulates - tiny soot particles that can lodge in the lungs or enter the bloodstream. Smog in London, January 2017 Londoners were advised to reduce their physical activity, particularly outdoors. Across the UK, vehicle pollution in the form of particulates and nitrogen oxides was killing 40,000 people per year, according to government figures. Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Burnley, Chelmsford, Derby, Leeds, Northampton, and Sheffield were just some of the towns and cities mentioned for exceeding limits on nitrogen dioxide. Hang on, I thought, weren't engines supposed to be getting cleaner? Three weeks later I am near Wandsworth Bridge, stuck in a line of traffic that jerks forward a foot or two at a time.

Hang on, I thought, weren't engines supposed to be getting cleaner? The Volkswagen scandal two years ago showed just how untrustworthy official emissions figures were for diesels. While particulates are the achilles heel of older diesels, new diesels have efficient particulate filters. What they struggle to control is NOx - oxides of nitrogen, the most harmful of which is nitrogen dioxide. In the US, researchers believe there is a strong link between inhaling nitrogen oxides and lung and heart problems, and this has resulted in tighter emission limits. In order to get its diesels into the country, VW realised it would have to cheat. So it installed “defeat devices” in the car's on-board computer that would recognise when a test was taking place and lower NOx emissions for the duration of the test. For older cars - petrol or diesel - emissions figures simply aren’t available. Even if you trust the official figures issued when they were first made, the engines will have become less efficient and more polluting over time. But how much? You’ll be hard pressed to find out. Mulling all this over, an idea began to take shape. My dad and I had two very interesting cars. The kind of cars that would be held up as just the kind we should be scrapping. Why not test my ageing petrol Golf against dad's newer Skoda Octavia diesel? It would be Top Trumps - but for emissions rather than 0-60 in 3.8 seconds. I was hoping our two cars would tell us something about the existing stock of cars on the road. My dad's car was made in 2009, so it's eight years old, the average age of a car in the UK. Mine, at 23 years old, is a senior citizen. But that too would tell us something about petrol engines from the distant past and how they age. Despite the outcry about air quality, no-one really knows how to frame the problem. Is it all to do with the type of engine - diesel v petrol? Is it the age of the engine - are old bangers the problem? Or is it about the manufacturer - are some makes better than others? And then what about NOx and particulates - are some good on one and poor on the other? And where does that leave carbon dioxide emissions, the greenhouse gas now rather forgotten in our focus on the more immediate peril of particulates and NOx? In late July the government published its air quality plan - after being compelled to by the High Court. The document put the onus on local authorities to enforce controls where limits on NOx were being exceeded. Highly polluting vehicles could be charged or banned from certain areas. A car scrappage scheme was not in the plan but neither was it ruled out. London has already jumped the gun with its T Charge, to begin on 23 October, which will charge drivers of pre-2005 cars (Euro 1, 2 or 3 in the jargon) an extra £10 to enter the congestion zone, regardless of whether their car is petrol or diesel. It is a precursor to the much more ambitious Ultra Low Emission Zone, penalising any vehicle made before autumn 2009 (pre-Euro 5) - which now seems likely to come into force in 2019 and to cover a large area between the North and South Circular ring roads. In other words, local government is coming for you. But are they going after the right targets? At a certain point my mother and father go to a lecture by Prof Frank Kelly who advises the government on the medical effects of air pollutants. He paints a stark picture. The closer you get to an exhaust pipe the more serious the problem is, the air at a busy junction is worse than on a quiet street a stone's throw away. Kelly recommends using back streets and keeping away from the kerb. This is not some amorphous cloud. Each individual car's exhaust is causing damage to individual people on every street. Dad was fascinated but also concerned. I sense his attitude has mellowed since we last discussed diesels. I seize the moment. We always used to buy petrol cars when I was growing up. So why, about 15 years ago, did he switch to diesel? It was to do with fuel economy, he explains. You can go further on a gallon of diesel, and in France - on holiday, travelling long distances - it was much cheaper. Hubert de Castella - Tom's dad Diesel was not seen as perfect, he recalls. He remembers being encouraged to phone a hotline to report dirty diesels with their telltale black smoke. But a well-tuned diesel was seen as the superior technology for miles per gallon and carbon dioxide emissions. Indeed, when I check I see that in 2001 the then chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax breaks for diesel cars because of their lower CO2 emissions. “We didn't think much about NOx at that time,” my dad says. “It's all come to light, the actual forms of pollution, in the last two or three years as far as the public are concerned. It shows that people do the wrong things for the right motives.” But knowing what we do now, shouldn't drivers like him be penalised? (I'm enjoying grilling my dad the way he has often grilled me over the years.) He isn't fazed though. “I think once the word ‘penalising’ comes into it people would start litigation saying, 'You got us into this mess, so how dare you penalise us for what we've done on your behalf,’” he replies. It seems to me that one might also blame those carmakers who have helped disguise the extent of the problem, either by cheating or simply by designing cars that pass emissions tests in the lab but continue to emit high levels of pollutants in real-world driving. And this brings me on to my final question. I ask if he's willing to submit the Skoda to an independent emissions test. “My Golf versus your Skoda, may the best car win - what do you say?” He thinks about it for a second, smiles and nods wearily. I sense that deep down he's also curious to find out what his car is pumping into the air. It's a bet of sorts. So what about the stakes? We settle on a pint. I may have my Dad on board. But how do you even get a car tested for emissions? You can't just walk in off the street and ask a garage for a NOx or particulate test. A garage tests emissions as part of the MoT. But it’s quite a crude system - it doesn't pick up NOx and misses invisible particulates. The best way of finding out what a car emits is to test it in real-world driving, with a PEMS - portable emissions measurement system. This is the kit that a bunch of students and their lecturers at the University of West Virginia used to identify differences in what VW cars emitted in a lab and what they produced on the roads. It led to dieselgate. Very few people in the UK seem to have a PEMS kit though. I assumed there would be a government-funded research centre to study vehicle emissions. The closest I can find, though, is the Transport Research Laboratory, which in the 1970s invented the mini-roundabout, and was privatised in 1996. But they don't have a PEMS kit. I do find two vehicle testing firms who regularly use PEMS. The first discusses my request internally for a week before saying they don't have the capacity for “ad hoc emissions testing”. An executive at the second company tells me, as an aside, that their clients are carmakers who don't want any potentially negative coverage of vehicle emissions. I later discover that there is a body called the Vehicle Certification Agency that is responsible for vehicle type approval, including measuring fuel consumption and emissions. But they do not have their own centre, they use private contractors - the two companies I have just been talking to. In the course of my enquiries I also discover the test is expensive. No-one will give precise figures but it's somewhere between £3,000 and £10,000 per car. Due to the unique way the BBC is funded, this isn't going to work. And then I hear about a small independent firm, Emissions Analytics, based in the Buckinghamshire village of Stokenchurch. It was started in 2011 by an Oxford economics graduate called Nick Molden, who spotted what he calls “a market failure” caused by poor data. Nick Molden “The official statistics were leading people to buy the wrong car,” he says. They were told it did 60mpg but in fact it did 40mpg.” Not only that, the regulations were leading the manufacturers to build the wrong kind of car. “They would meet the NOx limit in the lab but it would emit 10 times that when on the road. My mission was to create a new system that was real-world, accurate and independent.” Today the firm tests 500 vehicles a year selling its emissions information to subscribers rather than working for the carmakers. Being independent is their whole USP, Molden says. That's how I find myself in a small hangar with metal roof, breeze block walls and a floor that squeaks when I reverse Melvyn into the narrow space where he will be fitted with the PEMS. Watching the setting up of the test demands patience. First Melvyn is emptied of all the detritus that has built up over my two-and-a-half years' ownership. Then the rear seat is lowered and he is loaded with analyser boxes. A weather probe and GPS emanate from his one operable rear window. GPS is needed to track his journey, including climbs and descents, and weather needs to be factored in to any results. Heavy rain is a bigger problem and can stop the test as it can play havoc with the electrics. Two engineers screw pipes into Melvyn's exhaust. They are then connected to two plastic tubes that look a bit like the kind you find on a vacuum cleaner. Most of the exhaust emissions are released into the air but a small proportion will be measured. One pipe goes into the gas analyser, the other into a machine called a CPN that measures particulates. After about two hours, when it's all assembled, the mechanic hooks the pipes up to cylinders of various different gases and monitors the gas flowing through the system on a laptop. It's a control to check everything's working. In the back of the car a loud whirring noise comes from a fan used to cool the analysers, which get hot during the test. How will Melvyn cope? He's been around Europe under a previous owner (a retired Australian gentleman called Melvyn, hence the name). With Beth and me he has picked his way through the Pyrenees and made it to Galicia in north-west Spain. In all, he's clocked up more than 163,000 miles (262,675km). I put the question to Steve Hayton, the project director. A Golf Mk 3 like Melvyn is never going to be super clean but he could be OK, he says. It's all down to how he's been serviced over the years. And then it's time to go. Adam, one of the technicians, drives off in Melvyn, while I follow in a “chase car” driven by Lawrence, another technician. It's a grey day as we set off but Melvyn makes a striking sight. There are silver pipes and black plastic tubes climbing up his rear, some of which feed into a shiny blue box, and his boot - not fully closed - is held together by ties. We arrive at a petrol station, carry out a quick check to make sure everything's working, then the test starts. Nick Molden later tells me that several carmakers have tried to follow their test vehicle to identify the exact route. So I mustn't give too much away. What can be said is that we mix up 20-minute sections - town, country and then motorway - to give an approximation of normal driving. We move through High Wycombe's main roads and back streets, pausing in traffic and waiting for a white van to unload. Soon it becomes leafier, we're passing semi-detached houses with paved drives, acacias and privet hedges. Then we're out of the town and up to 50mph passing wheat fields, woodland and country pubs. Next it's on to the M40 and the Chilterns. We're not far from the opening credits of Vicar of Dibley, Paul the photographer points out. Melvyn is up to 70mph. “That's a diesel,” says Lawrence pointing to a Peugeot van in the slow lane belching black smoke. A petrol engine that's badly tuned produces blue smoke, he says. “But yours looks fine.” We're off the motorway passing sheep, flint houses and village greens in places with names like Piddington. Our speed fluctuates as we round corners and wait behind tractors. It's a far cry from those car advertisements of my youth that measured fuel consumption “at a constant 56mph”. The next day we do it all again with the Skoda Octavia. This time the sun shines, we talk about more than just emissions, and get to know rather a lot about each other's lives. It's the camaraderie of a car journey. At one point the radio bursts unexpectedly into life with Jon Bon Jovi singing “Woah, We're Half-Way There”. It's Peter Kay's Car Share with a PEMS attached. Two-and-a-half hours after the test began, the Skoda arrives back at the hangar. The results won't be ready for a couple of days. So who will they favour - Melvyn or the Skoda? At the time I'm only vaguely aware that they could have ramifications that point far beyond our father-son bet. The moment of truth arrives in the form of an Excel document. Nick Molden is on the phone to talk me through it. “Both cars have stats that are directly comparable with each other and our wider data set,” he begins. “Hopefully it's an interesting result.” “Go on, then,” I think. It’s taken a long time to get this far, and the suspense is killing me. First I must scroll horizontally across a document listing fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions, NOx and carbon monoxide emissions. There are no values for the particulates here - those results have not come back yet, he says. NOx is the big one. And there is a clear winner: the diesel. Although diesels are castigated for being the big offenders as regards NOx, it’s not that simple. In fact Melvyn emits three times more NOx than the Skoda - 0.798 grams per kilometre as opposed to 0.260g/km. The urban/rural/motorway breakdown shows that both cars produce more on the motorway than in the other two settings, which perhaps isn’t surprising as they are going faster and working harder. Nitrogen oxides are at their most dangerous in built-up areas where people breathe them in higher concentrations. Melvyn, a VW Golf GL 1.8, performed a little better in urban driving than he did in the other two parts of the test. But at 0.678g/km his reading is still more than two-and-a-half times worse than the 0.262g/km registered by the Octavia Elegance 1.9. Melvyn's carbon monoxide value is high too. In urban driving it is 3.804g/km - “very poor” by today's standards. But his overall figure of 2.499g/km, taking into account his performance in other parts of the test, means he is still legal. Just. Diesels do not emit much carbon monoxide and the Skoda's urban figure is just 0.014g/km. On fuel economy the Golf posts 34.0 miles per gallon against the Skoda's 50.5mpg. The national average for Euro 6 (post-autumn 2014) petrol cars is 35.6mpg so Melvyn is only a little way behind. For diesel cars it’s 45.0mpg. A side-effect of this is that they produce less CO2, so there was some logic in Gordon Brown’s measures to promote the sale of diesels. I'm relieved to say that neither car is breaking the law. But at the same time, neither would be allowed to be sold new today if these results were obtained in lab conditions. And here it gets interesting. In fact it gets downright controversial. Nick clears his throat. “The average real-world [NOx] emissions from our Euro 6 diesels that we've tested is currently 0.399g/km. The Skoda is about a third less than the current average.” I ask him if I've understood correctly. My dad's 2009 car emits less NOx than most new diesels they've tested in the past three years? Yes, a third less, he says. So how come they are legal if the Skoda would not now pass the legal limit? Here's the tricky bit. The limit on NOx for Euro 6 diesels is 0.08g/km. My dad's Skoda comes in at 0.262g/km. In other words, more than three times today's limit. But it is still better than most modern diesels. Something doesn't add up here. And it's all down to the testing. The new diesels pass the 0.08g/km figure in the lab. Like a child coached to pass an exam they do well in controlled conditions. But out in the real world they struggle. Some of them emit many times the European limit. I dig into theEqua Index, produced by Nick Molden’s company, which gives cars ratings from A to H. Having looked at the data for cars tested in 2016 and 2017, I request the exact NOx figures for some of the more surprising scores. And what comes back is pretty shocking. Here are two examples: ~ The Renault Megane Experience (1461cc) produces 0.991g/km - 12 times the limit (made in 2016, tested in January 2017) ~ The Fiat 500X CityLook Popstar (1598cc) produces 1.153g/km - 14 times the limit (made in 2015, tested in December 2015) But the worst is the Nissan Qashqai, which last month overtook the Ford Fiesta to become the UK's most registered car (counting diesel and petrol models together). The Qashqai N-Connecta DCI CVT (1598cc) produces 1.46g of NOx per kilometre. That is more than 18 times Europe's 0.08g/km limit. It's almost twice Melvyn's score. Five of my dad's Skodas would produce less NOx than this version of the Qashqai. Asked to comment on this poor result, Nissan replied: “Nissan is committed to upholding the law and meeting or exceeding regulations in every market where we operate. All our vehicles sold in Europe meet the Euro 5/6 emission standards.” Renault said all of its vehicles complied with the laws and regulations of the country in which they were sold, adding that it was aware of “significant potential for improvement regarding the release of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in real use conditions”. The company said it had been gradually taking action to reduce the gap between the performance of its vehicles in the lab and on the road, for example by reprogramming their engine injection computer. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said carmakers were investing billions in low-emission technologies to help improve air quality, adding it that it couldn’t comment on “non-official tests”. But how can it be that some new diesels are so dirty? Haven't they improved at all since my dad's car left the factory in 2009? Molden explains that there is a huge range. While most petrol cars leave diesels far behind when it comes to NOx some new diesels are relatively clean and some are very dirty. I look again at the list. It's true the Mercedes C250 AMG Line Premium DAproduces 0.080g/km of NOx in real-world driving, so it complies with the regulations outside the lab as well as inside. A version of the VW Tiguan (the SE-L BiTDI SCR 4MOTION Blue Motion Technology, to give it its full name) even comes in at 0.076g/km, just below the 0.08g/km limit. Both cars produce less than a third of the amount of NOx that my dad's Skoda emits. But they are a rarity. So why are diesels managing to pass strict limits in the lab while producing high levels of emissions on the road? It’s all down to the New European Driving Cycle - the laboratory process in place in Europe since 1997 -  says Anup Bandivadekar, passenger vehicles director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. This puts cars through a test involving steady acceleration, constant speed driving and steady deceleration. It bears no relation to how people actually drive, Bandivadekar says. This narrow focus has made it easy to game the system, he says. Auto makers rather than trying to meet the spirit of the regulations are trying to meet the letter of the law. “There doesn't seem to be enough incentive to do the right thing so companies are doing the bare minimum. That's the crux of this. The technical reasons are multiple.” There is one big disappointment about the Skoda's test results, I discover a couple of days later - it proved impossible to get an accurate measurement of the particulates emitted. Molden is happy to say that Melvyn emitted a negligible quantity of particulates whereas the Skoda emitted more, but due to a technical problem I cannot publish the exact value. So what does the test show? Quite a lot, it seems to me. That a diesel can be better for NOx than an old banger with a petrol engine. That older diesels can beat newer ones. That the European testing regime failed at some point in the last decade. And that the Euro 4, 5, 6, designations are misleading. Belatedly, the authorities have woken up to the problem of misleading lab tests. Last month the European Union began its Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test on all new cars. The SMMT describes the new EU testing regime as the “toughest in the world”. But it is not retrospective, so all the millions of diesels labelled as compliant with the Euro 6 standard on the basis of a flawed lab test are still out there pumping out high levels of NOx. And in Bandivadekar’s view, the RDE test is too lenient. The way it defines “real” driving is still too simplistic, he argues. In addition, until 2019 carmakers will be given leeway of 2.1 times the European limit - diesel cars will be allowed to emit 0.168g/km instead of 0.08g/km. After that they will be given leeway of 1.5 times the limit. This is partly because there is some variability in the results of the PEMS test. The new T Charge arrives next week in London. It will quite rightly penalise my Golf. I'll have to pay £10 to drive into the central London congestion charge zone, in addition to the standard charge. But no-one is stopping me from driving round my built-up area of south-east London. Meanwhile the Skoda, as a Euro 4 car, will not be penalised by the T Charge. But the next big change, the Ultra Low Emission Zone due to come into force in London in 2019, will penalise Euro 4 cars and older. At the same time it will permit the Euro 6 diesels like the Nissan Qashqai N-Connecta DCI CVT to pump out NOx at 18 times the European limit. It all seems very arbitrary. Some cities - Oxford and Paris - have set ambitious targets on banning all combustion engines. Problem sorted? Not according to Prof Frank Kelly, the man whose lecture helped change my dad's mind. Even electric vehicles produce particulates from wear on brake discs and tyres, and by throwing up dust on roads. In any case it seems unlikely that petrol and diesel vehicles will vanish in the next five or 10 years. In which case there's a desperate need to sort the wheat from the chaff, the Tiguans from the Qashqais. In a bid to do this the Mayor of London’s website is now going to publish Emissions Analytics’ Equa Index on its website. When I phone my Dad to discuss the results, he's magnanimous in victory and agrees to accept a half rather than a pint because of the Skoda's higher particulates. He says he is pleasantly surprised by the Skoda's NOx levels. But it's not enough. “I'm going to get rid of it,” he says. It's partly because it's getting old. But he's also done some soul searching. He worries about the particulates and the NOx in the city, so hopes to find a buyer who lives in a rural area. His next car? I wouldn't buy another diesel. I'm wondering about an electric car, but the problem is range. So I'm tempted more by a hybrid.” And what of Melvyn? Eight days after the test I get a call from Beth saying that clouds of steam are billowing from his bonnet and she's been forced to park in a cul-de-sac 10 minutes from home. It turns out to be a broken radiator hose and he's soon back on the road again. But we've made up our mind to have him scrapped. He is 13 times over the NOx limit for a new petrol car after all. It'll be sad to say goodbye. He's only my second ever car. We've been to a lot of places together. He's carried our daughter Hannah in the first six months of her life. But he's dirty and the world will be better off without him. We probably won't replace him - we only bought him to move out of London, and now we're back. It's easy for us to be ethical - Melvyn cost just £950. If you've spent £19,000 on a Nissan Qashqai diesel it'll be rather harder to take a stand to help clean up the air we breathe. Built with Shorthand"
How Angela Merkel quietly achieved power," It was a mild November night.  And in Berlin something unbelievable was happening. Hundreds, and then thousands, of incredulous East Germans surged towards what was once an impassable divide and found they could cross it unchallenged. Later, crowds cheered as young men with pick axes chipped away at the concrete that had separated them from the West for decades. As they sang and lit candles, reporters, stiff in their overcoats, spoke into the cameras. The Iron Curtain had parted. The Berlin Wall was falling. One of the defining moments of the 20th Century was underway. And Angela Merkel went for her weekly sauna. “It was Thursday,” she said many years later, “and Thursday was my sauna day so that’s where I went.” Merkel did eventually venture to the West that night - and back again the following day - but she was in no rush. “I figured if the Wall had opened it was hardly going to close again.” The response was typical of the young quantum chemist. And her approach – unhurried analysis in the face of high drama  – is one with which the whole world has become familiar. Angela Merkel is one of this century’s most enduring and powerful leaders - chancellor of Germany since 2005 and one of the world’s most recognisable figures. Her strength has grown during Europe’s economic crises. And from her role as a conduit between Russia and the West. For many, Merkel represents stability in an unstable and shifting world. Planning the future of a European Union without the UK. Quietly reinforcing new global alliances in the stormy wake of Donald Trump’s chaotic administration. Admirers declare her the last defender of Western democratic values. But while she is revered by many, she has also been reviled and caricatured for her uncompromising stances - on Greek debt, on refugee policy, on the environment. And yet we know very little about her. Even in her own country, she remains an enigmatic figure. The German chancellor is notoriously private. Her family, friends and staff are scrupulously discreet. Her husband, Joachim Sauer, makes few public appearances. The scientist is her second husband, although Merkel kept her first husband’s surname. Merkel with her husband, Joachim Sauer He and her confidantes form a circle around her as impenetrable as the thick forests of the Uckermark region where she grew up, and where she and Sauer still have a weekend retreat. To understand Merkel, her politics, her motivation, it’s important to consider her rather unusual upbringing in what was then communist East Germany. Her childhood home in Templin still stands - huge, serene, pastel-coloured, but overshadowed by the woodland that lies beyond it. To reach it one must drive through a complex of well-kept gardens and small cottages. In the car park, a young man and woman greet visitors with a formal handshake delivered with a wide trusting smile. Merkel's childhood home in Templin They’re residents at the complex – it houses adults with learning disabilities, as it did during the then Angela Kasner’s childhood. Her father, a Lutheran pastor, moved his family here from Hamburg not long after Angela was born. At a time when almost everyone else was migrating west, the Kasner family were heading east. The border had not yet been closed - that would come seven years later - but the regime in the communist German Democratic Republic was oppressive. Those who were considered dissenters had few prospects. No-one’s really sure what motivated Reverend Kasner’s decision to come here but the job seems to have appealed to him and, as a member of the clergy, he would have enjoyed more freedom than most in East Germany. Ulrich Schöneich – who would later become the mayor of Templin – knows the family well. Horst Kasner, he recalls, was a strict man who gathered around him a circle of intellectuals in Templin and ensured his children joined the GDR’s youth organisations, thus securing their future access to university education and employment. It was a decision that would come back to haunt Merkel later - decades on newspapers would print pictures of her as a teenager, dressed in the uniform of the regime’s Free German Youth movement. She has always insisted that her role within the organisation was a relatively passive one. “I can only rely on my memory,"" she said in 2013. “If something turns out to be different, I can live with that."" Schöneich, whose own father would not let him join the youth organisation, says he sees the influence of both parents on Merkel. Her mother was a schoolteacher although she had to give up her job when the family moved to the GDR. She was politically active, chairing the local social democrat party. Merkel is said to remain close to her mother, discussing political problems with her and travelling straight from the recent G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg to attend her birthday tea. “Both are there,” says Schöneich. “Her father was very career-focused and so is she. She acts tactically. Her mother is a very lovely woman who is loved by everyone.” While her political strategy is, he says, like that of a good chess player, Merkel is also a politician of scruples. “Many here expected that, when Angela became chancellor, Templin would blossom. You’re wrong, I told them, she can’t do that. She would be seen as biased.” Merkel was 35 when the Berlin Wall fell. She’d had a university education, married and divorced in her 20s, and reportedly even lived in a squat at one point, but many other freedoms – including the ability to travel the world – had been denied to her generation. Merkel (r) pictured in Poland in 1989 with her husband, and her colleague Malgorzata Jeziorska She often invokes her youth behind the Iron Curtain and speaks passionately on the subject of personal freedom. After Donald Trump’s election, horrified by his plan to build a wall on the Mexican border, Merkel was quick to remind him of his duty to uphold Western values - “democracy, freedom, respect for the rule of law and human dignity” regardless of “ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or political conviction”. The girl from Templin was undoubtedly moulded by her country’s turbulent history. Merkel may not have been among those who, on that November night in 1989, stood next to the Wall and sang as it fell. But in the decades to come it would be her voice - as the leader of a new Germany - which would resonate across the world. The environment minister was having a bad day. A furious crowd had gathered. Shouting and jeering, the protesters waved their banners. There was no way anyone was sending reprocessed nuclear waste to their village. Angela Merkel would struggle to persuade them otherwise. It was 1997 and she’d held the environment portfolio for three years. During that time, Helmut Kohl’s government had sent several transports of reprocessed waste from Germany’s nuclear power plants to be stored in or around the town of Gorleben. The locals were not impressed. Neither was Germany’s environmental lobby.  Some of the protests became violent. Thousands took to the streets. This was a national scandal and it would taint Merkel for years to come. Angela Merkel in 1994 But she’d come a long way since she cast about for a political party to join after the Wall fell. In less than 10 years she’d gone from helping out in the office of the then-Democratic Awakening (which would later evolve into the modern day Christian Democratic Union) to party spokeswoman and was now rising through the ranks of Helmut Kohl’s cabinet under the tutelage of the chancellor himself. He referred to his protégée as his “mädchen”. Heiko Sakurai's cartoon portrays Merkel impersonating the Statue of Liberty, standing on a plinth reading: ""Give me your tired, your poor..."", holding a tablet reading ""We'll manage it"" It was during those first years that Heiko Sakurai, a young political cartoonist, began to draw Angela Merkel. “What I concentrated on were her eyes,” he says. “Half-closed eyes. How she was watching. That was interesting to me. I thought she’s a bit like a sleepy girl, insecure. But that has changed. “I’m still drawing her with half-closed eyes but now I know it’s a sign of rationality. You can’t look into her mind - that’s still my problem. I still don’t know what the woman is thinking.” Angela Merkel: You just let the men do it...Theresa May: ... and then you get their job in the end. It illustrates, in his view, an ability to keep secrets that may have been born out of necessity during her childhood in East Germany. “That’s helped her in her career - to have a close circle of people who don’t talk and can keep secrets.” Merkel’s mentor Helmut Kohl would learn – too late – just how secretive his protégée could be. 1994: Chancellor Helmut Kohl with Merkel As Kohl and many in his party became mired ina funding scandal, Merkel distanced herself from him in a newspaper article. He never forgave what he perceived as an act of betrayal. Years later, his widow reportedly tried to stop Merkel from speaking at his funeral. Merkel and Kohl in 2007: In his later years he was sometimes a critic of her policies Merkel had helped to facilitate the end of Kohl’s chancellorship and had begun to realise her own ambition for the top job. It was worthy of a plot from one of the Wagnerian operas Merkel so enjoys. A political transformation was underway. The mädchen - the little girl - was gone. In her place stood the mächtig - the mighty. But, once her party regained power, it would be some time before Germany’s first female chancellor would gain the poise and self-assurance which characterise her today. Gradually her appearance changed - the hair cut less severe, the suits more streamlined. The woman Germans initially came to call Mutti (mum) exuded, perhaps cultivated, an image as a safe pair of hands. Trustworthy, straightforward, careful. Despite the nickname - which is rarely used these days - Merkel’s gender has rarely been an issue.  She has shattered a glass ceiling but it is rarely reflected in her own political rhetoric. “There is in Germany,” says Wolfgang Bosbach, a long serving CDU MP, “a decades old advertising slogan which everyone knows and it applies to Angela Merkel too - It’s better to stick with what one has. She’ll never stick to an ideology just for the sake of it, which is very un-German.” “People know she doesn’t tend to extremes and she impresses many also with her personal life. I remember how [former French President Francois] Hollande was photographed at night on his scooter going to see his girlfriend. No one can imagine Angela Merkel at night on a moped going to see her lover - and it will never happen.” But there have been moments where Merkel has surprised the country - and the world. As Sakurai puts it: “She’s predictable but she’ll never stick to an ideology just for the sake of it which is very un-German. Germans are known to stick to their traditions and ideologies.” For him, and for many, Merkel has deviated from her usual script twice. Once when she announced the “energiewende” - her decision to end nuclear power in Germany following the crisis at the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011. And, again in 2015, when she opened the country’s doors to hundreds of thousands of people. Both decisions have defined her politically though at a cost to her reputation and popularity. Both decisions were applauded in some quarters but derided in others. Both had long term consequences. Germany’s energy companies have sued the government over the “energiewende” - which means the last of their nuclear power stations will have to close by 2022. There will be compensation and tax refunds for some time to come. The owners of this German nuclear power station are seeking damages following the decision to close it The administrative, social and financial burden of integrating hundreds of thousands of migrants into German society is impossible to quantify. Perhaps those two decisions were all the more striking because Merkel is so carefully controlled – particularly when it comes to her public image. She is very funny – at off-the-record press briefings, she’ll answer questions with a twinkle in her eye, to a room filled with laughter. But it’s rarely seen on camera. According to Wolgang Bosbach, Merkel ""has a very good sense of humour..."" The first time they met, in his constituency, Wolfgang Bosbach asked Merkel if she wanted to go to the local fair. ""...but as soon as the cameras roll, you don’t see it.” “She didn’t want to but then my children who were very small asked, so she couldn’t say no and with one child on her left, one on the right, they went to the fair, went on the carousel and she relaxed and enjoyed herself. “When she relaxes she’s funny, she is witty,” says Bosbach. “Sometimes I feel she’s embarrassed when the public find that out about her. She has a very good sense of humour but, as soon as the cameras roll, you don’t see it.” Bosbach also knows what it’s like to get on the wrong side of the German chancellor, having openly rebelled against her over the Greek debt crisis. “The flaw she has is common in many who reach the very top. I saw it myself in Helmut Kohl. When someone like me has a different opinion and certain questions, be that the Greece crisis or the refugee problem, they question your loyalty. “She finds it hard to accept when someone tells her ‘I have a different opinion but I will go into any battle for you’.” Controversial subjects have come to characterise Merkel’s time in office – but they’ve also sustained it. She is good at crisis management. Her growing strength on the world stage brought Germany itself into a powerful new position. And these dramas drew focus away from those at home who grumble that she’s only ever reactive and rarely risks new policy. An unflattering verb entered the German lexicon in 2015 - “to Merkel”, which denotes indecisiveness. One of Sakurai’s most recent offerings presents Merkel as an amoeba, changing her political shape, swallowing up the ideas first presented by opposition parties. ""The Merkelamoeba has no fixed bodily form. She surrounds her prey, enclosing them in nourishment vacuoles and digests them."" “Her weakness is that I don’t know what her vision is. I don’t know if she has a vision for which way to lead the country. She’s reacting but she’s not acting.” Neverthless, Sakurai says, after 12 years in office, “no-one underestimates her any more”. The little blonde girl proudly lifted a cardboard box full of knitted toys. A tiny figure in the sprawling concourse of Munich railway station, she grinned, blue eyes shining. “They’re for the refugees!” she squealed, unable to contain her excitement. Around her a crowd of curious Germans smiled indulgently. Minutes later, those refugees arrived. Scores of exhausted men, women and children, clutching grimy plastic bags and battered holdalls, trudging along behind a police escort. For a moment the watching crowd was completely silent. Then someone began to applaud. Slowly the faces of the refugees brightened. The crowd, the cheers, the homemade welcome banners were all for them. Angela Merkel had just taken the biggest gamble of her political career. For months, the number of people seeking refuge in Europe from war, persecution and poverty had been steadily rising.  Families clinging desperately to overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean or trudging along the verges of Europe’s motorways. The EU now faced an unprecedented crisis and its leaders couldn’t agree how to deal with it. Merkel had already suspended the Dublin agreement - which requires asylum seekers to stay in their EU country of arrival - for Syrians. But the Hungarian government had had enough. The authorities closed the main railway station in Budapest, refusing to allow asylum seekers to board trains onwards to Western Europe. Perhaps Merkel was moved by the weary migrants chanting “Germany, Germany” outside Keleti station. Or maybe it was the discovery, days earlier, of the decomposing corpses of 71 asylum seekers in the back of a lorry on an Austrian motorway. Police had been called by a road worker who’d spotted liquid seeping from the vehicle, abandoned on the hard shoulder of a motorway. October 2015: Iraqi Kurdish men carry the body of one of 71 asylum seekers suffocated in an Austrian lorry The men, women and children inside had trusted a gang of traffickers to get them to Western Europe. Instead they’d suffocated, packed together, standing room only, in the back of a meat transporter. Merkel hastily agreed a plan with the Austrian government. Within hours, asylum seekers were joyfully boarding trains to Munich. The doors to Germany were open. Afterwards, Merkel would say she’d acted to prevent a humanitarian crisis. But, according to her former environment minister Norbert Röttgen, this was “not so much a moral or ethical question but – and this is typical for her – a decision based on facts. The refugees were there. Germany was able to deal with 10,000 refugees.” Even so, he says, “collectively, Germany underestimated the longer term implications and consequences” of that decision. As Röttgen puts it, “there was euphoria at first”. Towns threw street parties to welcome the new arrivals, warehouses filled up with donated food and clothing, tens of thousands of volunteers staffed reception centres. Germans revelled in their new international reputation. No longer defined by the echoes of World War Two or the caricature of the economic giant bullying the southern Eurozone. Instead, Germany was now the humanitarian face of Europe. “Wir schaffen das!” Merkel proclaimed. We can do it. It was to become her motto, oft repeated over the coming year. But her interior minister was worried, fearing a backlash. Without the goodwill of the volunteers, Thomas de Maiziere believed the country would struggle to cope with the sheer number of people now seeking asylum. Other EU countries were muttering furiously - Germany was encouraging the influx that affected them too. Merkel repeatedly appealed for a quota system to evenly distribute asylum seekers across the EU. She was ignored. As the months went by and towns and cities tried to house and integrate the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals, attacks on refugee accommodation were gleefully seized upon by her critics as evidence that her policy was failing. Merkel’s approval ratings began to fall. As populist movements gained ground across Europe, Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) campaigned hard and began to attract supporters. “Wir schaffen das,” Merkel insisted. But her electorate were increasingly unconvinced. For many, the real turning point came on the very last day of 2015. During New Year’s Eve celebrations in Cologne, hundreds of women were sexually assaulted by groups of men – mostly described as being of North African or Arab origin. It horrified Germany. And, for the first time since the crisis began, Merkel was in real political trouble. Described at the time as a tired and isolated figure, even those loyal to her were in despair. Demonstrators outside Cologne Cathedral protest at violence against women following the sexual assaults on New Year's Eve 2015 The Merkel brand became so tarnished that some within the party began to cast about for alternatives to lead them into the next general election. Their pessimism was vindicated as the party suffered two humiliating regional election defeats - one of them in Merkel’s own home state of Mecklenburg Vorpommen. But, remarkably, she has survived. Gradually her government has tightened the law - making it easier to deport asylum seekers who commit crime, as well as declaring countries like the former Balkan states safe so that their citizens have no right to asylum in Germany. The number of migrants reaching Germany has dwindled.  The deal Merkel brokered between Turkey and the EU helped. Under its terms, migrants arriving in Greece would be sent back to Turkey. For every Syrian sent back, another Syrian in Turkey would be resettled in the EU. For playing its part, Turkey was promised millions of euros and visa free travel for Turkish citizens. But in the end she also got lucky. Countries along the Balkan route slammed their doors shut. Merkel opposed this development but the closure of the Balkan route was a political lifeline. A migrant camp in Lesbos Greece - numbers have dropped since a 2016 EU/Turkey deal “At the last minute it stopped,” says Norbert Röttgen. “The numbers have decreased rapidly and significantly to a manageable level for the last 18 months. It was a critical period, but it turned out to not be a never-ending story.” As Merkel predicted, the migrant crisis has changed Germany. And it’s perhaps too early to judge whether it’s for the better or the worse. Integration will take time. There are success stories - the teams of migrants, exuberant in their cricket whites,  teaching a hitherto unheard of sport to Germans, or the Syrian guides showing visitors around a museum of Middle Eastern antiquity. But there are still migrants living in poverty, housed in school gyms and unable - or unwilling - to access German language classes. And there are unsettling stories too. The young woman volunteer killed by a Nigerian asylum seeker, or the crowd of Germans who clapped and cheered as a building designed to house refugees burned down in front of them. Nevertheless, Merkel has never regretted the decision she made in the late summer of 2015 - although she’s made it clear that the year which followed will never be repeated. If anything, Merkel said, she wished she’d acted sooner when Greece and Italy struggled single-handed to deal with the people arriving on their shores. “It was,” she said in August 2017, “right and it was important for us to take these people in during this extraordinary situation.” These days, her unwavering stance, and her continued insistence that Germany did the right thing, appears to help rather than hinder her popularity. Merkel seems to have got away with it. But perhaps more by luck than judgement. The two giant pandas chewed impassively on their bamboo, apparently oblivious to the global significance of the piece of diplomatic theatre being performed right in front of their new enclosure at Berlin Zoo. Meng Meng and Jiao Qing are on loan from China. Germany is paying $1m a year for the privilege of hosting the bears. Don’t be fooled by their names – which translate as “sweet dream” and “darling” - the animals symbolise strength and unity. Merkel and Xi Jinping open the panda enclosure at Berlin Zoo And the timing of this piece of panda diplomacy couldn’t have been more carefully stage-managed.  Angela Merkel and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping formally opened the enclosure together – just days before they faced Donald Trump across the G20 summit table in Hamburg. The German chancellor had already helped to secure China’s ongoing commitment to the Paris climate accord, after the Trump administration announced it would pull out. In the preceding weeks she’d also taken the rather unusual step of hosting the Indian prime minister and the leaders of the EU member countries for pre-summit talks. After the twin shocks of Brexit and Donald Trump’s election, Merkel has been seeking to create stability and perhaps new partnerships in this new world. It will change her own and her country’s role on the international stage. She warned that Europe could no longer rely on the traditional alliances with Britain and the US. “The times in which we could completely depend on others is, to an extent, over,” she told voters at a rally in Munich. “We Europeans have to take our fate into our own hands.” Speaking in Munich, May 2017: ""We... have to take our fate into our own hands"" Merkel‘s clout on the world stage sprang initially from her own country’s economic weight and subsequent leadership during the Eurozone crisis. Her stance earned her admirers and critics but, as Konstantin von Hammerstein and Rene Pfister wrote in Der Spiegel in December 2012, there was no doubting her power. “All eyes in Europe are directed at Merkel. No other politician on the Continent arouses as many hopes - or as much hatred - as the German chancellor. When she visits Greece, protesters wearing Nazi uniforms march through the streets of Athens, and yet a word from Merkel can also mean saving a euro country from bankruptcy.” A 2012 protest in Athens against EU austerity measures depicts Merkel as Hitler The crisis cemented Merkel’s position as de facto leader of the EU. But two relationships were crucial to a more powerful global position - one to the east and one to the west. The story of one of Merkel’s meetings with Vladimir Putin is well-known and often repeated. During talks, Putin allowed his black Labrador Connieto wander into the roomdespite knowing that the German chancellor had a profound fear of dogs.  The Russian leader later apologised but over the years the story has come to symbolise a fractious relationship. Putin allowed his labrador into the room where he was meeting Merkel, despite her fear of dogs The leaders share a grudging respect for one another. They also share a history. She grew up in East Germany where she learned to speak Russian. He wasa KGB officerstationed in Dresden, in the east, and speaks German. Merkel is credited with brokering regular talks over Russia’s activities in Ukraine, with France the fourth partner in the so-called Normandy format. Critics argue that the terms of theresulting Minsk agreementhave never actually been met. But by intervening to stop the US sending weapons to Ukraine, for example, it has been argued that Merkel has limited some of the bloodshed. The format of the talks also illustrated her perceived status as a link between Russia and the West and, in particular, the US. When Merkel discovered in 2013 thatAmerican spies had listened into her mobile phone, she was furious. “Spying on friends,” she said at the time, “that’s just not on.” But the revelation did little to sour her relationship with then-President Barack Obama and the two leaders fostered a warm, trusting and mutually beneficial relationship, speaking frequently over the phone. Barack Obama with Merkel in Berlin, May 2017 She supported and advised the president who, at the time, had little real domestic power. And President Obama, who enjoys rock star status in Germany, and is as popular among many Germans as his successor is reviled, reciprocated. In April 2016, well before Donald Trump’s election, a survey for die Zeit newspaper found that nearly two-thirds of Germans (62%) regretted the fact that Obama couldn’t serve another term. In May 2017, 70,000 people cheered and chanted his name as Obama stood in front of the Brandenburg gate and told the crowd: “We can’t hide behind a wall.” His friendship with Merkel, and his public support for her refugee policy, has done much to soothe her voters. The two leaders were unable to push through the doomed US/European trade deal TTIP but they did build a transatlantic alliance which bound Europe and America together. It’s a partnership unlikely to be replicated with the new administration. Merkel initially decided the way to Donald Trump’s heart was via trade,visiting the USwith the chief executives of Siemens and BMW. Merkel and Trump at the G20 meeting in Hamburg, July 2017 Then she tried the family route, appearing on stage alongside his daughter Ivanka at a women’s business event in Berlin. Behind the scenes, advisers spoke – without much conviction - of a new style of transatlantic diplomacy. But, one confided, it was like dealing with a five-year-old. With Ivanka Trump at a women's business event in Berlin Merkel’s strength now may depend on her opposition to Trump’s rhetoric. “She relies on her immense reputation as one of the world’s longest serving leaders,” says Wolfgang Bosbach. “Others have come and gone but Angela Merkel stays and she also relies on her strong nerves, her poker face. You can’t really tell from her expression which way she’s going to decide, she’s not extrovert, she’s not a big tweeter like Donald Trump but that doesn’t mean that she isn’t completely focused on her political goal.” That poker face slips occasionally, particularly when it comes to the UK, where Merkel - and most Germans - have a profound fondness. On 24 June 2015 Merkel’s spokesman tweeted footage of the world’s most powerful woman showing one of its most famous women around her office. Merkel gives the Queen a tour of her offices, 2015 Merkel, speaking in English, which she rarely does in public, points out the former course of the Berlin Wall and her former home in the old East to the Queen. Viewed now, the footage has a certain poignancy. A year later to the day a visibly shocked Merkel would speak – this time in German – of her great sorrow at Britain’s decision to leave the EU. She, like many Germans, was completely flummoxed by the result of the 2016 referendum. 24 June 2016: Merkel arrives at a press conference to give her reaction to the UK referendum In a country where people identify themselves as European first and German second, the EU represents an ideal of post-war unity. While not without imperfections and challenges, the institution isviewed as broadly beneficial politically and economically. Aware of the situation in the UK before the vote, Merkel showed willing, suggesting that she wouldn’t rule out treaty changes in the future, saying “where there’s a will there’s a way”, but in reality her position has never changed. With former British Prime Minister David Cameron - the two reportedly had a warm personal relationship There would be, she emphasised time and again, no access to the single market without the free movement of people. Confronted by Britain’s decision to leave the EU, Merkel’s initial reaction was to present a united front. Within days of the Brexit vote EU foreign ministers, and then the leaders of France and Italy, held meetings in Berlin. By 2017, when Brexit negotiations began, that united front was still in evidence. Germany under Merkel won’t break away from the official EU position. And she’s the one setting the tone. She never wanted to go down in the history books as the German chancellor under whom Britain left the EU It’s based on the desire to satisfy two principles. To keep Brexit as clean as possible - Britain is an important partner and a break which damages its economy will adversely affect Germany too. But the terms of the British departure cannot be so generous that they risk encouraging other countries to leave too. If anything, Brexit – or at least dealing with the fallout - has strengthened Angela Merkel domestically. But, as one commentator noted, she never wanted to go down in the history books as the German chancellor under whom Britain left the European Union. Koblenz is a city where two great European rivers meet. The very name of this ancient settlement originates from the confluence of the French Moselle and the German Rhine. And it was here, in January 2017, that hopes of a very different union briefly flared. To flashing lights and loud music, flanked by their country’s flags, the giants of Europe’s right-wing, Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders, marched through a crowd of cheering supporters and on to a stage where they were joined by Frauke Petry, then leader of Germany’s own populist movement, Alternative für Deutschland. (l-r) Geert Wilders, Frauke Petry and Marine Le Pen meet in Koblenz, January 2017 What began life as an anti-euro party on Germany’s political fringe, then evolved into a right-wing movement which gathered pace and support during the migrant crisis. Its xenophobic rhetoric and nationalist fervour repulsed many Germans. Nevertheless its anti-migrant and anti-Islam stance appealed to those perturbed by Angela Merkel’s refugee policy. There was a broader appeal too. AfD began to attract voters who felt forgotten, even ignored by Germany’s centrist politics and mainstream parties. Donald Trump had just been elected when the Koblenz meeting took place. The EU was still digesting the shock of Britain’s decision to leave. Le Pen and Wilders sensed triumph. A patriotic spring was underway, they declared. This unstoppable force would revolutionise Europe. Beyond the police cordon, protesters demonstrated against this so-called summit of the right (from which the mainstream German press had been banned). Protesters demonstrate outside the Koblenz event But away from the conference hall, the Moselle continued its quiet and endless flow into the Rhine. There is little appetite for revolution here. Post-war Germany is, by and large, a philosophical nation, which tends towards compromise and distrusts impetuous decision making. No wonder perhaps that its leader, who embodies those qualities, has lasted for so long. Merkel has been in the job for 12 years. Her political fortunes have risen, fallen and risen again. But her personal popularity rating - measured monthly for broadcaster ARD - has never dropped below 46%. That’s part skill and part fortune. Ever since the Brexit referendum and Trump’s election, Merkel, to many German voters, is a stable figure in an unstable world. She took her time deciding whether to stand for a fourth term, admitting that she was torn. Exhausted by the migrant crisis, unsure of the electorate’s support, she also, Ulrich Schöneich says, wanted to spend more time with her elderly mother. At the time, some suspected her of deliberate prevarication - and it wasn’t long before her party, and the country, started to feel mildly panicked. There is no obvious successor to Merkel. To coin the phrase often employed by Merkel herself to defend her nuclear and economic policies, Germany found itself “alternativlos” (without alternative). This may not be entirely accidental. As Schöneich notes: “She learned her lesson from Kohl who would not tolerate anyone being at his level. She managed to get rid of all the men with ambitions to her job.” At the age of 63, Merkel is unrivalled and at the height of her political confidence. She has always made an awkward hand gesture – thumb and fingertips pressing together to create a diamond shape. It has often been ridiculed but is now being perceived differently. Andreas Kluth, editor-in-chief of Handelsblatt, wrote recently that the chancellor’s body language, undramatic as it is, subtly exudes power and control. But Merkel’s future political path will not be easy and it’s perhaps no accident that she so often appeals publicly for international or European solidarity and co-operation. The global challenges make for a daunting agenda - an erratic US administration, migration and trafficking, Syria, Ukraine. And then there’s the fractious relationship with an increasingly belligerent Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Germany is home to around three million people of Turkish descent. Erdogan was furious after several of his ministers were prevented from campaigning on German soil ahead of Turkey’s constitutional referendum in 2017. Diplomatic relations – never easy – reached a new low when a number of German nationals, including several journalists, were detained in Turkey. Merkel has never supported Turkish accession to the EU. Nevertheless she has, thus far, refused calls from some political quarters to call off accession negotiations. Her argument is that the talks are barely happening as it is and that there is no consensus within the EU on the issue. She may also be thinking of that migrant deal. It’s a delicate balance. Wolfgang Bosbach, German politician Merkel is also preoccupied by, and expected by many to shape, the future of a post-Brexit EU. She has indicated support for French President Emmanuel Macron’s ambition for deeper integration within the Eurozone, although hopes for a renewed Franco-German axis at the heart of Europe are fading somewhat as Macron’s domestic popularity leaches away. Merkel has indicated support for her new French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron But the international stateswoman must please her home crowd too. She knows she barely survived the migrant crisis - voters want a clear integration and asylum policy. The scandal over bypassing tests on diesel cars casts a shadow still. Air pollution regularly exceeds legal levels in many German cities and at least one, Stuttgart, may impose a ban on all diesel vehicles. Merkel must protect the health of her citizens but she must also safeguard Germany’s automobile industry. And, as Wolfgang Bosbach puts it, Merkel has a tough challenge ahead - “future-proofing” the economy in a globalised marketplace. Many wonder how much longer she will continue. Will she see out a fourth term? Bosbach believes so. After all, he says, the chancellor is motivated solely by a sense of duty. “She understands her role as being a servant of the state. She grew up in East Germany, far removed from democracy, which is why she perceives her life in reunited Germany as a gift and she wants to show gratitude to this country and give back in return for the freedom and rights she received after the Wall came down.” It’s not clear whether the far-right leaders who gathered in Koblenz at the beginning of 2017 realised that they were meeting not far from the city’s most famous landmark. A huge statue of Kaiser Wilhelm I on his horse was built there in the 19th Century to commemorate the celebrated emperor who unified Germany. Those who promised a patriotic spring here never fully realised their ambitions. Marine le Pen and Geert Wilders were defeated at the ballot box, although the AfD has gained a significant number of seats in the federal German parliament. Kaiser Wilhelm still stands, implacable. Beneath him the rivers flow, slow and constant. And, quietly, in her office in Berlin, Angela Merkel gets on with her job. Built with Shorthand"
"Real wages 'will be flat in 2018'Britain's pay squeeze will end, but a meaningful pay rise remains out of sight, says research group.24m25 minutes agoBusiness","The UK's pay squeeze will end next year, but a meaningful rise in wages remains out of sight, an influential research group has warned. The Resolution Foundation, which campaigns for fair pay, predicted inflation would no longer outpace wage growth by the end of 2018. But it said real wage growth would still be flat and that many households were pessimistic about their finances. The Treasury said it was ""helping families to earn more"". The Office of Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's economic watchdog, projects that when the full figures for 2017 are confirmed they will show that wages have fallen by 0.4% in real terms asinflation has soared to more than 3%. The squeeze, caused by the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, has contributed to weaker consumer spending and a slowdown in the housing market. The Resolution Foundation, which based its outlook on OBR data, said the trend would worsen in the first few months of next year before levelling out. This would result in ""zero real wage growth"" in 2018 - an improvement on 2017, but worse than any year in the three decades leading up to the financial crisis. Torsten Bell, director of the research group, said 2017 had been ""a tough year for living standards"". ""The good news is that things will get better next year. The bad news is we may only go from backwards to standing still, with prospects for a meaningful pay recovery still out of sight."" Referencing Bank of England data, the research group added that 27% of working age households thought their financial positions would worsen in the coming 12 months - roughly the same as those who think it will get better. However, it noted the lowest paid workers were set for a pay rise of 4.3% in April as the National Living Wage reached Â£7.83. Overall, it said UK workers would not see a ""noticeable"" pay rise until December 2018. A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We are helping families to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Our National Living Wage is delivering the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years and we are cutting taxes for millions of people.""

"Shoppers stay home for Boxing Day salesFewer people went bargain hunting, following Black Friday discounts and smarter online shopping.11h11 hours agoBusiness","Fewer people have hit the UK's Boxing Day sales this year as Black Friday discounts and savvy online shoppers lowered turnout. Shop visits dropped by 4.5% up to 5pm compared with last year, according to research group Springboard. Shopping centres and High Streets recorded the biggest declines. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said that although it had expected a downturn, ""the scale of the drop is greater than expected."" She said: ""What we have seen in the last couple of years is a structural shift in the Christmas trading period."" While Black Friday sales have changed the way people shop in the UK, Ms Wehrle said the impact was particularly felt this year, as retailers began discounting a week before 24 November and carried on right up until Christmas. ""The hotspots for Christmas trading around Boxing Day and New Year's Day are dissipating,"" she said. On the upside, Springboard said early indicators pointed to a strong rise in online shopping for the full 24-hour Boxing Day period. It expects internet transactions to surpass last year, when they rose by 6.2%. But Ms Wehrle said that people were increasingly looking online for bargains before they visited a store or deciding to ""click and collect"". As a result of this targeted shopping, there is less window-shopping and fewer spur-of-the-moment purchases. Footfall on UK High Streets fell by 5.8%, while in shopping centres, it tumbled by 4% in the first 17 hours of Boxing Day. Chris Daly, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, said: ""Gone are the days of setting the alarm at 06:00 to be first in line for the Boxing Day sales, something borne out by the footage of quiet shopping centres up and down the country."" However, Hammerson, the property group that owns a number of Britain's largest shopping centres, said that about 600 people were lining up to grab bargains at the retailer Next's store in Birmingham's Bullring. Queues began forming there at half past midnight. Over the long term, Ms Wehrle believes that shopping habits in the UK have changed for good, with people looking for more of a ""leisure experience"" when they hit the stores. ""If people go out to eat, they don't have money to spend in the shops,"" she said.

ITV's highest rated programme was Coronation Street with 4.8 million viewers, making it number seven on the ratings list. The Great British Bake Off on Channel Four was watched by around 2.8 million people. By Lizo Mzimba, entertainment correspondent Coming together to sit and watch the Queen's broadcast is still a traditional part of Christmas for many families, and it is one of the main reasons that year after year the programme (broadcast on multiple channels) comes top of the overnight ratings. Once Christmas catch-up viewing is taken into consideration, it is likely the Queen will be overtaken at the top by another programme. Because with so much choice on 25 December, viewers will often opt to watch some shows live, while saving others to watch later. For example, this year there was a significant overlap between three of TV's most popular programmes - Call the Midwife on BBC One, Coronation Street on ITV and the Great British Bake Off on Channel Four. Overall, figures for some individual shows do seem to be dropping slightly year on year, but that is probably inevitable with the increasing amount of choice available on traditional channels and from on-demand services like Netflix and Amazon.
