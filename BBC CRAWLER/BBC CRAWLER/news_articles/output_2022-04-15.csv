Twitter board takes action to fight Musk bid,"Twitter's board has armed itself against a possible hostile takeover - a day after billionaire Elon Musk made a $43bn (Â£33bn) offer to buy the platform. It has adopted what is known as a ""limited-duration shareholder rights plan"", also known as a ""poison pill"". The move will prevent anyone from having more than a 15% stake in the company. It does this by allowing others to buy additional shares at a discount. The Twitter board detailed its defence plan to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and put out a statement saying it was needed because of Mr Musk's ""unsolicited, non-binding proposal to acquire Twitter"". A takeover bid is considered hostile when one company tries to acquire another against the wishes of that company's management - in Twitter's case, its executive board. Josh White, former financial economist for the Securities and Exchange Commission, told the BBC that a poison pill is ""one of those last lines of defence against a hostile bid takeover"". ""We call it the nuclear option,"" he said. Mr White says the board has made it clear ""that they don't feel like it's a high enough value for the company"". Elon Musk makes offer to buy Twitter Former Twitter exec questions seriousness of Musk offer Because Mr Musk had signalled that he was not willing to negotiate a higher price, the Twitter board went ahead with the poison pill. Mr White says he was surprised by Mr Musk's negotiation tactic because if the end game is to acquire the company it might not be the ""right approach"". ""I actually think if he was truly serious about the takeover attempt, he would have started at a price and left the window open for negotiation,"" he said. The plan will expire on 14 April next year. Chief Executive Parag Agrawal previously said the company was not being ""held hostage"" by the offer. Meanwhile,Mr Musk said at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver: ""I am not sure that I will actually be able to acquire it."" He added that he does have a ""plan B"", though he did not divulge it. Mr Musk announced a 9.2% stake in the company earlier this month, but he is not the largest shareholder anymore. Asset management firm Vanguard Group disclosed that its funds now own a 10.3% stake. Mr Musk has said he believes Twitter is limiting freedom of speech on the platform and he reiterated this at the Vancouver event. He has said his primary motivation would be to expand free speech - a US Constitutional right - on Twitter. Mr Musk is being advised by the US investment bank Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, Twitter is being helped by two banks, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, according to Bloomberg. Twitter is trying to make itself inedible to a predator. Its wrapping itself with spikes and covering itself with poison. The poison pill strategy has been around for decades - and it works. Twitter will flood the market with new shares if Elon Musk buys more than 15% of the company. That would then dilute his share of the company. Clever. It strongly suggests that Twitter's board will fight Mr Musk's bid to take control of the company. This doesn't necessarily mean Twitter is saying it doesn't want to be bought. The mechanism simply gives the board more power to prevent a hostile takeover. Elon Musk is likely now to appeal to shareholders. He's already said it would be ""indefensible"" if Twitter's board didn't put the offer to a shareholder vote.

Independent artists score chart hat-trick,"Wet Leg is the brainchild of Rhian Teasdale (left) and Hester Chambers Three independent artists - Wet Leg, Father John Misty and Jack White - have taken the top positions in the UK albums chart for the first time in more than 11 years. Wet Leg, the much-hyped Isle of Wight indie duo, went in at number one on Friday with their eponymous debut. They managed to outsell the rest of the top five combined in the process. Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers' guitar band are the fourth non-major label act to top the chart this year. ""We just want to say thanks to all of our fans that have bought the record, and that means we can be number one,"" the band said in a statement to the Official Charts Company on Friday. Father John Misty's album, Chloe and the Next 21st Century - released by Bella Union - went in at number two this week, while Jack White's Fear Of The Dawn, put out on his own Third Man imprint, entered at number three.

Official Charts Company boss Martin Talbot said the ""indie treble"" underlined ""the independent sector's power in uncovering and developing talent"". Music Week's chart analyst Alan Jones noted it was only the third time this century that indie records - albums by non major-labels or their subsidiaries - had occupied all of the top three places in the chart. ""The first time, in 2011, saw two albums from Adele (21 and 19) and one from The Strokes (Angles) shutting out the majors, and the second instance happened just six weeks later,"" he told the charts company. Wet Leg's album, released on Domino Records, continues a fine run of form for the smaller labels of late. Central Cee's best-selling LP 23, Stereophonics' Oochya! and Don Broco's Amazing Things have previously reached the summit. Earlier this week, the BPI - the recorded music trade body -announced a fourth consecutive year of growth,externalfor indie label market share. Frontwoman Teasdale has said she started the band as a joke Along with the likes of PinkPantheress and Mimi Webb, Wet leg have been one of the most talked-about acts of the year, impressing judges on the BBC Sound of 2022 panel. ""We just started it as a joke,"" Teasdale told the BBC's Ian Youngs in January. ""And it's doing really well, and there's all this buzz and hype, which feels a bit strange."" 'We started a band for fun, now it's doing really well' Why more and more musicians are going independent 'The rug can be pulled any time,' say indie stars Their first single, Chaise Longue, hit the sweet spot between being deeply cool and satisfyingly silly. Inspired by Chambers' grandfather's furniture, it features a string of innuendos including a classic quote from 2004 film Mean Girls (""Is your muffin buttered? Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?""). That was followed up by Wet Dream, an equally enjoyable message to an ex-boyfriend, and their ear-wormy recent single, Angelica.

Burnley sack manager Dyche with eight games leftBurnley sack manager Sean Dyche with eight games left of their season in the Premier League.BBC SportComments,"Sean Dyche managed just four league wins with Burnley this season Burnley have sacked manager Sean Dyche with eight games left of their season in the Premier League. The Clarets, who have lost five of their last six top-flight games, are 18th and four points from safety. Dyche was the Premier League's longest serving manager, having taken over at Turf Moor in October 2012. Burnley chairman Alan Pace said it was ""an incredibly difficult decision"" to part company with the 50-year-old, but ""we feel a change is needed"". 'A huge gamble that smacks of blind panic' Dyche's last game in charge of Burnley saw them lose 2-0 to Norwich City, who are bottom of the Premier League. Assistant manager Ian Woan, first-team coach Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Billy Mercer have also left the club. ""Firstly, we would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sean and his staff for their achievements at the club over the last decade,"" said Pace. ""During his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community. ""However, results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status. ""Under-23s coach Mike Jackson, assisted by academy director Paul Jenkins, Under-23s goalkeeping coach Connor King and club captain Ben Mee have been asked to take charge of the team for Sunday's game with West Ham United. ""The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dyche had signeda new four-year contract until 2025 with Burnley in September last year. During his spell at the club he guided them to two promotions from the Championship and two top-half Premier League finishes. He also helped Burnley achieve their first European qualification in 51 years courtesy of leading them to a commendable seventh place in the Premier League in 2017-18. However, the Clarets have won just four Premier League games this season, the worst win record in the league. ""It's massive news, no one really expected it,"" reacted former Burnley midfielder Paul Weller. ""He has been backed by the board for so long, so to do it so late in the season is a really big surprise. ""To do it so late in the week is leaving it really tight because there's a massive game coming up against West Ham on Sunday. There's a big eight games left and we need somebody in there quick."" Weller added: ""Sean has had to take the ultimate punishment. ""What he has done at Burnley is unbelievable, he has done it on a shoestring [budget]. He's not been supported by any of the chairmen financially like other Premier League managers have been. ""It's been a really difficult season and I think that's why everybody is so surprised because the fans love him. ""Even though we are struggling, we are down at the bottom and it's looking like relegation, Burnley fans were still loyal to him.""

BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone Burnley are in their sixth successive season in the Premier League, which is their longest run in the top flight since their heydays in the 1960s. It is a brave owner of any football club who just accepts relegation without doing something to stop it. Alan Pace, the owner and chairman of Burnley, is a relatively new owner and he has decided to act. The impact has to be absolutely immediate and I guess that means Burnley picking up points immediately. They start against West Ham on Sunday, then Southampton and Wolves. Sean Dyche is highly employable. Any like-minded club such as Burnley, Dyche will be top of the people who will be to be favourites to take over that job. He has been linked with many Premier League jobs over the years. He has always responded to those rumours by saying he was at Burnley - now he is not. I don't think it will be long until he gets another job. Clearly the problem for Burnley is getting another manager for themselves. Allow Twitter content?

"Easter travellers face traffic jams and disruptionMillions of drivers are heading on trips across the UK, while several major train routes are closed.Business","There were queues on the A303 past Stonehenge in Wiltshire on Friday morning Travellers are facing traffic jams on some roads and disruption to trains as the Easter weekend gets under way. There was heavy congestion on motorways near London and Kent on Friday, while holiday traffic to south west England led to jams near Bristol, the AA said. But despite some hotspots, the RAC said vehicles on many of the country's major roads appeared to be running reasonably freely. It comes as several major train routes are closed for engineering works. The AA said there was a build up of traffic on the M25 as well as the M20 in Kent. There have also been jams on the M4 and M5 near Bristol. The AA dealt with 6,000 breakdowns by 15:00 BST on Friday. Hot weather led to more vehicles overheating when stuck in traffic jams, it said. Meanwhile, there have been long queues at the Port of Dover, where P&O Ferries' services are still not running. Rail delays and cancellations for Easter travellers Air travel industry warned over Easter disruption Edmund King, the AA's president, said traffic was likely to remain busier than usual and would start picking up on Saturday morning with football traffic flooding from Liverpool and Manchester to Wembley as there are no direct trains. ""It would have saved a lot of congestion and CO2 if the FA Cup semi-final was held in the north rather than having both sets of fans driving hundreds of miles south and back. It looks like Saturday will be another busy day on the roads so drivers should be prepared,"" he continued. He said there were traffic jams on the M20, while the M25 also suffered heavy congestion on the west side around Heathrow and the east near Dartford earlier. He advised travellers to ""give yourselves extra time for the journey and build regular stops at least every two hours or so into your trip"". The AA said traffic had eased during the afternoon, although hotspots remained on the south and south west coast. Rod Dennis, from the RAC, said: ""While much of the country's major roads appear to be running reasonably freely at the moment, Easter getaway traffic is starting to build in certain spots and that is likely to continue through the day."" The RAC predicted Good Friday would be the busiest day of the bank holiday weekend, with an estimated 4.62 million journeys by car likely across the UK. After two years of relatively quiet Easter bank holidays on the roads because of Covid restrictions, it said drivers were planning about 21.5 million trips over the bank holiday - the highest figure since it started its driver surveys in 2014. Meanwhile, rail passengers are facing delays and cancellations, with Network Rail carrying out 530 engineering projects across the bank holiday weekend, costing a total of Â£83m. No trains will run in or out of Euston station in London until the end of Monday on the West Coast main line, which is likely to disrupt football fans going to the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley. Trains to the West Midlands, north west England and parts of Scotland will instead start from Milton Keynes Central. There will be also be no Southern services to and from London Victoria all weekend, nor any direct trains from London to Stansted Airport. Alternative services are expected to be busy and Network Rail has advised people to travel either side of the bank holiday. Travellers heading across the Channel faced long queues at Dover There were long queues at the Port of Dover on Friday, with some travellers complaining they missed their ferries after waiting for hours. Ferry company DFDS urged customers to allow three hours to complete border checks. It said customers delayed by traffic at border control would be transferred to the first available departure. The Port of Dover also advised customers to allow extra time for their journey, saying there were delays at French border controls prior to check-in. Some lorries were being forced to queue on the A20 outside Dover, as part of the Traffic Access Protocol (TAP) scheme, which is designed to limit congestion in the town. Allow Twitter content?

P&O Ferries' Dover-Calais services remain suspended, nearly a month after the company sacked about 800 workers without notice. Two of the company's ferries which normally serve the route are still detainedafter they failed safety inspections. Bad weather, the Easter holidays and problems with an IT system for customs checks following Brexit have also contributed to congestion around Dover in recent days. This has led to long queues for lorries crossing the Channel. Operation Brock, which sees lorries heading to Dover queue on one side of the M20, was put in place last week to help manage the traffic. However, National Highwayssaid it had now been scaled backas the threat of disruption had reduced. Has there been any disruption to your travel plans?

Independent artists score chart hat-trickThree non-major label acts dominate the album chart's top spots for the first time in over a decade.,"Wet Leg is the brainchild of Rhian Teasdale (left) and Hester Chambers Three independent artists - Wet Leg, Father John Misty and Jack White - have taken the top positions in the UK albums chart for the first time in more than 11 years. Wet Leg, the much-hyped Isle of Wight indie duo, went in at number one on Friday with their eponymous debut. They managed to outsell the rest of the top five combined in the process. Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers' guitar band are the fourth non-major label act to top the chart this year. ""We just want to say thanks to all of our fans that have bought the record, and that means we can be number one,"" the band said in a statement to the Official Charts Company on Friday. Father John Misty's album, Chloe and the Next 21st Century - released by Bella Union - went in at number two this week, while Jack White's Fear Of The Dawn, put out on his own Third Man imprint, entered at number three.

Official Charts Company boss Martin Talbot said the ""indie treble"" underlined ""the independent sector's power in uncovering and developing talent"". Music Week's chart analyst Alan Jones noted it was only the third time this century that indie records - albums by non major-labels or their subsidiaries - had occupied all of the top three places in the chart. ""The first time, in 2011, saw two albums from Adele (21 and 19) and one from The Strokes (Angles) shutting out the majors, and the second instance happened just six weeks later,"" he told the charts company. Wet Leg's album, released on Domino Records, continues a fine run of form for the smaller labels of late. Central Cee's best-selling LP 23, Stereophonics' Oochya! and Don Broco's Amazing Things have previously reached the summit. Earlier this week, the BPI - the recorded music trade body -announced a fourth consecutive year of growth,externalfor indie label market share. Frontwoman Teasdale has said she started the band as a joke Along with the likes of PinkPantheress and Mimi Webb, Wet leg have been one of the most talked-about acts of the year, impressing judges on the BBC Sound of 2022 panel. ""We just started it as a joke,"" Teasdale told the BBC's Ian Youngs in January. ""And it's doing really well, and there's all this buzz and hype, which feels a bit strange."" 'We started a band for fun, now it's doing really well' Why more and more musicians are going independent 'The rug can be pulled any time,' say indie stars Their first single, Chaise Longue, hit the sweet spot between being deeply cool and satisfyingly silly. Inspired by Chambers' grandfather's furniture, it features a string of innuendos including a classic quote from 2004 film Mean Girls (""Is your muffin buttered? Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?""). That was followed up by Wet Dream, an equally enjoyable message to an ex-boyfriend, and their ear-wormy recent single, Angelica.

Easter travellers face traffic jams and disruption,"There were queues on the A303 past Stonehenge in Wiltshire on Friday morning Travellers are facing traffic jams on some roads and disruption to trains as the Easter weekend gets under way. There was heavy congestion on motorways near London and Kent on Friday, while holiday traffic to south west England led to jams near Bristol, the AA said. But despite some hotspots, the RAC said vehicles on many of the country's major roads appeared to be running reasonably freely. It comes as several major train routes are closed for engineering works. The AA said there was a build up of traffic on the M25 as well as the M20 in Kent. There have also been jams on the M4 and M5 near Bristol. The AA dealt with 6,000 breakdowns by 15:00 BST on Friday. Hot weather led to more vehicles overheating when stuck in traffic jams, it said. Meanwhile, there have been long queues at the Port of Dover, where P&O Ferries' services are still not running. Rail delays and cancellations for Easter travellers Air travel industry warned over Easter disruption Edmund King, the AA's president, said traffic was likely to remain busier than usual and would start picking up on Saturday morning with football traffic flooding from Liverpool and Manchester to Wembley as there are no direct trains. ""It would have saved a lot of congestion and CO2 if the FA Cup semi-final was held in the north rather than having both sets of fans driving hundreds of miles south and back. It looks like Saturday will be another busy day on the roads so drivers should be prepared,"" he continued. He said there were traffic jams on the M20, while the M25 also suffered heavy congestion on the west side around Heathrow and the east near Dartford earlier. He advised travellers to ""give yourselves extra time for the journey and build regular stops at least every two hours or so into your trip"". The AA said traffic had eased during the afternoon, although hotspots remained on the south and south west coast. Rod Dennis, from the RAC, said: ""While much of the country's major roads appear to be running reasonably freely at the moment, Easter getaway traffic is starting to build in certain spots and that is likely to continue through the day."" The RAC predicted Good Friday would be the busiest day of the bank holiday weekend, with an estimated 4.62 million journeys by car likely across the UK. After two years of relatively quiet Easter bank holidays on the roads because of Covid restrictions, it said drivers were planning about 21.5 million trips over the bank holiday - the highest figure since it started its driver surveys in 2014. Meanwhile, rail passengers are facing delays and cancellations, with Network Rail carrying out 530 engineering projects across the bank holiday weekend, costing a total of Â£83m. No trains will run in or out of Euston station in London until the end of Monday on the West Coast main line, which is likely to disrupt football fans going to the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley. Trains to the West Midlands, north west England and parts of Scotland will instead start from Milton Keynes Central. There will be also be no Southern services to and from London Victoria all weekend, nor any direct trains from London to Stansted Airport. Alternative services are expected to be busy and Network Rail has advised people to travel either side of the bank holiday. Travellers heading across the Channel faced long queues at Dover There were long queues at the Port of Dover on Friday, with some travellers complaining they missed their ferries after waiting for hours. Ferry company DFDS urged customers to allow three hours to complete border checks. It said customers delayed by traffic at border control would be transferred to the first available departure. The Port of Dover also advised customers to allow extra time for their journey, saying there were delays at French border controls prior to check-in. Some lorries were being forced to queue on the A20 outside Dover, as part of the Traffic Access Protocol (TAP) scheme, which is designed to limit congestion in the town. Allow Twitter content?

P&O Ferries' Dover-Calais services remain suspended, nearly a month after the company sacked about 800 workers without notice. Two of the company's ferries which normally serve the route are still detainedafter they failed safety inspections. Bad weather, the Easter holidays and problems with an IT system for customs checks following Brexit have also contributed to congestion around Dover in recent days. This has led to long queues for lorries crossing the Channel. Operation Brock, which sees lorries heading to Dover queue on one side of the M20, was put in place last week to help manage the traffic. However, National Highwayssaid it had now been scaled backas the threat of disruption had reduced. Has there been any disruption to your travel plans?

Burnley sack manager Dyche with eight games left,"Sean Dyche managed just four league wins with Burnley this season Burnley have sacked manager Sean Dyche with eight games left of their season in the Premier League. The Clarets, who have lost five of their last six top-flight games, are 18th and four points from safety. Dyche was the Premier League's longest serving manager, having taken over at Turf Moor in October 2012. Burnley chairman Alan Pace said it was ""an incredibly difficult decision"" to part company with the 50-year-old, but ""we feel a change is needed"". 'A huge gamble that smacks of blind panic' Dyche's last game in charge of Burnley saw them lose 2-0 to Norwich City, who are bottom of the Premier League. Assistant manager Ian Woan, first-team coach Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Billy Mercer have also left the club. ""Firstly, we would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sean and his staff for their achievements at the club over the last decade,"" said Pace. ""During his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community. ""However, results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status. ""Under-23s coach Mike Jackson, assisted by academy director Paul Jenkins, Under-23s goalkeeping coach Connor King and club captain Ben Mee have been asked to take charge of the team for Sunday's game with West Ham United. ""The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dyche had signeda new four-year contract until 2025 with Burnley in September last year. During his spell at the club he guided them to two promotions from the Championship and two top-half Premier League finishes. He also helped Burnley achieve their first European qualification in 51 years courtesy of leading them to a commendable seventh place in the Premier League in 2017-18. However, the Clarets have won just four Premier League games this season, the worst win record in the league. ""It's massive news, no one really expected it,"" reacted former Burnley midfielder Paul Weller. ""He has been backed by the board for so long, so to do it so late in the season is a really big surprise. ""To do it so late in the week is leaving it really tight because there's a massive game coming up against West Ham on Sunday. There's a big eight games left and we need somebody in there quick."" Weller added: ""Sean has had to take the ultimate punishment. ""What he has done at Burnley is unbelievable, he has done it on a shoestring [budget]. He's not been supported by any of the chairmen financially like other Premier League managers have been. ""It's been a really difficult season and I think that's why everybody is so surprised because the fans love him. ""Even though we are struggling, we are down at the bottom and it's looking like relegation, Burnley fans were still loyal to him.""

BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone Burnley are in their sixth successive season in the Premier League, which is their longest run in the top flight since their heydays in the 1960s. It is a brave owner of any football club who just accepts relegation without doing something to stop it. Alan Pace, the owner and chairman of Burnley, is a relatively new owner and he has decided to act. The impact has to be absolutely immediate and I guess that means Burnley picking up points immediately. They start against West Ham on Sunday, then Southampton and Wolves. Sean Dyche is highly employable. Any like-minded club such as Burnley, Dyche will be top of the people who will be to be favourites to take over that job. He has been linked with many Premier League jobs over the years. He has always responded to those rumours by saying he was at Burnley - now he is not. I don't think it will be long until he gets another job. Clearly the problem for Burnley is getting another manager for themselves. Allow Twitter content?

Russian warship Moskva sinks in Black Sea,"The Moskva patrolling the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Syria A Russian warship that was damaged by an explosion on Wednesday has sunk, Russia's defence ministry has said. Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, was being towed to port when ""stormy seas"" caused it to sink, according to a ministry message. The 510-crew missile cruiser was a symbol of Russia's military power, leading its naval assault on Ukraine. Kyiv says its missiles hit the warship. The United States says it also believes it was hit by Ukrainian missiles. Moscow has not reported any attack - it says the vessel sank after a fire. The blaze caused the explosion of the warship's ammunition, Russia says, adding that the entire crew were later evacuated to nearby Russian vessels in the Black Sea. Sunken Russian warship: What do we know? Latest updates After saying initially the warship was afloat, late on Thursday the Russian defence ministry announced that the Moskva had been lost. The 12,490-tonne vessel is the biggest Russian warship to be sunk in action since World War Two. ""While being towed... towards the destined port, the vessel lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull as fire broke out after ammunition exploded. Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank,"" the Russian defence ministry said. Ukraine has said the captain of the warship was killed on board. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of internal affairs, shared the claim on Telegram, saying that the ship's captain, Anton Kuprin, had died during an ""explosion and fire on board"". The BBC has not been able to verify this claim. Ukrainian military officials said they struck the Moskva with Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles - a weapon designed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the naval threat to Ukraine in the Black Sea grew. The US now also believes the Moskva was hit by two of these missiles, a senior official said on Friday. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official told the Reuters news agency that the US believes there were Russian casualties, though numbers are unclear. A senior Ukrainian official said as many as 510 crew could have been on board the Moskva. On the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on a small garrison of Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender -to which they memorably radioed an expletive-laden message of refusal. Originally built in the Soviet-era, the Moskva entered service in the early 1980s. The vessel was actually laid down in Ukraine's southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been heavily bombed by Russia in recent days. By Jenny Hill, BBC News, Moscow This is a significant and humiliating loss for Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly insisted that his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is going according to plan. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Russian state media are not dwelling on the loss of the pride of the Black Sea fleet. Morning TV bulletins limited themselves to briefly reporting the statement issued by the authorities, who claim the ship sank in stormy seas after fire and explosions on board caused significant damage to its hull. A furious ex-MP, Vladimir Bortko, said the sinking of the Moskva was grounds for war Some newspaper commentators appeared to support that, arguing that the fire extinguishing systems on board the forty-year-old warship were out of date and inefficient but several writers agree that the development won't change the course of war. It is however a blow to national pride; the Moskva, once a symbol of Russian might and ambition, now lies at the bottom of the sea. While one TV talk show host didn't speculate on Ukraine's claims that it had struck the ship, a clearly emotional studio guest - film director and ex-MP Vladimir Bortko - said the fate of the Moskva was grounds for war. ""It's more about psychological damage than material damage,"" Mykola Bielieskov from Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies told the BBC. ""It won't remove Russia's naval blockade on Ukraine completely,"" he said. ""But it's a powerful symbol that we can employ sophisticated weaponry effectively."" But Mr Bielieskov, who advises the Ukrainian government on military strategy, did predict that ""Russian ships will now be forced to move further from the Ukrainian shore, where they can no longer feel secure."" The Moskva didn't itself fire missiles at Ukrainian land targets, but military experts told the BBC that it offered crucial support to other vessels that did. The remaining vessels in Russia's Black Sea fleet will now be more vulnerable to aerial attacks - although it's not clear that Ukraine's depleted forces have the resources to take advantage of this. ""The Moskva was the only ship in the fleet which had long-range air defences on board,"" said Sidharth Kaushal, a sea power expert at the Royal United Services Institute. ""While smaller vessels were conducting bombardments of Ukrainian cities, the Moskva was providing them with wide-area air cover."" The guided missile cruiser was previously deployed by Moscow in the Syria conflict where it supplied Russian forces in the country with naval protection. It is the second major vessel Russia has lost since the start of its invasion. Admiral Lord West, former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, said that as well as being a military blow the vessel's loss was ""very embarrassing"". ""This has a huge impact,"" Lord West said, speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM before confirmation that the Moskva had sunk. ""Putin loves the navy. When he came into power, the first bit of the old Soviet forces that he put effort into was the navy. He's always had a soft spot for it.""

What a great win for Emma Raducanu! Raducanu 7-5 6-5 Martincova* Martincova angles a backhand down a line that fizzes past a sliding Raducanu. Oh! A great forehand pass gets Raducanu on the board, and she keeps on pushing, with Martincova shanking a forehand to take it to 30-30. Now then!Match point to Raducanu! Raducanu 7-5 6-5 Martincova* Raducanu sends a winner past a rooted Martincova, and then pumps her fist as the Czech errs on return. Martincova will, once again, have to serve to stay in the match.

There is nothing in it. *Raducanu 7-5 5-5 Martincova Raducanu will be hoping this service game isn't as mammoth as her last.

"Army failing to deal with bullying complaints, lawyer saysThe experience of a young soldier who took his own life is ""sadly not isolated"", a lawyer says.Berkshire","Joel Robinson's mother said he was a ""warm young man"" and a ""gifted horseman"" The case of a soldier who took his own life just over three years ago shows the Army is still failing to deal with serious bullying complaints in its ranks, says a lawyer who specialises in military justice. Lance Corporal Joel Robinson was serving in the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment when he was found hanged in a common room at Combermere Barracks in Windsor on 25 March 2019. Around seven months earlier, the 24-year-old had made a formal complaint that he was being bullied and victimised,""leaving him lonely and depressed"". The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said it has no record of his complaint. But Angela Robinson told the BBC her son also sent her a copy, which she wasable to show at his inquestin November. ""I was assured by the Army in the immediate aftermath of his death that there was no record of any bullying - this was fundamentally untrue,"" Mrs Robinson said. Lawyer Emma Norton, director of the Centre for Military Justice, said: ""Joel's experience is sadly not isolated and is reflected in a lot of our casework. ""While the Army likes to state publicly that it welcomes complaints, the reality is a far cry from that and complainants are all too often seen as trouble-makers, or the cause of their own problems, and treated with a lack of sympathy and respect. ""That is why there have been repeated calls for the handling of these kinds of serious complaints to be taken away from the services themselves and handled by a central MoD authority."" L/Cpl Robinson (not pictured) served with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment The service complaints system was introduced in 2006 and can be used by current or former members of the armed forces who feel they have been wronged at some point during their service. According to the most recent official figures, there were 198 service complaints concerning bullying, harassment or discrimination in 2020. TheService Complaints Ombudsman,externalsaid the Army has the highest rates for bullying, harassment or discrimination complaints. It added that only one in nine (12%) personnel who experience such behaviour make a complaint. Mrs Robinson believes her son's complaint was swept under the carpet, and also led to him being continually overlooked for promotion, putting more pressure on his mental health. She said: ""Because he sent it to me, I was able to make sure the coroner saw it but if we hadn't done that, no-one would have ever known he had complained of serious bullying in the months before he died. ""I think that if his complaint had been dealt with properly, things might have turned out differently for my son."" The Army has the highest rates for bullying, harassment or discrimination complaints among the UK armed forces, according to official figures During the inquest into L/Cpl Robinson's death, senior officers gave evidence that they had seen his letter of complaint and taken steps to deal with the matter informally. However, in its subsequentresponse to recommendations,externalmade by senior coroner Heidi Connor, the Army reiterated that it had no record of his complaint. When approached by the BBC for clarification, the MoD declined to comment further. Ms Norton said: ""It's disappointing that the MoD continues to claim that it had no record of Joel making a complaint. ""Senior Army witnesses at his inquest gave evidence that they knew about his complaint of bullying, saw a copy of it, shared it and discussed it, accepting that it was a formal complaint."" Ruling L/Cpl Robinson's death a suicide, Mrs Connor did not conclude the Army's handling of his complaint caused his death. But she said: ""It appears that those involved in the complaint that Joel raised were wholly or mostly unaware of the appropriate procedure."" She added that her impression was that the Army had not gone ""much further than acknowledging"" the problem of suicide in its ranks, stating: ""The evidence is clear, there is more suicide within the Army than other armed forces."" According to the latestofficial figures,external, the deaths of seven armed forces personnel in 2021 were found to be suicide by a coroner. An additional 22 deaths last year may also result in a suicide verdict once coroner inquests are held, the MoD said. In total, 285 suicides were recorded among UK regular armed forces personnel between 2002 and 2021 - 264 men and 21 women. Emma Norton is the director of the Centre for Military Justice In response to Mrs Connor's report, the MoD acknowledged there have been delays in addressing suicide prevention. But it said it is now a ""priority health theme for defence"" and promised a detailed suicide prevention plan would be produced by this summer. Another soldier, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC how she also experienced bullying and isolation after making a service complaint. She said: ""I have been through the military's service complaints process, which started when I tried to raise a complaint about sexism in my chain of command. ""After making my complaint, I found myself the subject of all sorts of unfair criticisms - criticisms that had never been made against me before - and I was bullied by my chain of command and became increasingly isolated. ""At times I can say that I have felt utterly alone and desperate and have had some really dark thoughts of self-harm or even suicide. ""It's really hard to convey to people outside the armed forces just what it can be like. It felt like everywhere I turned there was no help. Without help, in desperation people can do terrible things."" In 2019, the MoD commissioned Air Chief Marshall Wigston to carry out anindependent review,externalof the prevalence of inappropriate behaviours in the armed forces. It recommended that complex bullying and harassment complaints should be taken out of the chain of command and single services, dealt with instead by a central defence authority. But Ms Norton said this plan ""appears to have been quietly shelved"". ""Despite initially saying it would accept that recommendation, the MoD later rolled back and rejected it, choosing instead to allow the services to keep marking their own homework,"" she said. She continued: ""As we saw in Joel's case, not only did none of the senior officers he approached for help know about how to deal with a service complaint, but it was quite clear they were not interested in getting to the bottom of the serious bullying allegations he had made. ""Joel made clear to his mum he had felt under pressure to withdraw it and that if he stuck with it, it would adversely affect his career."" At the conclusion of L/Cpl Robinson's inquest, thecoroner issued a report to prevent future deaths. In response the MoD said: ""The concerns surrounding L/Cpl Robinson's access to support outside the direct chain of command is a known and acknowledged risk. ""We seek to continually enhance support to our soldiers and families through chaplaincy, charitable and external providers and our regimental associations."" It said that ""awareness of the SC [service complaint] procedures throughout the Army has significantly improved"". ""Since L/Cpl Robinson's death, a significant amount of work has gone into improving the mental health resilience and risk identification training we provide to those who serve,"" it added. But Ms Norton said the Army had been ""misleading"" in its response to the coroner about its handling of service complaints. She said: ""Despite saying awareness of the process has significantly improved since Joel died, the fact is that the last armed forces survey showed the vast majority of service personnel still knew nothing or only a little about it. ""The simple truth is that despite warm words from the MoD that complaints are to be encouraged as a change to learn and improve, that is not how they are seen on the ground.""

Travellers warned of Easter road and rail delays,"There were queues on the A303 past Stonehenge in Wiltshire on Friday morning Travellers are facing traffic jams on some roads and disruption to trains as the Easter weekend gets under way. There was heavy congestion on motorways near London and Kent on Friday, while holiday traffic to south west England led to jams near Bristol, the AA said. But despite some hotspots, the RAC said vehicles on many of the country's major roads appeared to be running reasonably freely. It comes as several major train routes are closed for engineering works. The AA said there was a build up of traffic on the M25 as well as the M20 in Kent. There have also been jams on the M4 and M5 near Bristol. The AA dealt with 6,000 breakdowns by 15:00 BST on Friday. Hot weather led to more vehicles overheating when stuck in traffic jams, it said. Meanwhile, there have been long queues at the Port of Dover, where P&O Ferries' services are still not running. Rail delays and cancellations for Easter travellers Air travel industry warned over Easter disruption Edmund King, the AA's president, said traffic was likely to remain busier than usual and would start picking up on Saturday morning with football traffic flooding from Liverpool and Manchester to Wembley as there are no direct trains. ""It would have saved a lot of congestion and CO2 if the FA Cup semi-final was held in the north rather than having both sets of fans driving hundreds of miles south and back. It looks like Saturday will be another busy day on the roads so drivers should be prepared,"" he continued. He said there were traffic jams on the M20, while the M25 also suffered heavy congestion on the west side around Heathrow and the east near Dartford earlier. He advised travellers to ""give yourselves extra time for the journey and build regular stops at least every two hours or so into your trip"". The AA said traffic had eased during the afternoon, although hotspots remained on the south and south west coast. Rod Dennis, from the RAC, said: ""While much of the country's major roads appear to be running reasonably freely at the moment, Easter getaway traffic is starting to build in certain spots and that is likely to continue through the day."" The RAC predicted Good Friday would be the busiest day of the bank holiday weekend, with an estimated 4.62 million journeys by car likely across the UK. After two years of relatively quiet Easter bank holidays on the roads because of Covid restrictions, it said drivers were planning about 21.5 million trips over the bank holiday - the highest figure since it started its driver surveys in 2014. Meanwhile, rail passengers are facing delays and cancellations, with Network Rail carrying out 530 engineering projects across the bank holiday weekend, costing a total of Â£83m. No trains will run in or out of Euston station in London until the end of Monday on the West Coast main line, which is likely to disrupt football fans going to the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley. Trains to the West Midlands, north west England and parts of Scotland will instead start from Milton Keynes Central. There will be also be no Southern services to and from London Victoria all weekend, nor any direct trains from London to Stansted Airport. Alternative services are expected to be busy and Network Rail has advised people to travel either side of the bank holiday. Travellers heading across the Channel faced long queues at Dover There were long queues at the Port of Dover on Friday, with some travellers complaining they missed their ferries after waiting for hours. Ferry company DFDS urged customers to allow three hours to complete border checks. It said customers delayed by traffic at border control would be transferred to the first available departure. The Port of Dover also advised customers to allow extra time for their journey, saying there were delays at French border controls prior to check-in. Some lorries were being forced to queue on the A20 outside Dover, as part of the Traffic Access Protocol (TAP) scheme, which is designed to limit congestion in the town. Allow Twitter content?

P&O Ferries' Dover-Calais services remain suspended, nearly a month after the company sacked about 800 workers without notice. Two of the company's ferries which normally serve the route are still detainedafter they failed safety inspections. Bad weather, the Easter holidays and problems with an IT system for customs checks following Brexit have also contributed to congestion around Dover in recent days. This has led to long queues for lorries crossing the Channel. Operation Brock, which sees lorries heading to Dover queue on one side of the M20, was put in place last week to help manage the traffic. However, National Highwayssaid it had now been scaled backas the threat of disruption had reduced. Has there been any disruption to your travel plans?

Elon Musk 'not sure' his Twitter bid will succeed,"Elon Musk at the opening party for the Tesla gigafactory in Austin, Texas Tesla boss Elon Musk has admitted he is ""not sure"" his takeover bid for social media firm Twitter will be successful. He made the comments at a conference just hours after revealing that he had offered to buy the company for $54.20 a share, valuing the firm at $43bn. Also on Thursday, Twitter's chief executive told employees that the company was evaluating the approach. Parag Agrawal reportedly said at the staff meeting that the company was not being ""held hostage"" by the offer. Speaking at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Mr Musk said: ""I am not sure that I will actually be able to acquire it."" He added that he had a ""Plan B"" if his bid for Twitter was rejected, but gave no further details of what that could mean. Mr Musk also said at the event that Twitter should be more open and transparent. ""I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,"" he said. Elon Musk makes offer to buy Twitter NFT of Jack Dorsey's first tweet struggles to sell On Thursday, he revealed his offer to buy all the shares in Twitter that he does not already own. In an official filing to US regulators, Mr Musk said he was the right person to ""unlock"" the company's ""extraordinary potential"" and that if his offer was not accepted, ""I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder."" He also said that if Twitter's board of directors chose to reject the offer, it would be ""utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote"". Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal shunned the bid, tweeting: ""I don't believe that the proposed offer by Elon Musk comes close to the intrinsic value of Twitter given its growth prospects."" The billionaire claimed that he has a stake in Twitter through his investment firm Kingdom Holding Company. However, Mr Musk immediately replied asking how many Twitter shares Prince Alwaleed's firm owns, adding: ""What are the Kingdom's views on journalist freedom of speech?"" Allow Twitter content?

Twitter confirmed that it had received the bid, but said its board must still review the ""unsolicited, non-binding"" offer, which values its shares at well below the level of more than $70 that they reached last summer. Mr Musk already owns more than 9% of the social media platform, but he is no longer its biggest shareholder. Asset management firm Vanguard Groupdisclosed on 8 April,externalthat its funds now own a 10.3% stake, bumping him off the top spot. This video can not be played Watch: Ex-Twitter exec Vivian Schiller questions seriousness of Musk offer Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla where he is chief executive. He has not revealed any details on how his bid for Twitter will be financed. Mr Musk is being advised by US investment bank Morgan Stanley. Bruce Daisley, Twitter's former vice president for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Musk appeared to be ""toying with the company to some extent"". ""The latest bid he's put in, as far as I can tell, doesn't seem to be regarded as a serious bid but it is proving to be very disruptive with the organisation I think."" He said that Twitter may benefit from being taken private and out of the hands of shareholders. ""To some extent the constant scrutiny of being a publicly listed company, following in the footsteps of the likes of Google and Facebook, is definitely a challenge for the organisation so private ownership might be the right solution. ""I'm not convinced Elon Musk's approach is going to win many fans though,"" he added. Twitter's shares, which are listed in New York, initially rose on Thursday but ended down 1.6% at $45.08, below Mr Musk's offer. The board of Twitter has enlisted the help of another Wall Street bank, Goldman Sachs, as it considers how to respond to the takeover approach. Other than acknowledging the takeover bid, Twitter has publicly kept pretty quiet since Elon Musk revealed his attempt to buy the company. But details have emerged of an ""all hands"" meeting, where questions were put to the company's chief executive, Parag Agrawal. The details give nothing more than a suggestion of what Twitter's management thinks of the offer. Mr Agrawal reportedly said he could not talk about the details, but that the company was not being ""held hostage"". I'm told the meeting was designed to give employees more information. But one Twitter worker told me they left the meeting more confused. ""I didn't leave feeling any sense of clarity,"" they said. The employee said that they were in the dark about what could happen next. ""I would say I know about as much as the public on Twitter,"" they said. Twitter's board not only has to weigh up the offer, but also assess the damage that Elon Musk could do if scorned. Apparently he has a Plan B if Twitter rejects his offer. Twitter may be worth tens of billions of dollars, but it is nothing compared to Elon Musk, who is worth more than $200bn. And that kind of wealth makes him a dangerous foe.

The battle for control of Ukraine's skies,"Captain Vasyl Kravchuk Much of the focus of the war in Ukraine has so far been about the battle on the ground - but the fight to dominate the skies is just as important. The BBC has been given an exclusive interview with a Ukrainian air defence officer about the battle for control of Ukraine's skies. Captain Vasyl Kravchuk has a surprisingly ready smile for a man who has endured 50 days of war. We spoke to him via video link from his base at an undisclosed location. He knows the coming weeks will offer no respite. Russia may have received a bloody nose in its aborted attempts to take Kyiv, but with the Eastern region of the Donbas now firmly in Moscow's sights, the men and women of Dnipro's Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade will continue to play a key role in the next phase of the war. Defending Ukraine's skies from Russian attacks is already proving a challenge. As another Ukrainian air defence officer told the BBC, it is like trying to use a giant fly swatter which had large holes in it. ""We can't cover the whole airspace,"" Capt Kravchuk says simply. The fact he is even sitting here speaking to us is somewhat remarkable - especially given the fact that ""many air defence facilities were destroyed fully or partially"" in the first days of the war. It's a rare public admission by Ukrainian forces that they suffered significant losses in the early stages of the war. But despite these losses, the air defences which survived have still been used to good effect. Oryx, which has been tracking military losses during the war using visual confirmation, says that Ukraine has destroyed, damaged or captured at least 82 Russian aircraft, including jets, helicopters and drones. Ukraine's equivalent aircraft losses stands at 33. Indeed, their successes have confounded military experts, who predicted that Russia would quickly achieve air superiority over Ukraine. This video can not be played This video, shared by Ukrainian armed forces, shows a Russian helicopter being shot down by a missile Russia already had a significant advantage in the air, deploying more than three times as many combat aircraft as Ukraine. The US Pentagon says that Russian aircraft have been flying around 250 military missions and carrying out some 30 air strikes every day. Western officials still say that Russia is struggling to gain air superiority. But in contrast, Ukraine's aging fleet of mostly MiG-29 fighter jets have been struggling to compete, managing at best around 10 military missions a day. Ukraine knows that Russia has the upper hand in the air. That's why its repeatedly called on Western nations to close its skies. But Russia's anticipated offensive in the Donbas presents a new, more difficult challenge. How will Russia attack in east Ukraine? What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? Are arms shipments to Ukraine making a difference? Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for airpower at the Royal United Services Institute, says Russia is likely to have greater freedom of access in the airspace over the eastern region than the rest of the country due to its proximity to Russian controlled airspace. In order to win the fight here, Ukraine requires a mix of long, medium and short range weapons to provide what's known as a ""layered defence"". The West has been providing a significant number of shorter-range surface-to-air missiles. The US alone has already sent 2,000 Stingers. The UK has provided an unspecified number of Starstreak high velocity missiles too. But while Capt Kravchuk says his country is grateful for those shoulder launched weapons, known as Manpads, he says they're only effective on the frontline. This is because Manpads - man-portable air defence systems - are most effective against low flying aircraft. Russia is mostly using long range cruise missiles and high-altitude bombing. Capt Kravchuk told the BBC: ""We now lack medium and long range air defence systems... we do not have enough."" A renewed Russian offensive in the Donbas will put another serious strain on Ukraine's limited air defence. While the focus of the war has turned to Eastern Ukraine, the rest of the country still needs protection. On the ground, we've seen evidence that Ukraine has been sending additional air defence systems to the east in recent days. But it can't afford to redeploy all its air defence systems to the Donbas region. ""We cannot leave half of Ukraine completely without protection,"" Capt Kravchuck says. Ukraine is having to use its air defences not just to target Russian aircraft, but also Russian cruise and ballistic missiles. They are having some success, but they can't destroy everything. Capt Kravchuk estimates that his unit is shooting down between 50-70% of Russia's longer-range missiles. As an example, he says when Russia fired six missiles around Dnipro recently they managed to stop four. That still suggests a significant number are getting through. The Pentagon says that Russia has launched 1,550 missiles since the war began. Russia says it's also been using hypersonic missiles. There isn't much Ukraine's air defences can do against those as they travel at five times the speed of sound. But the harsh fact is that, without more significant support, Ukraine will find it increasingly hard to defend itself from Russian air and missile strikes the longer this war goes on. A senior western intelligence official told the BBC that long and mid-range air defences were top of the list of Ukraine's requests for more weapons supplies: ""They're very specific that they need air defence ammunitionâ¦ they do need those in large quantities."" And as Capt Kravchuk told us: ""Past wars have shown, whoever dominates the air wins the war.""

Russian warship Moskva sinks in Black SeaThe warship sunk while being towed a day after Ukraine claimed to have hit it with a missile.,"The Moskva patrolling the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Syria A Russian warship that was damaged by an explosion on Wednesday has sunk, Russia's defence ministry has said. Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, was being towed to port when ""stormy seas"" caused it to sink, according to a ministry message. The 510-crew missile cruiser was a symbol of Russia's military power, leading its naval assault on Ukraine. Kyiv says its missiles hit the warship. The United States says it also believes it was hit by Ukrainian missiles. Moscow has not reported any attack - it says the vessel sank after a fire. The blaze caused the explosion of the warship's ammunition, Russia says, adding that the entire crew were later evacuated to nearby Russian vessels in the Black Sea. Sunken Russian warship: What do we know? Latest updates After saying initially the warship was afloat, late on Thursday the Russian defence ministry announced that the Moskva had been lost. The 12,490-tonne vessel is the biggest Russian warship to be sunk in action since World War Two. ""While being towed... towards the destined port, the vessel lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull as fire broke out after ammunition exploded. Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank,"" the Russian defence ministry said. Ukraine has said the captain of the warship was killed on board. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of internal affairs, shared the claim on Telegram, saying that the ship's captain, Anton Kuprin, had died during an ""explosion and fire on board"". The BBC has not been able to verify this claim. Ukrainian military officials said they struck the Moskva with Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles - a weapon designed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the naval threat to Ukraine in the Black Sea grew. The US now also believes the Moskva was hit by two of these missiles, a senior official said on Friday. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official told the Reuters news agency that the US believes there were Russian casualties, though numbers are unclear. A senior Ukrainian official said as many as 510 crew could have been on board the Moskva. On the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on a small garrison of Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender -to which they memorably radioed an expletive-laden message of refusal. Originally built in the Soviet-era, the Moskva entered service in the early 1980s. The vessel was actually laid down in Ukraine's southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been heavily bombed by Russia in recent days. By Jenny Hill, BBC News, Moscow This is a significant and humiliating loss for Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly insisted that his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is going according to plan. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Russian state media are not dwelling on the loss of the pride of the Black Sea fleet. Morning TV bulletins limited themselves to briefly reporting the statement issued by the authorities, who claim the ship sank in stormy seas after fire and explosions on board caused significant damage to its hull. A furious ex-MP, Vladimir Bortko, said the sinking of the Moskva was grounds for war Some newspaper commentators appeared to support that, arguing that the fire extinguishing systems on board the forty-year-old warship were out of date and inefficient but several writers agree that the development won't change the course of war. It is however a blow to national pride; the Moskva, once a symbol of Russian might and ambition, now lies at the bottom of the sea. While one TV talk show host didn't speculate on Ukraine's claims that it had struck the ship, a clearly emotional studio guest - film director and ex-MP Vladimir Bortko - said the fate of the Moskva was grounds for war. ""It's more about psychological damage than material damage,"" Mykola Bielieskov from Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies told the BBC. ""It won't remove Russia's naval blockade on Ukraine completely,"" he said. ""But it's a powerful symbol that we can employ sophisticated weaponry effectively."" But Mr Bielieskov, who advises the Ukrainian government on military strategy, did predict that ""Russian ships will now be forced to move further from the Ukrainian shore, where they can no longer feel secure."" The Moskva didn't itself fire missiles at Ukrainian land targets, but military experts told the BBC that it offered crucial support to other vessels that did. The remaining vessels in Russia's Black Sea fleet will now be more vulnerable to aerial attacks - although it's not clear that Ukraine's depleted forces have the resources to take advantage of this. ""The Moskva was the only ship in the fleet which had long-range air defences on board,"" said Sidharth Kaushal, a sea power expert at the Royal United Services Institute. ""While smaller vessels were conducting bombardments of Ukrainian cities, the Moskva was providing them with wide-area air cover."" The guided missile cruiser was previously deployed by Moscow in the Syria conflict where it supplied Russian forces in the country with naval protection.

Travellers warned of Easter road and rail delaysMillions are expected to travel on what is predicted to be the busiest day of the Easter weekend.Business,"There were queues on the A303 past Stonehenge in Wiltshire on Friday morning Travellers are facing traffic jams on some roads and disruption to trains as the Easter weekend gets under way. There was heavy congestion on motorways near London and Kent on Friday, while holiday traffic to south west England led to jams near Bristol, the AA said. But despite some hotspots, the RAC said vehicles on many of the country's major roads appeared to be running reasonably freely. It comes as several major train routes are closed for engineering works. The AA said there was a build up of traffic on the M25 as well as the M20 in Kent. There have also been jams on the M4 and M5 near Bristol. The AA dealt with 6,000 breakdowns by 15:00 BST on Friday. Hot weather led to more vehicles overheating when stuck in traffic jams, it said. Meanwhile, there have been long queues at the Port of Dover, where P&O Ferries' services are still not running. Rail delays and cancellations for Easter travellers Air travel industry warned over Easter disruption Edmund King, the AA's president, said traffic was likely to remain busier than usual and would start picking up on Saturday morning with football traffic flooding from Liverpool and Manchester to Wembley as there are no direct trains. ""It would have saved a lot of congestion and CO2 if the FA Cup semi-final was held in the north rather than having both sets of fans driving hundreds of miles south and back. It looks like Saturday will be another busy day on the roads so drivers should be prepared,"" he continued. He said there were traffic jams on the M20, while the M25 also suffered heavy congestion on the west side around Heathrow and the east near Dartford earlier. He advised travellers to ""give yourselves extra time for the journey and build regular stops at least every two hours or so into your trip"". The AA said traffic had eased during the afternoon, although hotspots remained on the south and south west coast. Rod Dennis, from the RAC, said: ""While much of the country's major roads appear to be running reasonably freely at the moment, Easter getaway traffic is starting to build in certain spots and that is likely to continue through the day."" The RAC predicted Good Friday would be the busiest day of the bank holiday weekend, with an estimated 4.62 million journeys by car likely across the UK. After two years of relatively quiet Easter bank holidays on the roads because of Covid restrictions, it said drivers were planning about 21.5 million trips over the bank holiday - the highest figure since it started its driver surveys in 2014. Meanwhile, rail passengers are facing delays and cancellations, with Network Rail carrying out 530 engineering projects across the bank holiday weekend, costing a total of Â£83m. No trains will run in or out of Euston station in London until the end of Monday on the West Coast main line, which is likely to disrupt football fans going to the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley. Trains to the West Midlands, north west England and parts of Scotland will instead start from Milton Keynes Central. There will be also be no Southern services to and from London Victoria all weekend, nor any direct trains from London to Stansted Airport. Alternative services are expected to be busy and Network Rail has advised people to travel either side of the bank holiday. Travellers heading across the Channel faced long queues at Dover There were long queues at the Port of Dover on Friday, with some travellers complaining they missed their ferries after waiting for hours. Ferry company DFDS urged customers to allow three hours to complete border checks. It said customers delayed by traffic at border control would be transferred to the first available departure. The Port of Dover also advised customers to allow extra time for their journey, saying there were delays at French border controls prior to check-in. Some lorries were being forced to queue on the A20 outside Dover, as part of the Traffic Access Protocol (TAP) scheme, which is designed to limit congestion in the town. Allow Twitter content?

P&O Ferries' Dover-Calais services remain suspended, nearly a month after the company sacked about 800 workers without notice. Two of the company's ferries which normally serve the route are still detainedafter they failed safety inspections. Bad weather, the Easter holidays and problems with an IT system for customs checks following Brexit have also contributed to congestion around Dover in recent days. This has led to long queues for lorries crossing the Channel. Operation Brock, which sees lorries heading to Dover queue on one side of the M20, was put in place last week to help manage the traffic. However, National Highwayssaid it had now been scaled backas the threat of disruption had reduced. Has there been any disruption to your travel plans?

Zoo welcomes birth of 'tiny' rare monkey,"The endangered primates weigh just 40g and are 10cm tall An extremely rare cotton-top tamarin monkey has been born at Chester Zoo. The miniature species, weighing just 40g, is among the world's most endangered primates, with only about 2,000 left in the wild. Zoo keeper Siobhan Ward said: ""It's a little too tiny and a bit early on to determine its gender at the moment."" The 10cm-tall creatures have a distinctive look with heads striped with white fur and are often found in the illegal wildlife trade. The zoo said the species is predicted to decline by 80% over the next 20 years. Nick Davis, the zoo's deputy curator of mammals, said their striking appearance ""tends to draw poachers"" and their wild habitats have been destroyed by commercial logging. Only about 2,000 breeding animals remain in the wild He continued: ""Their crest of hair raises up when then they get excited, or feel that they need to warn off danger, making them look bigger and more intimidating. ""It wasn't that long ago that these miniature primates were seen as quite a common species. ""So their dramatic demise over the last few years shows just how a species thought to be safe can change so rapidly."" The zoo said the animals were highly intelligent and can live for about 25 years but should never be kept as pets.

Crypto boss says fraudsters have 'place in hell',"A senior director at one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges has told Radio 4 Money Box there's a ""special place in hell"" for fraudsters. Curtis Ting spent eight years at the FBI before joining Kraken where he is now managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa. ""I'm a former law enforcement official myself, I also have two living grandparents,"" he says. ""Frankly there's a special place in hell reserved for scammers and fraudsters who try to rob the vulnerable and the elderly."" He was speaking in relation to a fraud recently featured on Money Box where 77-year-old Graeme Stagg had nearlyÂ£800,000 stolen. Graeme was tricked into investing in cryptocurrency and more than half a million pounds was taken in less than a month using Kraken's exchange. ""We have a lot of fraud identification controls on the platform. We have flags identifying anyone who registers over a certain amount so anybody over a certain age gets flagged,"" says Mr Ting. ""Not only do they get flagged but you also see certain transaction amount levels in association with those accounts creating a particularly high risk profile. ""When that happens we hold [freeze] that account and reach out to individuals, and we require that a written note be provided to us identifying explicitly these individuals are doing these transactions of their own volition and not being guided by anybody."" Despite having these controls in place, Graeme had been so completely groomed by criminals he was able to transfer more than Â£500,000 into e-wallets using the Kraken exchange within the space of just 26 days. This video can not be played Graeme served with the RAF for 22 years before fraudsters stole every penny he had - nearly Â£800,000 The criminals then transferred it out of Graeme's control, stealing it all and leaving him with nothing. Curtis says it's up to law enforcement to catch the criminals but that it's the ""duty of exchanges, like ourselves, to work very closely with [law enforcement]"", adding they are fully cooperating with police in this case. Mr Ting welcomes plans announced by the UK government toregulate some cryptocurrenciesas part of wider efforts to make the country a hub for digital payment companies. So-called stablecoins will become recognised forms of payment to give people confidence in using digital currencies, according to the Treasury. Stablecoins are designed to have a stable value linked to traditional currencies or assets like gold, and as such they are considered less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. ""The integration of stablecoins into the payment framework potentially impacts our business quite a bit,"" Mr Ting says. ""There is the potential that we expand our service so that on top of simply facilitating trades, buying and selling of crypto, there's closer integration with payment networks, merchant providers and so forth."" US crypto investors complete Crawley takeover Some cryptocurrencies to be regulated in UK What a $600m hack says about the state of crypto Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""We want to see the [cryptocurrency] businesses of tomorrow - and the jobs they create - here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term."" The Treasury has not yet confirmed which stablecoins will be regulated; well-known ones include Tether and Binance USD. Mr Ting says he sees more regulation as a positive thing as ""it means more people will have to join us"". ""We welcome that. In our operations in Europe we're actually much further ahead in our discussions with European regulators because actual legislation is already on the table. ""If anything, the UK articulating this vision brings it further into alignment with where the rest of the industry is headed."" Regulators are racing to draw up rules to manage cryptocurrencies amid concern that their growing popularity could threaten established financial systems. In December, the Bank of England's deputy governor said that while only about 0.1% of UK wealth was currently held as digital assets, that proportion was growing quickly. Sir Jon Cunliffe told the BBC that if the value of cryptocurrencies fell sharply, it could have a knock-on effect. Meanwhile, the US is moving to craft regulations amid rising concern that the cryptocurrency industry is a haven for criminals. The process of generating digital coins via banks of powerful computers, called mining, is also highly energy intensive. Recent research suggests Bitcoin now generates carbon emissions comparable to the country of Greece. Mr Glen admitted there were concerns about the environmental impact and said the government ""will be looking closely at energy usage associated with certain crypto-technologies"".

"Army failing to deal with bullying complaints, lawyer says","Joel Robinson's mother said he was a ""warm young man"" and a ""gifted horseman"" The case of a soldier who took his own life just over three years ago shows the Army is still failing to deal with serious bullying complaints in its ranks, says a lawyer who specialises in military justice. Lance Corporal Joel Robinson was serving in the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment when he was found hanged in a common room at Combermere Barracks in Windsor on 25 March 2019. Around seven months earlier, the 24-year-old had made a formal complaint that he was being bullied and victimised,""leaving him lonely and depressed"". The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said it has no record of his complaint. But Angela Robinson told the BBC her son also sent her a copy, which she wasable to show at his inquestin November. ""I was assured by the Army in the immediate aftermath of his death that there was no record of any bullying - this was fundamentally untrue,"" Mrs Robinson said. Lawyer Emma Norton, director of the Centre for Military Justice, said: ""Joel's experience is sadly not isolated and is reflected in a lot of our casework. ""While the Army likes to state publicly that it welcomes complaints, the reality is a far cry from that and complainants are all too often seen as trouble-makers, or the cause of their own problems, and treated with a lack of sympathy and respect. ""That is why there have been repeated calls for the handling of these kinds of serious complaints to be taken away from the services themselves and handled by a central MoD authority."" L/Cpl Robinson (not pictured) served with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment The service complaints system was introduced in 2006 and can be used by current or former members of the armed forces who feel they have been wronged at some point during their service. According to the most recent official figures, there were 198 service complaints concerning bullying, harassment or discrimination in 2020. TheService Complaints Ombudsman,externalsaid the Army has the highest rates for bullying, harassment or discrimination complaints. It added that only one in nine (12%) personnel who experience such behaviour make a complaint. Mrs Robinson believes her son's complaint was swept under the carpet, and also led to him being continually overlooked for promotion, putting more pressure on his mental health. She said: ""Because he sent it to me, I was able to make sure the coroner saw it but if we hadn't done that, no-one would have ever known he had complained of serious bullying in the months before he died. ""I think that if his complaint had been dealt with properly, things might have turned out differently for my son."" The Army has the highest rates for bullying, harassment or discrimination complaints among the UK armed forces, according to official figures During the inquest into L/Cpl Robinson's death, senior officers gave evidence that they had seen his letter of complaint and taken steps to deal with the matter informally. However, in its subsequentresponse to recommendations,externalmade by senior coroner Heidi Connor, the Army reiterated that it had no record of his complaint. When approached by the BBC for clarification, the MoD declined to comment further. Ms Norton said: ""It's disappointing that the MoD continues to claim that it had no record of Joel making a complaint. ""Senior Army witnesses at his inquest gave evidence that they knew about his complaint of bullying, saw a copy of it, shared it and discussed it, accepting that it was a formal complaint."" Ruling L/Cpl Robinson's death a suicide, Mrs Connor did not conclude the Army's handling of his complaint caused his death. But she said: ""It appears that those involved in the complaint that Joel raised were wholly or mostly unaware of the appropriate procedure."" She added that her impression was that the Army had not gone ""much further than acknowledging"" the problem of suicide in its ranks, stating: ""The evidence is clear, there is more suicide within the Army than other armed forces."" According to the latestofficial figures,external, the deaths of seven armed forces personnel in 2021 were found to be suicide by a coroner. An additional 22 deaths last year may also result in a suicide verdict once coroner inquests are held, the MoD said. In total, 285 suicides were recorded among UK regular armed forces personnel between 2002 and 2021 - 264 men and 21 women. Emma Norton is the director of the Centre for Military Justice In response to Mrs Connor's report, the MoD acknowledged there have been delays in addressing suicide prevention. But it said it is now a ""priority health theme for defence"" and promised a detailed suicide prevention plan would be produced by this summer. Another soldier, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC how she also experienced bullying and isolation after making a service complaint. She said: ""I have been through the military's service complaints process, which started when I tried to raise a complaint about sexism in my chain of command. ""After making my complaint, I found myself the subject of all sorts of unfair criticisms - criticisms that had never been made against me before - and I was bullied by my chain of command and became increasingly isolated. ""At times I can say that I have felt utterly alone and desperate and have had some really dark thoughts of self-harm or even suicide. ""It's really hard to convey to people outside the armed forces just what it can be like. It felt like everywhere I turned there was no help. Without help, in desperation people can do terrible things."" In 2019, the MoD commissioned Air Chief Marshall Wigston to carry out anindependent review,externalof the prevalence of inappropriate behaviours in the armed forces. It recommended that complex bullying and harassment complaints should be taken out of the chain of command and single services, dealt with instead by a central defence authority. But Ms Norton said this plan ""appears to have been quietly shelved"". ""Despite initially saying it would accept that recommendation, the MoD later rolled back and rejected it, choosing instead to allow the services to keep marking their own homework,"" she said. She continued: ""As we saw in Joel's case, not only did none of the senior officers he approached for help know about how to deal with a service complaint, but it was quite clear they were not interested in getting to the bottom of the serious bullying allegations he had made. ""Joel made clear to his mum he had felt under pressure to withdraw it and that if he stuck with it, it would adversely affect his career."" At the conclusion of L/Cpl Robinson's inquest, thecoroner issued a report to prevent future deaths. In response the MoD said: ""The concerns surrounding L/Cpl Robinson's access to support outside the direct chain of command is a known and acknowledged risk. ""We seek to continually enhance support to our soldiers and families through chaplaincy, charitable and external providers and our regimental associations."" It said that ""awareness of the SC [service complaint] procedures throughout the Army has significantly improved"". ""Since L/Cpl Robinson's death, a significant amount of work has gone into improving the mental health resilience and risk identification training we provide to those who serve,"" it added. But Ms Norton said the Army had been ""misleading"" in its response to the coroner about its handling of service complaints. She said: ""Despite saying awareness of the process has significantly improved since Joel died, the fact is that the last armed forces survey showed the vast majority of service personnel still knew nothing or only a little about it. ""The simple truth is that despite warm words from the MoD that complaints are to be encouraged as a change to learn and improve, that is not how they are seen on the ground.""

Online predators targeting live-streaming - charities,"A group of victims of child sexual exploitation has written to the UK governmentasking for the Online Safety Bill,externalto be strengthened. They say tech companies must be made responsible,externalfor stopping child abuse on live-stream and video call platforms. Charities say online predators increasingly live-stream, because most tech firms have no built-in software to detect or stop this type of abuse. Currently, the bill does not specifically address live-streaming. The bill does put a duty of care on tech platforms to tackle the distribution of child abuse materials. The International Justice Mission, which helps victims of sexual exploitation, said: ""The bill needs to go further in recognising that these platforms aren't just where abusive material is published, the platforms are used as tools to commit abuse."" The charity reports that half of the victims are 12 or under at the time of rescue, with some being less than a year old. It said children are often abused in places like the Philippines ""while remote offenders in places like the UK pay to direct and view the abuse in real time"". Malone, not his real name, was eight when his uncle started abusing him in the Philippines. ""I was asked to get naked and they were filming me while I was undressing. ""My uncle would fetch me from school and he would ask me to take my clothes off and he would take pictures. It came to a point that he was threatening me to not tell anyone by showing me his gun."" After about two years Malone was rescued, and his uncle was sent to jail. The NSPCCwants the bill to be strengthened,externalto give better protection to children. In 2020, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse,externalheard that the UK was the third largest consumer of live streaming abuse in the world. A recent report by theAustralian Institute of Criminology found,externalthat offenders were paying on average about Â£27 to view the sexual abuse of children. Ruby, not her real name, was 16 when she became a victim of live-streamed sexual exploitation in the Philippines. After her parents died, she was tricked by traffickers who offered her a job. The International Justice Mission says half of the victims of child sexual exploitation it rescues are 12 years old or younger. They trapped her in a house and she was sexually abused live online. ""The times that I spent in that house were the darkest days of my life,"" she said. ""The memories of those things that I did there and those faces of those customers that I interacted with haunted me for years."" The National Crime Agency reports that between 550,000 and 850,000 people in the UK pose a risk to children at any one moment. Rob Jones, from the organisation, said: ""Live-streamed abuse is an increasing problem that is getting worse. ""The only people that can tackle this problem are those working on the tech platforms where live-streaming abuse takes place. ""If you are creating an end-to-end platform, you can introduce technology that can prevent abuse."" NSPCC research has shown,externalone in 20 children in the UK who live-streamed with someone they had not met face-to-face were asked to remove an item of clothing. Andy Burrows, from the charity, said: ""Live-streaming services expanded rapidly during the pandemic, but in a race to roll out products tech firms put growth before children's safety."" The charity wants the Online Safety Bill to force these companies to use ""proactive"" technology to stop live-stream abuse. But creating these solutions isn't easy. The technology has to be extremely accurate, suitable for use on social media platforms with billions of users, and it also needs to satisfy privacy concerns. Meta, Facebook's parent company, says it uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and prioritise video calls and live-streams that are likely to contain child sexual exploitation. UK firm SafeToNet was one offive companies given Â£85,000 by the UK government,externalin October to work on ways to stop the spread of child sexual abuse material on end-to-end encrypted online platforms. It claims it is developing AI technology that can recognise when child exploitation is taking place ""in real-time, in live-stream content"" on mobile devices and ""disable the camera"". Technology expert Prof Peter Sommer questions the suitability of this kind of technology. He said: ""Using machine learning as a means of detecting live-streamed videos of child sexual abuse is likely to remain very imprecise, much more so than for static photographs. How do you distinguish the grandparent talking to a grandchild wearing a small swimsuit?"" Prof Sommer points out that moderating this material quickly and effectively would be expensive. There has been strong objection to the introduction of this kind of technology from privacy campaigners. Jim Killock, from the Open Rights Group, said: ""Blanket monitoring everyone's video calls all of the time is a step too far. ""Removing or limiting encryption would open up video calls to access and exploitation by criminals, so would be an unacceptably dangerous step to take."" The Online Safety Bill is due to be debated in Parliament on Tuesday. Among its proposals are: Regulator Ofcom would get powers to regulate social media sites Companies could be forced to have a duty of care for their users, including protecting them from legal but harmful content, like abuse that doesn't cross the criminality threshold Companies who breach Ofcom rules could face fines of up to Â£18m Social media sites would have to moderate content from different political viewpoints equally and without discrimination Provisions would be introduced to tackle online scams, like romance fraud and fake investment opportunities Online Safety Bill tweaked to target scam ads 'Sex for rent' ads to be banned Harmful content could evade new online law - MPs Watchdog criticises government encryption campaign The battle over end-to-end encryption Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Army 'failing to deal with bullying complaints',"Joel Robinson's mother said he was a ""warm young man"" and a ""gifted horseman"" The case of a soldier who took his own life just over three years ago shows the Army is still failing to deal with serious bullying complaints in its ranks, says a lawyer who specialises in military justice. Lance Corporal Joel Robinson was serving in the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment when he was found hanged in a common room at Combermere Barracks in Windsor on 25 March 2019. Around seven months earlier, the 24-year-old had made a formal complaint that he was being bullied and victimised,""leaving him lonely and depressed"". The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said it has no record of his complaint. But Angela Robinson told the BBC her son also sent her a copy, which she wasable to show at his inquestin November. ""I was assured by the Army in the immediate aftermath of his death that there was no record of any bullying - this was fundamentally untrue,"" Mrs Robinson said. Lawyer Emma Norton, director of the Centre for Military Justice, said: ""Joel's experience is sadly not isolated and is reflected in a lot of our casework. ""While the Army likes to state publicly that it welcomes complaints, the reality is a far cry from that and complainants are all too often seen as trouble-makers, or the cause of their own problems, and treated with a lack of sympathy and respect. ""That is why there have been repeated calls for the handling of these kinds of serious complaints to be taken away from the services themselves and handled by a central MoD authority."" L/Cpl Robinson (not pictured) served with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment The service complaints system was introduced in 2006 and can be used by current or former members of the armed forces who feel they have been wronged at some point during their service. According to the most recent official figures, there were 198 service complaints concerning bullying, harassment or discrimination in 2020. TheService Complaints Ombudsman,externalsaid the Army has the highest rates for bullying, harassment or discrimination complaints. It added that only one in nine (12%) personnel who experience such behaviour make a complaint. Mrs Robinson believes her son's complaint was swept under the carpet, and also led to him being continually overlooked for promotion, putting more pressure on his mental health. She said: ""Because he sent it to me, I was able to make sure the coroner saw it but if we hadn't done that, no-one would have ever known he had complained of serious bullying in the months before he died. ""I think that if his complaint had been dealt with properly, things might have turned out differently for my son."" The Army has the highest rates for bullying, harassment or discrimination complaints among the UK armed forces, according to official figures During the inquest into L/Cpl Robinson's death, senior officers gave evidence that they had seen his letter of complaint and taken steps to deal with the matter informally. However, in its subsequentresponse to recommendations,externalmade by senior coroner Heidi Connor, the Army reiterated that it had no record of his complaint. When approached by the BBC for clarification, the MoD declined to comment further. Ms Norton said: ""It's disappointing that the MoD continues to claim that it had no record of Joel making a complaint. ""Senior Army witnesses at his inquest gave evidence that they knew about his complaint of bullying, saw a copy of it, shared it and discussed it, accepting that it was a formal complaint."" Ruling L/Cpl Robinson's death a suicide, Mrs Connor did not conclude the Army's handling of his complaint caused his death. But she said: ""It appears that those involved in the complaint that Joel raised were wholly or mostly unaware of the appropriate procedure."" She added that her impression was that the Army had not gone ""much further than acknowledging"" the problem of suicide in its ranks, stating: ""The evidence is clear, there is more suicide within the Army than other armed forces."" According to the latestofficial figures,external, the deaths of seven armed forces personnel in 2021 were found to be suicide by a coroner. An additional 22 deaths last year may also result in a suicide verdict once coroner inquests are held, the MoD said. In total, 285 suicides were recorded among UK regular armed forces personnel between 2002 and 2021 - 264 men and 21 women. Emma Norton is the director of the Centre for Military Justice In response to Mrs Connor's report, the MoD acknowledged there have been delays in addressing suicide prevention. But it said it is now a ""priority health theme for defence"" and promised a detailed suicide prevention plan would be produced by this summer. Another soldier, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC how she also experienced bullying and isolation after making a service complaint. She said: ""I have been through the military's service complaints process, which started when I tried to raise a complaint about sexism in my chain of command. ""After making my complaint, I found myself the subject of all sorts of unfair criticisms - criticisms that had never been made against me before - and I was bullied by my chain of command and became increasingly isolated. ""At times I can say that I have felt utterly alone and desperate and have had some really dark thoughts of self-harm or even suicide. ""It's really hard to convey to people outside the armed forces just what it can be like. It felt like everywhere I turned there was no help. Without help, in desperation people can do terrible things."" In 2019, the MoD commissioned Air Chief Marshall Wigston to carry out anindependent review,externalof the prevalence of inappropriate behaviours in the armed forces. It recommended that complex bullying and harassment complaints should be taken out of the chain of command and single services, dealt with instead by a central defence authority. But Ms Norton said this plan ""appears to have been quietly shelved"". ""Despite initially saying it would accept that recommendation, the MoD later rolled back and rejected it, choosing instead to allow the services to keep marking their own homework,"" she said. She continued: ""As we saw in Joel's case, not only did none of the senior officers he approached for help know about how to deal with a service complaint, but it was quite clear they were not interested in getting to the bottom of the serious bullying allegations he had made. ""Joel made clear to his mum he had felt under pressure to withdraw it and that if he stuck with it, it would adversely affect his career."" At the conclusion of L/Cpl Robinson's inquest, thecoroner issued a report to prevent future deaths. In response the MoD said: ""The concerns surrounding L/Cpl Robinson's access to support outside the direct chain of command is a known and acknowledged risk. ""We seek to continually enhance support to our soldiers and families through chaplaincy, charitable and external providers and our regimental associations."" It said that ""awareness of the SC [service complaint] procedures throughout the Army has significantly improved"". ""Since L/Cpl Robinson's death, a significant amount of work has gone into improving the mental health resilience and risk identification training we provide to those who serve,"" it added. But Ms Norton said the Army had been ""misleading"" in its response to the coroner about its handling of service complaints. She said: ""Despite saying awareness of the process has significantly improved since Joel died, the fact is that the last armed forces survey showed the vast majority of service personnel still knew nothing or only a little about it. ""The simple truth is that despite warm words from the MoD that complaints are to be encouraged as a change to learn and improve, that is not how they are seen on the ground.""

N Korea hackers linked to $600m crypto heist,"The US has linked North Korea-backed hackers to a massive cryptocurrency heist worth $615m (Â£469m) from players of the popular online game Axie Infinity last month. Players can earn crypto through game play or trading their avatars. The hack is likely one of the biggest ever to hit the crypto world. US officials say they linked the breach to a group called ""Lazarus"", believed to be controlled by North Korea's primary intelligence bureau. ""Through our investigations we were able to confirm Lazarus Group and APT38, cyber actors associated with [North Korea], are responsible for the theft,"" the FBI said in a statement on Thursday. Lazarus Group gained notoriety in 2014 after they were accused of hacking into Sony Pictures and publicly leaking confidential data. The group demanded that Sony withdraw its then-upcoming film The Interview, a satirical comedy staring Seth Rogen and James Franco, about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. A United Nations panel that monitors sanctions on North Korea has accused Pyongyang of using stolen funds to support its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes as a way to avoid international sanctions. ""The United States is aware that the DPRK has increasingly relied on illicit activities - including cybercrime - to generate revenue for its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs as it tries to evade robust US and UN sanctions,"" Reuters quoted a Treasury Department spokesperson as saying. A2020 US military report,externalsays North Korea's hacking programme dates back to at least the mid-1990s and has grown to a 6,000-strong cyber warfare unit, known as Bureau 121, which operates from several countries including Belarus, China, India, Malaysia and Russia. Blockchain analysis company Chainalysis said North Korean hackers stolealmost $400m (Â£291m) worth of digital assetsin at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms in 2021- one of most successful years on record for cyber-criminals in the closed-off east Asian state.

Musk 'not sure' Twitter bid will be successful,"Elon Musk at the opening party for the Tesla gigafactory in Austin, Texas Tesla boss Elon Musk has admitted he is ""not sure"" his takeover bid for social media firm Twitter will be successful. He made the comments at a conference just hours after revealing that he had offered to buy the company for $54.20 a share, valuing the firm at $43bn. Also on Thursday, Twitter's chief executive told employees that the company was evaluating the approach. Parag Agrawal reportedly said at the staff meeting that the company was not being ""held hostage"" by the offer. Speaking at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Mr Musk said: ""I am not sure that I will actually be able to acquire it."" He added that he had a ""Plan B"" if his bid for Twitter was rejected, but gave no further details of what that could mean. Mr Musk also said at the event that Twitter should be more open and transparent. ""I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,"" he said. Elon Musk makes offer to buy Twitter NFT of Jack Dorsey's first tweet struggles to sell On Thursday, he revealed his offer to buy all the shares in Twitter that he does not already own. In an official filing to US regulators, Mr Musk said he was the right person to ""unlock"" the company's ""extraordinary potential"" and that if his offer was not accepted, ""I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder."" He also said that if Twitter's board of directors chose to reject the offer, it would be ""utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote"". Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal shunned the bid, tweeting: ""I don't believe that the proposed offer by Elon Musk comes close to the intrinsic value of Twitter given its growth prospects."" The billionaire claimed that he has a stake in Twitter through his investment firm Kingdom Holding Company. However, Mr Musk immediately replied asking how many Twitter shares Prince Alwaleed's firm owns, adding: ""What are the Kingdom's views on journalist freedom of speech?"" Allow Twitter content?

Twitter confirmed that it had received the bid, but said its board must still review the ""unsolicited, non-binding"" offer, which values its shares at well below the level of more than $70 that they reached last summer. Mr Musk already owns more than 9% of the social media platform, but he is no longer its biggest shareholder. Asset management firm Vanguard Groupdisclosed on 8 April,externalthat its funds now own a 10.3% stake, bumping him off the top spot. This video can not be played Watch: Ex-Twitter exec Vivian Schiller questions seriousness of Musk offer Mr Musk is the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine, mostly due to his shareholding in electric vehicle maker Tesla where he is chief executive. He has not revealed any details on how his bid for Twitter will be financed. Mr Musk is being advised by US investment bank Morgan Stanley. Bruce Daisley, Twitter's former vice president for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Musk appeared to be ""toying with the company to some extent"". ""The latest bid he's put in, as far as I can tell, doesn't seem to be regarded as a serious bid but it is proving to be very disruptive with the organisation I think."" He said that Twitter may benefit from being taken private and out of the hands of shareholders. ""To some extent the constant scrutiny of being a publicly listed company, following in the footsteps of the likes of Google and Facebook, is definitely a challenge for the organisation so private ownership might be the right solution. ""I'm not convinced Elon Musk's approach is going to win many fans though,"" he added. Twitter's shares, which are listed in New York, initially rose on Thursday but ended down 1.6% at $45.08, below Mr Musk's offer. The board of Twitter has enlisted the help of another Wall Street bank, Goldman Sachs, as it considers how to respond to the takeover approach. Other than acknowledging the takeover bid, Twitter has publicly kept pretty quiet since Elon Musk revealed his attempt to buy the company. But details have emerged of an ""all hands"" meeting, where questions were put to the company's chief executive, Parag Agrawal. The details give nothing more than a suggestion of what Twitter's management thinks of the offer. Mr Agrawal reportedly said he could not talk about the details, but that the company was not being ""held hostage"". I'm told the meeting was designed to give employees more information. But one Twitter worker told me they left the meeting more confused. ""I didn't leave feeling any sense of clarity,"" they said. The employee said that they were in the dark about what could happen next. ""I would say I know about as much as the public on Twitter,"" they said. Twitter's board not only has to weigh up the offer, but also assess the damage that Elon Musk could do if scorned. Apparently he has a Plan B if Twitter rejects his offer. Twitter may be worth tens of billions of dollars, but it is nothing compared to Elon Musk, who is worth more than $200bn. And that kind of wealth makes him a dangerous foe.

Russian warship Moskva has sunk - defence ministry,"The Moskva patrolling the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Syria A Russian warship that was damaged by an explosion on Wednesday has sunk, Russia's defence ministry has said. Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, was being towed to port when ""stormy seas"" caused it to sink, according to a ministry message. The 510-crew missile cruiser was a symbol of Russia's military power, leading its naval assault on Ukraine. Kyiv says its missiles hit the warship. The United States says it also believes it was hit by Ukrainian missiles. Moscow has not reported any attack - it says the vessel sank after a fire. The blaze caused the explosion of the warship's ammunition, Russia says, adding that the entire crew were later evacuated to nearby Russian vessels in the Black Sea. Sunken Russian warship: What do we know? Latest updates After saying initially the warship was afloat, late on Thursday the Russian defence ministry announced that the Moskva had been lost. The 12,490-tonne vessel is the biggest Russian warship to be sunk in action since World War Two. ""While being towed... towards the destined port, the vessel lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull as fire broke out after ammunition exploded. Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank,"" the Russian defence ministry said. Ukraine has said the captain of the warship was killed on board. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of internal affairs, shared the claim on Telegram, saying that the ship's captain, Anton Kuprin, had died during an ""explosion and fire on board"". The BBC has not been able to verify this claim. Ukrainian military officials said they struck the Moskva with Ukrainian-made Neptune missiles - a weapon designed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the naval threat to Ukraine in the Black Sea grew. The US now also believes the Moskva was hit by two of these missiles, a senior official said on Friday. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official told the Reuters news agency that the US believes there were Russian casualties, though numbers are unclear. A senior Ukrainian official said as many as 510 crew could have been on board the Moskva. On the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Moskva gained notoriety after calling on a small garrison of Ukrainian border troops defending Snake Island in the Black Sea to surrender -to which they memorably radioed an expletive-laden message of refusal. Originally built in the Soviet-era, the Moskva entered service in the early 1980s. The vessel was actually laid down in Ukraine's southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been heavily bombed by Russia in recent days. By Jenny Hill, BBC News, Moscow This is a significant and humiliating loss for Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly insisted that his ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is going according to plan. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Russian state media are not dwelling on the loss of the pride of the Black Sea fleet. Morning TV bulletins limited themselves to briefly reporting the statement issued by the authorities, who claim the ship sank in stormy seas after fire and explosions on board caused significant damage to its hull. A furious ex-MP, Vladimir Bortko, said the sinking of the Moskva was grounds for war Some newspaper commentators appeared to support that, arguing that the fire extinguishing systems on board the forty-year-old warship were out of date and inefficient but several writers agree that the development won't change the course of war. It is however a blow to national pride; the Moskva, once a symbol of Russian might and ambition, now lies at the bottom of the sea. While one TV talk show host didn't speculate on Ukraine's claims that it had struck the ship, a clearly emotional studio guest - film director and ex-MP Vladimir Bortko - said the fate of the Moskva was grounds for war. ""It's more about psychological damage than material damage,"" Mykola Bielieskov from Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies told the BBC. ""It won't remove Russia's naval blockade on Ukraine completely,"" he said. ""But it's a powerful symbol that we can employ sophisticated weaponry effectively."" But Mr Bielieskov, who advises the Ukrainian government on military strategy, did predict that ""Russian ships will now be forced to move further from the Ukrainian shore, where they can no longer feel secure."" The Moskva didn't itself fire missiles at Ukrainian land targets, but military experts told the BBC that it offered crucial support to other vessels that did. The remaining vessels in Russia's Black Sea fleet will now be more vulnerable to aerial attacks - although it's not clear that Ukraine's depleted forces have the resources to take advantage of this. ""The Moskva was the only ship in the fleet which had long-range air defences on board,"" said Sidharth Kaushal, a sea power expert at the Royal United Services Institute. ""While smaller vessels were conducting bombardments of Ukrainian cities, the Moskva was providing them with wide-area air cover."" The guided missile cruiser was previously deployed by Moscow in the Syria conflict where it supplied Russian forces in the country with naval protection. It is the second major vessel Russia has lost since the start of its invasion. Admiral Lord West, former First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, said that as well as being a military blow the vessel's loss was ""very embarrassing"". ""This has a huge impact,"" Lord West said, speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM before confirmation that the Moskva had sunk. ""Putin loves the navy. When he came into power, the first bit of the old Soviet forces that he put effort into was the navy. He's always had a soft spot for it.""
