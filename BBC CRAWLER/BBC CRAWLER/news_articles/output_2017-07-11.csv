Should washing machines be in kitchens?,"When it comes to the laundry, it's all about location, location, location, according to TV host Kirstie Allsopp.  The presenter of property programmes has provoked a debate after posting on Twitter that it is disgusting to keep washing machines in the kitchen. The remark, in response to a journalist's comments about Americans finding the British way of placing washing machines in kitchens confusing, provoked a (mostly) humorous backlash on social media. Moments after the postone Twitter user,externalasked where exactly in the home the washing machine should be located if a homeowner did not have a utility room to which Ms Allsopp replied: ""Bathroom, hall cupboard, airing cupboard, google tiny laundry rooms."" ""Really? We live in a moderately-sized, four-bed semi and couldn't fit a washing machine anywhere other than the kitchen!"" remarkedanother Twitter user,external, whileanother commented,external: ""What is disgusting is disrespecting those who have nowhere else to put one. "" Another Tweeter referred to the issue as,external""first world problems."" You may also like: Taylor Review: No cash, no problem? Vladimir Putin: The president who wasn't there Puppy left in airport by abused owner Realising the washing machine comment had provoked such a debate, Ms Allsopp attempted to quell the barrage of negative comments directed at her. But the mocking continued, provoking some post-watershed language from the TV presenter, aimed at those who had still failed to grasp she was joking when she said it was her ""life's work"" to get washing machines out of the kitchen. Most got the message as the responses took a humorous turn. Washing machines in many parts of the US and Europe are placed in the bathroom or separate utility rooms, but in most UK homes they are usually found in the kitchen, in part because in the UK there are no electrical sockets in the bathroom and most UK bathrooms could not fit a washing machine.

'Over-sexualised' shaving advert banned,"The video-on-demand Femfresh advert was shown in March and April of this year An advert for bikini line shaving products has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which found it was likely to cause ""serious or widespread offence"". The Femfresh advert featured women, wearing briefs and swimwear, dancing. Shown on ITV and Channel 4 on-demand services earlier this year, it included close-up shots of the women's crotches. The ASA received 17 complaints that the advert objectified women and portrayed them in an overly sexualised way. Church & Dwight UK - the brand which owns Femfresh - did not believe the advert for the so-called ""intimate shaving collection"" was offensive or socially irresponsible. It said it was aimed at a target audience of 18 to 34-year-old women and that close-ups were used to illustrate that the product could give consumers a smooth bikini line. Neither Channel 4 or ITV received any complaints about the advert directly and both agreed with comments made by Church & Dwight that it did not objectify women. But the ASA noted that the dance sequence was ""highly sexualised"", there were ""few shots"" of the women's faces and the high-cut swimsuits ""were more exposing"" than most. ""Even taking into account the nature of the product, we considered that it had been presented in an overly-sexualised way that objectified women,"" the ASA said. ""We concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence and therefore breached the code."" It ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form.

Trump Jr emails show Russia communication,"Donald Trump Jr was told the information would be useful to his father, one email says US President Donald Trump's son has released an email chain showing he was keen to accept ""sensitive"" information on Hillary Clinton from a Russian national. Publicist Rob Goldstone tells Donald Trump Jr that there is information that is ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump"". Mr Trump Jr replies: ""If it's what you say, I love it."" The emails led to a meeting in New York with a Russian lawyer. It appears to be the first confirmation that a Trump associate attended a meeting in the expectation of being handed sensitive information from Russian officials. US officials are currently investigating alleged Russian meddling in the US election. President Trump issued a brief statement in support of his son, describing him as ""a high-quality person"" and applauding his transparency. Later, the highest-ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said he wanted Mr Trump Jr and all participants in the meeting to testify before the panel. Trump Jr's email chain: Full text Four most explosive lines in the emails Trump Jr's habit for headline-making The emails to Mr Trump Jr, which hereleased on Twitter,external, say ""the crown prosecutor of Russia"" (a role that does not exist) had ""offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father"". The email chain was also forwarded to President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign manager Paul Manafort. All three later met Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York. Since he was elected, President Trump has been dogged by allegations that Russia tried to sabotage Mrs Clinton's campaign. He has denied any knowledge of this and Russia has also repeatedly denied interfering. In May, the justice department appointed ex-FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to look into the Russian matter. This video can not be played ""The optics might look bad,"" says Trump supporter, but critic calls it ""a thunderbolt"" TheNew York Times first reported on Saturday,externalthat a meeting had taken place on 9 June 2016 between Ms Veselnitskaya and the Trump team at Trump Tower. It later reported that Mr Trump Jr had earlier been offered alleged damaging information on Mrs Clinton. President's family facing the heat Russian cloud hangs over White House Trump-Russia scandal: How did we get here? The Times had been expected to publish emails connected to the meeting, but Mr Trump Jr pre-empted this by posting the email chain on Twitter. He had earlier admitted meeting Ms Veselnitskaya but insisted she had provided ""no meaningful information"". He said she had wanted to talk about adoptions. The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was also at the meeting Ms Veselnitskaya, who has been linked to the Russian government, has insisted she was never in possession of information that could have damaged Mrs Clinton. She said Mr Trump Jr and two senior campaign aides may have met her last summer because they were ""longing"" for such information. She has denied any connection with the Kremlin. The email chainposted by Mr Trump Jr,externalshows: On 3 June last year he received an email from intermediary Mr Goldstone promising documents from Russia that would incriminate Hillary Clinton and her supposed dealings with Russia One email from Mr Goldstone said the information they had been promised was ""obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump"" The person who was to meet Mr Trump Jr in New York was described as ""a Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow"" Within the week, a meeting had been arranged which included Mr Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort Mr Trump Jr also posted a statement saying he was releasing the email chain ""to be totally transparent"" and reiterated that the Russian lawyer had ""no information to provide"". Mr Goldstone has previously denied any knowledge of involvement in the election by the Russian government. Who is the man behind Donald Trump Jr's meeting? Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter The New York Times' description of the email to Donald Trump Jr from Rob Goldstone was bad news for the Trump presidency. The actual text of the emails, however, is absolutely devastating. Trump Jr was explicitly told the Russian government wanted to provide him with documents incriminating Hillary Clinton as part of its ""support for Mr Trump"". Son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chair Paul Manafort were apparently copied on the entire email chain the day before the meeting. Goldstone even offered to pass the information along to Donald Trump's personal assistant. These emails place dynamite under nearly a year's worth of assertions by Trump officials that there was no co-ordination between their campaign and the Russian government. Even if no collusion took place in this instance - all the parties to the meeting who are speaking publicly deny that any information was exchanged - Trump Jr wasn't just open to Russian help, he ""loved"" it. Time and time again members of President Trump's inner circle have denied contacts with Russian nationals only to later revise their assertions when new facts emerged. These emails may have given the public the first glimpse of why such elaborate defences were constructed. Anthony's analysis in full Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina - a Trump critic - said the emails were ""very disturbing"", adding that the meeting should never have been held in the first place. He told reporters on Capitol Hill: ""This is the most problematic thing that I've seen thus far... the most direct evidence yet... that the Russian government was interested in helping the Trump campaign.""

Thomas Cook wins holiday sickness case,"There has been a spike in fake sickness claims by UK holidaymakers, industry bodies say Travel company Thomas Cook says it has won a legal victory against a fake holiday sickness claim and plans to challenge other such claims in court. It comes after a family tried to win up to Â£10,000 in damages for food poisoning on a trip to the Canary Islands. A judge at Liverpool County Court dismissed the case on Monday after concluding they were not sick. It follows reports of a ""huge rise"" in fake sickness claims by UK tourists. In June, the travel trade organisation Abta launched a campaign to tackle the problem, saying it was ""one of the biggest issues that has hit the travel industry for many years"". It said tens of thousands of holidaymakers had made claims in the past year - worth between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 each - despite reported sickness levels in resorts remaining stable. Speaking after the hearing in Liverpool, Thomas Cook managing director Chris Mottershead said the company would ""not accept liability"" in such cases. ""It's not comfortable for us to be in court questioning our customers' credibility, but the significant increase in unreported illness claims being received by the travel industry threatens holidays for all UK customers,"" he said. The claimants said poor food and hygiene at their hotel made them sick ""This case follows an increasingly common pattern for these claims, with a previously unreported illness being raised years after the holiday, with no medical or other evidence to support the illness having occurred."" Thomas Cook said that Julie Lavelle, 33, her partner Michael McIntyre, 34, and their two young children had sought compensation after stating they suffered gastroenteritis on the third day of a two-week holiday in 2013. The family blamed poor food and hygiene at their hotel on Gran Canaria and said their symptoms continued after they had returned the UK. Thomas Cook said they did not mention their condition to hotel staff or tour representatives in the resort. The company also said Mr McIntyre filled out a holiday feedback questionnaire on his flight home and left the section on illness unanswered. The family's law firm, Bridger & Co of Carmarthenshire, was not immediately available for comment. Abta said that rules designed to stop a spike in fraudulent whiplash claims have fuelled the rise in holiday sickness reports as they do not apply to incidents abroad. It said holidaymakers pursuing fake or exaggerated claims risked being barred from resorts or ending up in prison. In July, the government said it planned to tackle the problem by reducing the cash incentives of bringing such cases against holiday firms. Justice Secretary David Lidington also said the government wanted tolimit the legal costs,externalthat travel firms had to pay out for the claims. ""Our message to those who make false holiday sickness claims is clear - your actions are damaging and will not be tolerated,"" Mr Lidington said.

Four explosive lines in Trump Jr emails,"Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner at an inauguration ball The word ""explosive"" doesn't do justice to the details of the emails Donald Trump Jr tweeted out on Tuesday morning. Calamitous, perhaps? Seismic? TwitterdÃ¤mmerung? The president's eldest son probably revealed this correspondence because the New York Times was about to publish it, a fourth devastating journalistic wave that was poised to crash on the White House at any moment. If that's the case Trump Jr's act, while committed in the name of being ""totally transparent"", was akin to shooting oneself in the head to avoid getting shot. He certainly didn't do it to save his own skin. Here are four of the most remarkable passages of the email chain that will live in infamy - and what it all means. Trump Jr originally tweeted out the first three pages, leaving out page four, which has all the juiciest bits. It was like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony without Ode to Joy or the 1812 Overture without the cannons. The above line is clearly the highlight of the page. Rob Goldstone, the music publicist turned international man of mystery, is straight-up telling the presidential son that Russia wants to help his dad. In the prior paragraph, he details exactly what he says is being offered - ""official documents and information"" about Democrat Hillary Clinton. Several lines later he floats the possibility of sending the incriminating material to Donald Trump the Elder, via his personal assistant, Rhona. (Rhona should probably get her own lawyer, by the way.) Trump Jr's email chain: Full text Why is this British guy emailing Donald Trump Jr? Setting aside the glaring lack of punctuation, this line in Trump Jr's response to Goldstone's email shows he knows exactly what he's getting himself into. He's practically drooling at the possibility of being handed documents from the Russian government that incriminate the one person standing between his father and the White House. What's more, those last few words seem to indicate that Trump Jr also is thinking about when such information could be revealed. The meeting took place in early June. ""Later in the summer"", the general election campaign was in full swing. It's when both parties held their national conventions. It is also, incidentally, when the most damaging emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee server - at the behest of the Russian government, according to the US intelligence community - went public via Wikileaks. The lawyer in question - Natalia Veselnitskaya - has asserted that she is not connected to the Russian government, but Goldstone is presenting her to Trump Jr here as a ""government attorney"". There's always the possibility that Goldstone is blowing smoke Trump Jr's way, trying to make it seem like he's setting up a super-secret meeting that will upend the presidential campaign when actually he's just saying whatever he thinks is necessary to get a meeting that his client, Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, has requested. In the music business, I suppose, anything goes. That may not exonerate Trump Jr, but it would relieve the Russian government of culpability, at least in this regard. President's family facing the heat Russian cloud hangs over White House Trump-Russia scandal: How did we get here? At the very top of the email chain are two names that should be of particular concern to the White House - Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Trump Jr had told the New York Times that he had asked the two men to attend the Trump Tower meeting but had not told them what was to be discussed. This seems to undercut that, because both men probably had the full email chain, including the earlier correspondence discussing the promise of incriminating ""documents and information"" sitting in their in-boxes the day before they attended the meeting.

Air Canada in near-miss with four planes,"Air Canada says it is investigating the incident The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating an apparent near-miss involving an Air Canada flight at San Francisco's airport. It says Flight AC759 from Toronto was cleared to land on a runway last Friday, but the pilot ""inadvertently"" lined up for a taxiway where four aircraft were waiting to depart. An air traffic controller became aware of the problem and ordered the pilot to pull up and make another approach. The Airbus 320 then landed safely. The FAA is currently investigating the distance between the Air Canada aircraft and the aircraft lined up on the taxiway, which runs parallel to the runway. It describes the 7 July incident as ""very rare"". Air Canada says 135 passengers and five crew members were aboard the flight from Toronto. It was not immediately clear how many people were in the four planes on the taxiway. Air Canada is also investigating the incident, a spokesman for the company says. ""Air Canada flight AC759 from Toronto was preparing to land at San Francisco airport Friday night when the aircraft initiated a go-around,"" Peter Fitzpatrick is quoted as saying by CBC News. ""The aircraft landed normally without incident. We are still investigating the circumstances and therefore have no additional information to offer."" Meanwhile, an audio recording has emerged of what are said to be last Friday's communications between air traffic controllers and pilots at San Francisco's airport. In it, a male voice believed to be that of the Air Canada pilot is heard saying that there are lights on the runway. One of the air traffic controllers replies that there are no other planes there. Another - unidentified - voice is then heard saying: ""Where's this guy going? He's on the taxiway."" The air traffic controller then apparently realises the danger of the Air Canada plane crashing into the four aircraft on the ground, and orders the pilot to pull up and make another approach. A pilot from one of the planes on the ground is then heard saying: ""United One, Air Canada flew directly over us."" ""If it is true, what happened probably came close to the greatest aviation disaster in history,"" retired United Airlines Capt Ross Aimer, CEO of Aero Consulting Experts, told the Mercury News. ""If you could imagine an Airbus colliding with four passenger aircraft wide bodies, full of fuel and passengers, then you can imagine how horrific this could have been,"" he said. The deadliest incident in aviation history was in 1977, when 583 people were killed after two Boeing planes collided on a runway at Los Rodeos airport in northern Tenerife, on Spain's Canary Islands.

Aristocrat guilty over Gina Miller post,"Rhodri Colwyn Philipps, 4th Viscount St Davids, called Gina Miller a 'troublesome first generation immigrant' An aristocrat who wrote an online post offering Â£5,000 to anyone who ran over businesswoman Gina Miller has been found guilty of two charges of making menacing communications. Rhodri Colwyn Philipps, 50 - the 4th Viscount St Davids - wrote the message four days after Ms Miller won a Brexit legal challenge against the government. Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said she had ""no doubt it was menacing"". Philipps, who called his comments ""satire"", faces a custodial sentence. He was found guilty of two counts of making malicious communications and acquitted of a third at Westminster Magistrates' Court. One of the counts related to a post regarding Ms Miller, published on Facebook on 7 November 2016, which said: ""Â£5,000 for the first person to 'accidentally' run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant."" Philipps, of Knightsbridge, London, described her as a ""boat jumper"" and added: ""If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles."" Ms Arbuthnot found this offence was racially aggravated. The court heard how Ms Miller, 52, said she felt ""violated"" by Philipps's ""shocking"" comments about her. Ms Millerled a successful legal challengewhich, on 3 November, resulted in the government being told to consult Parliament before formally beginning the Brexit process. Philipps, who defended himself throughout the trial, said his posts had been simply reflecting how he and others felt following this ruling in the High Court. A statement from Gina Miller was read out to the court He told the court: ""My family motto is 'Love of Country is my motivation'."" He said his comments were ""meant to be a form of satire, a literary technique, iterated in my personal style, which may not be to everyone's taste, but is understood and accepted by everyone who knows me"". Ms Arbuthnot, in a series of exchanges with the peer, asked Philipps: ""Boat jumper, how can I see that as anything other than a racial, ethnic aggravation?"" But Philipps denied the allegation that his posts were ""racially aggravated"" saying that describing Ms Miller as a ""boat jumper"" and that she should go back to the ""steaming jungle"" were ""statements of fact not a racist comment at all"". He added that he would not have made any serious threat ""on an account where I could easily be identified"". He added he had deleted the posts as soon as he realised that his closed circle of Facebook friends had been ""infiltrated"" and screen shots of the posts had been passed to Ms Miller. Delivering her verdict, Ms Arbuthnot said there was ""nothing private about a Facebook post"". The other post Philipps was convicted for was in response to a news article about an immigrant in Luton, who was involved ina row over housing. Philipps wrote: ""I will open the bidding. Â£2,000 in cash for the first person to carve Arnold Sube into pieces."" Kate Mulholland, from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""No-one should have these kind of menacing comments made to them or about them."" Philipps will be sentenced later this week.

10 thoughts about the PM's position,"It wasn't meant to be called a ""relaunch"" or a ""fightback"" or even a ""reset"". The prime minister's speech this morning was, however, the first big speech she has made since the election. You might, therefore, have expected it to be bold, determined, as she said it would be. You might have expected it to be, at least in part, a genuine mea culpa from the PM for the mistakes of the election campaign. It was, however, more a rather pedestrian response to the long awaitedTaylor review,externalon the changing world of work and insecure employment (insert obvious jokes here) and a restatement of purpose than a dazzling rebrand. But whatever Theresa May had said this morning, as MPs stagger towards the finish line of this tumultuous year, and stumble towards the sun loungers, she is in trouble. And Tories will leave Westminster next week with the question of her future very much on their minds - the issue: how long can she survive? There are some fundamental obstacles to her doing so, but some advantages to her position too (honest). This list is not exhaustive, nor predictive, and may, as is the way of things these days, not age well at all. 1) Smack bang in the middle of her speech Theresa May said she is still convinced that her vision for the country is the right one, and she is completely committed to delivering it. The problem with that is that plenty of her MPs believe that the election result gave the country's verdict on that vision, and it wasn't pretty. They believe simply that she has to change, to show she can be flexible. How can she do that if she refuses to accept that some of her judgements were wrong? 2) The cabinet has big disagreements on a lot of things, most notably of course on Brexit, and since the election they have little compunction in giving their views. Remainer members like the chancellor have not held back from arguing for a more flexible position than the PM's negotiating position as outlined earlier in the year. But others are adamant she must stick. I'm told that in cabinet this morning the foreign secretary urged the PM to reaffirm that the government position remained theLancaster House speech,externaland that she did so, despite the fact others sitting round the table have been arguing for that approach to bend. 3) There are plenty of would-be rebels who believe they have the numbers on all sorts of issues to force the government to back down. First up could be membership of the European nuclear safety agency, Euratom. The rebels are very confident they have the numbers to get the prime minister to back down without even having to put an amendment down. One cabinet minister told me it would be a sensible move to show willing to compromise on an issue which doesn't raise much public concern, and would not raise too much suspicion of Brexit backsliding. Another source said it was simply now an issue for Number 10, with the Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to be ""relaxed"" about the issue. Theresa May might end up isolated with only her red lines for company. 4) Some Brexiteer Tory MPs are what's described by a minister as ""absolutist"" - ready to pounce on any sign of compromise from Theresa May as evidence that she is about to betray their cause. Simply, she is trapped by the parliamentary numbers that dictate she will have to compromise, and by some in her own party who would be ready to condemn any whiff of her doing so. 5) The Tory party particularly has little sympathy for leaders who look like they will damage all of their fortunes. You cannot find Tory MPs who say that she should lead them into the next election. It is a question of when not if. One former minister said she was finished (a much more delicate term than the ex-minister actually used) adding: ""We know it, and she knows it too."" And as they enter the summer, many believe it would only take one more big thing to go wrong for the plotters to seize their moment. 1) While Tory MPs agree that Theresa May can't stay on indefinitely, they pretty much all agree that they don't want to risk a general election right now. A few sources around the margins argue that a period of opposition is the only thing that will bring true reflection - but the overwhelming sense is that they need at least to stick together until the Autumn, for risking any leadership changes could slam them into another such contest. They worry that by plunging into another internal battle, they would push voters to choose Jeremy Corbyn for Number 10. 2) There is no obvious successor to her. If there was a universally popular and respected alternative leader the situation might feel extremely different. Despite the chatter about all sorts of people, particularly Mr Davis, who is in notably buoyant form, there is no one figure that the party could obviously rally around. For those younger politicians who might hope for the job in a few years' time, there is a cynical - but also strategically understandable - appeal in allowing her to stay on to soak up all the potentially difficult months of Brexit, before being able to appear as a change candidate. 3) Labour, while definitely riding high, are still divided on some issues, and not universally convinced that Jeremy Corbyn is the man for the job in the long term. United, and determined, they could make day-by-day life extremely difficult and uncomfortable for the Tories in Parliament. But it's not clear yet that they will be able to deliver that kind of sustained pressure, nor that they will be able to continue to build support. 4) On the hardest thing of all, Brexit, there have - whisper it - been some signs of compromise on both sides. For example, while the UK folded on its key demand for parallel talks over withdrawal and future relationship, the EU side did concede a phased approach - there is a rather optimistic but well-informed outline of signs of compromisehere,external. 5) Pretty much everyone (including the journalists!) who works in Westminster is exhausted after 12 months of turmoil. One of those knackered MPs suggested this week that last year, May ended up PM by being ""the only grown-up in the room"" left after the mess of the referendum. No-one else had the energy to fight - and, 12 months on, they suggested, while Mrs May is damaged, no-one wants - yet - to get on another rollercoaster with an unknown destination - at least until they have had a lie down.

Human chain in Florida sea saves family,"Eighty beachgoers linked hands at Panama City beach in Florida to rescue a family In a testament to the true human spirit, 80 beachgoers formed a human chain in Panama City Beach in Florida to help save a family pulled in to the water by strong tides. Roberta Ursey and her family were at the beach on Saturday when she heard her sons crying out for help. Luckily, Jessica Simmons and her husbandcame to the rescue,external, encouraging people to hold hands and reach out for those who were in difficulties. Ms Ursey's mother, who was among several others trapped in the rip current, suffered a heart attack and remains in hospital. Ms Simmons, who is from Alabama and said she was raised in a pool and a lake since she could crawl, posted on Facebook that there were heavy rains at the beach when the incident occurred. ""I can hold my breath underwater and go around a Olympic pool with ease! I knew I could get them to the human chain of people that wanted to help,"" she stated. Alongside her husband and the help of those forming the human chain, Ms Simmons shuttled people to safety on her bodyboard. ""To see people from different races and genders come into action to help total strangers is absolutely amazing! People who didn't even know each other went hand in hand in a line, into the water to try and reach them,"" she continued. Rosalind Beckton, 38, who is a regular visitor to the beach, was there at the time with her 12-year-old son andwitnessed,externalthe incident. She told the BBC that she administered CPR to a woman who looked to be in need and who later suffered a heart attack. ""I witnessed many brave citizens risking their safety and their lives to form this human chain. It was amazing and heart warming to see,"" she continued. Ms Beckton added that she didn't see any lifeguards on duty at the time. Ms Ursey, who was rescued from the water alongside her family,told,externalthe News Herald: ""I am so grateful...

Benzema breakthrough in sex tape case,"Since the case began neither Karim Benzema (R) nor Mathieu Valbuena (L) have played for France A French court has backed footballer Karim Benzema as he fights to have a blackmail case over a sex tape dropped. The Real Madrid forward was placed under formal investigation in 2015 over an alleged bid to blackmail fellow footballer Mathieu Valbuena. When he and another suspect argued the police had acted dishonestly, their case was rejected by the Appeal Court. Now another court has backed Karim Benzema's complaint. His lawyer says he expects the case to be thrown out. ""It's definitely a big victory,"" said lawyer Patrice Spinosi, who told France Info it was a turning point in the investigation. He said Tuesday's decision by France's highest judicial court - the Court of Cassation - meant that the case would return to the Court of Appeal's examining chamber, which would have no choice but to drop the inquiry. Sex, blackmail and French footballers Benzema 'not selected' for France At the heart of the case was the role of an undercover police officer. In 2015, a blackmailer got in touch with Mathieu Valbuena, threatening to make the sex tape public. The footballer was asked to appoint a go-between and at that point a police officer was given the task of negotiating on Mr Valbuena's behalf under the false name Lukas. Karim Benzema (R) helped Real Madrid to victory in the European Champions League last month Three suspects were linked to the blackmail attempt before one of them approached a childhood friend of Karim Benzema for help. Karim Benzema is then alleged to have discussed the sex tape with Mathieu Valbuena during a France team training session in October 2015. According to Mr Spinosi, the undercover officer had played a ""very active role"", pushing the two sides towards a deal. Without his involvement no offence would have taken place, he believes. Prosecutors argue that Karim Benzema urged his colleague to pay the blackmailers although he denies the allegation. Even if it is eventually thrown out, that could take months. The Court of Cassation has only ruled on the conduct of police during the investigation rather than on the allegations themselves, commentators say. That will be the task of the Court of Appeal. Another of Karim Benzema's lawyers, Sylvain Cormier, said ""we aren't forgetting the main battle is to prove his innocence"". Since the affair emerged in November 2015, neither footballer has played for their national team. Karim Benzema joined Real Madrid in 2009 and is seen as one of the club's leading players, helping them to Champions League victory last month in Cardiff. Mathieu Valbuena's Lyon team finished fourth in France's Ligue 1 last season and reached the semi-finals of the Europa League.

Lloyds ends fees for unplanned overdrafts,"Fees for unplanned overdrafts are to be scrapped for the 20 million customers of Lloyds Banking Group, which includes the Halifax and Bank of Scotland. From November this year, any customer going over their overdraft limit will face no fees at all, Lloyds said. However, the bank may continue to block payments from the account until the overdraft is paid off. It follows criticism of high charges by consumer groups and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is also expected to propose measures on overdraft fees within the next few weeks, as part ofits inquiryinto high-cost credit. Previously Lloyds customers taking out unauthorised overdrafts faced interest payments at an annual rate of 19.89%, a daily charge of up to Â£10, the monthly charge of Â£6, and up to Â£30 a day for returned (unpaid) items. These will all now be abolished. Fees for missed payments from basic bank accounts will also disappear. Lloyds said that it expected to make less money as a result of the changes, although it said fewer people now use an unauthorised facility than used to be the case. Barclays has already abolished unauthorised lending. Since June 2014, customers cannot exceed their overdraft limit, unless they obtain permission for emergency lending. Barclays customers cannot access unauthorised borrowing As well as scrapping charges for unplanned overdrafts, Lloyds is also simplifying fees for planned overdrafts, making it cheaper for many customers to borrow. Those with overdrafts of less than Â£500 are likely to pay less, while those borrowing more than Â£1000 are likely to see higher charges. Anyone who takes out an authorised overdraft with Lloyds Banking Group - in other words the bank has agreed to it - is currently charged a Â£6 monthly fee, on top of interest at 19.89% a year. While the Â£6 fee will be dropped, the interest charge will rise sharply, to 68.4% on an annual basis. Lloyds said that amounts to 1p a day for every Â£7 borrowed. As a result nine out of 10 customers will either be better off, or see no difference, it said. However, the changes will not make Lloyds the cheapest lender on the market. Andrew Hagger, personal finance expert with Moneycomms, said there were at least eight banks providing lower cost overdrafts. Tap on the image above, then pinch and zoom to enlarge The move by Lloyds to abolish unauthorised borrowing fees was welcomed by consumer groups. ""Lloyds' decision to do away with these fees is a positive step, and its proposed simpler pricing will benefit many of its customers,"" said Peter Vicary-Smith, Which? chief executive. ""However, not everyone will be better off, so it's critical that Lloyds supports customers to help them avoid high charges and to reduce their level of debt."" The FCA should encourage other banks to follow suit, he added. As part of its inquiry into current accounts, theCMA ruled last yearthat banks should introduce a maximum monthly charge - set by each bank - by the end of September 2017. Lloyds is due to introduce a maximum monthly charge of Â£95 for unauthorised overdrafts in August, although this will be superseded by the changes in November. RBS and NatWest will introduce a Â£80 maximum on 24 July. HSBC is to remove interest charges on most unarranged overdrafts, but will still charge a Â£5 daily fee, up to a maximum of Â£80 a month.

Premier League revenues at record Â£3.6bn,"Buoyant Uefa TV income helped Premier League clubs' revenues rise 9% to a record Â£3.6bn in the 2015-16 season, according to analysis from Deloitte. It says broadcast earnings of Â£1.9bn accounted for more than half of the top flight clubs' total revenues. A new domestic TV deal which kicked in last year means overall revenues continue to grow strongly, it added. For a third straight season, clubs' combined operating profits exceeded Â£500m, but wages rose 12% to Â£2.3bn. ""Even in the final year of its old broadcast contracts, Premier League revenues continued to set new records,"" said Dan Jones, partner in Deloitte's sports business group, which has unveiled its latest Annual Review of Football Finance. He said the broadcasting boost to revenues in 2015-16 was mainly down to European federation Uefa increasing its payments to Premier League clubs by Â£100m. Total European football market revenues reached 25bn euros (Â£22bn) in 2015-16, a 13% increase on 2014-15 The increase was driven by growth in broadcasting rights' values in Europe's biggest leagues, plus impact of Euro 2016 All ""big five"" leagues - England, Italy, Germany, Spain, France - saw revenues increase from the  previous season ""Big Five"" collective revenues rose 12% to a record 13.4bn euros Premier League clubs spent a record Â£1.3bn on transfers, surpassing the previous season's record by more than 20%. Source:  Deloitte Annual Review of Football Finance 2017 Mr Jones said Premier League clubs were now reaping the benefit of a new broadcast rights cycle which started in 2016-17, plus new commercial agreements, and match day revenue growth from new and expanded stadia. Deloitte says it now expects total Premier League clubs' revenues to be more than Â£4.5bn in 2017-18. A new broadcasting cycle is now in operation Meanwhile, Premier League net debt fell for the third consecutive season, by Â£125m (5%) to Â£2.2bn at the end of the 2015-16 season. However, while Premier League clubs returned to a collective pre-tax loss in 2015-16. Deloitte said this was the result of exceptional, or one-off, accounting adjustments, without which clubs collectively would have broken even. One example of these one-off adjustments was Chelsea making a big financial provision to cover the cost of the early cancellation of their kit deal with Adidas. ""We fully expect that Premier League clubs will collectively achieve record levels of profitability in the seasons to come,"" said Mr Jones. In the Championship, overall revenues increased to a new record level of Â£556m in 2015-16, and have risen by 74% in the past decade. But for the third time in four years, clubs spent more on wages (Â£561m) than they generated in revenue, resulting in a record operating loss of Â£261m. This follows two seasons where losses have been reduced. Clubs in the Championship stand to see their revenues jump by at least Â£170m from promotion to the Premier League, rising to over Â£290m if they survive one season. But Deloitte says there there is a danger that Championship clubs may continue to be tempted ""to spend excessively relative to their revenues, particularly on wages"". Former Chelsea captain John Terry has signed for Aston Villa on a reported Â£60,000 a week, plus further cash incentives should they win promotion Yet Deloitte points out that Huddersfield Town's promotion at the end of the 2016-17 season shows any Championship club can reach the Premier League, regardless of their budget. And they point out that in 2015-16 Huddersfield had the Championship's fourth-lowest wage costs. Including Football League clubs, the top 92 professional teams in England generated a record Â£4.4bn in revenue in 2015-16, Deloitte said. The 92 clubs contributed Â£1.6bn to UK government in taxes in 2015-16, up from Â£1.5bn the year before. In Scotland, despite Celtic's failure to qualify for the Uefa Champions League group stages for the second consecutive season, Scottish Premiership clubs' aggregate revenues grew 10% to 149m euros. Celtic continued to generate more than 50% of total revenues as they won the league for a fifth consecutive season, and Deloitte says ""their participation in the 2016-17 Uefa Champions League group stages will result in a substantial uplift in revenue"". Oscar (r) has been one of the Chinese Super League's biggest signings China's investment and influence in football has been growing in both domestic clubs' playing squads and infrastructure, and foreign club purchases and sponsorship. In their 2016-17 winter transfer window, Chinese Super League clubs spent more than Â£300m on players, including Oscar's transfer from Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG  and Odion Ighalo's move from Watford to Changchun Yatai. But Deloitte says some recent political moves could curtail this player spending boom. In January, the government body responsible for regulation of sport in China said that a cap on player salaries and transfer fees would be established to control ""irrational investment"". That month, the Chinese Football Association also implemented a stricter rule allowing only three foreign players to participate for a club in a super league fixture. This replaced the previous ""4 plus 1"" rule which allowed four foreigners plus one (non-Chinese) Asian player in a matchday squad. And in June 2017, the Chinese Football Association said clubs that were loss making and spent in excess of 45m yuan (c.Â£5m) on a foreign player must pay an amount equivalent to the excess into a national fund to develop young Chinese players.

Child killer sent 'last photo' to her ex,"Cody-Anne Jackson killed Macey and then tried to take her own life, the court heard A mother who sent a ""last photo"" of her two-year-old daughter to her ex-partner shortly before she killed her has admitted murder. Cody-Anne Jackson, 20, changed her plea to guilty after Stafford Crown Court heard evidence about how her daughter, Macey Hogan, may have died. Macey was smothered to death in 2016, shortly before Jackson called 999 and then tried to kill herself. The jury heard Jackson told paramedics she had been stabbed. Jackson resented Macey's father following the breakdown of their relationship and sent him a photo of the toddler along with the message ""Sorry, just thought you deserved one last picture and memory of her"", the trial heard. The 20-year-old, of Packett Street, Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, claimed she had woken up on 10 October 2016 to find her daughter lifeless next to her between two pillows, police said. Macey died at her home last October Jurors heard she called paramedics to report that her daughter was not breathing. More updates on this and other stories in Staffordshire Forensic pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar said the exact cause of Macey's death had not been defined. It was impossible to give an exact time of death, he said, but evidence pointed to it being at least 30 minutes before the emergency services arrived. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said a suicide note written by Jackson, who had a history of self harm, was found at the house. She was seen by a doctor who confirmed she had three superficial stab wounds but no significant injuries. ""The prosecution case is the defendant deliberately smothered Macey,"" he said, Toys and flowers were left outside the home in Packett Street ""The defendant acted on her stated intention to kill Macey but failed to follow through with her suicide. It is that simple."" Det Insp Dan Ison, of Staffordshire Police, said: ""We welcome this guilty plea, albeit during the trial, but nothing can ever replace Macey. ""This incident resulted in the dreadful loss of a two-year-old girl who is dearly missed."" Jackson will be sentenced on 27 July.

Laura Kuenssberg: 10 thoughts about the PM's position,"It wasn't meant to be called a ""relaunch"" or a ""fightback"" or even a ""reset"". The prime minister's speech this morning was, however, the first big speech she has made since the election. You might, therefore, have expected it to be bold, determined, as she said it would be. You might have expected it to be, at least in part, a genuine mea culpa from the PM for the mistakes of the election campaign. It was, however, more a rather pedestrian response to the long awaitedTaylor review,externalon the changing world of work and insecure employment (insert obvious jokes here) and a restatement of purpose than a dazzling rebrand. But whatever Theresa May had said this morning, as MPs stagger towards the finish line of this tumultuous year, and stumble towards the sun loungers, she is in trouble. And Tories will leave Westminster next week with the question of her future very much on their minds - the issue: how long can she survive? There are some fundamental obstacles to her doing so, but some advantages to her position too (honest). This list is not exhaustive, nor predictive, and may, as is the way of things these days, not age well at all. 1) Smack bang in the middle of her speech Theresa May said she is still convinced that her vision for the country is the right one, and she is completely committed to delivering it. The problem with that is that plenty of her MPs believe that the election result gave the country's verdict on that vision, and it wasn't pretty. They believe simply that she has to change, to show she can be flexible. How can she do that if she refuses to accept that some of her judgements were wrong? 2) The cabinet has big disagreements on a lot of things, most notably of course on Brexit, and since the election they have little compunction in giving their views. Remainer members like the chancellor have not held back from arguing for a more flexible position than the PM's negotiating position as outlined earlier in the year. But others are adamant she must stick. I'm told that in cabinet this morning the foreign secretary urged the PM to reaffirm that the government position remained theLancaster House speech,externaland that she did so, despite the fact others sitting round the table have been arguing for that approach to bend. 3) There are plenty of would-be rebels who believe they have the numbers on all sorts of issues to force the government to back down. First up could be membership of the European nuclear safety agency, Euratom. The rebels are very confident they have the numbers to get the prime minister to back down without even having to put an amendment down. One cabinet minister told me it would be a sensible move to show willing to compromise on an issue which doesn't raise much public concern, and would not raise too much suspicion of Brexit backsliding. Another source said it was simply now an issue for Number 10, with the Brexit Secretary David Davis understood to be ""relaxed"" about the issue. Theresa May might end up isolated with only her red lines for company. 4) Some Brexiteer Tory MPs are what's described by a minister as ""absolutist"" - ready to pounce on any sign of compromise from Theresa May as evidence that she is about to betray their cause. Simply, she is trapped by the parliamentary numbers that dictate she will have to compromise, and by some in her own party who would be ready to condemn any whiff of her doing so. 5) The Tory party particularly has little sympathy for leaders who look like they will damage all of their fortunes. You cannot find Tory MPs who say that she should lead them into the next election. It is a question of when not if. One former minister said she was finished (a much more delicate term than the ex-minister actually used) adding: ""We know it, and she knows it too."" And as they enter the summer, many believe it would only take one more big thing to go wrong for the plotters to seize their moment. 1) While Tory MPs agree that Theresa May can't stay on indefinitely, they pretty much all agree that they don't want to risk a general election right now. A few sources around the margins argue that a period of opposition is the only thing that will bring true reflection - but the overwhelming sense is that they need at least to stick together until the Autumn, for risking any leadership changes could slam them into another such contest. They worry that by plunging into another internal battle, they would push voters to choose Jeremy Corbyn for Number 10. 2) There is no obvious successor to her. If there was a universally popular and respected alternative leader the situation might feel extremely different. Despite the chatter about all sorts of people, particularly Mr Davis, who is in notably buoyant form, there is no one figure that the party could obviously rally around. For those younger politicians who might hope for the job in a few years' time, there is a cynical - but also strategically understandable - appeal in allowing her to stay on to soak up all the potentially difficult months of Brexit, before being able to appear as a change candidate. 3) Labour, while definitely riding high, are still divided on some issues, and not universally convinced that Jeremy Corbyn is the man for the job in the long term. United, and determined, they could make day-by-day life extremely difficult and uncomfortable for the Tories in Parliament. But it's not clear yet that they will be able to deliver that kind of sustained pressure, nor that they will be able to continue to build support. 4) On the hardest thing of all, Brexit, there have - whisper it - been some signs of compromise on both sides. For example, while the UK folded on its key demand for parallel talks over withdrawal and future relationship, the EU side did concede a phased approach - there is a rather optimistic but well-informed outline of signs of compromisehere,external. 5) Pretty much everyone (including the journalists!) who works in Westminster is exhausted after 12 months of turmoil. One of those knackered MPs suggested this week that last year, May ended up PM by being ""the only grown-up in the room"" left after the mess of the referendum. No-one else had the energy to fight - and, 12 months on, they suggested, while Mrs May is damaged, no-one wants - yet - to get on another rollercoaster with an unknown destination - at least until they have had a lie down.

Spanish royals' UK visit glosses over Brexit cracks,"Felipe's coronation took place on 19 June 2014 The UK is rolling out the red carpet for King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain, sprinkling pomp and glamour over some deep-rooted tensions. Brexit and the centuries-old dispute over Gibraltar might suggest that UK-Spanish relations are between a Rock and a hard place. But the 12-14 July state visit could send a sunburst through those clouds. The royal couple were due to arrive in London on Tuesday. Both royal lines are descended from Queen Victoria - something to celebrate, in tough times for both countries. This visit is nothing if not a survivor, having been called off - once in 2016, when Spain endured 10 months of political crisis without a government, and again this year, when UK Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap election in June. ""These have been times of great difficulty on both sides, with the double cancellation telling its own story,"" says Ana Romero, a leading Spanish journalist and royal observer. She wrote a book - Final de Partida (End Game) - about the strained personal circumstances surrounding the abdication of King Felipe's father, Juan Carlos. Ms Romero says King Felipe's reign has been three years of ""permanent difficulty"", including a fraud trial in which his sister, Princess Cristina, was eventually acquitted, while her husband IÃ±aki Urdangarin was sentenced to six years in jail. Almost as damaging were supportive text messages Queen Letizia reportedly sent to a suspect in another corruption case. Spanish princess cleared in tax trial What's the Gibraltar Brexit row about? Brexit: All you need to know Will Brexit make sherry trade less sweet? ""Now after three years of hard climbing, it is as if Felipe and Letizia have reached the bright summit, because the British monarchy represents the height of royal protocol,"" Ms Romero says, before adding that both countries face great problems. Spain is still emerging from an economic crisis that has seen confidence in institutions plummet due to corruption scandals. British politics entered a turbulent period with last year's referendum vote to leave the EU. Brexit remains shrouded in uncertainty. Many of Spain's leading companies have made bold moves into Britain, including Santander bank and Ferrovial, an infrastructure group that owns Heathrow's operating company, among other UK concerns. Brexit is also a worry for the many citizens living in each other's country and for those with investments at stake. The almost 300,000 British citizens registered as residents in Spain, and many more who come and go, are concerned about their healthcare and pensions, says Anne Hernandez, leader of Brexpats in Spain, a group with more than 4,000 members. While British diplomatic sources say they consider Spain an ally in negotiating relatively benign terms for Brexit, they also admit they are concerned about Madrid's insistence on re-examining the status of Gibraltar - an already delicate equation. This is especially the case after the European Council included a clausein its guidelines for talks,external, stating that no agreement on the EU's future relationship with the UK would apply to Gibraltar without the consent of Spain, giving Madrid a potential veto. All eyes will be on King Felipe when he speaks to UK parliamentarians on Wednesday, to see if he emulates his father Juan Carlos. As king back in 1986 Juan Carlos raised Spain's claim over the Rock when addressing MPs and Lords, on the last Spanish state visit to the UK. Gibraltar's status is a hot topic again because of Brexit The signs are that Felipe is prepared to broach the issue as he did before the UN General Assembly last autumn. Describing Gibraltar as the last colony in Europe, Spain's king invited the UK to ""put an end to this anachronism"". King Felipe, who will also have a private meeting with Prime Minister May, is considered a consummate diplomat, having been patiently groomed for the job by representing Spain in Latin America and elsewhere for almost two decades before his coronation. He also proved in 2004 that he was his own man by marrying the TV journalist Letizia Ortiz, a commoner and divorcee. For the first time Prince Harry, 32, will have an important ceremonial role, escorting Felipe and Letizia to Westminster Abbey. He will also attend a grand state banquet, after the Queen has welcomed her Spanish guests to Buckingham Palace on Wednesday. Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks?

"Taylor Review: No cash, no problem?","The author of a government report on work practices has criticised the ""cash-in-hand economy"". Matthew Taylor said cash jobs wereoften untaxed and worth up to Â£6bna year. Mr Taylor said he hoped transaction platforms such as PayPal and WorldPay would see cash-in-hand work eased out of favour. The BBC spoke to a selection of workers and employers to find out if cash was still king for them. Debbie Took has been teaching or tutoring Maths for 25 years. She sees about 30 students a week from her home in Reading. ""I'm a private tutor and parents pay me by cash or cheque,"" she says. ""I declare all earnings and a cheque is as welcome as cash, whatever is easiest for the parent. ""I've had parents pay by bank transfer or internet banking in the past and some forget to pay me. ""Many of my students come in without their parents. Payment by phone would need the parent to be present. ""Cheques are easy. I have one in my hand at the time of tutoring and know instantly that I have been paid."" Julian Thorpe, from Bradford, runs a plumbing and heating business. He says the onus should not just be on workers, but also on customers seeking a bargain. ""People ask if it is any cheaper for cash,"" he says. ""We then get undercut by people who say they will do it for cash. ""It makes no difference to me what I'm paid in. It all has to go in the bank. ""There are many people who work their day jobs and then do these jobs for a bit of extra money - using their firm's van, tools and materials and getting paid in cash. ""For me it's a moral thing to pay tax. It funds the NHS, social care and everything else. ""People don't see that sometimes. They have got mortgages to pay and mouths to feed."" Sam Welbourne, from Glastonbury, has worked in the gig economy since his software business collapsed after the2008 financial crisis,external. He believes concerns about cash-in-hand work shows government is focusing on the wrong people. ""I have worked a great deal in the gig economy and never managed to raise enough tax. ""If this is made harder because of ideas about paying tax it makes my poverty worse. ""I declare everything and keep honest accounts. I feel sick that the government wants to paint me as the bad guy. ""I know loads of people who work freelance in one way or another. ""Where I am in Somerset there are people sleeping in sheds and back gardens trying to make ends meet wherever they can. There is no security from month to month."" Louie Birch, from Suffolk, runs a window-cleaning business and does not pay his two employees in cash. ""I was disappointed the first thing you hear about is window cleaners,"" he said. ""We're trying to make the trade more professional. All of my clients are offered the opportunity to use direct debit. ""If they're set up with our details we leave a receipt through the door when we clean and they can then transfer the payment into the business account. ""It makes the business run more effectively.

Coffee drinkers live longer - perhaps,"Drinking three cups of coffee a day may help you live longer, according to a study of almost half a million people from 10 European countries. The research, published in the journal the Annals of Internal Medicine, suggests an extra cup of coffee could lengthen a person's lifespan - even if it is decaffeinated. But sceptical experts point out it is impossible to say for sure that it is the coffee that is having a protective effect, rather than say, a more healthy lifestyle in coffee drinkers. They say there is no need to reach for that extra cup of coffee just yet. Researchers from the International Agency for Research on Cancer and Imperial College London say they have found that drinking more coffee is linked to a lower risk of death - particularly for heart diseases and diseases of the gut. They came to their conclusions after analysing data of healthy people over the age of 35 from 10 EU countries. They asked them once at the beginning of the study how much coffee they tended to drink and then looked at deaths over an average of 16 years. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, from the University of Cambridge, analyses the public understanding of risk and says that if the estimated reductions in death really were down to coffee, then an extra cup of coffee every day would extend the life of a man by around three months and a woman by around a month on average. But despite the sheer scale of the study, it is by no means perfect and cannot prove that coffee beans are the magic ingredient. Frustratingly for coffee fiends, the findings really are not as clear-cut as they might first seem. That's because the study could not take every factor into account - clouding how certain one can be about coffee's effects. For example, it did not look at how much coffee drinkers earned in comparison with non-coffee drinkers. It might be that people who can afford three cups of coffee a day are richer and that extra money, in some way, helps protect their health. It might be that people who drank three cups of coffee a day spent more time socialising and that in turn may have boosted their wellbeing. And even if they were to be certain it was the coffee that was responsible, not every risk improved. The researchers found higher coffee-drinking was linked to a higher rate of ovarian cancer in women, for example. And although the paper looked at a lot of people, the researchers excluded anyone who had diabetes, heart attacks or strokes at the beginning of the study. So it doesn't tell us much about the risks or benefits of drinking coffee if people are unwell. It is also possible some of those people became unwell while having their regular brews. Previous studies have shown conflicting and often contradictory results. For many people, experience suggests that drinks containing caffeine can temporarily make us feel more alert. But caffeine affects some people more than others, and the effects can vary from person to person. NHS experts have not set limits for coffee in the general population but they do say that pregnant women should avoid drinking more than 200mg of caffeine a day. They say this is because coffee might increase the chance of the baby being born too small. Too much caffeine may also increase the risk of miscarriage. And, of course, caffeine is not just found in coffee. The 200mg caffeine limit could be reached by having two mugs of tea and a can of cola, for example, or two cups of instant coffee. There was also recentlythe case of a US teenwho, it's thought, may have died from drinking too many caffeinated drinks too quickly. The most rigorous scientific way to be certain that coffee could make you live longer would be to force thousands of people all over the world to drink it regularly while preventing many thousands of otherwise similar people from ever drinking coffee. Scientists would then have to monitor every other aspect of their life - what else they ate and drank, how much they earned, how much exercise they did, for example. That's a study that is never likely to take place. So for now, some experts say, instead of putting all your bets on coffee being good for you, you could instead do something that has been proven to extend life -  take  a brisk, 20-minute walk to the nearest coffee shop - whether you order a cup or not.

Italian tourist treasure turned into ghost town by earthquake,"From a distance Castelluccio looks the same as it has done for 1,000 years, a beautiful hilltop town in the midst of one of Italy's most celebrated plains, the Piano Grande. But even from the road below the village you can see the buildings are shattered, roofs collapsed, more reminiscent of a war zone than the Umbrian countryside. Nearly a year on from the earthquakes which devastated this region of central Italy, visitors have just been allowed back into the so-called ""zona rossa"" near Castellucio, although not the village itself. The red zone marks areas still regarded as too dangerous to visit but an exception was made for people to see ""La Fioritura"". This is a spectacular showing of wild flowers in the meadows of the Piano Grande. We joined a convoy of around 40 cars to be taken through army road blocks high up into the Sibillini mountains. Cornflowers and poppies colour the 16 sq km plain surrounded by the Sibillini mountains Village after village showed the impact of the earthquakes that hit this region, first in August 2016 and then again in October. Why so many houses collapsed Italy quake: Those who lost their lives Why multiple quakes are hitting Italy Italy reels after fourth quake in months These villages look as if the earthquake had just happened, instead of nearly a year ago. Most of the people who lived there have been moved to hotels on the coast. We left our cars on top of a high ridge and trekked for two hours down on to the plain, overlooked by the jagged peak of Monte Vettore, which marks the boundary between Umbria and Le Marche. A deep, black crack could be seen high up on the mountainside which had appeared after the earthquake. The crack on the mountain, the lower of two lines, is up to a metre wide As we came down on to the plain, extraordinary splashes of colour came into view, reminiscent of an Impressionist canvas. Meadows were tinted red with swathes of poppies, others bright blue with cornflowers. Normally there would be 10,000 visitors a day to photograph the splendours of the Fioritura, we were told. This year it is in the hundreds. There are more beehives than people in the fields. The Piano Grande's fields are unusually deserted this year The 16 sq km (6 sq miles) Piano Grande - literally the big plain - was once a glacier lake and is surrounded by mountains. It is here that the farmers of Castelluccio plant their lentils, a crop that has become famous amongst foodies around the world. This year they were only allowed in by convoy to prepare for the season ahead. No-one is allowed up into this ghost village at 1,452m (4,760 ft). Below what has been his home for generations, Lorenzo Caponecchi is selling lentils and wild peas in a stall by the side of the road. I wondered why it was taking time for rebuilding to begin. Was it because these were such old buildings or was it a question of money? Lorenzo and Monia run a stall in the shadow of Castelluccio No, said his partner Monia Falzetti angrily. ""It's the state and the politicians. There is plenty of money from the EU but we aren't seeing any of it."" Other former inhabitants of Castelluccio are so angry at the lack of help that they believe visitors should not be allowed into the Piano Grande. It is the tourism of rubble, they proclaim. Rubble tourism? The remains of homes in the village of Trisungo But the local mayor told La Repubblica that the flowers of the Piano Grande do not just belong to the people of Castelluccio. They are the world's heritage and, besides, more tourism will help the local economy. Side by side in this unique valley, you can see the sublime beauty of nature at its most spectacular but also the forces of nature at its most destructive. In a few moments here houses that existed for hundreds of years were torn down and reverted to stones.

The anti-immigration party trying to recruit immigrants,"Although their manifesto calls for a near-total halt to immigration, the far-right political party Britain First is now actively trying to appeal to Polish immigrants. They are a fringe group, with no elected officials at any level, but Britain First has about 1.9 million Facebook likes - more than any other UK political party. And now they're trying to use that social media footprint to make explicit appeals to Polish immigrants living in the UK. A string of Britain First videos that seem designed to attract a Polish audience have appeared online. Recent ones include a video from Jacek Miedlar, a Polish far-right former priest, an interview with a Polish media outlet that has over half a million views, and videos by Polish Britain First supporters encouraging others to support the party. Miedlar, who has over 25,000 subscribers on YouTube, is an activist known for his anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic views. He has tried to travel to the UK twice this year to attend Britain First rallies but was stopped by UK authorities. The videos have been posted despite Britain First's anti-immigration manifesto which calls for cash payments to foreigners to leave the UK, a complete halt to immigration except for people who marry British citizens, and a call to make it ""an act of treason to implement any policy or measure, or sign any agreement, that facilitates and/or results in significant numbers of foreigners entering the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom with the aim of settling."" WATCH:#BBCtrending: The rise of Britain First online WATCH:BBC Three: We Want Our Country Back LISTEN:on BBC Trending radio Visit BBC Trending onFacebook,external Despite the party's hard line on immigration, Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen told BBC Trending that post-Brexit, all European immigrants who are already in the UK should be allowed to stay, as long as they aren't criminals or Muslims. The party also supports a total ban on Islam in the UK, a policy they believe will attract some support from Polish migrants. Poles form thelargest immigrant communityin Britain. There were an estimated 831,000 Polish-born residents in 2015 - a jump of almost 750,000 compared with the number in 2004, the year Poland joined the European Union. Rafal Pankowski from the Polish anti-hate charity Never Again says the party's attempts to appeal to UK-based Polish people may have something to do with what he perceives to be a trend towards the far-right in Polish society. ""We have been witnessing a rise in far-right activity in Poland itself as well,"" he says. ""And unfortunately the Polish people in the UK have been victims of discrimination and hate crime especially since the Brexit referendum. And some of them have been turning to Polish far-right nationalist groups for a sense of belonging."" A number of videos have appeared on the Britain First Youtube channel seemingly aimed at the UK's Polish population Wiktor Moszczynski, a former spokesperson for the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, agrees that there has been a spike of far-right activity amongst Polish people living in the UK, but says that such activity has recently died down. ""At the moment the trend tends to be towards the right in Polish society, both in Poland and to some extent here in the UK, but when I say right that doesn't necessarily mean radical right,"" Moszczynski tells BBC Trending radio. ""Suddenly these groups began turning up in demonstrations in the UK over the last two or three years generally wearing Polish fascist symbols, but what I do have to say is I have not seen anything of this in the last year,"" he says. ""I have been spoken to by the police who are very concerned about these groups, so we do know that there may still be an undercurrent. But at the moment the problem seems to have been in remission, temporarily at least."" He says a majority of the younger Polish community are resistant to the influence of far-right groups, including Britain First, but nevertheless the far-right spike is ""not pleasant, particularly at a time when we're trying to build up sympathy for the Poles living in this country on the way they've been treated after the Brexit vote."" A recentreport,externalfrom the campaigning group Hope Not Hate said the largest and most organised neo-Nazi group in the UK is the National Rebirth of Poland. The presence of groups like these, Hope Not Hate says, has fuelled extreme far-right activists. Britain First rarely runs candidates. When they do they receive a small amount of the vote, such as the 1.2% of the vote party leader Paul Golding attracted in the 2016 London mayoral election. Its outsized social media following is due to a combination of factors includingpaid advertising,external, acore group of dedicated followers,external, and the use of less controversial posts - for instance messages encouraging people to support the troops or the royal family - and other tactics to drive up the numbers of likes. The group's Facebook page has also become something of an international hub people attracted to its anti-Islam message. According to an analysis by Trending, less than half (44%) of the group's Facebook likes come from accounts based inside the UK, with large numbers of likes coming from the US, Australia and Canada. Around 23,000 of the page's likes come from Polish accounts. By way of comparison, 87% of the Labour Party's 1 million likes come from UK accounts. The figure for the Conservative Party (more than 600,000 likes) is 78%. Fransen claims the party has a ""growing number"" of Polish members and supporters, but refused to provide membership figures. She says the party's low appeal at the ballot box can be explained by the fact that the group has been concentrating on direct action, including turning up at the homes and offices of elected officials. Former Polish wrestling champion Marian Lukasik (left) called for the assassination of Angela Merkel over her country's refugee policy Pankowski believes the membership figures are very small, yet says his organisation saw via social media a number of Polish flags and Polish people at a Britain First rally in Birmingham last month. In one video from the event, a UK-based Polish former wrestling champion Marian Lukasik, can be heard advocating the assassination of German Chancellor Angela Merkel because of her country's refugee policy. Lukasik has recently made other videos in support of Britain First. ""Britain First decided to attract support among the Polish community in the UK against Muslims, and a small section of the Polish community in the UK is probably prone to such messages,"" Pankowski says. ""But obviously it's ironic because Polish migrants and Muslim migrants in the UK actually have a lot in common in terms of the everyday challenges they face.""

Halloween 'Mad Max' bike gang jailed,"This video can not be played Bikers who took part in a ""ride-out"" in Leeds which caused chaos are jailed The gang behind a Halloween ""ride-out"" in Leeds which was likened to scenes from the film Mad Max has been jailed. More than 100 bikers congregated in Kirkstall Road before riding into the city, disrupting traffic and driving through pedestrianised areas. David Armitage did not take part in the event but had organised it through social media, Leeds Crown Court heard. Also jailed were 12 other defendants, who had all admitted causing a public nuisance at an earlier hearing. The judge said their actions on 31 October could ""not be tolerated"". Read more about this and other stories from across Yorkshire More than 100 bikers caused chaos on the streets during the Halloween ""ride-out"" Armitage, 26, of Brookfield Road, Headingley, had been filmed on 31 October telling riders to ""shut down"" the city centre. Jailing him for two years, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: ""This is a case which calls for a deterrent sentence. ""Behaviour of this sort, having serious effects on this city, cannot be tolerated."" David Armitage had organised the event through social media West Yorkshire Police received around 160 calls from members of the public, some of whom had likened it to scenes from the Mel Gibson film, Mad Max. Ch Supt Paul Money said: ""The behaviour of these individuals and others that night put people's safety at risk, caused unnecessary fear to the public and created an image of lawlessness in the heart of the city that we simply could not allow to go unchallenged."" Following the incident, Leeds City Council secured an injunction banning people from anti-social driving of vehicles, including motorbikes and quad bikes, in any public place where it involves two or more vehicles.

Johnson to EU: 'Go whistle' over exit bill,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson's message to the EU: ""Go whistle seems to me to be an entirely appropriate expression"" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has told MPs the European Union can ""go whistle"" for any ""extortionate"" final payment from the UK on Brexit. And he said that the government had ""no plan"" for what to do in the event of no deal being agreed with the EU. He said: ""The sums I have seen that they propose to demand from this country appear to be extortionate."" ""Go whistle seems to me to be an entirely appropriate expression,"" he added. The foreign secretary was responding to a question from backbench MP Philip Hollobone, who urged him to tell the EU they could ""go whistle"" if they wanted ""a penny piece more"" than the money the UK had already paid to the EU since 1973. Reality Check: Will the UK pay a multibillion pound divorce bill? All you need to know about Brexit The question of any ""divorce bill"" paid by the UK is one of the first subjects to be tackled in the Brexit talks, and EU leaders say it must be settled before a future trading relationship can be negotiated. Reports have suggested the demand from Brussels could be as high as 100bn euros. The UK government has said it will not pay this amount but will settle its ""obligations"" as it leaves. Taking questions in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson also denied reports Chancellor Philip Hammond and First Secretary of State Damian Green had said there will be a transition period of at least three years after Brexit, when the UK will remain under the jurisdiction of the Europe Court of Justice. And he was asked if there was a strategy, either public or private, for what would happen if there was no agreement on Brexit. ""There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal,"" he replied. His comments come after No 10 sources played down suggestions that Theresa May plans to walk out of Brexit talks in September to show defiance over EU demands for a divorce bill worth tens of billions of pounds. Mrs May has said that her view going into the Brexit negotiations was that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". Mr Johnson's comments seem to be at odds with Brexit Secretary David Davis, who told the BBC last month that the government had ""worked up in detail"" the ""no deal"" option on Brexit. Asked about the foreign secretary's remarks, the prime minister's spokeswoman said: ""We have said it is right to plan for all eventualities, and that planning is taking place across government."" Liberal Democrat Brexit Spokesperson Tom Brake said the foreign secretary's remarks showed a ""shocking level of complacency"". ""It is simply not good enough when people's jobs, living standards and rights are all on the line,"" he said. ""People should be able to judge Boris Johnson on his actions not his words, with the chance to reject a disastrous Brexit deal and stay in the EU."" Labour MP Chris Bryant added: ""For the government to threaten to leave the EU with no deal, while boasting about not having a plan for that eventuality, is completely unacceptable."" Mr Davis was asked during a House of Lords committee hearing about Mr Johnson's ""go whistle"" remark. In response he laughed and said: ""Bluntly, I wouldn't worry, I mean you'll have to get the foreign secretary here to explain his views if you really want him to, I'm not going to comment on other ministers.""

Three days that shook America,"In a single week last summer, the deaths of two black men and then five police officers in a series of shootings across three US states left some wondering where the country was heading. One year on, what's changed? Last week, on 5 July, Sandra Sterling lay awake in her bed nearly the entire night. ""At 1:30 this morning, you'll never know what I went through,"" she said later. Before the sun rose on 6 July, Diamond Reynolds also could not sleep. ""The first thing I did was think, 'Phil's not here,'"" she said. ""Last year we was waking up together around this time."" And in the wee hours of 7 July, Abigail Irizarry, a dispatcher for the Dallas Police Department, was also struggling. ""I woke up early and it was kind of hard seeing everything on the news all over again,"" she said. ""The footage of what happened."" This video can not be played 'The nation is at tipping point' One year ago, in rapid succession, a series of incidents shook three American cities over the course of three days: On 5 July, 37-year-old Alton Sterling was shot six times while pinned to the ground by two Baton Rouge police officers. Cell phone video capturing the struggle and the moment the officers shot him at close range was viewed by millions. On 6 July, 32-year-old Philando Castile was shot seven times by a St Anthony Police Department officer during a traffic stop, while his girlfriend Diamond Reynolds and her four-year-old daughter watched. Reynolds livestreamed the immediate aftermath, as bloodstains blossomed across the dying man's T-shirt and the officer screamed at her through the window. On 7 July, a former army reservist arrived at the tail end of a peaceful demonstration in downtown Dallas - part of a nationwide day of protest over the deaths of Castile and Sterling - and started shooting police officers with a Saiga AK-47. Five were killed, and seven other officers were wounded in the deadliest attack on US law enforcement since 9/11. After the three events splintered apart into their own individual investigations, memorials, trials, and controversies, it became difficult to remember that they occurred back to back, on a week when it felt as if the nation was on the brink of a race war. But last week, they were pulled back together as the friends, families and survivors central to each incident dutifully marked the anniversaries, one after the other. Though they did so in vastly different ways, with at times diametrically opposed messages, the three communities were all in mourning. They shared those sleepless nights. Former Dallas police chief David O Brown ""As much as we politicise and advocate our position when these tragedies happen, the grief of the family of an officer and the grief of the family of a person killed by an officer is the same grief,"" said David O Brown, who was the chief of the Dallas police on the night of the ambush. ""These funerals - they're all the same,"" he said. ""These families hurt in the same ways."" While the race war never arrived, a new presidential administration did, one with a very different view on the federal government's role in police-involved killings and law enforcement reform in general. President Donald Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions, believes that consent decrees - agreements between local police departments and the Department of Justice on a set of reforms that often occur after a high profile incident - can ""lower police morale"" and actually increase crime. Sessions has ordered all current consent decrees to be ""reviewed"". Fourteen police or sheriff's departments currently have such decrees, including Ferguson, Missouri, and many others were in the works in cities like Baltimore and Chicago. Politics aside, the consequences of these incidents continue to pulse through the nation as a whole, affecting not just the families of the deceased, but those on the periphery as well. Abdullah Muflahi behind the counter at Triple S Food Mart in Baton Rouge, Louisiana On the sweltering Baton Rouge afternoon of 5 July, Abdullah Muflahi smoked a cigarette outside of his store, Triple S Convenience, and watched a video on his cell phone. It was not the one he recorded a year ago, of the death of his friend Alton Sterling, who died just feet from where Muflahi was sitting. It was one from that morning, when a group of protesters from the New Black Panther Party clashed with Baton Rouge police officers at their headquarters a few miles away. The video, taken by a local news crew,showed the group,externalof about 30 demonstrators try to walk through an opening in barricades surrounding the police headquarters when a brawl broke out with the officers blocking the way. The officers deployed their Tasers - they alleged later that one of the Black Panthers also had a Taser - one shot a PepperBall gun at the demonstrators, and seven protesters were arrested. Two of Sterling's aunts are seen on the tape being dragged to the back of the protest screaming and crying. ""Nothing has changed,"" said Muflahi. ""It's very depressing."" Just a week earlier, US Department of Justice officials declined to charge the two officers who shot Sterling with civil rights violations. Louisiana state officials have yet to announce whether they will pursue their own indictment. No charges for US police over Alton Sterling killing Why do US police keep killing black men? 'Legendary' image of US protests emerges Muflahi, a laconic, bearded 28-year-old Yemeni immigrant, allowed Sterling to sell bootleg CDs on a table outside his shop in a busy but economically depressed part of Baton Rouge. They'd sit outside on days just like this one and talk over cigarettes. One year ago, Muflahi noticed the flashing lights of police vehicles pull up outside the store. Someone called to say Sterling had threatened them with a gun. By the time Muflahi pulled out his cell phone and started recording one of two videos that went viral of the incident, Sterling was already on his back with two officers on top of him. Within seconds, one officer yelled, ""Gun!"" and that's when the shooting started. The video footage shows Sterling's eyes go wide, blood pooling on his chest. ""It's not as easy as just seeing it on the tape or the screen,"" said Muflahi. ""Seeing it in front of you, somebody that you know, you knew for a while, it takes a big effect on your whole life."" Since the incident Muflahi has started seeing a psychiatrist. He said he has trouble sleeping, and when he does sleep, he finds it impossible to get up in the morning. ""My doctor's been trying to give me something to help me out,"" he said. ""He said it was all because of depression."" Arthur ""Silky Slim"" Reed sits in the back of his ""hearse ambulance"" Standing next to Muflahi was Arthur ""Silky Slim"" Reed, a former gang leader turned activist. Reed runs an organisation called ""Stop the Killing"" whose members listen to police scanners and race to the scene of every homicide in Baton Rouge. This is how Reed got his hands on the second tape of Sterling's death, which he turned over to the press, not trusting the local police to make it public. ""They have put new policies in place for policing,"" Reed conceded. ""But even when you break the policy there's no [accountability]. So it's the same old thing and it's not just Baton Rouge, it's all over America."" This video can not be played The story behind this photo at Baton Rouge protests Reed's vehicle sat in the Triple S car park - an ambulance painted black blasting ""Tha Crossroads"" on a loop. Inside was a bench seat facing a television screen, which played footage of the aftermath of real homicides in Baton Rouge that Reed and his associates filmed, in the hope that showing the extremely graphic tapes to the friends and family of the dead will motivate them to change their lives. The screen that afternoon showed a young man in a white tank top lying in the street. When the police lifted him by his arms, his head pitched lifelessly to one side, blood pouring out of his nose and mouth. ""So many people like to try to throw this cliche on us like, 'Oh, how come they don't worry about when they killing each other?' We do,"" said Reed. ""We show this."" Sandra Sterling at the Triple S Food Market Not long afterwards, Sandra Sterling - the aunt who raised Alton from the age of 10 when his mother died - walked into the Triple S. She looked exhausted, her voice hoarse from screaming. ""I don't have no strength left,"" she said. Sandra said she did her best to raise her sister's children, but Alton and his siblings were often in trouble, sometimes locked up. During his last stint in prison, Sandra said, Alton's brother died of a drug overdose. When she went to pick Alton up after his release, he insisted she take him straight to his brother's gravesite. ""Later on they buried [Alton] exactly where he was standing,"" she said. As dusk approached, a group of about 60 activists and community members gathered in the parking lot of the Triple S. It was an informal gathering, light-up placards spelled out the words ""JUSTICE FOR ALTON STERLING"". A few activists spoke, several state and city officials milled about, but there were no celebrities or crowds like the hundreds that had descended on the food mart a year ago. Sandra Sterling grew incensed. ""Why nobody out here?"" she cried, her voice breaking. ""This street was flooded with people. Y'all make me think that y'all forgot about Alton. How could you forget?"" Despite the chants of ""justice for Alton Sterling"", despite the activist who turned to her and promised in a soaring voice that the two police officers would certainly be indicted, Sandra was not optimistic. ""After the Philando Castile murderer got off, I don't feel a lot of hope,"" she said. Unlike the Sterling family, which is still waiting to find out if Louisiana authorities will indict the two officers involved in Alton's death, the friends and family of Philando Castile have their answer. On 17 June, a jury acquitted Officer Jeronimo Yanez on all counts in Castile's death. On the 6th of July, Diamond Reynolds woke up early, around the time that her boyfriend Castile used to wake up to get ready for his job as a cafeteria supervisor at an elementary school in St Paul, just a few blocks from where he lived as a boy. Waking up alone, Reynolds said she felt sluggish and weak. ""It's just gonna be a hard day,"" she said. Shot US man's partner seeks law change The view from Philando Castile's empty seat on the porch Diamond Reynolds holds her daughter Dae'Anna as she addresses a crowd the day after Castile's death in 2016 Reynolds doesn't have a lot of time for outrage over the court decision. She has to be out of the apartment she and her five-year-old Dae'Anna are currently living in by the end of the month, and since she can't find work, coming up with the money for a new place is proving impossible. ""No one will hire her,"" said her mother, Dafina Doty. ""We're really, really, really having a hard time right now."" Still, Reynolds got up, and loaded Dae'Anna into the car to go do last-minute shopping for an event she was hosting later that afternoon to mark the year anniversary of Castile's death, titled ""Black Love: A Remembrance Celebration"". This video can not be played 'I don't want you to get shooted': Inside police car after Castile shooting At about the same time that Reynolds was heading for the store, a press conference was starting at the Minnesota State Capitol in downtown St Paul. Rather than feeling forgotten in a dusty parking lot like Sandra Sterling had the day before, Castile's uncle Clarence found himself standing beside Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, who announced the appointment of Clarence to the state's Peace Officer Standards and Training board. ""I can be angry at the system because they let Yanez off the hook. I can be angry at that. But I can also feel empowered because I've been appointed to this board,"" he said later. ""For me, that's power."" Governor Dayton also announced a $12m infusion of money into the board, in a fund named after Philando. This video can not be played Mark Dayton, Minnesota Governor: ""Would this have happened if he was white?"" ""We need this extra training for our police officers,"" Valerie Castile, Philando's mother, told reporters. ""Because at the end of the day, everyone wants to go home. The police wants to go home, and the civilian wants to go home."" The Castiles hosted a memorial dinner at an idyllic farm for about 250 friends and family later that day - no media allowed - just to the west of where Philando was killed. Reynolds held her separate event in a lakeside park to the east of the site. Notably, Castile's name and image were absent from the flier for Reynolds' event. This was in accordance with Castile's mother's wishes, which Reynolds agreed to but was still bothered by. ""The fact that my child wasn't his child and we weren't married doesn't discredit the love that we had for each other,"" she said. ""Doesn't mean we weren't a family."" Diamond Reynolds and a friend observe the anniversary of Castile's death at a park in St Paul, Minnesota At both events, attendees ate and danced, listened to live music. The atmosphere was relaxed, the surroundings were lush. Dae'Anna played with her therapy dog, Chedda - Philando's nickname. Reynolds called it the ""closure"" that she and her daughter had been craving for the last year. Still, in the back of Reynolds' mind there are many pressing worries. She rattled off a list of the kinds of jobs she's applied for over the last year: administrative work, customer service, childcare provider, nurse's aid. ""People notice who I am and they don't want to work with me,"" she said. Then there's Dae'Anna. Reynolds needs to find a new home in time to enrol her for her first day of elementary school. The five year old is thriving in some ways - already reading chapter books and excited to start the first grade - but she also gets picked on by other kids who needle her about Castile. She's receiving therapy, but still ducks down in her car seat at the sound of sirens. ""She thinks any police officer [could hurt her],"" said Reynolds. ""Even when I tell her all police officers aren't bad, she's still going to be scared of them."" Shetamia Taylor in her family's home Shetamia Taylor remembers the face of the burly, bald officer who turned as he was being shot and called out to her as she and her four sons were leaving what had been a peaceful protest in downtown Dallas. ""He's got a gun,"" the officer yelled. ""Get down!"" Taylor and her sons turned to run, but before she could, a bullet ripped through her leg with a red-hot stinging sensation, shattering her tibia bone. She grabbed on to her second oldest son and tumbled to the ground, covering him with her body. A group of officers formed a protective circle around Taylor, including the one who'd first warned her. Later on she learned his name: Dallas police officer Lorne Ahrens. He would not survive. ""He was one of the five,"" she recalls. ""I am so thankful to god that he spared us, but I'm so saddened that these men, these husbands, these fathers didn't."" This video can not be played People in Dallas started running when they hear dozens of gun shots On 7 July 2017, the city of Dallas commemorated the deaths of Officer Ahrens, Officer Patrick Zamarripa, Officer Michael Krol, Sergeant Michael Smith, and Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer Brent Thompson. All five were killed in an ambush by Micah Xavier Johnson, who reportedly told police negotiators he wanted to kill white officers in retaliation for the deaths of black men and women at the hands of police. Johnson was killed after an hours-long standoff by an explosion set off by the Dallas police. Dallas police shootings: What we know so far Who were victims of the Dallas shooting? In pictures: Dallas police shootings One year later, in the dim light of the room which served as her recovery room for three months, Taylor still walked with a slight limp. She had a metal plate and six screws holding the bone together, and though she was finally able to return to work she still has thousands of dollars in medical bills left to pay. She had no plans to venture back into downtown Dallas for memorial events that day. Just seeing the news about the anniversary that morning sent her into a minor panic attack, her chest pounding and hands shaking. ""I guess it's just part of the PTSD,"" she said. El Centro College police officer John Abbott was wounded pursuing shooter Micah Xavier Johnson El Centro College police officer John Abbott didn't have that option. That morning, 12 months on, Abbott donned his uniform and headed in for his shift, patrolling the same campus where he took fire from Johnson. He walked the same street where he had pulled a wounded officer to safety - his own legs shredded by flying glass - only to roll him over and see that it was his long-time friend, DART officer Brent Thompson. Abbott, who is also a Navy medic, worked to save Thompson's life, but it was too late. ""I was just angry. I wanted to get a hold of that guy,"" recalled Abbott. ""I don't know that there really is anyone who is a civilian who will ever be able to understand that type of reaction."" For Dr Alex Eastman - lead medical officer for the Dallas Police Department SWAT team, assistant professor of surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center, and a trauma surgeon at Parkland Memorial Hospital - the day began with a short prayer in the ""trauma pod"" at Parkland surrounded by the medical team that had worked feverishly to save the officers' lives that night. ""I know many of us have hurt deeply over the last year,"" he told the small gathering of doctors, nurses, technicians and security guards. ""This has certainly been, for me, one of the most challenging events of my career."" Then he swapped out of his white doctor's coat, and suited up in the same SWAT gear he wore a year ago when he found himself in the middle of the shooting. Portraits of the five fallen officers at Dallas police headquarters ""I'm doing [on 7 July] what the rest of the police department and what Parkland Hospital is doing - we're going to take a few minutes for ourselves and we're going to reflect and honour the memory of our colleagues that aren't with us anymore,"" he said. ""And then we're going to do what we do everyday. We're going to come to work and do our jobs and protect this great city."" Eastman went on duty to help watch over the city-wide memorial held in front of Dallas' city hall. Hundreds poured into the grassy areas in front of the building to listen to state and local politicians express condolences and grief, pledges of loyalty to the men and women in blue, and for extra spending on police tactical gear. At exactly 8:58pm, when the shooting began a year earlier, the crowd held tiny blue lights aloft as bagpipers played Amazing Grace. Although the deaths of the officers took place at a protest over the deaths of Castile and Sterling, few of those present drew a link from those deaths to the deaths of the officers. ""I guess my perspective was we hadn't had anything like that happen in Dallas, so why did we pay for other issues?"" said police dispatcher Abigail Irizarry, who was on duty the night of the ambush. ""Why us?"" For Jose Vela, the contrast was even more stark. One year ago, he'd come to the demonstration as the leader of an organisation called ""Cop Block"" which filmed and scrutinized police behaviour. Vela said he was a block and a half away when the shots began. ""I saw the police literally run towards the bullets flying,"" he said. Vela was so affected he completely reversed course. He resigned from Cop Block, started showing up to police stations in Dallas with an American flag, donating money to police causes, and instead of filming cops, filming civilians to try to be of assistance to law enforcement. ""Crime is going up. The police department is short 400 officers. They're tired, they're desperate,"" he said. ""There will always be bad police, but overall, all police are good. They all have families, they're all human beings."" Jose Vela has gone from a protester of police to their number one fan Opinions split from Baton Rouge to St Paul to Dallas on whether or not there is a way to connect the three days, and the seven deaths. The Sterling family bristled at the thought that Alton somehow caused the deaths of the Dallas officers. Clarence Castile freely admitted he'd been too steeped in his own grief and effort to hold his family together to think about much about the other families. The police community feels increasingly embattled after several ambush killings of officers over the past year including just last week, the death of a New York City police officer who was shot through the window of her cruiser by a mentally ill man. But Shetamia Taylor quietly connected all these worlds. She was born in Louisiana, raised in Minnesota, and now lives in Texas - a set of facts that leads internet conspiracy theorists to accuse her of being a ""crisis actor"" and a hoaxer. She went to the march a year ago to protest over police brutality, on behalf of her four black sons. She left wounded, but alive, thanks, she believes, to the bravery of an officer who died helping her. Even before that day one year ago, her youngest son declared he wants to become a police officer, a decision she supports. ""I know there is false fear on both sides,"" she said on 7 July. ""But being a black mother of four young black men at a time where race tensions are so high, to have these white officers so willingly risk their own lives for my black life? Come on now - everybody matters."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Is this a smoking gun and other Trump Jr questions,"Call it a journalistic triple punch. The New York Times on Fridayrevealed,externalthat Donald Trump Jr, his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chair Paul Manafort had a previously undisclosed meeting with an influential Russian lawyer in Trump Tower during the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. Then, on Sunday, the paperreported,externalthat during the meeting the group discussed information that was possibly damaging to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Trump Jr had previously said only that the meetings were ""primarily"" about a suspended Russian adoption programme. Finally, the Times on Monday evening landed the haymaker - that Trump Jr went into the meeting thinking it was the Russian government itself that had incriminating information on the Democratic candidate. Those stories, andsubsequent reporting,externalby the Washington Post, raise a bevy of questions. Here are a few of the big ones. What is a gun? What is smoke? Is anything real any more? The media could discover a metaphorical .357 Magnum on the floor, still warm to the touch, and it would probably be dismissed by many as just another bit of fake news. These latest revelations aren't going to cause such existential angst, but they're still enlightening - and could be bad news for Trump Jr. For the first time there's confirmation of a meeting between Mr Trump's inner circle and someone with ties to the Russian government where campaign issues were discussed. More than that, Trump Jr seems to have walked into the meeting with the impression that the Russian government wanted to help his father - and there's email evidence that supports this. As the Washington Postputs it,external: ""The meeting suggests that some Trump aides were in the market to collect negative information that could be used against Clinton - at the same time that US government officials have concluded Russians were collecting such data."" That may not be evidence of collusion, but it gets close to evidence of a willingness to collude. News of the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers first surfaced a week later. Roughly a month after that, Wikileaks began releasing information from the hack, causing a political headache for the Democrats just before their national convention. Now throw in the fact that both Mr Kushner and Mr Manafort have been mired in their own Russia-related controversies, and the plot thickens. Hillary Clinton had her own campaign operatives investigating Donald Trump ""Everybody does it"" is Trump Jr's current defence of the meeting, after his original explanation was undercut by subsequent revelations and his revised statement proved more incriminating than exculpatory. ""Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent,"" he tweeted sarcastically. ""Went nowhere but had to listen."" ""Opposition research"", as it's called, is a standard part of any campaign. Usually a candidate has a team of researchers chasing down any and every possible bit of unflattering information on their opponents. Dirt-digging is a messy business, however, and these units usually have a fair amount of separation from a candidate's top team to insulate the campaign from embarrassing blowback. Such insulation was non-existent in this case. A Russian national, apparently at the behest of a British publicist working for a Russian music star who is the son of a billionaire real estate developer, was able to arrange a sit-down meeting with three top figures in the Trump campaign. As Republican campaign strategist Evan Siegriedpoints out,external, even for a campaign as unconventional as Mr Trump's, letting those close to a candidate talk to sources of uncertain background is ""not just dumb"", it's a serious departure from basic standard operating procedure. Another Republican operative, Stuart Stevens, drew comparisons to an episode during the 2000 presidential race between Al Gore and George W Bush. ""When Gore campaign was sent Bush debate brief book, they called FBI,""he tweeted,external. ""If foreign interests offer you info on former [secretary of state], you call the FBI."" The Trump team didn't do that. Instead, they took the meeting. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is one of several Trump aides caught up in Russia-related trouble In June, Trump Jr took to Twitter to celebrate former FBI head James Comey's testimony that there was no evidence campaign aides had ""repeated contacts"" with Russians. Now, it turns out, he helped set up one such meeting - and reportedly thought that the Russian government was a willing partner. Mr Kushner wrote in his security clearance application that he never met with Russian nationals - and had to subsequently revise his answers when it was revealed he had multiple meetings. Close campaign aide turned White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn said he never spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak about sanctions. He resigned in disgrace after government surveillance proved that assertion inaccurate. Mr Manafort had to acknowledge he received millions in payments from a pro-Russian Ukrainian party and retroactively register as a foreign agent, after insisting last year that he had no such ties. Jeff Sessions, a close political confidant of Mr Trump during the campaign and now US attorney general, had to recuse himself from his department's Russia investigation because he was not forthcoming about his own meetings with Mr Kislyak. Time and time again, those close to Mr Trump have had to backtrack on assurances they made that they did not have Russian contacts or connections. Taken individually, these episodes may be unremarkable. In their totality, however, they become a steady drumbeat of evasion and obfuscation whenever the topic of Russia comes up. Independent Counsel Robert Mueller may have some questions for Trump Jr Several congressional committees and Independent Counsel Robert Mueller are looking into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Trump Tower meeting, while it may not be a smoking gun, will definitely pique their interest - and could result in legal exposure for Trump Jr. On Monday morning Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said that the Senate Intelligence Committee should interview Trump Jr and other participants about what took place in New York last June. Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, has made a similar call. Trump Jr's assertion that neither Mr Manafort nor Mr Kushner knew the details of the meeting ahead of time appears to insulate those two from possible political and legal fallout, as does Mr Trump's lawyer's statement that the president was not aware of the meeting. Trump Jr may not be so fortunate. ""His statements put him potentially in legal crosshairs for violating federal criminal statutes prohibiting solicitation or acceptance of anything of value from a foreign national, as well as a conspiracy to defraud the United States,""writes,externalDarren Samuelsohn in Politico. For the past few weeks, some Trump supporters have been insisting that even if members of the campaign did co-ordinate with Russian operatives, it wouldn't have been illegal or even improper. At the time the assertions appeared unexpected and unnecessary. That's not so much the case anymore. Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have a lot on their plate There are two schools of thought surrounding the impact this could have on Mr Trump's efforts to enact healthcare and tax reform, devise a federal budget, pass some sort of infrastructure spending bill and do all the other stuff that used to occupy the days of a pre-""modern"" presidency. On one hand, the latest round of Russia stories are crowding out any efforts to promote the president's priorities on the public stage. The latest iteration of the Senate's Obamacare repeal bill is woefully unpopular, and there's been little opportunity for any of its advocates - whether in the administration or Congress - to make a high-profile pitch for why it should be made law. Other agenda items, like tax reform, are so far back on the burner they may have fallen completely off the stove. The counter to this is that, given the heat many politicians have taken over proposed elements of the healthcare bill, flying under the public's radar may afford the involved parties time and space to regroup. Two weeks ago, members of the Senate were being hounded by reporters for the latest details on the ongoing healthcare fight. This week, the media's lidless gaze is fixed elsewhere. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already sent two draft bills to the Congressional Budget Office for analysis. If he gets a result that's positive for his party, he may try to race to a vote before opposition mounts. Of course these theories may well co-exist. Congressional Republicans could have the space to quickly pass a new healthcare bill and get it on Mr Trump's desk for a short-term win. Without the ability to boost its approval ratings, however, the unpopular law ends up being a long-term drag on the party heading into next year's midterm election and undermines subsequent legislative efforts. With a little help from his eldest son, Mr Trump could end up losing by winning - or vice-versa. FollowAnthony Zurcher,externalon Twitter.

Briton killed fighting IS in Syria,"A 22-year-old British man has been killed fighting against so-called Islamic State in northern Syria, Kurdish fighters have said. Luke Rutter, of Birkenhead, Merseyside, was killed on 6 July in a neighbourhood south of Raqqa, they said. In a statement, the Kurdish YPG fighters said he had been killed ""during the big campaign to liberate Raqqa from the terrorism of IS"". Mr Rutter's family said they did not wish to comment. He is the fourth British man to be killed while fighting against IS in Syria. BBC News correspondent Emma Vardy said an eyewitness who had been close by told her Mr Rutter had not been killed during a planned operation, but had died in what he described as an ambush. While Mr Rutter and a group of other soldiers were some distance back from the front line, one fighter stepped on a landmine which exploded, and then IS fighters attacked, the eyewitness said. They were quickly overpowered and the incident lasted only minutes, he added. YPG representatives told our correspondent that while IS is slowly being defeated in Raqqa, this ambush is proof that the jihadists are very much active within the city and are using snipers, tunnels, booby traps and hidden explosive devices. In a video posted online by the general command of the YPG, Mr Rutter said he had joined the group because it ""stands for the best opportunity for peace that this region might have"". ""I lied to people I care about to come here,"" he said. ""I said I was going somewhere else - I didn't. I apologise massively for that. ""Apart from that I don't regret my decision and I hope that you respect it."" Volunteering to fight with the Kurds Is so-called Islamic State finished? Why is there a war in Syria? The statement from the YPG said Mr Rutter was also known by the name ""Soro Zinar"" and he had arrived in Rojava, a Kurdish region in northern Syria, at the beginning of March 2017. It said Mr Rutter had had military training at the YPG academy in Rojava and that ""despite lacking professional military background, he was among the best in training."" ""We send our thoughts and prayers to Martyr Soro, his family, and his comrades who fought courageously on behalf of all humanity,"" the statement said. ""Soro will always be remembered by our people and all peace-loving people around the world as a hero who sacrificed his life for the sake of protecting the value of the free world."" The British Foreign Office advises people not to travel to Syria to fight. Luke Rutter is one of a number of volunteers who have been willing to go to the front line and fight against the jihadists. It is seen as a fight of good versus evil, a vision of hope against a fascist mindset. Despite warnings from authorities, many volunteers from the UK and other countries have felt a strong draw to go and to take part. The Kurdish YPG is a non-religious force fighting for a libertarian, socialist ideology. They say their struggle is a revolution, and many westerners have come to play a role. But Mr Rutter's death is a reminder of the risks they take. Raqqa: Syrian capital of the IS 'caliphate' Why has the Syrian war lasted 12 years?

Attack led to cancer woman's early death,"Paul Storm Blueitt will serve at least 27 years in prison A robber who carried out a ""horrendous"" attack on a cancer patient has been jailed for life for her murder. Paul Storm Blueitt, 36, assaulted Judith Ducker during the raid at a newsagents in Rotherham on 1 September. Police said the injuries stopped Mrs Ducker receiving treatment for breast cancer and she died prematurely from the disease in hospital a month later. Blueitt, of Cambridge Crescent, Rotherham, was convicted after a trial at Sheffield Crown Court. More on this and other South Yorkshire stories Det Sgt Andy Shields said 64-year-old Mrs Ducker was left with a fractured skull, a fractured eye socket, multiple head lacerations and bruising to the brain following a ""horrendous assault"". Det Sgt Shields added: ""The consequence of this assault, was that Judith would never be well enough to receive further cancer treatment and after being taken to hospital, a CT head scan revealed that Judith's breast cancer had spread to her brain. ""Such were her head injuries that further cancer treatment could not be given to her and she sadly died in hospital on 20 October last year. She died from the breast cancer that had spread to her brain."" Judith Ducker died in hospital after the attack prevented her from receiving cancer treatment South Yorkshire Police said Blueitt was initially charged with attempted murder but after Mrs Ducker's death, the charge was upgraded to murder, following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service. The prosecution case was that the serious head injuries caused by Blueitt prevented Mrs Ducker from receiving vital cancer treatment and resulted in her premature death. Blueitt was also found guilty of robbery and will have to serve a minimum of 27 years in prison.

"River death boy, 12, was 'hero'","Owen's family thanked the emergency services who had tried to help him The family of a 12-year-old boy, who died trying to rescue a girl from a weir, has described him as a ""hero"". Owen Jenkins went missing in the River Trent near Beeston Marina, Nottinghamshire, on Monday afternoon. Tributes have been paid to the boy, whose body was found in the water during a major search operation. His great aunt, Liz Ryan, said: ""He went in the water to save a girl and help her get out, and he couldn't swim much himself. ""We don't know the full story but all we know is that he is a hero."" In a statement his parents, Nicola and Gary Jenkins, said: ""Our little boy, our English rose, our champion will be missed and never forgotten. ""We wish to thank all of the emergency services, who have been amazing, and all of the people that helped to look for Owen."" More on this and other stories across Nottinghamshire A weir on the River Trent is located near to Beeston Marina AFacebook post,externalby the boy's rugby team, Nottingham Casuals RFC, said: ""It is with profound sadness and regret that we confirm the loss of 12-year-old Owen Jenkins who died at Beeston Weir last night. ""We cannot express how deep our sorrow is and our thoughts are with Owen's family and friends. ""Owen has played Rugby for Nottingham Casuals RFC since he was 7 and was loved [by] his teammates and everyone he came into contact with. ""His teammates are in bits this morning."" Ian Brierly, head teacher at Chilwell School where Owen was a student, described him as an ""enthusiastic and gregarious young man"". ""He was an exceptional sportsman and we recently celebrated his success from sports day when he broke several long-standing school records; most notably the 200m. ""Owen was a key member of our community and we are heartbroken at his loss,"" he added. Dozens of firefighters and police officers were called to Beeston Marina Anna Soubry, Conservative MP for Broxtowe,tweeted,externalOwen had ""lost his life in the Trent trying to help others"". The MP also raised the issue in the House of Commons, calling for government action to co-ordinate safety measures around open water. ""This is a terrible accident and everyone's thoughts are with Owen's family and friends,"" she said. A body was found four hours after the alarm was raised Narrow boat owner Brad O'Riordan said the water at Riverside Road, near to where Owen was last seen, was very dangerous. He said: ""It's a very fast current there. I don't think the kids realise what they're getting into when they go into the water."" About 30 firefighters helped with the search, which involved three power boats, a police helicopter and an air ambulance. At the scene, Dave Wade, BBC Nottingham There was a sombre mood among the barge owners and dog walkers at Beeston Marina early this morning. Some described seeing the boy entering the water to help a pair of girls who had got into trouble at the weir. One barge owner told me the 12-year-old was standing on the weir when he picked a girl out, but his legs gave way and he never surfaced. Many had questions over safety at the beauty spot, which is a magnet for youngsters when the weather is good. Most people I spoke to said lifebelts had been stolen or vandalised.

Airline to drop pregnancy test demand,"Iberia insists it did not refuse to hire anyone for being pregnant - and says requiring tests is commonplace in Spain The Spanish airline Iberia has said it will stop requiring female job candidates to take a pregnancy test after it was fined for the practice. Labour inspectors in the Balearic Islands discovered the airline insisted on the tests, and fined it â¬25,000 (Â£22,000; $28,000). The airline argued it had only been trying to ""guarantee that [pregnant women] did not face any risks"". But this explanation drew ridicule on social media. ""You need help to improve your arguments,"" tweeted one blogger, Eva Snijders, having earlier tweeted, ""Hello, we are Iberia and we live in medieval times."" Russia's Aeroflot airline defeats discrimination claims UK recruitment agency criticised for job ads specifying bra size Just the job? When interviews go wrong The airline practice was uncovered after a campaign on the Balearic Islands to combat discrimination in the workplace,reports El Pais in English,external. Inspectors subsequently found Iberia had required a recruitment company, Randstad, to carry out the test on candidates along with other medical checks, the paper says. Iberia insists it did not turn down candidates discovered to be pregnant, saying five had been hired. It also reportedly argues that requiring pregnancy tests is commonplace in Spain. ""You need help to improve your arguments,"" tweeted Eva Snijders But Spanish Health Minister Dolors Montserrat said she ""rejected"" the practice. ""Maternity can in no way be an obstacle for access to a job,"" she told reporters.

Contaminated blood scandal inquiry announced,"A UK-wide inquiry will be held into the contaminated blood scandal that left at least 2,400 people dead, the prime minister has confirmed. A spokesman for Theresa May said it would establish the causes of the ""appalling injustice"" that took place in the 1970s and 1980s. Thousands of NHS patients were given blood products from abroad that were infected with hepatitis C and HIV. It's been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Many of those affected and their families believe they were not told of the risks involved and there was a cover-up. Speaking to the BBC, Mrs May said: ""They deserve answers, and the inquiry that I have announced today will give them those answers, so they will know why this happened, how it happened. ""This was an appalling tragedy and it should never have happened."" A recentparliamentary report,externalfound around 7,500 patients were infected by imported blood products. Many were patients with an inherited bleeding disorder called haemophilia. They needed regular treatment with a clotting agent Factor VIII, which is made from donated blood. The UK imported supplies and some turned out to be infected. Much of the plasma used to make Factor VIII came from donors like prison inmates in the US, who sold their blood. Jason Evans was just four years old when his father Jonathan, a haemophiliac, died after being infected with HIV through contaminated Factor VIII treatment. This video can not be played Jason Evans' father died of Aids after being infected with contaminated blood Jason recently discovered that in late 1984 his father had raised concerns with his doctors about Factor VIII but he says he was told ""there was nothing to worry about, this is sensationalism and not to pay attention to it. And he trusted his doctor"". BBC Panorama - Contaminated Blood: The Search for the Truth Families of those who died will be consulted about what form the inquiry should take. It could be a public Hillsborough-style inquiry or a judge-led statutory inquiry, the prime minister confirmed. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the inquiry should have the potential to trigger prosecutions. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""We were very surprised that as the new inquiry is expected to extend to Scotland, the UK government did not seek to discuss this with us in advance of their announcement. We will be seeking clarity as a matter of some urgency. ""People in England and Wales should get the same opportunity to get answers as we have already given through thePenrose Inquiry,externalin Scotland."" Sir Peter Bottomley, co-chairman of the cross-party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminated blood, said the success of the inquiry would depend on it being able to get hold of sensitive information. ""It must have powers to get documents from pharmaceutical companies and government,"" he said. The government has been strongly criticised for dragging its heels. This video can not be played ""People were acting for the best motives but just made catastrophic mistakes,"" says Sir Peter Bottomley MP Greater Manchester mayor and former health secretary Andy Burnham has repeatedly called for a Hillsborough-style probe into what happened. Mr Burnham claimed in the Commons that a ""criminal cover-up on an industrial scale"" had taken place. The Downing Street announcement came hours before the government faced possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion about the need for an inquiry. Payments have been made to some of the people who were infected. Afund,externalwas established to help support survivors. If the new inquiry finds culpability it opens the door to victims seeking large compensation payouts through the courts. Jason Evans said his father had raised concerns with his doctors about Factor VIII before he died Liz Carroll, chief executive of the Haemophilia Society, said: ""The government has for decades denied negligence and refused to provide compensation to those affected, this inquiry will finally be able to properly consider evidence of wrongdoing."" Improvements in donor vetting meant that by 1986 UK patients were receiving safer treatments. By the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. Anyone who received a blood transfusion before 1991 is potentially at risk of Hepatitis C infection since blood donations were not screened before this date. Blood donations are now routinely tested for infections, including hepatitis and HIV.

Trump Jr releases Russia email chain,"Donald Trump Jr was told the information would be useful to his father, one email says US President Donald Trump's son has released an email chain showing he was keen to accept ""sensitive"" information on Hillary Clinton from a Russian national. Publicist Rob Goldstone tells Donald Trump Jr that there is information that is ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump"". Mr Trump Jr replies: ""If it's what you say, I love it."" The emails led to a meeting in New York with a Russian lawyer. It appears to be the first confirmation that a Trump associate attended a meeting in the expectation of being handed sensitive information from Russian officials. US officials are currently investigating alleged Russian meddling in the US election. President Trump issued a brief statement in support of his son, describing him as ""a high-quality person"" and applauding his transparency. Later, the highest-ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said he wanted Mr Trump Jr and all participants in the meeting to testify before the panel. Trump Jr's email chain: Full text Four most explosive lines in the emails Trump Jr's habit for headline-making The emails to Mr Trump Jr, which hereleased on Twitter,external, say ""the crown prosecutor of Russia"" (a role that does not exist) had ""offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father"". The email chain was also forwarded to President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign manager Paul Manafort. All three later met Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York. Since he was elected, President Trump has been dogged by allegations that Russia tried to sabotage Mrs Clinton's campaign. He has denied any knowledge of this and Russia has also repeatedly denied interfering. In May, the justice department appointed ex-FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to look into the Russian matter. This video can not be played ""The optics might look bad,"" says Trump supporter, but critic calls it ""a thunderbolt"" TheNew York Times first reported on Saturday,externalthat a meeting had taken place on 9 June 2016 between Ms Veselnitskaya and the Trump team at Trump Tower. It later reported that Mr Trump Jr had earlier been offered alleged damaging information on Mrs Clinton. President's family facing the heat Russian cloud hangs over White House Trump-Russia scandal: How did we get here? The Times had been expected to publish emails connected to the meeting, but Mr Trump Jr pre-empted this by posting the email chain on Twitter. He had earlier admitted meeting Ms Veselnitskaya but insisted she had provided ""no meaningful information"". He said she had wanted to talk about adoptions. The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was also at the meeting Ms Veselnitskaya, who has been linked to the Russian government, has insisted she was never in possession of information that could have damaged Mrs Clinton. She said Mr Trump Jr and two senior campaign aides may have met her last summer because they were ""longing"" for such information. She has denied any connection with the Kremlin. The email chainposted by Mr Trump Jr,externalshows: On 3 June last year he received an email from intermediary Mr Goldstone promising documents from Russia that would incriminate Hillary Clinton and her supposed dealings with Russia One email from Mr Goldstone said the information they had been promised was ""obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump"" The person who was to meet Mr Trump Jr in New York was described as ""a Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow"" Within the week, a meeting had been arranged which included Mr Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort Mr Trump Jr also posted a statement saying he was releasing the email chain ""to be totally transparent"" and reiterated that the Russian lawyer had ""no information to provide"". Mr Goldstone has previously denied any knowledge of involvement in the election by the Russian government. Who is the man behind Donald Trump Jr's meeting? Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter The New York Times' description of the email to Donald Trump Jr from Rob Goldstone was bad news for the Trump presidency. The actual text of the emails, however, is absolutely devastating. Trump Jr was explicitly told the Russian government wanted to provide him with documents incriminating Hillary Clinton as part of its ""support for Mr Trump"". Son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chair Paul Manafort were apparently copied on the entire email chain the day before the meeting. Goldstone even offered to pass the information along to Donald Trump's personal assistant. These emails place dynamite under nearly a year's worth of assertions by Trump officials that there was no co-ordination between their campaign and the Russian government. Even if no collusion took place in this instance - all the parties to the meeting who are speaking publicly deny that any information was exchanged - Trump Jr wasn't just open to Russian help, he ""loved"" it. Time and time again members of President Trump's inner circle have denied contacts with Russian nationals only to later revise their assertions when new facts emerged. These emails may have given the public the first glimpse of why such elaborate defences were constructed. Anthony's analysis in full Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina - a Trump critic - said the emails were ""very disturbing"", adding that the meeting should never have been held in the first place. He told reporters on Capitol Hill: ""This is the most problematic thing that I've seen thus far... the most direct evidence yet... that the Russian government was interested in helping the Trump campaign.""

Russian lawyer denies Trump son's claim,"Donald Trump Jr said ""no meaningful information"" on Mrs Clinton was provided The Russian lawyer at the centre of allegations surrounding US President Donald Trump's son has insisted she was never in possession of information that could have damaged Hillary Clinton. Natalia Veselnitskaya said Donald Trump Jr and two senior campaign aides may have met her last summer because they were ""longing"" for such information. Ms Veselnitskaya has been linked to the Russian government. US officials are investigating alleged Russian meddling in the US election. Mr Trump Jr was told that material on Democratic presidential candidate Mrs Clinton offered by Ms Veselnitskaya was part of Moscow's effort to help his father's election campaign,the New York Times reports,external. Publicist Rob Goldstone, who arranged the meeting with Ms Veselnitskaya, stated this in an email, the newspaper says. The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign head Paul Manafort also attended the meeting at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016. Ms Veselnitskaya told US broadcaster NBC on Tuesday: ""I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that."" President's family in peril? Russian cloud hangs over White House Trump-Russia scandal: How did we get here? Ms Veselnitskaya said the meeting was set up by a man she did not know who told her by telephone to go to Trump Tower. Mr Trump Jr asked her just one question during the meeting, she said. ""The question that I was asked was as follows: whether I had any financial records which might prove that the funds used to sponsor the DNC [Democratic National Committee] were coming from inappropriate sources. ""It is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such information. They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted."" Ms Veselnitskaya denied ever having worked for the Russian government. In a tweet sent after Ms Veselnitskaya's interview with NBC, Mr Trump Jr accused the media and Democratic Party of focusing on a ""nonsense meeting"" and of ""desperation"". Separately on Tuesday, Russian officials said Moscow wasready to expel 30 US diplomats and seize US state propertyin retaliation for sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama over Russian hacking of Democratic Party computers. The newspaper reports that three people with knowledge of the Goldstone email said it indicated the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information on Mrs Clinton. But it says there was no mention in the email of any wider effort by the Russian government to interfere in the election, nor was there any indication of a link to the hacking attack on the Democratic Party that was first reported a week after the meeting. Mr Goldstone has previously denied any knowledge of involvement by the Russian government. Rob Goldstone: The man behind the meeting Who's who in the Trump clan Jared Kushner's dizzying array of portfolios Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC that the New York Times report was ""a very serious development"" that required further investigation. Mr Trump Jr'sstatement on the matter on Sunday,externaldid not indicate he had been told of any Russian government involvement. Lawyer Alan Futerfas, hired by Mr Trump Jr to represent him in the Russia-related investigations, described reports of the meeting as ""much ado about nothing"" and said his client had done nothing wrong. The president's sonsaid,externalhe was ""happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know"". It took place on 9 June 2016, just two weeks after Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination. The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was also at the meeting After theNew York Times,externalfirst reported the meeting on Saturday, Mr Trump Jr released a statement which confirmed that it had taken place but did not mention whether it was related to the presidential campaign. However,another Times report,external, on Sunday, said Mr Trump Jr had agreed to the meeting after being offered information that would prove detrimental to Mrs Clinton. In his statement on Sunday, Mr Trump Jr said he had been asked to meet ""an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign"". Mr Trump Jr's statement continues: ""The woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs Clinton. Mr Trump Jr has denied issuing conflicting statements on the matter ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information."" Trump: 'Did Russian meddle? No-one knows' Mr Trump Jr said the lawyer then changed the subject to the Magnitsky Act and ""it became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along"". Adopted by Congress in 2012, the Magnitsky Act allows the US to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved in human rights violations. Ms Veselnitskaya is married to a Moscow government official and her clients include companies and individuals said to be close to the Kremlin. She has been at the forefront of a campaign - backed by the Russian state - to overturn the act. In an interview on Monday, Mr Goldstone backed Mr Trump Jr's version of the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered ""just a vague, generic statement about the campaign's funding"" which was ""the most inane nonsense I've ever heard"". On Monday, Mr Trump Jrtweeted,externalsarcastically: ""Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent..."" He alsodenied,externalissuing conflicting statements. A spokesman for President Trump's legal team said the president was ""not aware of and did not attend"" the meeting. Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Whether by plan or happenstance, Donald Trump Jr is stumbling into an increasingly dire situation. The pattern has been set. The New York Times runs a story, Trump Jr issues his response, then the noose tightens. First he said the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was about adoption issues. Then the Times reports that Trump Jr thought he would learn damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The presidential son says he was conducting routine opposition research. Then the Times reports that he was told it was the Russian government itself that was coming to his father's aid. In a traditional campaign, a foreign government's attempt to offer incriminating information about an opponent - or even the hint of such an overture - would set off all kinds of alarms. The FBI would have been notified. Senior staff would have insulated themselves from incrimination. The Trump team was not a conventional campaign. And time and time again, it made novice mistakes or, more ominously, took unprecedented risks. Its candidate prevailed, but it has led to countless political headaches. Now it appears the president's own family, and his presidency itself, could be in peril. They have only themselves to blame.

Meet the Guides encouraging girls into science and tech,"Girl Guide Catherine Young wants to encourage more women into engineering The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts is updating its image with a number of new achievement badges aimed at encouraging young women into science and technology. My memories of the Girl Guides involve marshmallow toasting, tying knots and being assessed on my table-laying skills for a badge no doubt long-consigned to the archives. Fast forward some 25 years and it's clear much has changed. In an international organisation that liaises with Google and Microsoft among others, today's young guides are just as likely to be gathered round an engineering bench as a campfire. Sixteen-year-old Catherine Young is on a mission to boost girls' interest in engineering and has found the Girl Guides a valuable platform for her campaign. She surveyed girls aged 11-18 and found that 74% didn't have the opportunity to take the subject at school. As part of the Girl Guide Scotland Action for Change project, she is lobbying MPs to make the subject more readily available across all UK schools. ""Having a national stage for my project has been incredible as this is something I'm very passionate about,"" she says. ""There is a huge lack of female engineers due to the subject not being available, or girls not knowing about it, and we need more females to bring new ideas that could solve Earth's biggest problems."" Nvidia's Screen Girls project in India is giving girls computer training courses As the battle to engage girls with Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths - extends beyond the classroom, attention is turning to the role this 106-year-old movement has to play in cultivating this interest. The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts has a presence in 146 countries and is busy forging links with tech companies and organisations across the globe. For example, guides in Tanzania have hooked up with Techchix, a non-profit body that promotes science and engineering to girls at local secondary schools through mentoring programmes. And in India, girls have teamed up with US-based artificial intelligence giant, Nvidia, to boost female employability in the tech sector. More Technology of Business Could new data laws end up bankrupting your company? The 'Babypod' carrier that comes with an F1 pedigree Why your bananas could soon cost more in the afternoon Ant power: The bus that runs on formic acid Piloted in the city of Pune, the Screen Girls project aims to deliver computer courses to 400 girls who have recently completed secondary school education. If successful, the project will be extended to other parts of the country. ""Every country will have different approaches and where there is success we will showcase it to the rest of the world,"" says Anita Tiessen, chief executive of the World Association of Girl Guides. ""In the US, for example, there has always been a very strong outdoors culture, so they introduce Stem activities in this way through robot camps and Stem field trips."" Girl guides can achieve a growing number of science-related badges A forthcoming overhaul of achievement badges is likely to see Coding and Mechanics added to the list. Google is currently advising on the delivery of a new Web and App Design badge. In the UK, the main Stem-related badges are Science and Communicator. Girlguiding UK's recent survey with Microsoft found that many members did not see technology as a potential career option, their views influenced by enduring gender stereotypes. ""It is a concern that many girls think of Stem as boys' subjects and don't identify any female role models in this area,"" says Angie Pitt, head of Girlguiding youth programmes. ""We have to think about what we can do to counter this, and the first thing is offering a space where they can learn about these subjects in a way that is fun, accessible and relevant to them - and doesn't feel like school or that they're being judged."" Projects with Rolls-Royce and BAE systems have led to the development of new ""science investigator"" and ""engineering"" badges - while cloud computing specialist Salesforce recently ran a weekend workshop for 200 guides in London. When Lady Olave Baden-Powell (centre) was Chief Guide, roles for girls were more traditional Charlotte Finn, Salesforce's vice president of programs, says: ""Aspects of the school curriculum are rooted in the past and are simply not pairing young people with the skills they need for today's jobs in technology. ""So it's important that organisations like us complement formal education by bringing these skills to the forefront."" Salesforce also helped develop a volunteer recruitment app for the US Girl Scouts. Ellie Overland, senior lecturer in computing education at the UK's Manchester Metropolitan University, recently developed a Computing badge with 30 guides. ""I have a son in the Scouts and daughter in the Brownies and I noticed a difference in the technology-related badges on offer,"" she says. ""The Scouts badges seemed to get into the nitty-gritty of computing, while in the Guides the focus was more about online image and e-safety, so I felt it was important with this badge to drill deeper and include components on networks, data and algorithms."" ""Safe space"": Anita Tiessen, head of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts While evolution is inevitable in an institution with a 100-plus year heritage, Ms Tiessen believes much of the progress in this area will be underpinned by the movement's core values of girl-led learning and leadership. ""In many countries around the world there are very few opportunities for girls to have that 'safe space' to develop their skills and leadership opportunities,"" she says. ""And with all the evidence pointing to girls holding back in more mixed environments, we are giving girls greater freedom to explore those things."" Ever since a small group of girls gate-crashed the first ever Scout rally in 1909 demanding ""something for the girls"", girl guides have been challenging the status quo. More power to their elbows.

Teachers raise concerns over Sats marking,"Primary head teacher Cathryn Throup highlighted the guidance given to markers Primary school teachers in England have taken to social media to vent their anger about what they claim are inconsistencies in the marking of this year's national curriculum test (Sats). Using the hashtag#SATsshambles,externalon Twitter, teachers have listed a range issues and are calling on all schools to go through their pupils' marked papers to check for errors. The Department for Education said results of the tests were ""robust and accurate"" but head teachers could apply for a review of contested marks. According to the teachers tweeting, 10- and 11-year-olds were asked to put punctuation in a pre-written sentence and - even though they got the right answer - did not get a mark because their commas were not curved the right way or their semi-colon was too large or not in precisely the right place. They also complained about marking guidance which they claimed only markers, not teachers, had access to. Primary tests: Two-fifths fail to make grade Primary tests: What are the changes? Primary head teacher Cathryn Throup tweeted some of the issued guidance which gave details of the ""origin, height, depth and orientation"" of semi-colons - or where pupils' should write their answers. In particular it said: Neither element of the semi-colon should start higher than the letter 'l' The dot of the semi-colon must not be lower than the bottom of the letter 'w' in the word 'tomorrow' The orientation of the comma element of the semi-colon must be inclined to the left or straight down. It cannot incline to the right. Primary teacher Liz Hindley, who tweets as @Leaping_liz, put up pictures of four answers all featuring the semi-colon in the correct place, but two were given a mark and two were not. ""The lack of consistency is so frustrating,"" she said. Other teachers raised similar issues, such as pupils' answers straying outside of the box. Brian Walton, head teacher of Brookside Academy in Somerset, told the BBC that schools had not been told that markers would mark pupils down for misshapen semi-colons and answers straying outside of a box. ""The markers had guidance that none of the teachers, none of the schools knew about, so a lot of this guidance about the size and the shape and the orientation and  how we form letters - we didn't know that,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""Remember, they [pupils] are putting written semi-colons in text type with no gaps between the writing at the same time - we're really getting pernickety when we're getting to that level."" Mr Walton said he did know the scale of the problem, but had already had 50 or 60 heads in his area contact him with concerns. Writer and poet Michael Rosen tweeted: ""The punctuation police demand that the mark has to be drawn correctly and at the right angle."" In a statement, Pearson, the company which administered the Sats, said: ""Marking quality is extremely important and is something we monitor continuously. ""In the unusual circumstance that there is an error, there is a review process in place which ensures a fair and transparent system and enables Pearson to correct any discrepancies and ensure pupils receive a fair mark."" A spokesman for the DfE said there were ""a number of measures in place to ensure that schools' Key Stage 2 writing teacher assessment judgements are robust and accurate"". ""The Standards and Testing Agency takes any issues with the accuracy of schools' teacher assessment judgments very seriously. ""Any concerns about particular schools should be reported to the STA so that they may be properly investigated."" But teacher unions criticised the marking for being inconsistent, saying pupils were being marked down on a technicality when it was clear they knew the correct answer to the question. This pupil received no marks, despite appearing to answer the question correctly Russell Hobby, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: ""We now operate within a testing culture which appears focused on catching young children out rather than recording their achievements. ""Such a culture will swiftly erode the confidence of parents and teachers that the system is operating in the best interests of pupils. ""The stakes are so high that we seem unable to apply reasonable common sense."" Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: """"We already know that moderation is inconsistent and open to gaming. ""Now, teachers are finding out that marking is unreliable too. ""The system does not deserve anyone's trust, and it should not be the basis on which schools are held to account."" Last week, official figures showedtwo-fifths (39%) of primary school pupils in England had failed to meet the expected standardin reading, writing and mathematics. However, this summer's results were an improvement on the success rate last year (53%), which was the first year of new, more rigorous tests.

Russia threatens US over seized mansions,"This video can not be played The Kremlin is urging Donald Trump to lift the sanctions, as Steve Rosenberg reports Russia says it is ""outrageous"" that the US has not yet handed back two Russian intelligence compounds seized in the US under the Obama administration. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he was ""considering specific measures"" in response, but did not elaborate. Earlier, unnamed Russian officials said Moscow was ready to expel about 30 US diplomats and seize US state property. In December the Obama administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shut down two intelligence compounds. Ex-President Barack Obamaacted against Russiaafter US intelligence sources had accused Russian state agents of hacking into Democratic Party computers to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Mr Lavrov told Russian media it was ""simply shameful for such a great country as the United States, a champion of international law, to leave the situation in such a state of suspended animation"". ""Justice and international law must be restored,"" he said, accusing the US Congress of being ""charged up with Russophobia"". The US seized a Russian diplomatic property on Maryland's Eastern Shore - a sprawling 45-acre (18.2-hectare) retreat. The facility, acquired during the Cold War, was used by Russian diplomats for recreation, such as tennis and swimming. But it also had sophisticated communications, and US officials said it doubled as a spying outpost The other diplomatic property is a New York mansion at Glen Cove, Long Island. It has 49 rooms and is similarly surrounded by woods. Like the Maryland mansion, its location is ideal for eavesdropping on US communications, US officials say Luxury Russia resorts in US crosshairs A huge Russian diplomatic estate in Maryland was seized by the US government in December Russian President Vladimir Putin raised the issue of the Obama sanctions with US President Donald Trump when they met in Hamburg on 7 July, the daily Izvestia reported. The Trump team is under investigation over alleged Russian collusion during last year's presidential campaign. The Kremlin has denied interfering in the election. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Email 'linked Russia to Trump Jr meeting' Is this a smoking gun and other Trump Jr questions Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent If Donald Trump has ever read Joseph Heller's famous satirical novel, he'll recognise the situation as Catch-22. If President Trump hands back the Russian diplomatic compounds seized by President Obama last year, he will cement his image of Kremlin stooge in the eyes of his opponents. At this point any concessions to Russia would be highly controversial, in light of current investigations in America into alleged links between Mr Trump's team and Moscow. But if the Russian compounds are not returned, Moscow may well expel a number of US diplomats and seize some US diplomatic buildings. That could complicate what Mr Trump says he wants to achieve: better relations with Russia. This is not the first time that reports have emerged of Russia planning counter-measures. The latest threat - via a foreign ministry source in a pro-Kremlin newspaper - may be designed to increase the pressure on Washington, ahead of US-Russia talks on the issue. The Obama sanctions came on top of existing Western sanctions imposed because of Russia's role in the Ukraine conflict. Mr Putin refrained from tit-for-tat retaliation - unlike in previous diplomatic spats. Mr Trump had been elected to succeed President Obama just weeks before. Russia says President Trump presented ""no plan to resolve the crisis"" when the issue was raised in Hamburg last week. An unnamed Russian diplomat told Izvestia that in retaliation Russia could seize a US government dacha (country villa)  at Serebryany Bor, to the northwest of Moscow, and a US warehouse in the city itself. However, the US ambassador's Spaso House residence and the Anglo-American School in St Petersburg would not be affected. Russia would carry out the threat if no compromise was reached at a St Petersburg meeting later this month between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and US Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon, Izvestia reported.

Russia 'ready to expel 30 US diplomats',"This video can not be played The Kremlin is urging Donald Trump to lift the sanctions, as Steve Rosenberg reports Russia says it is ""outrageous"" that the US has not yet handed back two Russian intelligence compounds seized in the US under the Obama administration. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he was ""considering specific measures"" in response, but did not elaborate. Earlier, unnamed Russian officials said Moscow was ready to expel about 30 US diplomats and seize US state property. In December the Obama administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shut down two intelligence compounds. Ex-President Barack Obamaacted against Russiaafter US intelligence sources had accused Russian state agents of hacking into Democratic Party computers to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Mr Lavrov told Russian media it was ""simply shameful for such a great country as the United States, a champion of international law, to leave the situation in such a state of suspended animation"". ""Justice and international law must be restored,"" he said, accusing the US Congress of being ""charged up with Russophobia"". The US seized a Russian diplomatic property on Maryland's Eastern Shore - a sprawling 45-acre (18.2-hectare) retreat. The facility, acquired during the Cold War, was used by Russian diplomats for recreation, such as tennis and swimming. But it also had sophisticated communications, and US officials said it doubled as a spying outpost The other diplomatic property is a New York mansion at Glen Cove, Long Island. It has 49 rooms and is similarly surrounded by woods. Like the Maryland mansion, its location is ideal for eavesdropping on US communications, US officials say Luxury Russia resorts in US crosshairs A huge Russian diplomatic estate in Maryland was seized by the US government in December Russian President Vladimir Putin raised the issue of the Obama sanctions with US President Donald Trump when they met in Hamburg on 7 July, the daily Izvestia reported. The Trump team is under investigation over alleged Russian collusion during last year's presidential campaign. The Kremlin has denied interfering in the election. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Email 'linked Russia to Trump Jr meeting' Is this a smoking gun and other Trump Jr questions Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent If Donald Trump has ever read Joseph Heller's famous satirical novel, he'll recognise the situation as Catch-22. If President Trump hands back the Russian diplomatic compounds seized by President Obama last year, he will cement his image of Kremlin stooge in the eyes of his opponents. At this point any concessions to Russia would be highly controversial, in light of current investigations in America into alleged links between Mr Trump's team and Moscow. But if the Russian compounds are not returned, Moscow may well expel a number of US diplomats and seize some US diplomatic buildings. That could complicate what Mr Trump says he wants to achieve: better relations with Russia. This is not the first time that reports have emerged of Russia planning counter-measures. The latest threat - via a foreign ministry source in a pro-Kremlin newspaper - may be designed to increase the pressure on Washington, ahead of US-Russia talks on the issue. The Obama sanctions came on top of existing Western sanctions imposed because of Russia's role in the Ukraine conflict. Mr Putin refrained from tit-for-tat retaliation - unlike in previous diplomatic spats. Mr Trump had been elected to succeed President Obama just weeks before. Russia says President Trump presented ""no plan to resolve the crisis"" when the issue was raised in Hamburg last week. An unnamed Russian diplomat told Izvestia that in retaliation Russia could seize a US government dacha (country villa)  at Serebryany Bor, to the northwest of Moscow, and a US warehouse in the city itself. However, the US ambassador's Spaso House residence and the Anglo-American School in St Petersburg would not be affected. Russia would carry out the threat if no compromise was reached at a St Petersburg meeting later this month between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and US Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon, Izvestia reported.

'All work in UK economy should be fair',"This video can not be played Theresa May said it was important to have a ""flexible"" approach that didn't ""exploit workers"" All work in the UK's economy should be ""fair and decent"", a government review of employment practices has said. The report,externalby former aide to Tony Blair, Matthew Taylor, pays particular attention to the gig economy. It recommends that workers for firms such as Uber and Deliveroo should be classified as dependent contractors, with extra benefits. The Prime Minister said the government would take the report's recommendations seriously. Mr Taylor said there was a perception that the gig economy put too much power into the hand of employers: ""Of all the issues that were raised with us as we went around the country, the one that came through most strongly was what the report calls one-sided flexibility. At-a-glance: The Taylor review Viewpoints: Paying in cash What is the gig economy? National Insurance hit for gig economy firms ""One-sided flexibility is where employers seek to transfer all risk onto the shoulder of workers in ways that make people more insecure and makes their lives harder to manage.  It's the people told to be ready for work or travelling to work, only to be told none is available."" â¢ People who work for platform-based companies, such as Deliveroo and Uber, be classed as dependent contractors â¢ Strategies must be put in place to make sure that workers do not get stuck on the National Living Wage â¢ The review suggests a national strategy to provide good work for all ""for which government needs to be held accountable"" â¢ The government should avoid further increasing the the non-wage costs of employing a person, such as the apprenticeship levy A spokesperson for the meal delivery service Deliveroo, one of the companies at the heart of the gig-economy debate, said: ""We would welcome the opportunity to work with the government so we can end this trade off between flexibility and security."" Mr Taylor's report did not attack the gig economy. It said that flexibility in the workplace was important and had contributed to record high employment. He pointed to the official Labour Force Survey of March this year, which found that 68% of those on zero hours contracts did not want more hours. However, he said too many employers and businesses were relying on zero hours, short-hours or agency contracts, when they could be more forward thinking in their scheduling. This video can not be played Matthew Taylor: gig economy firms should pay national insurance on workers Earlier, Mr Taylor had told the BBC: ""There are too many people at work who are treated like cogs in a machine rather than being human beings, and there are too many people who don't see a route from their current job to progress and earn more and do better."" But he said working platform providers such as Uber had to demonstrate that workers signing on for hours of work would ""easily clear"" the minimum wage. Andrew Byrne, head of policy at Uber, said that the average driver took well over the National Living Wage. He also said Uber ""would welcome greater clarity in the law over different types of employment status"". Mr Taylor also suggested that cash payments should be phased-out. He said cash jobs such as window cleaning and decorating were worth up to Â£6bn a year and many were untaxed - something Mr Taylor says should be addressed. Mr Taylor said he did not want to ban cash payments outright, but hoped, over time, the increasing popularity of transaction platforms such as PayPal and Worldpay would see a shift from cash-in-hand work. ""In a few years time as we move to a more cashless economy, self employed people would be paid cashlessly  - like your window cleaner. At the same time they can pay taxes and save for their pension,"" he said. ""Most people who do pay for self-employed labour would like to know that that person is paying their taxes."" However, Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the review did not go far enough for the 4.5 million people in insecure work. She told the BBC: ""If it looks like a job or it smells like a job then it is a job, and the worker should be employed, and I think in those situations where a worker is carrying out work on behalf of an employer... they should not be exploited as a flexible workers."" Trade unions also said Mr Taylor had not tackled many of the issues facing workers. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""From what we've seen, this review is not the game-changer needed to end insecurity and exploitation at work.""

Arrest over Sydney boy shot dead in bed,"Brayden Dillon was shot dead in his Sydney home An Australian man has been charged with the ""execution-style"" killing of a 15-year-old boy who was shot in his bed. Brayden Dillon was sleeping on Good Friday in April when a masked gunman entered his family's Sydney home andshot him in the head, police said. On Monday, heavily armed officers arrested a 26-year-old man and charged him with murder. It came hours after police released images of a car being driven in the area around the time of the shooting. In April, police said the gunman had threatened Brayden's mother before entering his room and shooting him at close range. His stepfather and young step-siblings were also in the house at the time. ""Brayden's murder was particularly callous,"" Detective Chief Inspector Mark Henney said on Monday. He would have celebrated his 16th birthday on Wednesday, police said.

Elle Fanning on being 'the bad girl',"The 19-year-old previously worked with Sofia Coppola on Somewhere Elle Fanning can't stop smiling as she describes her racy character in gothic thriller The Beguiled, set in a girls' boarding school during the American Civil War. ""It's funny because my character got to wear her hair down and have a couple of buttons unbuttoned and got to show her ankle - that was scandalous in Civil War times,"" she tells the BBC. The film tells the story of what happens when Union soldier Corporal John McBurney (played by Colin Farrell) is taken in when one of the schoolgirls finds him injured - and he becomes an object of fascination for pupils and teachers alike. The 19-year-old plays rebellious Alicia in the Sofia Coppola film, which won her the best director accolade at Cannes this year. Fanning, star of last year's Neon Demon, said she'd stayed ""extremely close"" to Coppola since working with her on 2010's Somewhere. She got an email with the script for The Beguiled attached, saying Kirsten Dunst was to play teacher Edwina - and with a specific part in mind for Fanning. ""She thought that would be fun to make me the naughty one,"" said Fanning, adding that another draw was that it's set in the south, where she's from herself. Her character Alicia gets to ""show her ankle"", said Fanning The Beguiled is based on the Clint Eastwood film of the same name - and the Thomas P Cullinan novel The Painted Devil, which inspired that 1971 movie. ""It's a remake of that and also a different take on that - Sofia Coppola-esque, from a different point of view, from the women's perspective this time,"" explains Fanning. Nicole Kidman (left) and Kirsten Dunst (second right) also star in the film, directed by Sofia Coppola (second left) So what was it like being the ""bad one""? ""It was really fun,"" she grins. ""Also with Sofia, it feels so safe. She's so tasteful and keeps it classy."" The other girls got to have their fun too - in a ""girls gone wild behind-the-scenes"" film that Coppola also directed. ""We're holding these red Solo cups and showing our ankles,"" Fanning says. She says that McBurney ""really shakes things up"" and ""also how he becomes the object"", adding: ""Normally women in films are objectified but in our film, we really got to objectify Colin. ""We had a calendar shoot with him, where all the girls were there and he was shirtless and he was sawing and we were laughing at him. He was a really good sport about it, it was really funny."" This video can not be played Kirsten Dunst on her new film The Beguiled and why things are harder for women Her co-star Kirsten Dunst said there were ""a lot of interesting dynamics with the household before McBurney comes in"" - notably between her and headmistress Miss Martha, played by Nicole Kidman. I don't know if something's gone on with me and Miss Martha or if she's made me do things that aren't kosher, you know what I mean?"" she says, adding that there are a lot of underlying tensions. ""This whole movie's about what's not being said,"" she adds. ""I think my character is extremely repressed by her but has to keep a good front for the girls because she's their teacher and being a good Christian woman and so I think my character swallows a lot. ""But I think it's relatable in any way - it's not because we're women. I think that's just being stuck in that household all together is making us a bit stir crazy."" Dunst is also directing a film version of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, starring Elle's sister Dakota - explaining the script is currently being rewritten. She said she picks up tips from all the directors she works with and adds that Coppola, who directed her in The Virgin Suicides and Marie Antoinette, could have her play ""any role"". ""I've taken a lot from every director I've worked with,"" says Dunst - who wasso overwhelmed,externalat being on the Cannes red carpet with Coppola earlier this year that she burst into tears. ""Sofia makes a nice community on set which is a really lovely working environment. To be the most vulnerable you have to have a kind and open set and really listen to everyone and work as a team.

Camden fire: 'It's our heart and soul',"The windows of the Market Hall were smashed as the fire took hold The blaring music and bustling streets surrounding Camden Lock Market have been replaced with tearful stall holders worried about their futures. In the early hours of the morning, 70 firefighters and 10 fire engines attended the scene as flames burst from the top of the Market Hall building - next to the iconic railway bridge at the heart of the North London destination. The top three floors of the former Pickfords stables and Grade II-listed horse hospital were engulfed in the blaze that took London Fire Brigade almost three hours to bring under control. And as the traders arrived to the smoky remains of where they had once sold their creations, there was upset and confusion around how it could have happened. Fire hits London's Camden Lock Market 'I could see flames' Anna Sionek has been selling her artwork in the hall for four years and was devastated at what she may have lost. ""Every piece I had in there was handmade by me,"" she said. ""That is my business, my livelihood, and I am very upset. ""But it is not just me who will suffer - it is the people we employ. They depend on us and now I don't know what we are going to do."" Firefighters were still on the scene come lunchtime to investigate The famous market started in the 1970s with just 16 stalls and grew from a Saturday afternoon event to a seven-day-a-week shopping experience, with more than 1,000 places to shop, eat, drink and dance into the early hours. Due to the hard work of the fighters - who were still on the scene come lunchtime - the blaze was stopped from spreading to nearby buildings, no-one is believed to have been hurt and much of the market remains safe. One woman who runs a food stall near the entrance said: ""We are going to be opening today and lots of the market is safe, so we are very lucky and very grateful."" But for those who worked out of the hall, this was their patch - a part of a larger community that they love dearly. ""This place is my heart and soul,"" said Laetitia Dupont, who has lived in Camden for 10 years and set up her stall selling lamps and jewellery just 18 months ago. ""Even if the things I sell survived the fire, they won't have survived the smoke and water. ""The firefighters are doing everything they can, but it is devastating for the people who work here."" Emergency services were guarding the scene as teams investigated the cause of the blaze This isn't the first time that Camden stall holders have been hit by fire. On 8 February 2008, the famous celebrity haunt The Hawley Arms was severely damaged in a blaze, along with six shops and 90 market stalls. And in 2014, some 600 people fleda blaze in the Stables Market, which saw the whole area destroyed and sold to new developers. Ozgur Kaya, who works on a jewellery stall in the building, now fears for the market hall's future. ""We must protect this market,"" he said. ""It is so unique and there is nothing left like this in London. ""Whether your stall was inside or not, it is so important to all of us and we really hope it will be back up and running soon, how it was."" This video can not be played Camden Lock fire eyewitness: ""I could see flames"" The sense of community around the incident is palpable. Jordan Lemon works on an Italian leather stall on the ground floor of the building - so his stock is safe - but he wanted to offer his support. ""There are people in tears that have lost everything,"" he said. ""These are their jobs and their businesses. ""I wasn't even going to be working today, but when I heard the news, I wanted to come and be here for people."" Two fire investigation teams are trying to get to the bottom of what caused the blaze. But, for the meantime, those world-famous traders will have to wait until the smoke clears to find out whether their future is bright.

Labour MP 'won't use morally wrong Uber',"This video can not be played Rebecca Long-Bailey told Today Uber's ""not morally acceptable"" Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey has said she doesn't use taxi app Uber because it is not ""morally acceptable"". ""I don't like the way they treat their workers,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Ms Long-Bailey claimed Uber drivers were being ""exploited"" and should have the same rights as workers with permanent jobs. Uber said its drivers liked ""being their own boss"". 'UK should end cash-in-hand economy' What is the 'gig' economy? Ms Long-Bailey told Today: ""I don't personally use Uber because I don't feel that it is morally acceptable but that's not to say they can't reform their practices."" She added: ""I don't want to see companies model their operations on the Uber model."" The San Francisco-based company argues that its drivers are not employees but self-employed contractors. An Uber spokesman said: ""Millions of people rely on Uber to get around and tens of thousands of drivers use our app to make money on their own terms. ""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades before our app existed and with Uber they have more control. ""Drivers are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive with no shifts or minimum hours. In fact the main reason people say they sign up to drive with Uber is so they can be their own boss. ""Drivers using Uber made average fares of Â£15 per hour last year after our service fee and, even after costs, the average driver took home well over the National Living Wage. ""We're also proud to have moved things on from this industry's cash-in-hand past since every fare is electronically recorded, traceable and transparent."" An employment tribunal last yearruled that Uber drivers were entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the national minimum wage. The tribunal described Uber's claim that its London operation was a network of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common technology platform as ""faintly ridiculous"". The company's appeal against the employment tribunal decision will be heard later this year. The tribunal said Uber drivers were not employees in the traditional sense, so were not entitled to the full range of employment rights, but could be classed as workers while they were using the Uber app and so were entitled to the minimum wage. A government commissioned report by Tony Blair's former adviser, Matthew Taylor, recommends creating a new category of worker called a ""dependent contractor"", who should be given extra protections by firms such as Uber and Deliveroo. But Ms Long-Bailey said this would not necessarily help them. ""We don't really need a new status, the court victories that we've far have proved that many of these so-called self-employed people who work for the likes of Uber, for example, are workers and should be given adequate protections. ""And I do worry that if this isn't dealt with in sufficient detail, it could undermine the court rulings of Uber, for example, which it was hoped to have wide-ranging implications for the industry."" Ms Long-Bailey's deputy, shadow business minister Chi Onwurah, said she used Uber, but would have to reconsider if workers' rights were not strengthened. The Labour MP told Sky News: ""These services bring real benefits to people. As a single woman leaving a meeting at 11 o'clock at night, being able to trace and see that your Uber is approaching is a benefit. ""We are not putting the blame on consumers and users of these applications.""

US President Trump 'to visit UK in 2018',"US President Donald Trump is likely to come to the UK next year, the BBC understands. Downing Street and the White House are believed to be looking at options for the visit. Mr Trump accepted the Queen's invitation for him to travel to Britain on a state visit when UK PM Theresa May visited Washington in January. But the prospect of a state visit caused much controversy and reportedly led Mr Trump to change his mind. It was said he did not want to visit while there was potential for protests against him. Nearly two million people signed one of a number of petitions saying Mr Trump should not be invited to the UK on a state visit. What is a state visit? Senior politicians, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron who called Mr Trump ""an embarrassment to America"", said the visit should not go ahead. Questions were also raised as to why Mr Trump was invited so soon after taking office - it was two-and-a-half years into his first term before his predecessor Barack Obama came to the UK for his state visit. The Queen welcomed President Barack Obama to Buckingham Palace in 2011 Mrs May extended the invitation to the president just as he sparked anger across the world with his proposed travel ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, clashed with Mr Trump over the immigration measures, later saying the UK should not ""roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for"". Confirmation of Mr Trump's visit had been expected in last month's Queen's Speech, in which the Queen set out her official plans for the year. But there was no mention of it, and October was later mooted as a possible date. The White House denied reports that Mr Trump had reservations about visiting, saying they looked forward to working out a ""mutually acceptable date"". The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state a year. She has hosted 109 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952. State visits are grand, ceremonial occasions, but have a political purpose too, with governments using them to further what they see as Britain's national interests.

Sixteen die in US military plane crash,"This video can not be played Smoke was seen billowing from the plane crash site At least 16 people have died after a US military plane crashed in the southern state of Mississippi at around 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Monday. The crash happened in LeFlore County, about 100 miles (160km) north of Jackson, the state capital. All 16 victims were on the Marine Corps aircraft and there were no survivors, Leflore County emergency management director Fred Randle said. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said,externalthe incident was a ""tragedy"". ""Our men and women in uniform risk themselves every day to secure our freedom,"" he said. US President Donald Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning: ""Marine Plane crash in Mississippi is heartbreaking. Melania and I send our deepest condolences to all!"" No official details were immediately available on the circumstances of the crash. Mississippi outlet the Clarion-Ledger said,externalthe plane came down in a soybean field on the Sunflower-Leflore county line, and left a five-mile trail of debris. It said the FBI was assisting at the scene. Local Fire Chief Marcus Bankstold the Greenwood Commonwealth,externalthat firefighters were driven back by several ""high-intensity explosions"", possibly caused by jet fuel igniting.

'UK should end cash-in-hand economy',"This video can not be played Theresa May said it was important to have a ""flexible"" approach that didn't ""exploit workers"" All work in the UK's economy should be ""fair and decent"", a government review of employment practices has said. The report,externalby former aide to Tony Blair, Matthew Taylor, pays particular attention to the gig economy. It recommends that workers for firms such as Uber and Deliveroo should be classified as dependent contractors, with extra benefits. The Prime Minister said the government would take the report's recommendations seriously. Mr Taylor said there was a perception that the gig economy put too much power into the hand of employers: ""Of all the issues that were raised with us as we went around the country, the one that came through most strongly was what the report calls one-sided flexibility. At-a-glance: The Taylor review Viewpoints: Paying in cash What is the gig economy? National Insurance hit for gig economy firms ""One-sided flexibility is where employers seek to transfer all risk onto the shoulder of workers in ways that make people more insecure and makes their lives harder to manage.  It's the people told to be ready for work or travelling to work, only to be told none is available."" â¢ People who work for platform-based companies, such as Deliveroo and Uber, be classed as dependent contractors â¢ Strategies must be put in place to make sure that workers do not get stuck on the National Living Wage â¢ The review suggests a national strategy to provide good work for all ""for which government needs to be held accountable"" â¢ The government should avoid further increasing the the non-wage costs of employing a person, such as the apprenticeship levy A spokesperson for the meal delivery service Deliveroo, one of the companies at the heart of the gig-economy debate, said: ""We would welcome the opportunity to work with the government so we can end this trade off between flexibility and security."" Mr Taylor's report did not attack the gig economy. It said that flexibility in the workplace was important and had contributed to record high employment. He pointed to the official Labour Force Survey of March this year, which found that 68% of those on zero hours contracts did not want more hours. However, he said too many employers and businesses were relying on zero hours, short-hours or agency contracts, when they could be more forward thinking in their scheduling. This video can not be played Matthew Taylor: gig economy firms should pay national insurance on workers Earlier, Mr Taylor had told the BBC: ""There are too many people at work who are treated like cogs in a machine rather than being human beings, and there are too many people who don't see a route from their current job to progress and earn more and do better."" But he said working platform providers such as Uber had to demonstrate that workers signing on for hours of work would ""easily clear"" the minimum wage. Andrew Byrne, head of policy at Uber, said that the average driver took well over the National Living Wage. He also said Uber ""would welcome greater clarity in the law over different types of employment status"". Mr Taylor also suggested that cash payments should be phased-out. He said cash jobs such as window cleaning and decorating were worth up to Â£6bn a year and many were untaxed - something Mr Taylor says should be addressed. Mr Taylor said he did not want to ban cash payments outright, but hoped, over time, the increasing popularity of transaction platforms such as PayPal and Worldpay would see a shift from cash-in-hand work. ""In a few years time as we move to a more cashless economy, self employed people would be paid cashlessly  - like your window cleaner. At the same time they can pay taxes and save for their pension,"" he said. ""Most people who do pay for self-employed labour would like to know that that person is paying their taxes."" However, Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the review did not go far enough for the 4.5 million people in insecure work. She told the BBC: ""If it looks like a job or it smells like a job then it is a job, and the worker should be employed, and I think in those situations where a worker is carrying out work on behalf of an employer... they should not be exploited as a flexible workers."" Trade unions also said Mr Taylor had not tackled many of the issues facing workers. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""From what we've seen, this review is not the game-changer needed to end insecurity and exploitation at work.""

Email 'linked Russia to Trump Jr meeting',"Donald Trump Jr said ""no meaningful information"" on Mrs Clinton was provided Donald Trump Jr was told that material on Hillary Clinton offered by a Russian lawyer was part of Moscow's effort to help his father's election campaign,the New York Times has said,external. Publicist Rob Goldstone, who arranged the June 2016 meeting with the lawyer, stated this in an email, it reported. But the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, told NBC on Tuesday she never had any sensitive information on Mrs Clinton. US officials are investigating alleged Russian meddling in the US election. Separately on Tuesday, Russian officials said Moscow wasready to expel 30 US diplomats and seize US state propertyin retaliation for sanctions imposed by Barack Obama over Russian hacking of Democratic Party computers. The paper reports that three people with knowledge of the Goldstone email said it indicated the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information on Mrs Clinton. But the paper says there was no mention in the email of any wider effort by the Russian government to interfere in the election, nor was there any indication of a link to the hacking attack on the Democratic Party that was first reported a week after the meeting. Mr Goldstone has previously denied any knowledge of involvement by the Russian government. Rob Goldstone: The man behind the meeting Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC that the New York Times report was ""a very serious development"". ""It all warrants thorough investigation. Everyone who was in that meeting ought to come before our committee."" Mr Trump Jr'sstatement on the matter on Sunday,externaldid not indicate he had been told of any Russian government involvement. Lawyer Alan Futerfas, hired by Mr Trump Jr to represent him in the Russia-related investigations, described reports of the meeting as ""much ado about nothing"" and said his client had done nothing wrong. The president's son said,externalhe was ""happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know"". She was interviewed on NBC on Tuesday, saying that she ""never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that"". She said the meeting was set up by a man she did not know who told her by telephone to go to Trump Tower. When asked why Mr Trump Jr seemed to believe she had information about Mrs Clinton, she said: ""It is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such information. They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted."" Ms Veselnitskaya also denied ever having worked for the Russian government. It took place on 9 June 2016 at New York's Trump Tower, just two weeks after Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination. It is thought to be the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and members of President Trump's inner circle. The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was also at the meeting The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign head, Paul J Manafort, also attended the meeting with Ms Veselnitskaya. After theNew York Times,externalfirst reported the meeting on Saturday, Mr Trump Jr released a statement which confirmed that it had taken place but did not mention whether it was related to the presidential campaign. Who's who in the Trump clan Jared Kushner's dizzying array of portfolios Russia: The cloud over the White House However,another Times report,external, on Sunday, said Mr Trump Jr had agreed to the meeting after being offered information that would prove detrimental to Mrs Clinton. In his statement on Sunday, Mr Trump Jr said he had been asked to meet ""an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign"". Mr Trump Jr's statement continues: ""The woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs Clinton. Mr Trump Jr has denied issuing conflicting statements on the matter ""Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information."" Is this a smoking gun, and other Trump Jr questions WATCH: Did Russian meddle? No-one knows, says Trump Mr Trump Jr said the lawyer then changed subject to the Magnitsky Act and ""it became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along"". Adopted by Congress in 2012, the Magnitsky Act allows the US to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved in human rights violations. Ms Veselnitskaya is married to a Moscow government official and her clients include companies and individuals said to be close to the Kremlin. She has been at the forefront of a campaign - backed by the Russian state - to overturn the act. Trump-Russia scandal: How did we get here? In an interview on Monday, Mr Goldstone backed Mr Trump Jr's version of the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered ""just a vague, generic statement about the campaign's funding"" which was ""the most inane nonsense I've ever heard"". On Monday, Mr Trump Jrtweeted,externalsarcastically: ""Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent..."" He alsodenied,externalissuing conflicting statements. And helinked,externalto a piece in the New York Post headlined ""The Times 'exposÃ©' on Donald Trump Jr is a big yawn"". A spokesman for President Trump's legal team said the president was ""not aware of and did not attend"" the meeting. Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Whether by plan or happenstance, Donald Trump Jr is stumbling into an increasingly dire situation. The pattern has been set. The New York Times runs a story, Trump Jr issues his response, then the noose tightens. First he said the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was about adoption issues. Then the Times reports that Trump Jr thought he would learn damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The presidential son says he was conducting routine opposition research. Then the Times reports that he was told it was the Russian government itself that was coming to his father's aid. In a traditional campaign, a foreign government's attempt to offer incriminating information about an opponent - or even the hint of such an overture - would set off all kinds of alarms. The FBI would have been notified. Senior staff would have insulated themselves from incrimination. The Trump team was not a conventional campaign. And time and time again, it made novice mistakes or, more ominously, took unprecedented risks. Its candidate prevailed, but it has led to countless political headaches. Now it appears the president's own family, and his presidency itself, could be in peril. They have only themselves to blame.

Bake Off's Nadiya had 'token Muslim' fears,"Great British Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain feared she was seen as the ""token Muslim"" when she appeared on the BBC TV show, she has revealed. The champion of the 2015 series told theRadio Times,externalreligion was ""incidental"" to her and she ""struggled"" with it being so tied to her identity. The negative comments she received ""shocked"" her, she told the magazine. But she said those people were in the ""minority"" and most of the UK had reacted to her with ""open arms"". Hussain, 32, told Radio Times magazine: ""I certainly didn't enter a baking show in the hope of representing anyone. ""Being a Muslim for me was incidental, but from the day the show was launched, I was 'the 30-year-old Muslim' and that became my identity."" She told Radio Times it was difficult to adjust to that ""identity"" being forced upon her. ""I struggled at the beginning, because I thought: 'Am I the token Muslim?' ""I'd never, in all my years, been labelled like that. ""I heard it constantly, 'Oh, she's the Muslim, she's the Muslim'... ""And I was so shocked by the amount of negative comments I got."" Hussain will be one of the hosts of the Big Family Cooking Showdown, which airs in the autumn Hussain, a second-generation British Bangladeshi, said she hears and sees ""negativity"" but that it does not affect her as those sharing such comments are in the minority. ""We are so much more accepting than that: I never realised Britain had such open arms,"" she said. Since winning Bake Off, Hussain has appeared in her own series, The Chronicles Of Nadiya. She is set to launch her new BBC TV show, Nadiya's British Food Adventure, on 17 July and will release a book of the same name alongside it.

The anti-immigrant party trying to recruit immigrants,"Although their manifesto calls for a near-total halt to immigration, the far-right political party Britain First is now actively trying to appeal to Polish immigrants. They are a fringe group, with no elected officials at any level, but Britain First has about 1.9 million Facebook likes - more than any other UK political party. And now they're trying to use that social media footprint to make explicit appeals to Polish immigrants living in the UK. A string of Britain First videos that seem designed to attract a Polish audience have appeared online. Recent ones include a video from Jacek Miedlar, a Polish far-right former priest, an interview with a Polish media outlet that has over half a million views, and videos by Polish Britain First supporters encouraging others to support the party. Miedlar, who has over 25,000 subscribers on YouTube, is an activist known for his anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic views. He has tried to travel to the UK twice this year to attend Britain First rallies but was stopped by UK authorities. The videos have been posted despite Britain First's anti-immigration manifesto which calls for cash payments to foreigners to leave the UK, a complete halt to immigration except for people who marry British citizens, and a call to make it ""an act of treason to implement any policy or measure, or sign any agreement, that facilitates and/or results in significant numbers of foreigners entering the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom with the aim of settling."" WATCH:#BBCtrending: The rise of Britain First online WATCH:BBC Three: We Want Our Country Back LISTEN:on BBC Trending radio Visit BBC Trending onFacebook,external Despite the party's hard line on immigration, Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen told BBC Trending that post-Brexit, all European immigrants who are already in the UK should be allowed to stay, as long as they aren't criminals or Muslims. The party also supports a total ban on Islam in the UK, a policy they believe will attract some support from Polish migrants. Poles form thelargest immigrant communityin Britain. There were an estimated 831,000 Polish-born residents in 2015 - a jump of almost 750,000 compared with the number in 2004, the year Poland joined the European Union. Rafal Pankowski from the Polish anti-hate charity Never Again says the party's attempts to appeal to UK-based Polish people may have something to do with what he perceives to be a trend towards the far-right in Polish society. ""We have been witnessing a rise in far-right activity in Poland itself as well,"" he says. ""And unfortunately the Polish people in the UK have been victims of discrimination and hate crime especially since the Brexit referendum. And some of them have been turning to Polish far-right nationalist groups for a sense of belonging."" A number of videos have appeared on the Britain First Youtube channel seemingly aimed at the UK's Polish population Wiktor Moszczynski, a former spokesperson for the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, agrees that there has been a spike of far-right activity amongst Polish people living in the UK, but says that such activity has recently died down. ""At the moment the trend tends to be towards the right in Polish society, both in Poland and to some extent here in the UK, but when I say right that doesn't necessarily mean radical right,"" Moszczynski tells BBC Trending radio. ""Suddenly these groups began turning up in demonstrations in the UK over the last two or three years generally wearing Polish fascist symbols, but what I do have to say is I have not seen anything of this in the last year,"" he says. ""I have been spoken to by the police who are very concerned about these groups, so we do know that there may still be an undercurrent. But at the moment the problem seems to have been in remission, temporarily at least."" He says a majority of the younger Polish community are resistant to the influence of far-right groups, including Britain First, but nevertheless the far-right spike is ""not pleasant, particularly at a time when we're trying to build up sympathy for the Poles living in this country on the way they've been treated after the Brexit vote."" A recentreport,externalfrom the campaigning group Hope Not Hate said the largest and most organised neo-Nazi group in the UK is the National Rebirth of Poland. The presence of groups like these, Hope Not Hate says, has fuelled extreme far-right activists. Britain First rarely runs candidates. When they do they receive a small amount of the vote, such as the 1.2% of the vote party leader Paul Golding attracted in the 2016 London mayoral election. Its outsized social media following is due to a combination of factors includingpaid advertising,external, acore group of dedicated followers,external, and the use of less controversial posts - for instance messages encouraging people to support the troops or the royal family - and other tactics to drive up the numbers of likes. The group's Facebook page has also become something of an international hub people attracted to its anti-Islam message. According to an analysis by Trending, less than half (44%) of the group's Facebook likes come from accounts based inside the UK, with large numbers of likes coming from the US, Australia and Canada. Around 23,000 of the page's likes come from Polish accounts. By way of comparison, 87% of the Labour Party's 1 million likes come from UK accounts. The figure for the Conservative Party (more than 600,000 likes) is 78%. Fransen claims the party has a ""growing number"" of Polish members and supporters, but refused to provide membership figures. She says the party's low appeal at the ballot box can be explained by the fact that the group has been concentrating on direct action, including turning up at the homes and offices of elected officials. Former Polish wrestling champion Marian Lukasik (left) called for the assassination of Angela Merkel over her country's refugee policy Pankowski believes the membership figures are very small, yet says his organisation saw via social media a number of Polish flags and Polish people at a Britain First rally in Birmingham last month. In one video from the event, a UK-based Polish former wrestling champion Marian Lukasik, can be heard advocating the assassination of German Chancellor Angela Merkel because of her country's refugee policy. Lukasik has recently made other videos in support of Britain First. ""Britain First decided to attract support among the Polish community in the UK against Muslims, and a small section of the Polish community in the UK is probably prone to such messages,"" Pankowski says. ""But obviously it's ironic because Polish migrants and Muslim migrants in the UK actually have a lot in common in terms of the everyday challenges they face.""

'Exploitation' exposed at cosmetics chain,"In the undercover investigation, a senior manager demanded staff work six days a week Some workers at a cosmetics chain in major London shopping sites, including Westfield, are getting paid as little as Â£2.05 an hour, a BBC investigation has found. The month-long undercover investigation found people were made to sign up as self-employed when legally they should have been classified as employees. Soap and Co. said it was ""extremely concerned"" about the allegations. It said it planned to review the employment status of workers. The company describes its products as ""an ideal balance between beauty, health and simple indulgence"". During the BBC London-Newsnight investigation, an undercover reporter spent one month working for the company, documenting the treatment of staff and their employment conditions. They were made to be at work for a minimum of six days per week, for around 60 hours, at the firm's stores. This video can not be played The BBC filmed undercover for this investigation. Watch Guy Lynn's report for BBC Newsnight Workers are paid by commission based on their sales. Some earned better under the arrangement than others. The BBC's undercover reporter was paid Â£199 in commission for 97 hours' work - equivalent to an hourly rate of Â£2.05. The national minimum wage ranges from Â£4.05 for under-18s to Â£7.50 for someone aged over 25. The BBC also asked the two managers that the undercover reporter worked for about their understanding of the working relationship. They did not respond. The BBC was told similar arrangements were in place at the company's affiliated Sakare outlets in Mayfair and Covent Garden. One employee said: ""I cannot move, I'm tired, my body hurts."" Another said: ""My lower back hurts. I'm smashed physically and mentally. This is not normal."" Fines were handed out if workers were caught checking their mobile phones. Soap and Co. mainly recruits workers from Eastern Europe, and some staff paid for cramped accommodation with shared bedrooms. Partner at employment law firm, BDBF, Arpita Dutt described what had happened as a ""flagrant breach"" of minimum wage legislation. She said: ""This does seem to be exploitation of workers. ""It reminds me of those days where we used to have master-servant relationships."" Staff had prescriptive hours, they were not allowed to work elsewhere, or to substitute another ""self-employed"" individual to cover a shift. The investigation found workers had to sign contracts saying they were self-employed. This Soap and Co. manager fined staff for looking at mobile phones But lawyers have told the BBC that the high level of control exercised by managers over workers meant in reality they were employees. This means they should have been paid the minimum wage and a host of other in-work benefits - including sick pay and holiday pay. ""What we're finding is a real case of abuse... a whole raft of employment legislation that has been with us for 30 years is being cast aside in one blink of an eye,"" said Meredith Hurst, a partner at employment lawyers Thomas Mansfield. ""I find it quite shocking. ""This is a very extreme case of control over an individual, and there is no doubt in my mind these individuals are employees. ""I would say that what we're seeing is a sham situation."" Workers being ""self-employed"" also saves a company paying national insurance. Neither HM Revenue & Customs nor the Office of National Statistics publishes official figures for bogus self-employment. But the overall PAYE tax gap - the difference between the amount of tax that should theoretically be collected from people's pay packets and what is actually taken - is currently Â£2.8bn. In a statement, Soap and Co. said: ""Soap and Co. takes their responsibility under UK law very seriously. We are therefore extremely concerned to learn about the allegations made by some individuals about the company's working arrangements. ""As a consequence we are reviewing those allegations and the implications (if any) regarding the employment status of those who work with us."" Westfield said it was ""concerned"" about the findings of the BBC investigation, but said it ""does not comment on specific allegations relating to individual retailers"". It said: ""Retailers in our centres directly manage their employees, independently of Westfield."" Update: The Soap Co. has asked us to point out that it has no connection to the company Soap and Co. which features in this report End 'bogus' self-employment, MPs say Soap & Co.

US commander: 'Iraq must stop IS 2.0',"This video can not be played Soldiers and police officers cheered as PM Abadi joined the celebrations The senior US commander in Iraq has warned that the war against so-called Islamic State (IS) is not over, despite a ""historic"" victory in Mosul. Lt Gen Stephen Townsend told the BBC Iraqis needed to unite to ensure IS was defeated across the rest of Iraq. He also urged the government to reach out to the Sunni Arab minority. ""If we're to keep... ISIS 2.0 from emerging, the Iraqi government is going to have to do something pretty significantly different,"" he said. ""They're going to have to reach out and reconcile with the Sunni population, and make them feel like their government in Baghdad represents them."" IS (also known as ISIS) seized control of much of northern and western Iraq three years ago after exploiting widespread Sunni anger at the sectarian policies of the country's Shia Arab-led government. Mosul defeat a blow to IS, but not the end Haunted faces of families freed from IS Mosul's Sunnis fear post-IS future Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who has promised to bridge the gap between the two Muslim communities,formally declared victoryover IS in Mosul on Monday. Standing alongside troops at a base in the city, he announced ""the end and the failure and the collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism "". A member of Iraq's security forces holds an IS flag as he celebrates in Mosul The US-led Coalition that provided air and ground support to Iraqi security forces confirmed they had Mosul ""firmly under their control"" but noted that areas of the Old City still had to be cleared of bombs and possible IS fighters in hiding. Later, US President Donald Trump sent his congratulations to his Iraqi counterpart,saying,externalMosul had been ""liberated from its long nightmare under the rule of ISIS"". ""We mourn the thousands of Iraqis brutally killed by ISIS and the millions of Iraqis who suffered,"" he added, promising to seek the ""total destruction"" of the jihadists. Lt Gen Stephen Townsend is the commander of the US-led operation against IS On Tuesday, UN special representative Jan Kubissaid,externalthe ""historic"" victory provided an ""outstanding opportunity for Iraq to rise again strong and united"". But he warned that reconstruction work had to run parallel to a ""robust political process to conduct elections and achieve national and societal reconciliation and rebuild the social fabric"". ""The peace... must be based on solid foundations of unity, co-operation, justice, tolerance and co-existence starting at the societal, community and tribal levels to prevent falling back into the past and risk disastrous consequences,"" he added. The battle for Mosul lasted almost nine months, left large areas in ruins, killed thousands of civilians and displaced more than 920,000 others. The UN says 5,000 buildings have been damaged and 490 destroyed in the Old City alone This video can not be played The BBC reports from Mosul where rescue teams are searching for survivors The UN says that of the 54 residential districts in the western half of Mosul - where the Old City is located - 15 are heavily damaged and at least 23 moderately damaged. In areport,externalpublished on Tuesday, Amnesty International said Iraqi and coalition forces had used unnecessarily powerful weapons in Mosul and failed to take adequate measures to protect civilians. Where is 'Islamic State' leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? After Mosul: The Iraqi towns still under IS control A coalition spokesperson described the allegations as ""irresponsible and an insult"" to the troops who had died freeing civilians in Mosul from IS rule. Amnesty also documented abuses by IS, including the use of human shields. IS militants overran Mosul in June 2014, before seizing control of large parts of northern and western Iraq. The following month, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his first and only public appearance as IS leader at the city's Great Mosque of al-Nuri, and gave a speech proclaiming the creation of a ""caliphate"". IS blew up the mosque last month as Iraqi troops prepared to retake it. IS still controls territory in three areas of Iraq - around Hawija, 130km (80 miles) south-east of Mosul, around Tal Afar, 65km west, and from Ana to Al-Qaim in the Euphrates river valley, 250km to the south-west. It also holds a string of towns along the Euphrates in Syria, including Albu Kamal and Mayadin, but its stronghold of Raqqa is besieged by US-backed fighters.

Italian tourist trap turned into ghost town by earthquake,"From a distance Castelluccio looks the same as it has done for 1,000 years, a beautiful hilltop town in the midst of one of Italy's most celebrated plains, the Piano Grande. But even from the road below the village you can see the buildings are shattered, roofs collapsed, more reminiscent of a war zone than the Umbrian countryside. Nearly a year on from the earthquakes which devastated this region of central Italy, visitors have just been allowed back into the so-called ""zona rossa"" near Castellucio, although not the village itself. The red zone marks areas still regarded as too dangerous to visit but an exception was made for people to see ""La Fioritura"". This is a spectacular showing of wild flowers in the meadows of the Piano Grande. We joined a convoy of around 40 cars to be taken through army road blocks high up into the Sibillini mountains. Cornflowers and poppies colour the 16 sq km plain surrounded by the Sibillini mountains Village after village showed the impact of the earthquakes that hit this region, first in August 2016 and then again in October. Why so many houses collapsed Italy quake: Those who lost their lives Why multiple quakes are hitting Italy Italy reels after fourth quake in months These villages look as if the earthquake had just happened, instead of nearly a year ago. Most of the people who lived there have been moved to hotels on the coast. We left our cars on top of a high ridge and trekked for two hours down on to the plain, overlooked by the jagged peak of Monte Vettore, which marks the boundary between Umbria and Le Marche. A deep, black crack could be seen high up on the mountainside which had appeared after the earthquake. The crack on the mountain, the lower of two lines, is up to a metre wide As we came down on to the plain, extraordinary splashes of colour came into view, reminiscent of an Impressionist canvas. Meadows were tinted red with swathes of poppies, others bright blue with cornflowers. Normally there would be 10,000 visitors a day to photograph the splendours of the Fioritura, we were told. This year it is in the hundreds. There are more beehives than people in the fields. The Piano Grande's fields are unusually deserted this year The 16 sq km (6 sq miles) Piano Grande - literally the big plain - was once a glacier lake and is surrounded by mountains. It is here that the farmers of Castelluccio plant their lentils, a crop that has become famous amongst foodies around the world. This year they were only allowed in by convoy to prepare for the season ahead. No-one is allowed up into this ghost village at 1,452m (4,760 ft). Below what has been his home for generations, Lorenzo Caponecchi is selling lentils and wild peas in a stall by the side of the road. I wondered why it was taking time for rebuilding to begin. Was it because these were such old buildings or was it a question of money? Lorenzo and Monia run a stall in the shadow of Castelluccio No, said his partner Monia Falzetti angrily. ""It's the state and the politicians. There is plenty of money from the EU but we aren't seeing any of it."" Other former inhabitants of Castelluccio are so angry at the lack of help that they believe visitors should not be allowed into the Piano Grande. It is the tourism of rubble, they proclaim. Rubble tourism? The remains of homes in the village of Trisungo But the local mayor told La Repubblica that the flowers of the Piano Grande do not just belong to the people of Castelluccio. They are the world's heritage and, besides, more tourism will help the local economy. Side by side in this unique valley, you can see the sublime beauty of nature at its most spectacular but also the forces of nature at its most destructive. In a few moments here houses that existed for hundreds of years were torn down and reverted to stones.

Did NHS stats become a political football?,"NHS monthly performance stats are not everyone's idea of a gripping read. Spreadsheets and tables are buried in the NHS England website and hard to find for the uninitiated. But they amount to a vitally important barometer of the pressures in A&E units and the waits experienced by patients for both emergency care and routine surgery. A set of data due during the General Election campaign was postponed. Correspondence seen by the BBC reveals how politically sensitive this decision was. Whitehall conventions ban the release of controversial announcements during election campaigns. Data releases for which the release date has not already been published will be held till after polling day. But official stats with a publication date already in the calendar will be put out as normal. The NHS England monthly performance data had been carded some time before for June 8th which, it later turned out, was to be polling day. A Freedom of Information request by BBC News has revealed delicate internal discussions about whether or not to press on with publication on that day. An official from the UK Statistics Authority advises Government bodies and departments in an email that statistical publications of ""significant public interest"" due on June 8th should be rescheduled - ""publishing on polling day presents difficulties in communicating data clearly and fully, not least because of restrictions in place around reporting."" Intriguingly an NHS England manager responds with a concern that ""changing the timing of this release in either direction would, to me, create the perception of political interference which tends me towards keeping the release for the original date."" The unnamed UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) official, acting on behalf of the National Statistician, warns again of the difficulties with communicating data on polling day and continued: ""If you were challenged about political interference, the response would be that this is about ensuring orderly release"". The NHS manager comes back questioning how the release of data on polling day would not be orderly and asking for more of an explanation of the difficulties releasing data that day. There is another reference to ""reticence"" about changing the date because of how that might be perceived. The UKSA official points out that broadcast media are not permitted to report anything about the election on polling day and the Whitehall conventions prevent any corrections of mistakes by journalists.  NHS England then decides to announce a 24 hour delay in publication till June 9th and puts out a statement saying the decision was taken on the recommendation of the National Statistician, UK Statistics Authority. The figures, which came out on June 9th, revealed a slight improvement in A&E performance (patients seen within four hours), but also the highest number of patients waiting longer than 18 weeks for routine surgery since September 2008. The postponed publication will not warrant a mention in the history books and in the hurly burly of the election campaign the decision did not generate much of a political row beyond social media. But the email exchange lifts a lid on the world of politics and data. It raises questions about whether the data should have been brought forward one day instead of delayed - and whether snap general elections should derail planned data releases. All this comes a short time after NHS England quietly changed the timing of future data. In 2015, the organisation controversially moved from publishing weekly A&E waiting time figures to monthly. The logic given was that this would be in line with other statistics, such as waits for routine surgery. The result was a delay of six weeks so, for example, the key January A&E data was not published till March. A leak of internal NHS A&E data to the BBC's Faye Kirkland in January resulted in the intervention of the UK Statistics Authority. NHS England was criticised for circulating weekly data inside the organisation but delaying official publication for six weeks. The organisation has now decided to cut the delay till two weeks so, for example, from August this year, A&E data for July will be published. Official statistics allow patients and the media to assess the performance of the NHS. Delays are not in anyone's interest. Recent revelations suggest that the timing of these stats has not been as straightforward as it might have been.
