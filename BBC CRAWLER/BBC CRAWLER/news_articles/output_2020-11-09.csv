"How Wales would use Covid vaccine 'not yet decided'""We will get our population share"", says First Minister Mark Drakeford.Wales","The drug's developers described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"" How any future Covid vaccine will be used in Wales will be decided when it becomes available, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Pfizer and BioNTech have announced the development ofan effective Covid-19 vaccinebut Boris Johnson cautioned it was ""very, very early days"". Mr Drakeford said the UK government would buy the vaccine on behalf of the whole of the UK. ""We will get our population share,"" he said. ""That's what's already been agreed and when the vaccine comes to Wales, it'll be the Welsh Government's responsibility to store the vaccine and then to distribute it so that it can be used for the Welsh population."" He told BBC Wales Today: ""We then decide how to use it, and make sure that it's done in the best possible way."" Covid vaccine: First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection Covid: Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? Covid vaccine: Boris Johnson warns of 'several more hurdles' Earlier, Mr Drakeford welcomed the breakthrough but cautioned it was unlikely to represent a ""magic bullet"". Speaking at Monday's Welsh Government press conference, he said: ""It is good news, of course, if any of the vaccines in trials are making progress. ""[But] I think you would always want to read carefully what a particular competitor in this field says on their own behalf. ""I'm not going to be tempted today, as I've tried not to be tempted throughout coronavirus, to suggest that this somehow means that there is a magic bullet on the horizon and coronavirus is about to disappear out of our lives."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson says a new vaccine is good news but warns the UK not to ""slacken our resolve"" Mr Johnson said the vaccine had ""cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go"". He warned people not to""rely on this news as a solution""to the pandemic. ""The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at a critical moment,"" he said. England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said he was ""hopeful"" the first vaccine could be seen by Christmas and there would be a ""much better horizon"" by spring. Speaking alongside Mr Johnson at a Downing Street news conference, Prof Van-Tam said that there was more work to be done before it became available to the public. ""This is a very important scientific breakthrough. I am certain of that,"" he said. The vaccine has been hailed as a ""milestone"" by many scientists. It has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries with no safety concerns raised. A limited number of people may get the vaccine this year. Pfizer and BioNTech say they will have enough safety data by the third week of November to take their vaccine to regulators. Until it has been approved it will not be possible for countries to begin their vaccination campaigns. The two companies say they will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. Each person needs two doses. The UK should get 10 million doses by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered.

LiveLiveBiden urges mask-wearing as Trump legal push looms1 minute ago,"President-elect Joe Biden made his first appointments, naming a group of scientists and experts who will lead his administration's response to Covid-19 However, President Donald Trump is still planning legal challenges to the results in some key states Biden says it will take time to develop a vaccine, and urges Americans to wear a mask to reduce Covid-19 transmissions Biden and President Trump both welcome news that a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is 90% effective Biden advisers are discussing who can fill key posts after the Democrat pledged the most diverse cabinet in history Results from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding Edited by Helier Cheung Thank you for joining us for our ongoing coverage of the 2020 US presidential election. It's been nearly a week since the 3 November election day, and there are another 10 weeks to go until Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

"Parler tops app charts in wake of Trump defeatThe self-styled ""free speech"" application topped US download charts in the wake of the election.Technology","Twitter alternative Parler has become the most-downloaded app in the United States as conservatives flock to the self-styled ""free speech"" app after the US election. It follows a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook in recent days. Prominent investor Dan Bongino said the service was adding ""thousands to users per minute"" on Sunday. But the sudden boom also caused technical issues for users. Some reported problems registering and a slowdown of the app as its servers attempted to deal with the influx. Parler founder John Matze said the app had added two million new users in a day, and increased its daily active users four-fold over the weekend. ""Don't worry, the app isn't normally this slow,"" he promised new arrivals. Some of Parler's most popular users are Republicans and media personalities While Mr Trump himself is not a user, the platform already features several high-profile contributors following earlier bursts of growth this year. Texas Senator Ted Cruz boasts 2.6 million followers on the platform, while Fox News hosts Mark Levin and Sean Hannity each have more than two million. Newsmax, a conservative-leaning news outlet, also crept near the top of the charts at the same time. Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among Trump supporters and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. It is one of a handful of start-up social networks - such as MeWe or Gab - trying to appeal to disgruntled users of the biggest platforms. Parler is ahead of bigger, better-funded apps in Apple's US download charts Mr Trump has been among Twitter's most vocal critics and has seenmany of his tweets hidden and labelled as misleadingduring the election period. Named after the French verb ""to speak"", the app has very similar functions to Twitter. Posts can be replied to with comments, ""echoed"" in a way similar to retweeting, and upvoted instead of liked. Is social media really biased against Republicans? How a misleading post made it to Trump's Twitter Parler says it keeps bans to an ""absolute minimum"", and does not fact-check posts. Parler does, however, ban some things, including pornography, threats of violence, and support for terrorism. Following Joe Biden's projected win in the presidential election - and Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud - many conservatives encouraged each other to leave Twitter and Facebook for Parler. On Facebook, multiple events and groups with thousands of members are encouraging a ""mass exit"" from Facebook to Parler from Friday 13 November. The planned exodus has been mocked by left-leaning Twitter users as an escape to a ""safe space"" devoid of challenge or criticism. The light-touch approach to content moderation means that misinformation can spread more easily on the platform than on those with stricter rules. By Shayan Sardarizadeh, disinformation reporter The first ""mass migration"" of right-wing users from major social networks to Parler happened in June, after a number of accounts that posted misleading content about Covid-19 and George Floyd protests got banned from the bigger social media sites. Thousands of supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory have joined in in the last few weeks, after Facebook, Instagram and YouTube took sweeping action against them in early October. Followers believe President Trump is waging a secret war against a ""deep state"" elite of Satan-worshipping paedophiles. Facebook's ban on organisations that promote violence has also forced groups such as the Proud Boys and Boogaloo Bois to rebuild on Parler. Who are Boogaloo Bois, antifa and Proud Boys? Proud Boys becomes LGBT trend on social media However, platforms like Parler have become an echo-chamber for a relatively limited group of like-minded users. That's why many users who have migrated to Parler make repeated attempts to create new accounts to return to major networks - as they know that's where their content can get widespread traction. While the content posted on Parler is usually not as extreme as other self-proclaimed ""free speech"" platforms like Gab and MeWe, it is the home of many posts that would either be flagged as misleading or removed by major platforms - on topics like the election, Covid-19, child trafficking and vaccines. Senator Cruz,who recently lambasted Twitter boss Jack Dorseyat a congressional committee hearing,said in June that he had joined Parler,externalbecause social networks use their power ""to silence conservatives and promote their radical left-wing agenda"". This video can not be played ""Who put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report?"" Twitter's Jack Dorsey is quizzed by Senator Ted Cruz Tweeting on Sunday, Mr Levin encouraged his followers to ""hurry"" and join Parler because ""I may not stay at Facebook or Twitter if they continue censoring me"". But technology analyst Benedict Evans questioned how long-standing such a shift would be. ""How many core Trump voters will now think that Fox is too left-wing and Twitter or Facebook too controlled?"" he said.

Jihadists 'behead more than 50' in Mozambique,"Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, many of which have been destroyed, during the three-year insurgency (file photo) More than 50 people have been beheaded in northern Mozambique by militant Islamists, state media report. The militants turned a football pitch in a village into an ""execution ground"", where they decapitated and chopped bodies, other reports said. Several people were also beheaded in another village, state media reported. The beheadings are the latest in a series of gruesome attacks that the militants have carried out in gas-rich Cabo Delgado province since 2017. Africa Live: Updates from around the continent Is Mozambique the latest outpost of Islamic State? How ruby smugglers nurtured jihadists Up to 2,000 people have been killed and about 430,000 have been left homeless in the conflict in the mainly-Muslim province. The militants are linked to the Islamic State (IS) group, giving it a foothold in southern Africa. The group has exploited poverty and unemployment to recruit youth in their fight to establish Islamic rule in the area. Many locals complain that they have benefited little from the province's ruby and gas industries. The BBC's Jose Tembe reports from the capital, Maputo, that the latest attack was probably the worst carried out by the militants. Many people are shocked, and they are calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, he adds. The gunmen chanted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"", in English), fired shots, and set homes alight when they raided Nanjaba village on Friday night, the state-owned Mozambique News Agency quoted survivors as saying. Two people were beheaded in the village and several women abducted, the news agency added. A separate group of militants carried out another brutal attack on Muatide village, where they beheaded more than 50 people, the news agency reported. Villagers who tried to flee were caught, and taken to the local football pitch where they were beheaded and chopped to pieces in an atrocity carried out from Friday night to Sunday, privately-run Pinnacle News reported. This video can not be played WATCH: The Mozambique conflict explained Mozambique's government has appealed for international help to curb the insurgency, saying its troops need specialised training. In April, more than 50 people were beheaded or shot dead in an attack on a village in Cabo Delgado and earlier this month, nine people were beheaded in the same province. Rights groups say Mozambican security forces have also carried out human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture and killings, during operations to curb the insurgency.

Father jailed over death of blind teenage son,"John Doak admitted manslaughter of his 15-year-old son who died as a teenager A father who admitted causing the death of his teenage son by shaking him as a baby has been jailed for three years. Jack Mitchell, 15, from Harwich, Essex, died in March 2016 from a pulmonary infection and pneumonia. His biological father John Doak, 37, of Spalding, Lincolnshire, had denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Chelmsford Crown Court. Justice John Cavanagh said only Doak knew what happened as he was alone with the child when the incident happened. David Emanuel, defending Doak, said that according to an expert report ""what probably happened was the loss of control temporarily while trying to stop him crying"". Justice Cavanagh said Jack suffered severe brain damage, required 24-hour care, was blind and unable to talk, had limited ability to move and had a ""very poor... if non-existent"" quality of life as a result of the assault. ""The cause of his death was a shaking-type assault that you inflicted on Jack many years previously, on May 22 2001, when he was only four months old. ""In the intervening period, Jack suffered from brain damage and from other very serious health problems that were the direct result of your assault on him. ""However, I sentence you on the basis that you did not intend to kill him or to cause him really serious harm."" Mr Emanuel added that unemployed lorry driver Doak was married with three children and three step-children. He said Doak ""grieves for (Jack) every day"" and was otherwise of good character.

"Brexit will be 'brutal' for UK, warns ex-PM Major","Brexit may be ""even more brutal than expected"" due to the UK's negotiating ""failures"", Sir John Major has said. In a speech in London, the ex-prime minister said the UK's ""inflexibility"" and ""threats"" towards the EU would make future trade ""less profitable"". And he warned of the ""corrosive"" impact to the UK's reputation of a proposed law giving ministers the power to over-ride aspects of the Brexit agreement. It came asthe House of Lords rejectedparts of the Internal Market Bill. Peers removed a series of clauses which would give the UK the right to disregard obligations in the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in relation to Northern Ireland, defeating the government twice by huge margins. Ministers have said they do not intend to use the powers but they are needed as a ""safety net"" in case disputes over the agreement's implementation cannot be resolved by other means. The government said it would seek to re-insert the measures when the bill returns to the House of Commons, where they have already been approved. UK-EU trade talks resume in London 'Significant differences' in Brexit talks, says PM Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future Sir John, who was an outspoken critic of the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January, said this ""was a slippery slope down which no democratic government should ever travel"". In a pre-recorded lecture at Middle Temple, Sir John - who led the UK from 1990 to 1997 - urged Parliament to resist measures in the bill which he said threatened essential liberties and could place ministers above the law. ""This action is unprecedented in all our history - and for good reason. It has damaged our reputation around the world,"" he said. ""Lawyers everywhere are incredulous that the UK - often seen as the very cradle of the rule of law - could give themselves the power to break the law."" Sir John said he was not optimistic about the prospects for trade talks between the UK and EU, which resumed in London on Monday, saying the UK was not being ""frank"" about the possible outcomes. The UK and EU are in a race against the clock to secure an agreement before 31 December, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union at the end of the post-Brexit transition period. The UK has said it is hopeful of securing a comprehensive deal modelled on the EU's arrangement with Canada, but Sir John said it was ""disingenuous"" of ministers to pretend they were not seeking far deeper commitments in key areas, such as energy and aviation. He said he feared, as a result, the process would end up either with no deal or a ""flimsy and bare-bones"" agreement that created new barriers to trade and would be a ""wretched betrayal"" of the promises made to British voters during the 2016 referendum. ""These costs and complexities are the certain legacy of Brexit,"" he said. ""This is as a result of our negotiating failure - and it is a failure. ""Because of our bombast, our blustering, our threats and our inflexibility - our trade will be less profitable, our Treasury poorer, our jobs fewer, and our future less prosperous."" He added: ""It now seems that on 1 January next year, Brexit may be even more brutal than anyone expected."" Sir John also warned that Brexit divisions increased the risk of the United Kingdom breaking up. While he remained an avowed unionist, he said the UK government could find it difficult to stave off demands for another independence referendum in Scotland and should consider a two-stage process, where a vote on the principle of independence was followed by another on the terms of separation offered to the Scottish people. The ex-PM said demands for another Scottish independence referendum may be hard to ignore In his speech, recorded before Joe Biden's election as US president was confirmed on Saturday, Sir John also warned that the UK's departure from the EU made it ""less relevant"" to its oldest and strongest ally. While the UK had enormous strengths and assets, he said it was ""no longer a great power"" in a world dominated by the US, China and the EU and was struggling to ""punch above its weight"" on the international stage. ""Our hefty international influence rested on our history and reputation, buttressed by our membership of the European Union and our close alliance with the United States. ""Suddenly, we are no longer an irreplaceable bridge between Europe and America."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is looking forward to workingwith President-elect Biden to uphold the two countries ""common values and interests"". On post-Brexit trade talks, he said on Sunday that the ""outlines"" of an agreement were clear and a deal was ""there to be done"". Sir John's warning about the future of the union was welcomed by former Tory cabinet minister David Lidington, who told the BBC the government needed a ""positive story to tell"" if it wanted to avoid Scottish independence. ""The government has not paid the attention to the union - and the threat to the union - that in an ideal world and in different circumstances they would have wanted to,"" he said. But Mr Lidington - who was responsible for relations with the devolved administrations in Theresa May's government - said he believed Sir John was mistaken to raise the possibility of multiple referendums as this ""took the debate onto the territory the SNP want"".

'I've been abused because my name is Corona',"Corona Newton used to only have to put up with jokes about beer Corona Newton has endured jokes about her unusual name for as long as she can remember. Beer-related nicknames have followed the 49-year-old civil servant since before she was legally able to sup her first pint. ""People used to call me Guinness and Budweiser,"" she said. ""That I could always laugh off. But this is more frustrating, especially when it gets aggressive."" Corona lives in Oldham, which currently has the highest number of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in England. Residents of the Greater Manchester town have endured some of the toughest enhanced lockdown measures for weeks. Corona said no-one takes her seriously when they discover her Christian name, while she cannot book a table or open an account without staff giving her peculiar looks. ""People have said to me 'as if I'm going to listen to somebody named after a virus',"" she said. Find out how many cases there are in your area England's coronavirus hotspots in maps Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? Mum-of-five Corona has even been plagued by ""really nasty"" cold callers, with people just saying things like: ""Is that the virus?"" While driving her daughter to the dentist last week, she picked up a highly abusive phone call from a man who swore at her. She said: ""He screamed down the phone at me 'what does it feel like to [do] the world over?'"" Her name also leads to awkward situations, like at a recent parents' evening when a teacher thought her daughter was being rude by saying Corona. According to the Office for National Statistics, fewer than three girls were named Corona in 2019 and it has not been recorded in the top 100 girls names at any time from 1904-2019. So how did Corona come by her unusual moniker? The name comes from the Latin word for crown and also means the aura around stars or the moon. It is quite a common Spanish surname but less so as a forename. Growing up in Drogheda, a town on the east coast of Ireland, Corona said she stood out for not sounding Catholic despite being named after the missionary midwife who delivered her. ""My parents couldn't decide between Sarah and Catherine, so they ended up choosing Corona,"" she said. Before news bulletins became dominated by the pandemic, Corona said it was much easier to have a sense of humour about her name. ""I had my hen do in Blackpool not long before lockdown started in March,"" she said. ""We played 'guess my name' with strangers and no-one managed it, so they all had to buy me shots."" Despite Covid-19 scuppering her wedding plans for now, as well as any dreams of a massive 50th birthday party, Corona said 2020 would certainly be a year to remember. ""In these tough times, if I've brightened someone's day by having a funny name, so be it,"" she said. ""At least no-one will ever forget me.""

Britain's 'most bashed' bridges revealed,"Drivers regularly misjudge the 4.6m (15ft) bridge in Hinckley A low bridge in Leicestershire has been dubbed the ""most bashed"" in Britain after being struck 25 times in a year. The Watling Street railway bridge on the A5 in Hinckley saw crashes almost once a fortnight on average in the year to the end of March, Network Rail said. Its list of the most commonly struck bridges also included structures in Dudley, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. However, the organisation said there had been an 11% decrease in bridge crashes compared to the previous year. Lorry drivers are being encouraged to check the height of their vehicles Network Rail said there was an average of five railway bridge crashes per day nationally, with repairs costing an average of Â£13,000 per strike. It has started a new awareness campaign ahead of an expected increase in traffic encouraging lorry drivers to familiarise themselves with the height of their vehicle before setting off. Chairman Sir Peter Hendy said: ""We've done a lot of work with partners across the industry in recent years to tackle bridge strikes, and whilst it's encouraging to see our work is paying off with numbers now on the decline, there's a lot more to be done to cut the unnecessary delays, costs and safety risks they pose."" Network Rail, which looks after about 10,000 bridges over roads, has also written to operators of large vehicle fleets warning they could lose their licence if they fail to have measures in place to minimise the risk of drivers misjudging height restrictions. Senior structures adviser at Highways England, Hideo Takano, said: ""Around two-thirds of bridge strikes on our roads are caused by vehicles carrying a load. ""So to reduce the risk of this happening, we urge all drivers to follow these simple steps: Know your height, plan your route and secure your load."" 1.

Shoppers hit high streets as firebreak ends,"This video can not be played 'Good feeling' as shops reopen after firebreak Shoppers have been hitting Wales' high streets as the nation's 17-day lockdown ends. New nationwide regulations allow non-essential shops to reopen and up to four people from different households to meet both indoors and outside. From Monday peoplecan travel anywhere within Wales,external, restaurants, pubs and gyms can reopen and two households can again form a bubble. But some shoppers in Cardiff said not everyone was social distancing. Friends Lara Walters and Casey Baos met up for lunch in Cardiff on Monday Casey Baos, 17, was in the capital to meet her friend Laura Walters, 18, for lunch and a catch-up. She said: ""It is too busy to social distance - people just walk wherever."" Another Cardiff shopper Has Hirani said: ""It looks like everyone is doing their Christmas shopping - it is much busier than I anticipated. ""But I'm not sure anyone is sticking to the social distancing rules so that's slightly concerning but understandable at the same time."" Has Hirani said Cardiff was busier than she had anticipated First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the firebreak had aimed to ""turn back the tide"" of rising cases and hospital admissions, but the impact would not be visible for some weeks. But the lifting of restrictions did not mean that people could do whatever they wanted, he added. Shoppers queuing outside Zara in Cardiff on Monday afternoon ""The fewer people we meet, the fewer journeys we all make, the more we work from home, the safer we will all be,"" he said. What can you do after Wales' firebreak ends? Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? How many Covid-19 deaths and cases in Wales? ""Coronavirus isn't something that happens to somebody else. It can happen just as easily to you and what you do, the decisions you make, are the decisions that keep you and other people safe."" At a press conference Mr Drakeford called for people to ""careful and cautious"" and to only travel when ""essential"". ""The fact that you can travel is not an invitation to travel and it's certainly not an instruction to travel,"" he said. Wales' lockdown- which the Welsh Government said would help prevent the health service in Wales becoming ""overwhelmed"" - ends just a few days afterEngland's four-week lockdownstarted. Wales has seen almost 7,000 coronavirus cases in the last seven days and thedeath toll is now more than 2,000 peoplesince the pandemic began. The number of patients in Welsh hospitals with coronavirus is now the highest since the height of the pandemic in April - and areas like Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent have some of the worst Covid-19 infection rates in the UK. But Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said on Sunday the country was starting to seea plateauing in the case rate. He added: ""It's still at a high rate which means that there's still a reservoir of coronavirus within our communities."" This video can not be played 'Our success and failure lies in the hands of every one of us,' Mark Drakeford said Opposition parties have called for more local targeted action in future. Wales had 17 separate local lockdowns before the firebreak period. Andrew RT Davies, health spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""Nobody wants further to see further lockdowns, but if they are to be imposed again, then they have to be targeted and based on ultra-accurate and localised data, which city-wide testing could provide."" Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said ""where we have more localised clusters or areas of particularly high prevalence, it makes sense to have a more enhanced set of rules"". Mr Drakeford said local lockdowns have not been ruled in future and they will be imposed ""where that is necessary"". Hot Gossip's Sara Bailey said the rise in cases ""brought home"" the dangers of Covid-19 in Rhondda Cynon Taf Sara Bailey, who runs the Hot Gossip cafe in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf - recently one of the top 10 Covid hotspots in the UK - welcomed being able to reopen but admitted she was also feeling ""apprehensive"". ""Cases gradually crept up to the point where it became very close to home. I think that's brought it home for a lot of people,"" she said. ""I understand why we needed the firebreak. The local restrictions were strangling the business and it was difficult, it was very challenging."" She added this year would be ""a write off"" in terms of profitability, but the challenge was ""staying afloat"" with the hope of recovery next year. ""We can reopen and at least make some progress and have a chance of turning things around in the run-up to Christmas,"" she said. Gift shop owner Ceredig Davies has concerns over people from Covid hotspots visiting Aberystwyth Ceredig Davies is a Ceredigion county councillor and runs Aberystwyth gift shop Mona Lisa. When asked how he felt about people from parts of Wales withhigher Covid case ratesbeing able to visit Ceredigion, which has one of the lowest case rates in Wales, he said: ""To be honest, that is a worry. ""I look at places like the south Wales Valleys where they've got a high Covid rate and with all due respect I hope they stay there. ""We want to keep this a low Covid area."" He added: ""Just because the two-week lockdown is over we shouldn't be complacent, we should be on our guard and follow restrictions."" Mr Davies also felt the Welsh Government's new restrictions were complicated which meant ""some people just don't follow them"". Pub landlord Ian Blair of The Ship and Castle in Aberystwyth said he has decided to remain closed while the rules remain unclear. ""I just sensed that the message we are getting from the first minister really is, if you can, stay shut. Stay out of the way, step back for a bit. And that's what we've decided to do."" He said adapting to new rules during the pandemic has been ""extremely stressful"". ""We're getting a lot of mixed messages and I think the trade needs to have more clarity,"" he said. Mobile hairdresser Kate Wingfield is restricting her work to her county and four clients a day to reduce the risk People inCaerphilly county were the first in Walesto be put into a ""local lockdown"" after a surge of coronavirus cases - but for the first time since having stricter rules imposed on 8 September, all residents are now able to leave the county Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) was the second local authority area to be put under tighter Covid restrictions a week later - but now Wales has scrapped local rules for a ""simpler"" nationwide approach. Kate Wingfield, a mobile hairdresser from Llanharan in RCT said: ""You've got to be super careful - I'm entering places that family members aren't allowed to enter. ""I am nervous about it but I wear a visor and a mask and use hand sanitiser. ""It's more that I'm crossing houses that concerns me... I'm house hopping basically."" Is Wales coming out of lockdown too early? Wales national lockdown in new year 'likely' Has the firebreak lockdown had an impact? Meanwhile the first minister has said that talks involving the four governments of the UK about arrangements for Christmas will take place later this week. Mr Drakeford told the press conference the meeting would now be a weekly event to discuss issues relevant to all four nations. He said his office had been contacted by staff of cabinet office minister Michael Gove ""to get a date in the diary this week, and the topic of that meeting will be a common approach to Christmas"". Mr Drakeford alsowelcomed new findings from trials of a potential coronavirus vaccine, but cautioned it was unlikely to represent ""a magic bullet"" that means coronavirus is about to ""disappear out of our lives"". During the firebreak some supermarket aisles selling non-essential items were closed off Thenew regulations made by the Welsh ministerscover everything from seeing friends and family to travel and visiting pubs and restaurants. They impose limits on meeting other people, prohibit people from entering or leaving Wales without areasonable excuse, impose requirements on people who have tested positive for coronavirus, and contain rules for public-facing business and services. Two families can form a bubble and meet up in each other's homes, as happened prior to the firebreak lockdown. Up to 15 people can take part in activities indoors and up to 30 outdoors - providing social distancing, hand hygiene and other Covid safety measures are followed. Merthyr remains one of the worst-hit areas in the UK when it comes to cases per 100,000 people Groups offour people from different householdscan meet indoors or outdoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants -  again, providing social distancing, hand hygiene and other Covid safety measures are followed. People from Wales can again holiday within Wales but international travel should be for essential reasons only so foreign holidays are still not allowed. People will still be allowed to make visits to another person's home in Wales if they are concerned about their mental well-being, Mr Drakeford said.

How Wales would use Covid vaccine 'not yet decided',"The drug's developers described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"" How any future Covid vaccine will be used in Wales will be decided when it becomes available, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Pfizer and BioNTech have announced the development ofan effective Covid-19 vaccinebut Boris Johnson cautioned it was ""very, very early days"". Mr Drakeford said the UK government would buy the vaccine on behalf of the whole of the UK. ""We will get our population share,"" he said. ""That's what's already been agreed and when the vaccine comes to Wales, it'll be the Welsh Government's responsibility to store the vaccine and then to distribute it so that it can be used for the Welsh population."" He told BBC Wales Today: ""We then decide how to use it, and make sure that it's done in the best possible way."" Covid vaccine: First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection Covid: Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? Covid vaccine: Boris Johnson warns of 'several more hurdles' Earlier, Mr Drakeford welcomed the breakthrough but cautioned it was unlikely to represent a ""magic bullet"". Speaking at Monday's Welsh Government press conference, he said: ""It is good news, of course, if any of the vaccines in trials are making progress. ""[But] I think you would always want to read carefully what a particular competitor in this field says on their own behalf. ""I'm not going to be tempted today, as I've tried not to be tempted throughout coronavirus, to suggest that this somehow means that there is a magic bullet on the horizon and coronavirus is about to disappear out of our lives."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson says a new vaccine is good news but warns the UK not to ""slacken our resolve"" Mr Johnson said the vaccine had ""cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go"". He warned people not to""rely on this news as a solution""to the pandemic. ""The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at a critical moment,"" he said. England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said he was ""hopeful"" the first vaccine could be seen by Christmas and there would be a ""much better horizon"" by spring. Speaking alongside Mr Johnson at a Downing Street news conference, Prof Van-Tam said that there was more work to be done before it became available to the public. ""This is a very important scientific breakthrough. I am certain of that,"" he said. The vaccine has been hailed as a ""milestone"" by many scientists. It has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries with no safety concerns raised. A limited number of people may get the vaccine this year. Pfizer and BioNTech say they will have enough safety data by the third week of November to take their vaccine to regulators. Until it has been approved it will not be possible for countries to begin their vaccination campaigns. The two companies say they will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. Each person needs two doses. The UK should get 10 million doses by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered.

Man who rammed scooter rider jailed for 10 years,"This video can not be played Craig Bond needed surgery for his injuries A driver has been jailed for 10 years for ramming into a scooter rider who accidentally cracked his wing mirror. Christian Verrall, 32, caused 20-year-old Craig Bond life-changing injuries in the attack in Pill, Newport, earlier this year. Verrall performed a U-turn to chase Mr Bond through busy streets, his trial heard. He was convicted last month of wounding with intent. Cardiff Crown Court heard Verrall used his 1,000kg Ford Fiesta as a ""weapon"". Mr Bond was sent flying over the bonnet, leaving him with fractures to his leg and foot. He now has ""suicidal thoughts"" and has continuing problems with his leg, the court heard. Verrall's trial heard he had dumped the car and reported it stolen. When he was shown CCTV footage of what happened, he told police: ""That doesn't even look like me."" However, the father of one, from Newport, later admitted dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice. Christian Verrall used his 1,000kg Ford Fiesta as a ""weapon"" Sentencing him, Judge Caroline Rees QC said: ""You lost your temper and it is clear from the evidence that the red mist of rage descended."" In mitigation, Verrall's lawyer Harry Baker claimed his client suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder due to ""an early-life trauma"". Det Con Rebecca Hamilton, an officer involved in the case, said the level of violence used was ""appalling"". ""This has been a difficult and distressing time for the victim and his family,"" she said. Verrall was also disqualified from driving for nine years and eight months.

Markets rocket on vaccine hopes,"Stock markets have rocketed on hopes of a potential breakthrough in the search for a vaccine against Covid-19. Drugs firm Pfizer's own shares climbed 9% after it said that preliminary analysisindicated that its coronavirus vaccine was 90% effective. Markets, already buoyed after a clear end to the US election, piled on gains. The FTSE 100 jumped nearly 5%. But some of the initial optimism appeared to fade by the end of the trading session. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had jumped 5.6% in opening trade, closed up about 3%. The S&P 500 also retreated from its morning leap, ending just 1.1% higher, short of a new record. Meanwhile the Nasdaq, where many of the tech firms that have benefited from the lockdowns are listed, fell 1.5%. Covid vaccine: First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? The vaccine hopes revived investor appetite for airlines, hotels, energy firms and others hit hardest by the pandemic, sending shares soaring - in some cases by more than 40%. Firms lifted by the pandemic dived, in contrast, dived. Such sizable swings are rare. In the case of the UK, the FTSE 100 added roughly Â£82bn to the value of its shares in the market's best day since March - and one of the ten largest ever single-day gains for the index. Markets are primarily about sentiment - does tomorrow look better than today - and in that regard there has been a radical and probably permanent sea change. With more vaccines in development that optimism could grow. What this result demonstrates is that while the virus is not yet beaten it is beatable. That ray of light has lit up stock markets around the world. As always, some people in the markets are already looking for something else to worry about. If we are returning to a semblance of normality in the months ahead, do the US authorities really need a stimulus package as big as the $3tn to $4tn being discussed by the Biden team? But for now, the markets, like the rest of us, are enjoying the warm glow of the first significant sentiment boost since the virus started ravaging the world economy. Read more here. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, called it ""very very unusual"", but said that a vaccine was ""one of the things that markets have been waiting for"". However, he told the BBC there were ""still lots and lots of questions around the vaccine"" and it was still too early to say when economies would bounce back or whether the market surge would be sustained. In the UK, shares in travel firms - which have been hit hard by the pandemic - saw the biggest rises, with British Airways owner IAG soaring 25%. Elsewhere in the sector, EasyJet shares rose 34%, while aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce surged almost 45%. Another sector of the economy that has been hit hard by coronavirus is hospitality - catering firm Compass Group saw its shares rise more than 21%. US-listed Royal Caribbean cruises meanwhile were up 29%, while travel booking firm Expedia jumped 24% and Disney climbed almost 12%. However, shares in those companies that have benefitted in the crisis fell sharply given the hopes of a successful vaccine. Shares in grocery delivery firm Ocado - which has seen sales soar amid the shift towards online shopping - dropped more than 11% Takeaway ordering firm Just Eat fell more than 8% And in the US, Zoom fell more than 17% and exercise bike firm Peloton was down more than 20% Drugmakers have been racing to be the first to develop a successful coronavirus vaccine. If Pfizer's vaccine is authorised, the number of doses will be limited initially. Many questions also remain, including how long the vaccine will provide protection. Stock markets hadalready been rallyingin response Saturday's declaration that Joe Biden had won the race to become the next US president. The Pfizer announcement then pushed market optimism ""exceedingly high"", but it ""could fade"" said Neil Wilson. ""We should not be jumping any guns here, but ultimately a vaccine that works effectively would be good for the economy and favours the cyclical parts of the market that we thought were going to struggle,"" he said. ""It's clear the market is forward looking and pricing in recovery in a number of beaten-down areas next year."" Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""The Pfizer announcement is not yet a panacea, but adds to investor sentiment which had already been buoyed by the Biden victory, and has sent markets to strongly positive levels."" He noted that airline and related stocks had been rising rapidly, while ""housebuilders, banks and retailers are all in the boat currently being lifted by a rising tide"". ""It is still early days, and the practicalities point to any meaningful distribution not being available until the first few months of next year,"" he added. ""Even so, the news is without question a positive development and has certainly captured the imagination of investors.""

Who would get the vaccine first?,"The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is one of two being rolled out across the UK. The government aims to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February and has got off to a strong start, with more than four million jabs administered. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus. It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack. The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases. The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use. NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. About half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. People in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab. Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population. The vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls andmass vaccination hubsin places like cathedrals and sports halls. However, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine: It must be keptat -70C during transportation The jab must be thawed before it is given to a patient It can be stored in a normal fridge for a few days before being used How do the Covid vaccines compare? It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu. The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggestsit works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. Early evidencesuggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK. Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported. If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent. However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised. Hopefully yes, but not for some time. If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures. However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time. So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further. We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used. About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring.

How soon can we expect it?,"If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won't be enough to go around. Research labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine. Unprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. So who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind? Vaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed. To date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox -  and that took 200 years. The rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations. Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine. Russia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of immune response in patients and has rolled out the vaccine for public use while late-stage trials continue. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced. Neither are on the World Health Organization's list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans. Some of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech say preliminary analysis shows their vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. They plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November. Pfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful. There are dozens of other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way. Not all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time. But even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear. Oxford vaccine trial paused as participant falls ill How close to developing a vaccine are we? Governments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved. The UK government, for example,has signed dealsfor undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. But not all countries are in a position to do likewise. Organisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates ""a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations"". This in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries. In the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example. Dr MariÃ¢ngela SimÃ£o, the WHO's assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check. ""The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more."" The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field. At least 94 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine planknown as Covax,external, which aims to raise $2bn (Â£1.52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get ""rapid, fair and equitable access"" to Covid-19 vaccines. The facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed. Having a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021. ""With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,"" says Gavi's CEO Dr Seth Berkley. ""If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe."" While billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine. Prices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (Â£24 to Â£28). AstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine ""at cost"" - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic. The Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (Â£2.28) a dose. But patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases. In the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way. Other countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population. People receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged. In the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill. Although the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won't be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. ""Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,"" Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President told the BBC. As the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised. The Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers. As more vaccine is produced, allocation is increased to cover 20% of the population - this time prioritising over 65s and other vulnerable groups. After everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process. ""The only certainty is that there won't be enough - the rest is still up in the air,"" says Dr Simao. Gavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount. Dr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, ""to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access"". A lot depends on which vaccine is successful. The ideal vaccine has a lot to live up to. It needs to be affordable. It needs to generate strong, long-lasting immunity. It needs a simple refrigerated distribution system and manufacturers must be able to scale-up production rapidly. The WHO, UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF / Doctors Without Borders), already have effective vaccination programmes in place around the world with the so called ""cold chain"" facilities - cooler trucks and solar fridges to keep vaccines at the right temperature as they travel from factory to field. World vaccine delivery 'will need 8,000 jumbo jets' But adding a new vaccine to the mix could pose huge logistical problems for those already facing a difficult environment. Vaccines usually need to be kept refrigerated - usually between 2C and 8C. That's not too much of a challenge in most developed countries, but can be an ""immense task"" where infrastructure is weak and electricity supply and refrigeration unstable. ""Maintaining vaccines under cold chain is already one of the biggest challenges' countries face and this will be exacerbated with the introduction of a new vaccine,"" MSF medical adviser Barbara Saitta told the BBC. ""You will need to add more cold chain equipment, make sure you always have fuel (to run freezer and refrigerators in absence of electricity) and repair/replace them when they break and transport them wherever you need them."" AstraZeneca has suggested their vaccine would need the regular cold chain between 2C and 8C. But at present it looks like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine would need ultra-cold chain - storage at -80C before being distributed. Welcoming the Pfizer announcement, Dr Richard Hatchett, of Cepi acknowledged that would ""remain a challenge for use in some settings"". ""This is something which will have to be addressed if the vaccine is to be made broadly available,"" he said. But the Ebola vaccine also needed very low temperatures, so it is not impossible. ""To keep the Ebola vaccine at -60Â°C or colder we had to use a special cold chain equipment to store and transport them, plus we had to train staff to use all this new equipment,"" said Barbara Saitta. There is also the question of the target population. Vaccination programmes usually target children, so agencies will have to plan how to reach people that normally are not part of the immunization program. As the world waits for the scientists to do their bit, many more challenges await. And vaccines are not the only weapon against coronavirus. ""Vaccines are not the only solution,"" Says Dr Simao, of the WHO. ""You need to have diagnostics. You need to have a way to decrease mortality, so you need therapeutics, and you need a vaccine.

Who would get the jab and how?,"If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won't be enough to go around. Research labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine. Unprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. So who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind? Vaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed. To date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox -  and that took 200 years. The rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations. Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine. Russia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of immune response in patients and has rolled out the vaccine for public use while late-stage trials continue. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced. Neither are on the World Health Organization's list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans. Some of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech say preliminary analysis shows their vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. They plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November. Pfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful. There are dozens of other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way. Not all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time. But even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear. Oxford vaccine trial paused as participant falls ill How close to developing a vaccine are we? Governments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved. The UK government, for example,has signed dealsfor undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. But not all countries are in a position to do likewise. Organisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates ""a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations"". This in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries. In the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example. Dr MariÃ¢ngela SimÃ£o, the WHO's assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check. ""The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more."" The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field. At least 94 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine planknown as Covax,external, which aims to raise $2bn (Â£1.52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get ""rapid, fair and equitable access"" to Covid-19 vaccines. The facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed. Having a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021. ""With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,"" says Gavi's CEO Dr Seth Berkley. ""If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe."" While billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine. Prices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (Â£24 to Â£28). AstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine ""at cost"" - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic. The Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (Â£2.28) a dose. But patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases. In the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way. Other countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population. People receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged. In the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill. Although the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won't be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. ""Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,"" Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President told the BBC. As the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised. The Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers. As more vaccine is produced, allocation is increased to cover 20% of the population - this time prioritising over 65s and other vulnerable groups. After everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process. ""The only certainty is that there won't be enough - the rest is still up in the air,"" says Dr Simao. Gavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount. Dr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, ""to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access"". A lot depends on which vaccine is successful. The ideal vaccine has a lot to live up to. It needs to be affordable. It needs to generate strong, long-lasting immunity. It needs a simple refrigerated distribution system and manufacturers must be able to scale-up production rapidly. The WHO, UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF / Doctors Without Borders), already have effective vaccination programmes in place around the world with the so called ""cold chain"" facilities - cooler trucks and solar fridges to keep vaccines at the right temperature as they travel from factory to field. World vaccine delivery 'will need 8,000 jumbo jets' But adding a new vaccine to the mix could pose huge logistical problems for those already facing a difficult environment. Vaccines usually need to be kept refrigerated - usually between 2C and 8C. That's not too much of a challenge in most developed countries, but can be an ""immense task"" where infrastructure is weak and electricity supply and refrigeration unstable. ""Maintaining vaccines under cold chain is already one of the biggest challenges' countries face and this will be exacerbated with the introduction of a new vaccine,"" MSF medical adviser Barbara Saitta told the BBC. ""You will need to add more cold chain equipment, make sure you always have fuel (to run freezer and refrigerators in absence of electricity) and repair/replace them when they break and transport them wherever you need them.""

'Dark cloud over BBC journalism' says Lord Grade,"Martin Bashir's Panorama interview with Princess Diana was broadcast in 1995 Former BBC chairman Michael Grade has said allegations that Martin Bashir used forged bank statements to convince Princess Diana to do a 1995 interview were ""a very, very serious matter"". The BBC has promised to launch an investigation into the claims made by Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's brother. Earl Spencer says the former Panorama reporter made false and defamatory claims about senior royals. Lord Grade said the BBC should now hold itself to account. ""There is a very dark cloud hanging over BBC journalism,"" Lord Grade told Radio 4's World at One programme on Monday. Diana's brother makes new BBC interview allegations Diana's brother demands BBC inquiry over interview BBC's Martin Bashir 'seriously unwell' from Covid ""As a result of the questions raised by Earl Spencer, Channel Four, and the Daily Mail, this needs to be cleared up. ""There needs to be an immediate independent inquiry announced, and the results of that inquiry need to be published."" A documentary titled Diana: The Truth Behind the Interview aired on Channel 4 last month and the Daily Mail published Earl Spencer's claims last week. The BBC's director general, Tim Davie, said on Monday the corporation was ""taking this very seriously and we want to get to the truth"". ""We are in the process of commissioning a robust and independent investigation,"" added Mr Davie. A BBC spokeswoman said Bashir, the corporation's current religion editor, was unwell and unavailable for comment. ""Martin Bashir is signed off work by his doctors - he is currently recovering from quadruple heart bypass surgery and has significant complications from having contracted Covid-19 earlier in the year,"" she said. Lord Grade said Bashir's medical condition ""is a secondary issue"" that is ""important for him and his family, obviously"". But he stressed that the public deserved a timeline of ""who knew what when"", ahead of the famous interview. ""Now there may well be very good answers and the BBC may well come out of this absolutely clean, but there are so many questions being raised. ""There's only one way to clear this up and that is with an independent inquiry to be published."" Almost 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama programme 25 years ago. In it, the princess famously said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to the Prince of Wales's relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time, Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. The BBC said Mr Bashir is currently recovering from heart surgery and complications from Covid-19 The BBC's royal correspondent, Jonny Dymond, said the notes Earl Spencer says he made with Bashir two months before the interview, reported by theDaily Mail,external, are ""astonishing"". They appear to record Bashir ""spinning lie after lie about members of the Royal Family, and its staff, in an attempt, Earl Spencer says, to win his trust and that of his sister, Diana"" our correspondent said. These claims, described by the Mail as ""preposterous lies"", include that Diana's private correspondence was being opened, her car tracked and phones tapped. It was also claimed that her bodyguard was plotting against her and close friends were betraying her by leaking stories to the press. This week, Earl Spencer said he never would have introduced Bashir to his sister were it not for him seeing faked bank statements. The faked statements wrongly purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on his sister, the Daily Mail said. The BBC has apologised for the faked statements, but has insisted they played ""no part in her decision to take part in the interview"". Lord Michael Grade was BBC chairman from 2004 to 2006 A documentary, which will air on ITV on Monday and Tuesday, features a graphic designer who says he was asked to create the fake bank statements. Matt Wiessler says he was made a scapegoat and wants an apology. Mr Wiessler said: ""I quite clearly felt that I was the one that was going to be the fall guy in this story. ""All I want is for the BBC in this instance to come forward and honestly make an apology. Because it's had a huge impact.""

"Jihadists 'behead more than 50' in MozambiqueA football pitch in a village was turned into an ""execution ground"", reports say.Africa","Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes, many of which have been destroyed, during the three-year insurgency (file photo) More than 50 people have been beheaded in northern Mozambique by militant Islamists, state media report. The militants turned a football pitch in a village into an ""execution ground"", where they decapitated and chopped bodies, other reports said. Several people were also beheaded in another village, state media reported. The beheadings are the latest in a series of gruesome attacks that the militants have carried out in gas-rich Cabo Delgado province since 2017. Africa Live: Updates from around the continent Is Mozambique the latest outpost of Islamic State? How ruby smugglers nurtured jihadists Up to 2,000 people have been killed and about 430,000 have been left homeless in the conflict in the mainly-Muslim province. The militants are linked to the Islamic State (IS) group, giving it a foothold in southern Africa. The group has exploited poverty and unemployment to recruit youth in their fight to establish Islamic rule in the area. Many locals complain that they have benefited little from the province's ruby and gas industries. The BBC's Jose Tembe reports from the capital, Maputo, that the latest attack was probably the worst carried out by the militants. Many people are shocked, and they are calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, he adds. The gunmen chanted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"", in English), fired shots, and set homes alight when they raided Nanjaba village on Friday night, the state-owned Mozambique News Agency quoted survivors as saying. Two people were beheaded in the village and several women abducted, the news agency added. A separate group of militants carried out another brutal attack on Muatide village, where they beheaded more than 50 people, the news agency reported. Villagers who tried to flee were caught, and taken to the local football pitch where they were beheaded and chopped to pieces in an atrocity carried out from Friday night to Sunday, privately-run Pinnacle News reported. This video can not be played WATCH: The Mozambique conflict explained Mozambique's government has appealed for international help to curb the insurgency, saying its troops need specialised training. In April, more than 50 people were beheaded or shot dead in an attack on a village in Cabo Delgado and earlier this month, nine people were beheaded in the same province. Rights groups say Mozambican security forces have also carried out human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture and killings, during operations to curb the insurgency.

We cannot rely on vaccine news as a solution - PM,"UK PM Boris Johnson warns we cannot rely on vaccine news as a solution But deputy CMO for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, is hopeful of vaccine by Christmas First Covid vaccine 90% effective, preliminary Pfizer analysis shows Stock markets soar on vaccine hopes Wales' 17-day 'firebreak' lockdown has ended and new rules have come into force In the US, President-elect Joe Biden names his coronavirus advisory team Edited by Julian Joyce Well, that's us over and out for today. Here's a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world this evening: And following the Downing Street conference thelatest coronavirus figures,externalhave been released. There have been a further 21,350 cases of coronavirus across the UK and a further 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. That takes the total number of deaths by this measure to 49,063. The figures tend to be lower on a Monday as there is a lag in reporting over the weekend. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky says he has tested positive for Covid-19 but that he ""feels fine"". Writing on Twitter, the 42-year-old said he would go into self-isolation and would continue to work. ""It's gonna be fine,"" he posted. The former comedian-turned-politician joins other world leaders who contracted coronavirus, including Donald Trump in the US, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro.

Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Prof Van Tam is all about the metaphors tonight! First, with a football reference, we were told we hadnât won the cup but we now know the keeper can be beaten. Then we were asked to imagine a cold, rainy station platform with the bright lights of a train coming down the track - but various hurdles to overcome before we could get on board. Whatever the metaphor the message is clear: the vaccine news is positive but itâs still far from a solution. And while the metaphors might be attracting some mirth on Twitter, thereâs a serious point to them too. The science can be complex. What's key is finding a way to get across the essential information in way we can all understand. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Managing expectations seems to be a key theme of the televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam are at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The prime minister says we must not âslacken our resolveâ, while Prof Van-Tam says it will not make âany differenceâ for the second wave this winter. Their message is simple â do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But todayâs announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, its ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome â and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. The prime minister is asked how distribution of the vaccine would be prioritised. He says ministers will âlook at where the doses will be most appropriately distributedâ and that âeverything flowsâ from driving down the R rate. He adds that âpeople are pulling togetherâ under the current restrictions, and that he believes they will get the R rate to below one. One journalist points out there is global excitement about the vaccine and asks the PM how confident he is that it can be delivered. The prime minister says he is âvery hopefulâ as the vaccine task force has been  âsecuring supplies for the UK for some time now"". But Jonathan Van-Tam warns that âmany thingsâ can go wrong with vaccines during manufacture. âEvery single batch has to be quality assured and released. Things can and do and have always gone wrong,â he says.
âWe have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes.â Boris Johnson says he is optimistic about the UKâs prospects for next year, but adds that he does not want to âlet people run away with the ideaâ that todayâs news is a âslam dunkâ. Jonathan Van-Tam says that there is an ""enormous mental health burdenâ on people during lockdown. âOne of the things we can do to try and make the restrictions as short as possible is to follow them to the letter,â he says. The prime minister adds a cautious note, warning it is âcrucial that we do not overdo itâ.
âWe cannot let our enthusiasm tonight run away with us, folks,â he says. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Despite todayâs positive vaccine announcement, the PM struck a deliberately cautious tone. Boris Johnson stressed that news of an effective vaccine was not yet a solution. Number 10 clearly doesnât want the suggestion of a scientific breakthrough to be any sort of green light for people to flout lockdown rules at what he described as a critical moment. The PM has been among the most optimistic â perhaps hopeful - in the past about science providing the way out of this pandemic. But the message today was, 'weâre not there yet', calling instead for the public to keep their resolve. Boris Johnson will know the political and economic difficulties facing Downing St are far from over too. Making a football reference Jonathan Van-Tam says that ""we haven't won the cup yet"", but what it ""does tell you is that the keeper can be beaten"". The deputy chief medical officer for England said we do not yet know what the vaccine breakthrough means for when we can get back to a normal life. ""Frankly weâre in the middle of the second wave and I donât see the vaccines making any difference for the wave we are now in. ""Iâm hopeful that it may prevent future waves but this one we have to battle through to the end without a vaccine. We have to keep pressing hard for now."" Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the Pfizer vaccine news is an ""important scientific breakthrough"" but warns that the message is to stand fast and not get overexcited about where we are. He says the next step will be to see safety data which he expects to see in the coming days. Van-Tam says if it does get to the stage where vaccines are authorised for use in the UK there will have to be decisions made by the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation as to who gets priotiry. This list cannot be finalised yet, he says. The prime minister is joined by Brigaidier Joe Fossey who has led the army's support for the mass testing pilot in Liverpool. Holding up a lateral flow test Brigadier Fossey says they offer the chance for more regular and rapid testing. He says: ""Our message to the people of Liverpool is clear: we are set up and ready for you to come and get tested. Please do not hesitate."" He says what they are trialling is a ""possible route out of lockdown and a way to get on with our lives"". The prime minister said that mass testing is still in its infancy and at present is no substitute for the national restrictions, social distancing and hand hygiene and ""all the rest"". ""I know it has been a hard first week of the autumn restrictions,"" he said. But Johnson added the country must get through this until 2 December when the current lockdown measures will expire and ""we plan to move forward with a tiered approach"". The prime minister says despite a vaccine being on the horizon we must continue to do everything we can to keep the R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - down. He warns that the number of Covid patients in hospital has risen to 13,000 as of 5 November, and says ""we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak"". Boris Johnson says that it is important more than ever to follow the rules but says we must hope and believe mass testing will help. He urges people in Liverpool to get tested and says ""we have tested thousands of people but there is still more to do"". Meanwhile, Joe Biden has made his first speech about coronavirus after forming a panel made up of 13 scientists to advise him as he prepares to take office. He tells Americans that regardless of how they voted in the election, they should wear masks in order to protect themselves and other citizens. ""Wear a mask, it's the single most potent weapon against the virus,"" he says. Face coverings have become politically divisive in the US. Biden says the vaccine development process must be transparent so Americans can have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine. He notes it won't be available for many months yet. ""The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. Although I'm not in office yet I'm just laying out what we expect to do and hope some of it can be done between now and the time I'm sworn in."" He adds that ""there's a need for bold action"" as cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up. His remarks contrast with many of Donald Trump's who at times underplayed the severity of the pandemic. Boris Johnson begins by saying that people are asking that ""does the progress towards a vaccine made today mean we are at the beginning of the end to our troubles"". ""We have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go,"" he says. But he adds if and when the vaccine is ready to be sued the UK is ""towards the front of the pack"" as it has already ordered 40 million doses. There will be an NHS-led vaccine programme, Johnson says. He adds he must stress that ""these are very, very early days"" and the distant toot of the scientific bugle is louder but still someway off. Prime Minister Boris Johnson begins speaking at the Downing Street news conference. Today he is joined by Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, and Brigadier Joe Fossey. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter News that the first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19 has meant vaccine conspiracy theories are being shared again on social media. For months, theyâve been spreading in local Facebook groups, on Instagram pages and in WhatsApp chats. The false claims include the baseless theory that a vaccine could be a way for Microsoft boss Bill Gates to secretly insert microchips into people â so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has debunked this particular claim in the past.Nevertheless, Bill Gatesâs name has been trending on Twitter since the announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech. Rumours have also been circulating about when the announcement happened â with the suggestion that it was deliberately timed to happen after Joe Biden was declared president-elect. Thereâs currently no evidence to support this claim. When you see these sorts of claims, remember to think about why a post was shared, how it makes you feel and to pause before passing it on. Get in touch if youâre seeing speculation like this on social media that you want me to investigate:Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Today's news that avaccine can prevent more than 90% of peoplefrom getting Covid-19 is based on preliminary analysis. There's still a way to go before any vaccine can be given to the wider public and our lives can go back to how they were pre-pandemic. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps puts this news into context. This video can not be played Covid vaccine: what does the Pfizer vaccine news mean? Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to host a Downing Street news conference shortly. It follows today's news that the company behind a vaccine trial has said it is 90% effective against the virus.

'Flat of horrors' couple guilty of murder,"Julia Rawson was last seen alive on 12 May 2019 A man obsessed with horror films has been convicted along with his boyfriend of murdering and dismembering a woman in their flat. Nathan Maynard-Ellis, 30, took Julia Rawson home after meeting her in a pub in Dudley, West Midlands, in May 2019. He and David Leesley, 25, then killed her and hid her body parts in undergrowth, the trial at Coventry Crown Court was told. Maynard-Ellis was also found guilty of rape charges relating to another woman. The four rapes, an attempted rape, and threats to kill were revealed when a woman came forward after his murder arrest. Both men had admitted perverting the course of justice and concealing a body, but had denied murder. This video can not be played The moment murderer and victim meet Jurors heard Maynard-Ellis had a fascination with decapitation and horror films and had been addicted to fantasies about the ""sexualised killing of women"". His victim would have seen swords and spiders mounted on the walls of the Tipton flat, reptiles kept in tanks, and ""gory face masks"" of horror film characters, Karim Khalil QC, prosecuting, told jurors at the start of the trial. Ms Rawson ""could not have known that she was about to enter a flat of horrors"", he said. ""But she must have realised this very soon after she went in."" Nathan Maynard-Ellis and David Leesley had admitted perverting the course of justice and concealing a body, but had denied murder Tracey Barrett, a neighbour of the two killers, told the BBC their flat ""was the making of horror stories"", with Freddy Krueger figures and Chucky dolls. Police said Maynard-Ellis had gone out the night of the murder with the aim of finding a victim. ""Unfortunately that victim was Julia"", Det Insp Jim Colclough, from West Midlands Police, said. Maynard-Ellis and Leesley's home had Chucky dolls and other horror movie paraphernalia The murderers' bookshelf featured works on serial killers Ms Rawson, 42, was struck about the head. Her remains, including her severed head, hands and feet, were found on 12 and 29 June last year in two different locations, near a canal and on wasteland. After identifying Maynard Ellis from CCTV video when he was with Ms Rawson at the pub, he was arrested on suspicion of kidnap and officers discovered a bloodstain underneath a new underlay in the living room of the couple's flat. Det Insp Colclough described the killing as ""a terrible, terrible thing to have taken place"". Ms Rawson, who was reported missing by friends, came from a close-knit family and was a talented musician and a fun-loving character, he said. ""Of course her family are absolutely devastated,"" he said. Julia Rawson met Nathan Maynard-Ellis in the Bottle and Cork pub in Dudley In a statement, Ms Rawson's family said her loss was ""felt as keenly today as when we heard she had first gone missing"". ""Her death has had a devastating impact on us, the mutilation of her body and the callous way in which her remains were scattered has revolted us,"" they said. The judge, Mr Justice Soole, told the jury: ""It has been a very demanding case because of the subject matter."" Maynard-Ellis and Leesley will be sentenced at a later date.

The 'wobble room' helping NHS staff through Covid,"In small room in the Royal Derby Hospital, there's a table bearing a laminated sign. ""You are not alone,"" it says. It continues: ""Kindness will get you through. Embrace the challenge. Look after each other. You are stronger than you think."" This is the ""wobble room"", set aside not for patients but for front-line staff to get them away - briefly - from the intense pressure and strain experienced in the first wave of Covid-19. ""We made a wobble room because that's what we needed,"" Kelly-Ann Gurney, an intensive-care nurse, told the BBC. ""It's a room where staff could just go and sit and cry if they needed to and get it all out and then come back and 'put their face on' and get back into it again."" Now the second wave is hitting the hospital, and the need for the room is just as great. Concerns are growing about the physical and mental health of front-line NHS staff. There has been no lull since the April peak of the virus as normal treatments and operations, postponed during the crisis, have returned to hospitals. The second wave is now breaking on them, but this time there has been no widespread clearing of beds and cancellations of non-urgent work to create capacity for Covid patients. To add to the pressure, winter with all its additional health challenges is not far off, and some staff are wondering whether they can cope. Covid-19: NHS in England moves to highest alert level How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Coronavirus: NHS workers who died in the pandemic Caroline Swan, a senior sister and manager of the intensive care unit at the Royal Derby, says she is ready to face what is ahead but feels very tired. ""I am also very concerned. My staff are very tired and stressed out. We have a lot of sickness either due to burnout or they are unwell. ""A lot of staff have to self-isolate at home - and that puts a lot of strain on staffing here."" Dr Magnus Harrison, medical director of the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Trust, says managing rotas is getting harder due to staff sickness and the need for some to self-isolate if family members are infected. ""It is worth acknowledging what staff did in the first wave. They behaved tremendously and worked incredibly hard, and we're expecting them to do it again in winter - and Covid numbers could be higher than in the first wave. People are tired out."" Intensive care nurse Kelly-Ann Gurney says staff will support each other The Royal College of Nursing has said it has ""grave concerns"" about how services will be safely staffed this winter with the NHS in England back at the highest alert level. It argues that even with an increase in newly trained nurses and those returning from retirement, there may not be enough staff to cope with the second Covid wave. Sir Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, said at a recent Downing Street media conference that about 30,000 NHS staff were either off with coronavirus or having to self-isolate. He added that controlling the spread of the virus in local communities was essential if the NHS was to be fully staffed. A Department of Health spokesman said it was committed to ensuring the NHS in England had ""the funding and resources it needs, including front-line staff"". He added: ""We are on our way to delivering 50,000 more nurses by the end of this Parliament - with already over 14,000 more in the NHS over the last year."" Dr Greg Fletcher, an intensive-care consultant, has worked at Royal Derby for 12 years. He points to the unprecedented strain of caring for very sick patients in critical-care beds, some of whom will not survive because there is no cure for the coronavirus. ""I've seen more people die seemingly needlessly or unexpectedly in the last six months than I have seen in the whole of my career. It's been despite trying everything we could to save life. It does take its toll on an emotional and psychological level."" Staff at the hospital are encouraged to think about what they are looking forward to The mood at the Royal Derby is stoical. Staff know what to expect after their experience of the first wave. But this time the days are shorter and colder, and there is no opportunity to take a break in the sunshine. Kelly-Ann Gurney says ""a lot of staff are struggling"". But she adds: ""We've done it before and we'll do it again. We just have to support each other through it."" Greg Fletcher adds that there will be no let-up and no holidays to look forward to. ""We go into the next few months with a significant degree of trepidation.""

Aldi extends click and collect to 200 more shops,"Aldi began the click and trial earlier this year Discount supermarket Aldi is to extend its trial click-and-collect shopping service to 200 more UK stores as it faces growing competition from rivals. It means about 25% of its 900 shops will offer the service by Christmas, compared with 18 now. Aldi and discount rival Lidl, which have challenged the big supermarket rivals on price, have missed out in the pandemic as more sales go online. By contrast traditional grocers such as Tesco have seen their sales accelerate. Aldi first launched its click and collect service to customers at a single store in the Midlands in September, before extending the trial last month. Shoppers can choose from a full range of grocery items online, then collect them in their cars ""contact-free"" at their local stores. Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent The German discounter has expanded rapidly over the past decade, largely by outcompeting traditional chains on price. However, it has seen growth slow since March as online grocery shopping has doubled its share of the UK market to around 14%. Analysts say mounting competition from traditional retailers with established online shopping services will make it harder for Aldi and Lidl to expand as quickly as they once did. Tesco has benefitted from the shift to online shopping For example, in the 12 weeks to May, Tesco and Sainsbury's increased sales at a faster rate than Aldi for the first time in a decade as the pandemic spurred weekly shops and more online ordering.Aldi has been rolling out new online options in response. In April, Aldi started selling online food parcels to help self-isolating and vulnerable customers and has also started a rapid delivery service in partnership with Deliveroo. Giles Hurley, boss of Aldi UK and Ireland, said its click and collect trial had been ""hugely popular"" so far. ""By extending it to hundreds of new stores, we're making Aldi accessible to thousands of shoppers who might never have visited one of our stores before.""

Bears shot dead on Russian nuclear submarine,"Bears, like this female brown bear, are fairly common in the Kamchatka peninsula (file photo) The Russian Navy has defended the shooting of a mother bear and its cub on a nuclear submarine following outrage among many social media users. The navy says there was no other option after the animals climbed onto the vessel moored off the Vilyuchinsk base in the far-eastern Kamchatka region. It says a hunting instructor was called in to ""neutralise the wild animals"". Hundreds of social media users accused the navy of unnecessary cruelty after seeing a video of the shooting online. ""Animals!"" and ""The whole essence of Russia in one video"" were some of the comments. The footage was published on 8 November, although it is unclear when the shooting happened. In the video, one of the animals is seen falling into the water after apparently being hit by a bullet. A male voice in the video is heard saying the animals would have gone to local villages had they been driven away. The bears, whose species was not disclosed, are believed to have swum across the bay to get onto the submarine for reasons unknown. The Kamchatka peninsula is home to about 24,000 bears that can frequently be seen on local beaches. Far-north Russian village overrun by polar bears Spray-painted polar bear alarms wildlife experts Last year, more than 50 polar bears descended on a village in Russia's far north. All public activities in Ryrkaypiy, Chukotka region, had to be cancelled, and schools were guarded to protect residents from the animals. Conservationists say climate change could be to blame, with weak coastal ice forcing the bears to search for food inland rather than at sea.

Stock markets rocket on vaccine hopes,"Stock markets have rocketed on hopes of a potential breakthrough in the search for a vaccine against Covid-19. Drugs firm Pfizer's own shares climbed 9% after it said that preliminary analysisindicated that its coronavirus vaccine was 90% effective. Markets, already buoyed after a clear end to the US election, piled on gains. The FTSE 100 jumped nearly 5%. But some of the initial optimism appeared to fade by the end of the trading session. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had jumped 5.6% in opening trade, closed up about 3%. The S&P 500 also retreated from its morning leap, ending just 1.1% higher, short of a new record. Meanwhile the Nasdaq, where many of the tech firms that have benefited from the lockdowns are listed, fell 1.5%. Covid vaccine: First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? The vaccine hopes revived investor appetite for airlines, hotels, energy firms and others hit hardest by the pandemic, sending shares soaring - in some cases by more than 40%. Firms lifted by the pandemic dived, in contrast, dived. Such sizable swings are rare. In the case of the UK, the FTSE 100 added roughly Â£82bn to the value of its shares in the market's best day since March - and one of the ten largest ever single-day gains for the index. Markets are primarily about sentiment - does tomorrow look better than today - and in that regard there has been a radical and probably permanent sea change. With more vaccines in development that optimism could grow. What this result demonstrates is that while the virus is not yet beaten it is beatable. That ray of light has lit up stock markets around the world. As always, some people in the markets are already looking for something else to worry about. If we are returning to a semblance of normality in the months ahead, do the US authorities really need a stimulus package as big as the $3tn to $4tn being discussed by the Biden team? But for now, the markets, like the rest of us, are enjoying the warm glow of the first significant sentiment boost since the virus started ravaging the world economy. Read more here. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, called it ""very very unusual"", but said that a vaccine was ""one of the things that markets have been waiting for"". However, he told the BBC there were ""still lots and lots of questions around the vaccine"" and it was still too early to say when economies would bounce back or whether the market surge would be sustained. In the UK, shares in travel firms - which have been hit hard by the pandemic - saw the biggest rises, with British Airways owner IAG soaring 25%. Elsewhere in the sector, EasyJet shares rose 34%, while aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce surged almost 45%. Another sector of the economy that has been hit hard by coronavirus is hospitality - catering firm Compass Group saw its shares rise more than 21%. US-listed Royal Caribbean cruises meanwhile were up 29%, while travel booking firm Expedia jumped 24% and Disney climbed almost 12%. However, shares in those companies that have benefitted in the crisis fell sharply given the hopes of a successful vaccine. Shares in grocery delivery firm Ocado - which has seen sales soar amid the shift towards online shopping - dropped more than 11% Takeaway ordering firm Just Eat fell more than 8% And in the US, Zoom fell more than 17% and exercise bike firm Peloton was down more than 20% Drugmakers have been racing to be the first to develop a successful coronavirus vaccine. If Pfizer's vaccine is authorised, the number of doses will be limited initially. Many questions also remain, including how long the vaccine will provide protection. Stock markets hadalready been rallyingin response Saturday's declaration that Joe Biden had won the race to become the next US president. The Pfizer announcement then pushed market optimism ""exceedingly high"", but it ""could fade"" said Neil Wilson. ""We should not be jumping any guns here, but ultimately a vaccine that works effectively would be good for the economy and favours the cyclical parts of the market that we thought were going to struggle,"" he said. ""It's clear the market is forward looking and pricing in recovery in a number of beaten-down areas next year."" Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""The Pfizer announcement is not yet a panacea, but adds to investor sentiment which had already been buoyed by the Biden victory, and has sent markets to strongly positive levels."" He noted that airline and related stocks had been rising rapidly, while ""housebuilders, banks and retailers are all in the boat currently being lifted by a rising tide"". ""It is still early days, and the practicalities point to any meaningful distribution not being available until the first few months of next year,"" he added. ""Even so, the news is without question a positive development and has certainly captured the imagination of investors.""

Who would get the vaccine and how?,"If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won't be enough to go around. Research labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine. Unprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. So who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind? Vaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed. To date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox -  and that took 200 years. The rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations. Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine. Russia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of immune response in patients and has rolled out the vaccine for public use while late-stage trials continue. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced. Neither are on the World Health Organization's list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans. Some of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech say preliminary analysis shows their vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. They plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November. Pfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful. There are dozens of other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way. Not all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time. But even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear. Oxford vaccine trial paused as participant falls ill How close to developing a vaccine are we? Governments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved. The UK government, for example,has signed dealsfor undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. But not all countries are in a position to do likewise. Organisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates ""a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations"". This in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries. In the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example. Dr MariÃ¢ngela SimÃ£o, the WHO's assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check. ""The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more."" The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field. At least 94 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine planknown as Covax,external, which aims to raise $2bn (Â£1.52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get ""rapid, fair and equitable access"" to Covid-19 vaccines. The facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed. Having a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021. ""With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,"" says Gavi's CEO Dr Seth Berkley. ""If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe."" While billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine. Prices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (Â£24 to Â£28). AstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine ""at cost"" - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic. The Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (Â£2.28) a dose. But patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases. In the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way. Other countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population. People receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged. In the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill. Although the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won't be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. ""Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,"" Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President told the BBC. As the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised. The Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers. As more vaccine is produced, allocation is increased to cover 20% of the population - this time prioritising over 65s and other vulnerable groups. After everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process. ""The only certainty is that there won't be enough - the rest is still up in the air,"" says Dr Simao. Gavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount. Dr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, ""to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access"". A lot depends on which vaccine is successful. The ideal vaccine has a lot to live up to. It needs to be affordable. It needs to generate strong, long-lasting immunity. It needs a simple refrigerated distribution system and manufacturers must be able to scale-up production rapidly. The WHO, UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF / Doctors Without Borders), already have effective vaccination programmes in place around the world with the so called ""cold chain"" facilities - cooler trucks and solar fridges to keep vaccines at the right temperature as they travel from factory to field. World vaccine delivery 'will need 8,000 jumbo jets' But adding a new vaccine to the mix could pose huge logistical problems for those already facing a difficult environment. Vaccines usually need to be kept refrigerated - usually between 2C and 8C. That's not too much of a challenge in most developed countries, but can be an ""immense task"" where infrastructure is weak and electricity supply and refrigeration unstable. ""Maintaining vaccines under cold chain is already one of the biggest challenges' countries face and this will be exacerbated with the introduction of a new vaccine,"" MSF medical adviser Barbara Saitta told the BBC. ""You will need to add more cold chain equipment, make sure you always have fuel (to run freezer and refrigerators in absence of electricity) and repair/replace them when they break and transport them wherever you need them."" AstraZeneca has suggested their vaccine would need the regular cold chain between 2C and 8C. But at present it looks like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine would need ultra-cold chain - storage at -80C before being distributed. Welcoming the Pfizer announcement, Dr Richard Hatchett, of Cepi acknowledged that would ""remain a challenge for use in some settings"". ""This is something which will have to be addressed if the vaccine is to be made broadly available,"" he said. But the Ebola vaccine also needed very low temperatures, so it is not impossible. ""To keep the Ebola vaccine at -60Â°C or colder we had to use a special cold chain equipment to store and transport them, plus we had to train staff to use all this new equipment,"" said Barbara Saitta. There is also the question of the target population. Vaccination programmes usually target children, so agencies will have to plan how to reach people that normally are not part of the immunization program. As the world waits for the scientists to do their bit, many more challenges await. And vaccines are not the only weapon against coronavirus. ""Vaccines are not the only solution,"" Says Dr Simao, of the WHO. ""You need to have diagnostics. You need to have a way to decrease mortality, so you need therapeutics, and you need a vaccine. ""Besides that, you need everything else - social distancing, avoiding crowded places and so on."" ENDGAME:When will life get back to normal? EASY STEPS:What can I do?

Johnson warns of 'several more hurdles' for vaccine,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that we are still in a 'critical moment' of Covid-19 response The development of a coronavirus vaccine has ""cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go"", Boris Johnson has said. The PM saidearly findings showing a jab could prevent 90% of people getting Covid-19were positive, but added it was ""very, very early days"". He warned people not to ""rely on this news as a solution"" to the pandemic. ""The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at a critical moment,"" he said. It came as a further 21,350 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Monday, along with 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Stock markets rocket on Covid vaccine hopes Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? Who would get the coronavirus vaccine and how? England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said he was ""hopeful"" the first vaccine could be seen by Christmas and there would be a ""much better horizon"" by spring. Speaking alongside Mr Johnson at a Downing Street news conference, Prof Van-Tam said there was more work to be done before it became available to the public. ""This is a very important scientific breakthrough. I am certain of that,"" he said. He said age would be the ""biggest priority"" when drawing up a list of who would be able to access the new vaccine. Older care home residents and care home staff are at the top of apreliminary priority list published,externalby the government, followed by health workers. Prof Van-Tam described the development as similar to ""getting to the end of the playoff final, it's gone to penalties, the first player goes up and scores a goal"". ""You haven't won the cup yet, but what it does is it tells you that the goalkeeper can be beaten,"" he said. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? The prime minister said ""if and when"" the vaccine was approved for use, the UK ""will be ready to use it"". He said 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate up to 20 million people - had been ordered, putting the UK near the front of the queue of countries in securing the jab. Mr Johnson said he had talked for a long time about ""the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill"" with a solution. ""I can tell you that tonight that toot of the bugle is louder, but it's still some way off, we absolutely cannot rely on this news as a solution,"" he said. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means The vaccine - developed by Pfizer and German-based BioNTech - has been hailed as a ""milestone"" by many scientists. It has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries with no safety concerns raised. Prof Van-Tam warned it was not yet known whether any vaccine would prevent someone passing on coronavirus to someone else. Dr Charlie Weller, a vaccines specialist at the Wellcome Trust, said the speed of the vaccine's progress was ""phenomenal"" but warned no single jab would be a silver bullet against the virus. She added that the technology behind the vaccine, so-called messenger RNA, had not been proved effective in jabs before. It has been suggested it could lead to safer vaccines for many types of viruses in future. Meanwhile, Surrey Police chief constable Gavin Stephens confirmed discussions with the Army were under way to determine the location of mass Covid-19 vaccination centres. He said there was a question over whether vaccinations should happen in the same place as testing and how many sites would be needed to meet capacity. GPs in England have been told to prepare to give patients two vaccine doses - to be delivered between 21 and 28 days apart - during clinics that could run between 08:00 and 20:00 GMT seven days a week as early as December, according to the British Medical Association (BMA). The BMA, which represents doctors, said it expects ""vaccine availability to be limited to begin with, meaning only small numbers of vaccine may be given in December and most vaccinations taking place in early 2021"". Managing expectations seemed to be a key theme of Monday's televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam were at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The PM said we must not ""slacken our resolve"", while Prof Van-Tam said it would not make ""any difference"" for the second wave this winter. Their message was simple - do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But the announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, the jab's ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain, and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome - and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. It could be that one of the many other vaccines being trialled proves more effective in the long-term. But, as Prof Van-Tam said, Monday's news showed the opponent could be beaten. Mr Johnson said levels of Covid-19 remained significant and were doubling in many areas, with recent data showing one in 90 people in England currently has the virus. ""There is a long way before we have got this thing beat,"" he said. He reiterated the government's intention to end England's current lockdown on 2 December and replace it with tiered regional restrictions.

Stock markets soar on vaccine,"Stock markets have rocketed on hopes of a potential breakthrough in the search for a vaccine against Covid-19. Drugs firm Pfizer's own shares climbed 9% after it said that preliminary analysisindicated that its coronavirus vaccine was 90% effective. Markets, already buoyed after a clear end to the US election, piled on gains. The FTSE 100 jumped nearly 5%. But some of the initial optimism appeared to fade by the end of the trading session. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had jumped 5.6% in opening trade, closed up about 3%. The S&P 500 also retreated from its morning leap, ending just 1.1% higher, short of a new record. Meanwhile the Nasdaq, where many of the tech firms that have benefited from the lockdowns are listed, fell 1.5%. Covid vaccine: First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? The vaccine hopes revived investor appetite for airlines, hotels, energy firms and others hit hardest by the pandemic, sending shares soaring - in some cases by more than 40%. Firms lifted by the pandemic dived, in contrast, dived. Such sizable swings are rare. In the case of the UK, the FTSE 100 added roughly Â£82bn to the value of its shares in the market's best day since March - and one of the ten largest ever single-day gains for the index. Markets are primarily about sentiment - does tomorrow look better than today - and in that regard there has been a radical and probably permanent sea change. With more vaccines in development that optimism could grow. What this result demonstrates is that while the virus is not yet beaten it is beatable. That ray of light has lit up stock markets around the world. As always, some people in the markets are already looking for something else to worry about. If we are returning to a semblance of normality in the months ahead, do the US authorities really need a stimulus package as big as the $3tn to $4tn being discussed by the Biden team? But for now, the markets, like the rest of us, are enjoying the warm glow of the first significant sentiment boost since the virus started ravaging the world economy. Read more here. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, called it ""very very unusual"", but said that a vaccine was ""one of the things that markets have been waiting for"". However, he told the BBC there were ""still lots and lots of questions around the vaccine"" and it was still too early to say when economies would bounce back or whether the market surge would be sustained. In the UK, shares in travel firms - which have been hit hard by the pandemic - saw the biggest rises, with British Airways owner IAG soaring 25%. Elsewhere in the sector, EasyJet shares rose 34%, while aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce surged almost 45%. Another sector of the economy that has been hit hard by coronavirus is hospitality - catering firm Compass Group saw its shares rise more than 21%. US-listed Royal Caribbean cruises meanwhile were up 29%, while travel booking firm Expedia jumped 24% and Disney climbed almost 12%. However, shares in those companies that have benefitted in the crisis fell sharply given the hopes of a successful vaccine. Shares in grocery delivery firm Ocado - which has seen sales soar amid the shift towards online shopping - dropped more than 11% Takeaway ordering firm Just Eat fell more than 8% And in the US, Zoom fell more than 17% and exercise bike firm Peloton was down more than 20% Drugmakers have been racing to be the first to develop a successful coronavirus vaccine. If Pfizer's vaccine is authorised, the number of doses will be limited initially. Many questions also remain, including how long the vaccine will provide protection. Stock markets hadalready been rallyingin response Saturday's declaration that Joe Biden had won the race to become the next US president. The Pfizer announcement then pushed market optimism ""exceedingly high"", but it ""could fade"" said Neil Wilson. ""We should not be jumping any guns here, but ultimately a vaccine that works effectively would be good for the economy and favours the cyclical parts of the market that we thought were going to struggle,"" he said. ""It's clear the market is forward looking and pricing in recovery in a number of beaten-down areas next year."" Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""The Pfizer announcement is not yet a panacea, but adds to investor sentiment which had already been buoyed by the Biden victory, and has sent markets to strongly positive levels."" He noted that airline and related stocks had been rising rapidly, while ""housebuilders, banks and retailers are all in the boat currently being lifted by a rising tide"". ""It is still early days, and the practicalities point to any meaningful distribution not being available until the first few months of next year,"" he added. ""Even so, the news is without question a positive development and has certainly captured the imagination of investors.""

Who would get vaccine and how?,"If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won't be enough to go around. Research labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine. Unprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. So who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind? Vaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed. To date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox -  and that took 200 years. The rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations. Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine. Russia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of immune response in patients and has rolled out the vaccine for public use while late-stage trials continue. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced. Neither are on the World Health Organization's list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans. Some of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech say preliminary analysis shows their vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. They plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November. Pfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful. There are dozens of other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way. Not all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time. But even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear. Oxford vaccine trial paused as participant falls ill How close to developing a vaccine are we? Governments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved. The UK government, for example,has signed dealsfor undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. But not all countries are in a position to do likewise. Organisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates ""a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations"". This in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries. In the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example. Dr MariÃ¢ngela SimÃ£o, the WHO's assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check. ""The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more."" The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field. At least 94 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine planknown as Covax,external, which aims to raise $2bn (Â£1.52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get ""rapid, fair and equitable access"" to Covid-19 vaccines. The facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed. Having a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021. ""With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,"" says Gavi's CEO Dr Seth Berkley. ""If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe."" While billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine. Prices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (Â£24 to Â£28). AstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine ""at cost"" - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic. The Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (Â£2.28) a dose. But patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases. In the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way. Other countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population. People receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged. In the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill. Although the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won't be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. ""Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,"" Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President told the BBC. As the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised. The Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers.

After everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process. ""The only certainty is that there won't be enough - the rest is still up in the air,"" says Dr Simao. Gavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount. Dr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, ""to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access"".

US woman conquers storied El Capitan summit in day,"File photo of Emily Harrington American Emily Harrington is being celebrated for becoming one of the few women to free-climb Yosemite National Park's famous El Capitan within a day. She is also the first woman to have used a challenging route known as the Golden Gate to reach the 3,000ft (1,000m) summit within 24 hours.

US woman first female to climb El Capitan in day,"File photo of Emily Harrington American Emily Harrington is being celebrated for becoming one of the few women to free-climb Yosemite National Park's famous El Capitan within a day.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president.""

Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader.

The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

"Man who rammed scooter rider jailed for 10 yearsChristian Verrall caused his victim life-changing injuries in the attack, Cardiff Crown Court heard.Wales","This video can not be played Craig Bond needed surgery for his injuries A driver has been jailed for 10 years for ramming into a scooter rider who accidentally cracked his wing mirror. Christian Verrall, 32, caused 20-year-old Craig Bond life-changing injuries in the attack in Pill, Newport, earlier this year. Verrall performed a U-turn to chase Mr Bond through busy streets, his trial heard. He was convicted last month of wounding with intent. Cardiff Crown Court heard Verrall used his 1,000kg Ford Fiesta as a ""weapon"". Mr Bond was sent flying over the bonnet, leaving him with fractures to his leg and foot. He now has ""suicidal thoughts"" and has continuing problems with his leg, the court heard. Verrall's trial heard he had dumped the car and reported it stolen. When he was shown CCTV footage of what happened, he told police: ""That doesn't even look like me."" However, the father of one, from Newport, later admitted dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice. Christian Verrall used his 1,000kg Ford Fiesta as a ""weapon"" Sentencing him, Judge Caroline Rees QC said: ""You lost your temper and it is clear from the evidence that the red mist of rage descended."" In mitigation, Verrall's lawyer Harry Baker claimed his client suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder due to ""an early-life trauma"". Det Con Rebecca Hamilton, an officer involved in the case, said the level of violence used was ""appalling"". ""This has been a difficult and distressing time for the victim and his family,"" she said. Verrall was also disqualified from driving for nine years and eight months.

It's been nearly a week since the 3 November election day, and there are another 10 weeks to go until Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump.

He and David Leesley, 25, then killed her and hid her body parts in undergrowth, the trial at Coventry Crown Court was told. Maynard-Ellis was also found guilty of rape charges relating to another woman. The four rapes, an attempted rape, and threats to kill were revealed when a woman came forward after his murder arrest.

The 'wobble room' helping NHS staff through CovidStaff at the Royal Derby Hospital created the room as a place to escape from the intense pressures.HealthCoronavirus: Evening updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening.UK,"In small room in the Royal Derby Hospital, there's a table bearing a laminated sign. ""You are not alone,"" it says. It continues: ""Kindness will get you through. Embrace the challenge. Look after each other. You are stronger than you think."" This is the ""wobble room"", set aside not for patients but for front-line staff to get them away - briefly - from the intense pressure and strain experienced in the first wave of Covid-19. ""We made a wobble room because that's what we needed,"" Kelly-Ann Gurney, an intensive-care nurse, told the BBC. ""It's a room where staff could just go and sit and cry if they needed to and get it all out and then come back and 'put their face on' and get back into it again."" Now the second wave is hitting the hospital, and the need for the room is just as great. Concerns are growing about the physical and mental health of front-line NHS staff. There has been no lull since the April peak of the virus as normal treatments and operations, postponed during the crisis, have returned to hospitals. The second wave is now breaking on them, but this time there has been no widespread clearing of beds and cancellations of non-urgent work to create capacity for Covid patients. To add to the pressure, winter with all its additional health challenges is not far off, and some staff are wondering whether they can cope. Covid-19: NHS in England moves to highest alert level How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Coronavirus: NHS workers who died in the pandemic Caroline Swan, a senior sister and manager of the intensive care unit at the Royal Derby, says she is ready to face what is ahead but feels very tired. ""I am also very concerned. My staff are very tired and stressed out. We have a lot of sickness either due to burnout or they are unwell. ""A lot of staff have to self-isolate at home - and that puts a lot of strain on staffing here."" Dr Magnus Harrison, medical director of the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Trust, says managing rotas is getting harder due to staff sickness and the need for some to self-isolate if family members are infected. ""It is worth acknowledging what staff did in the first wave. They behaved tremendously and worked incredibly hard, and we're expecting them to do it again in winter - and Covid numbers could be higher than in the first wave. People are tired out."" Intensive care nurse Kelly-Ann Gurney says staff will support each other The Royal College of Nursing has said it has ""grave concerns"" about how services will be safely staffed this winter with the NHS in England back at the highest alert level. It argues that even with an increase in newly trained nurses and those returning from retirement, there may not be enough staff to cope with the second Covid wave. Sir Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, said at a recent Downing Street media conference that about 30,000 NHS staff were either off with coronavirus or having to self-isolate. He added that controlling the spread of the virus in local communities was essential if the NHS was to be fully staffed. A Department of Health spokesman said it was committed to ensuring the NHS in England had ""the funding and resources it needs, including front-line staff"". He added: ""We are on our way to delivering 50,000 more nurses by the end of this Parliament - with already over 14,000 more in the NHS over the last year."" Dr Greg Fletcher, an intensive-care consultant, has worked at Royal Derby for 12 years. He points to the unprecedented strain of caring for very sick patients in critical-care beds, some of whom will not survive because there is no cure for the coronavirus. ""I've seen more people die seemingly needlessly or unexpectedly in the last six months than I have seen in the whole of my career. It's been despite trying everything we could to save life. It does take its toll on an emotional and psychological level."" Staff at the hospital are encouraged to think about what they are looking forward to The mood at the Royal Derby is stoical. Staff know what to expect after their experience of the first wave. But this time the days are shorter and colder, and there is no opportunity to take a break in the sunshine. Kelly-Ann Gurney says ""a lot of staff are struggling"". But she adds: ""We've done it before and we'll do it again. We just have to support each other through it."" Greg Fletcher adds that there will be no let-up and no holidays to look forward to. ""We go into the next few months with a significant degree of trepidation.""

The rowdy protests that changed the lives of 14 million people," Their rebellious protests to change the law Their rebellious protests to change the law A train pulls into Cardiff Queen Street Station on a bright spring morning and the carriage doors slide open. Quickly, a young man in a black beanie hat launches himself out of his wheelchair from the platform onto the train carriage floor. To the surprise of the passengers, he handcuffs himself to a handrail. Further along the platform, others have done the same. The man in the hat is pulled from the train by two police officers who struggle to keep hold of him. He twists and turns, managing to break free for a few seconds in a vain attempt to get back on board. The train’s going nowhere. That’s what this small group of protesters want. By disrupting the service, they’re hoping to highlight something they come up against daily - the difficulties of accessing public transport. One officer tells a young demonstrator she’s causing an obstruction to the train. But the woman tells him from her wheelchair that the station itself is the obstruction. “I couldn’t access Platform 3,” she says. The woman is initially arrested, but then let off with a warning. It’s difficult for the police to put people in wheelchairs in their inaccessible vans - and that’s why, she reckons, she’s been “de-arrested”. This dramatic protest - in spring 1995 - was just one of many staged on buses and trains across the UK in the fight for disabled civil rights. Back then, it was not illegal to discriminate against disabled people in many areas of everyday life.  By Damon Rose A train pulls into Cardiff Queen Street Station on a bright spring morning and the carriage doors slide open. Quickly, a young man in a black beanie hat launches himself out of his wheelchair from the platform onto the train carriage floor. To the surprise of the passengers, he handcuffs himself to a handrail. Further along the platform, others have done the same.

It’s difficult for the police to put people in wheelchairs in their inaccessible vans - and that’s why, she reckons, she’s been “de-arrested”. This dramatic protest - in spring 1995 - was just one of many staged on buses and trains across the UK in the fight for disabled civil rights. Back then, it was not illegal to discriminate against disabled people in many areas of everyday life.  Barbara Lisicki felt angry and ignored. “There was no sense of outrage anywhere until we started really pushing it,” she says. “Disabled people were so clearly socially excluded.” In the early 1970s, Barbara was living in north London with her mum and brothers. As a young child, she was “non-disabled”. She couldn’t get on with the rules at her “posh and very strict school” and her sense of personal justice was already being tested. “I got expelled. It was a convent run by nuns. I was rejecting the mindless discipline and religious zealotry. “I built up so many detentions there wasn’t enough time in the year for me to do them all.” Barbara Lisicki with her former partner and fellow campaigner Alan Holdsworth  Soon afterwards, Barbara developed a high temperature which wouldn’t go away - it was an early sign that her life was going to change. Eventually, she ended up at a specialist juvenile rheumatology hospital in Taplow, Buckinghamshire. She remained there for over a year. Barbara tells me she was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis which causes pain, swelling and stiffness in her joints. It’s an autoimmune condition usually affecting the hands, feet and wrists. As Barbara puts it: “It’s basically where your body starts attacking itself.” She made some friends at Taplow, but describes the overall experience as “horrible and oppressive”. Once again, she found herself breaking the rules - regularly escaping the ward with an older girl. In the hospital, they were made to use wheelchairs so as not to put too much weight on their hips. “But we used to dump the wheelchairs in the bushes and hitchhike to the pub,” says Barbara. “They’d be sending out search parties and we’d be down there having a vodka and lime. I was 16.” Barbara Lisicki Barbara acknowledges she was smart, well-read and “a player”. She got a degree at university and a postgraduate teaching qualification. “I thought: ‘I’m not going to be able to do a manual or factory job. Basically, I’m going to have to do something where I can sit down a lot!’” But she struggled to get a teaching job. That’s when her “get it” moment happened. She realised that employers were unwilling to offer a job to a disabled person. Many disabled people have “get it” moments, including me. I'm blind, and when I was in my early 20s a security guard tried to stop me taking my guide dog into a cinema. Other staff helped me, but for the whole film I was worried I’d be made to leave, when I hadn’t done anything wrong. Barbara says her opportunities were blocked by discrimination. “I put down [on application forms] I had a long-term condition - I’m not even sure I used the term disabled person. I simply wasn’t getting jobs.” “Everybody I qualified with on the teaching course got taken on except me. I’d done better than many of them - achieving credits and distinctions. “It just struck me then, it was because I had an impairment. I was a disabled person.”  Barbara Lisicki felt angry and ignored. “There was no sense of outrage anywhere until we started really pushing it,” she says. “Disabled people were so clearly socially excluded.” In the early 1970s, Barbara was living in north London with her mum and brothers.

I was a disabled person.”  Sue Elsegood was, like Barbara, part of a network of demonstrators determined to bring about change. She was the young woman arrested - and then de-arrested - at Cardiff Queen Street Station. For her, it started in 1990 when she got a call from a friend asking if she fancied hijacking a bus. Back then, few buses were accessible and wheelchair users had to give several days’ notice to travel by train. Even then, they were put in the guard’s van because of lack of space in the carriages. She found herself in central London on a direct action protest run by CAT, the Campaign for Accessible Transport. They knew their wheelchairs meant they couldn’t actually get on a bus, but they could block traffic on Oxford Street. “I realised then that buses should be for everyone, including us. Up to that point, I just thought it was my fault I couldn’t walk and couldn’t get on,” she says. “It’s actually possible to invent a ramp or a lift for the bus, whereas for me to be medically-cured was not within the realms of possibility at that time.” Sue and 14 others were arrested, but charges against them were later dropped. She’s convinced it’s because the magistrates’ courts weren’t accessible. Sue Elsegood at a 1990s bus protest (above) and more recently (below)   Disabled people then, as now, didn’t want to be seen as charity cases. In 1989, Barbara Lisicki went on television to say so. She didn’t accept the negative portrayals, as she saw it, of disabled people on shows like Children in Need. “If you make a disabled person an object of charity, you’re not going to see them as your equal,” she told BBC executives on the discussion programme, Network. “It isn’t just about individuals giving money. It isn’t just about having mass appeals on television. It’s about having rights. I want people to realise that disabled people have no rights.” ITV was not spared. In 1988, it started its own charity extravaganza. Telethon was on air for 27 hours non-stop over the late May Bank Holiday. The main studio was filled with a cheering audience, giant cheques were waved in the air, and an array of famous faces performed for the cameras. Alan Holdsworth Alan Holdsworth, Barbara’s partner during the 1990s and fellow campaigner, got a phone call from a youth worker asking if he’d seen the negative way disabled people, she felt, were shown on screen. “She told me her young people were really pissed off with it. Was there anything we could do?” Alan, Barbara and friends were often asked to protest - they were known for their ability to organise. But Telethon was different. “It was the easiest action ever to organise,” says Alan who staged demos in both 1990 and 1992. “I couldn’t believe how many people hated it. I’d never watched it. I don’t want to watch that kind of thing, the images were just so pathetic.” Sue Elsegood was, like Barbara, part of a network of demonstrators determined to bring about change. She was the young woman arrested - and then de-arrested - at Cardiff Queen Street Station. For her, it started in 1990 when she got a call from a friend asking if she fancied hijacking a bus.

It isn’t just about having mass appeals on television. It’s about having rights. I want people to realise that disabled people have no rights.” ITV was not spared. In 1988, it started its own charity extravaganza. Telethon was on air for 27 hours non-stop over the late May Bank Holiday. The main studio was filled with a cheering audience, giant cheques were waved in the air, and an array of famous faces performed for the cameras. Alan Holdsworth Alan Holdsworth, Barbara’s partner during the 1990s and fellow campaigner, got a phone call from a youth worker asking if he’d seen the negative way disabled people, she felt, were shown on screen. “She told me her young people were really pissed off with it. Was there anything we could do?” Alan, Barbara and friends were often asked to protest - they were known for their ability to organise. But Telethon was different. “It was the easiest action ever to organise,” says Alan who staged demos in both 1990 and 1992. “I couldn’t believe how many people hated it. I’d never watched it. I don’t want to watch that kind of thing, the images were just so pathetic.”  One particular slogan the police singled out on placards in 1990 was “Piss on Pity”. “[It was] the one sign they said they’d arrest me for, if I didn’t take it down’,” says Alan - even though the bad language on other signs was much worse. But the provocative slogan stuck. And Piss on Pity T-shirts began to make appearances at later demos - after all, it would be more difficult for police to insist on them being removed. “I’ve now sold about 20,000 of them,” says Alan. At the 1992 Telethon, Alan and Barbara staged “Block Telethon” - a demonstration and street-party with speeches, songs and comedy - outside ITV’s studios on London’s South Bank. Over 1,000 activists blocked the road making it difficult for celebrities’ cars to get into the building. ITV’s 1992 Telethon was to be the last. More from BBC News: Was 1995 the year that changed everything for disabled people? Disability laws - what next? Frank Gardner on the ‘iceberg’ of disability  “Barbara and Alan were dynamic and engaging personalities. People were drawn to them to hear about these exciting protests - where we’d be chaining ourselves to buses and getting arrested,” says Sue Elsegood. “They both had a political vision as to how we could challenge structural inequalities - and the demonstrations were powerful and quite sexy really.” In 1993, Sue, Barbara and Alan helped form a new group, the Disabled People’s Direct Action Network - or DAN. Over the next few years, DAN would stage many dramatic, non-violent protests across the UK. Barbara and Alan also used their alter egos - sharp-tongued comedian Wanda Barbara and singer-songwriter Johnny Crescendo - to drum up support at “Tragic But Brave” roadshow events and “Workhouse” cabarets. “We went around disability organisations performing and telling jokes,” says Alan. “We then talked to them in the bar afterwards to see what they wanted to do.” “The comedy and music was all about our experiences as disabled people. It was politicising us,” says Sue.

It was politicising us,” says Sue. DAN’s first high-profile national action took place in Christchurch, Dorset. A by-election was to be held in the safe Conservative seat, after the death of MP Robert Adley. The Tory candidate, Rob Hayward, had already been an MP - but had lost his seat at the 1992 general election. In parliament, he’d upset campaigners when he “talked out” (deliberately wasted time) a reading of a disabled civil rights bill put forward by a Labour MP. It meant the bill couldn’t become law. A week later he apologised to MPs. DAN protesters in Christchurch Enraged, DAN members spent a day chasing him in their wheelchairs around Christchurch during his campaign. The tide was already turning against John Major’s Conservative government, but Alan Holdsworth believes DAN played a part in Rob Hayward’s defeat. The Liberal Democrats took Christchurch.

But it was the resourceful and unruly way DAN members approached public transport that really caught attention. Wheelchairs blocked main roads and DAN members either handcuffed themselves to buses - or pulled themselves underneath vehicles - to prevent them from moving. In February 1995, they brought traffic on Westminster Bridge in central London to a standstill. Barbara argued with a furious bus driver, Sue was carried away in her wheelchair by police, while Alan handcuffed himself to a double-decker. And the chants were infectious. They call us wheelchair warriors, we’re kicking up some fuss And we will keep on marching ‘til you let us on the bus At the Cardiff station protest - where Sue was let off by police - Alan was actually arrested and charged with obstructing a train. Barbara recalls how she and a friend were arrested at a London bus protest and taken to a police station with accessible cells. “They didn’t search us. We must’ve looked too innocent,” she says. “We had a camera with us and took photos in our cell.”  From 1982 to the mid-1990s there were 14 failed attempts to get civil rights legislation for disabled people through parliament. But thanks to both DAN’s direct action protests - and more traditional campaigning from Rights Now, a wider alliance of disability groups - the time for change was approaching.

Disabled people hoped for the same legal protection offered to ethnic minorities under the Race Relations Act, and women under the Sex Discrimination Act. In 1994, the Minister for Disabled People, Sir Nicholas Scott, had to apologise for misleading MPs over the government’s undercover attempts to kill a Labour private members bill, which would have given disabled people equal rights. Two months’ later he was replaced in the job by William Hague, who helped draft a new bill - a political compromise between government and parliament - that stood a better chance of becoming law. The Disability Discrimination Act, or DDA, passed on 8 November 1995. “An Act to make it unlawful to discriminate against disabled persons in connection with employment, the provision of goods, facilities and services or the disposal or management of premises; to make provision about the employment of disabled persons; and to establish a National Disability Council.” But still campaigners felt it didn’t go far enough. Unlike the race and sex discrimination acts, there was no body with legal powers to make sure the new rules were being enforced. The Disability Rights Commission wasn’t established until 1999. Barbara Lisicki describes the National Disability Council set up instead as an “ineffective compromise body”. Some measures outlined in the DDA, including the “reasonable adjustments” service providers had to make so disabled people had access, didn’t have to be in place for nearly a decade. And what about being able to get on and off buses and trains more easily? That would need more legislation and more years of waiting. Barbara is both critical and pragmatic about the DDA. “We accepted we had some level of victory because legislation had finally been passed. But we were all aware it was weak and wasn’t going to do what was needed.” DAN’s work was not finished. There were more protests.

It was late 1997, a few months after Tony Blair had moved into Number 10, and DAN heard that Labour wanted to reduce the welfare budget. They rolled up at the gates of Downing Street. “We took the paint in takeaway food containers, so it looked like we’d taken our lunch with us as tourists. We threw it, spelling out the words ‘Blair’s blood’. “The cuts were going to make us bleed, make us suffer, as disabled people. We knew there were lots of people who wouldn’t be able to afford their heating with the benefit cuts he was proposing.” Sue remembers how one activist had a seizure during the protest. “He fell out of his chair and got covered in paint. The police didn’t know what to do. They went in to arrest us all but didn’t want to get red paint on their uniforms. “It wasn’t permanent damage, we were non-violent. We were out to get a message across and to reverse Blair’s policy. And we did, he didn’t go ahead with it at that time.” Podcast: Ouch - where real disability talk happens It’s a quarter of a century since the Disability Discrimination Act gave disabled people a legal starting point in the struggle for full civil rights. The positive thing that most people agree on is that it acknowledged in law, for the first time, that disabled people were discriminated against. Ten years ago, the DDA and more than 100 other separate pieces of legislation in England, Wales and Scotland, were rolled together into one piece of law, the Equality Act 2010. DAN has been disbanded but, since the March lockdown, some old members have been meeting up on Zoom - a chance to reminisce. “When you were chained to a train or bus, you had to rely on other members to keep you safe. You didn’t want the driver heading off with you still attached,” says Sue. “There’s still that really strong bond between us. It’s because we had to trust each other with our lives.” Author: Damon Rose Editor/Producer: Paul Kerley Long reads editor: Kathryn Westcott Photography: Getty Images, PA Media, Shutterstock and Emma Lynch Additional images: Sue Elsegood, David Hevey (Wanda Barbara poster), Alan Holdsworth (aka Johnny Crescendo), Barbara Lisicki,Dave Lupton(Crippen cartoons) Video: BBC News and BBC Disability Programmes Unit/Rave Productions Thanks to Alex Cowan at theNational Disability Arts Collection and Archive How the falling boys were saved The story of the Mangrove Nine Emma's long wait for a life-saving call"

"Breaking|Breaking newsJohnson warns of 'several more hurdles' for vaccineBoris Johnson says virus vaccine has ""cleared significant hurdle"" but warns of ""several more"" hurdles to come.UK","This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that we are still in a 'critical moment' of Covid-19 response The development of a coronavirus vaccine has ""cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go"", Boris Johnson has said. The PM saidearly findings showing a jab could prevent 90% of people getting Covid-19were positive, but added it was ""very, very early days"". He warned people not to ""rely on this news as a solution"" to the pandemic. ""The biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at a critical moment,"" he said. It came as a further 21,350 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Monday, along with 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Stock markets rocket on Covid vaccine hopes Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine? Who would get the coronavirus vaccine and how? England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said he was ""hopeful"" the first vaccine could be seen by Christmas and there would be a ""much better horizon"" by spring. Speaking alongside Mr Johnson at a Downing Street news conference, Prof Van-Tam said there was more work to be done before it became available to the public. ""This is a very important scientific breakthrough. I am certain of that,"" he said. He said age would be the ""biggest priority"" when drawing up a list of who would be able to access the new vaccine. Older care home residents and care home staff are at the top of apreliminary priority list published,externalby the government, followed by health workers. Prof Van-Tam described the development as similar to ""getting to the end of the playoff final, it's gone to penalties, the first player goes up and scores a goal"". ""You haven't won the cup yet, but what it does is it tells you that the goalkeeper can be beaten,"" he said. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? The prime minister said ""if and when"" the vaccine was approved for use, the UK ""will be ready to use it"". He said 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate up to 20 million people - had been ordered, putting the UK near the front of the queue of countries in securing the jab. Mr Johnson said he had talked for a long time about ""the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill"" with a solution. ""I can tell you that tonight that toot of the bugle is louder, but it's still some way off, we absolutely cannot rely on this news as a solution,"" he said. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means The vaccine - developed by Pfizer and German-based BioNTech - has been hailed as a ""milestone"" by many scientists. It has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries with no safety concerns raised. Prof Van-Tam warned it was not yet known whether any vaccine would prevent someone passing on coronavirus to someone else. Dr Charlie Weller, a vaccines specialist at the Wellcome Trust, said the speed of the vaccine's progress was ""phenomenal"" but warned no single jab would be a silver bullet against the virus. She added that the technology behind the vaccine, so-called messenger RNA, had not been proved effective in jabs before. It has been suggested it could lead to safer vaccines for many types of viruses in future. Meanwhile, Surrey Police chief constable Gavin Stephens confirmed discussions with the Army were under way to determine the location of mass Covid-19 vaccination centres. He said there was a question over whether vaccinations should happen in the same place as testing and how many sites would be needed to meet capacity. GPs in England have been told to prepare to give patients two vaccine doses - to be delivered between 21 and 28 days apart - during clinics that could run between 08:00 and 20:00 GMT seven days a week as early as December, according to the British Medical Association (BMA). The BMA, which represents doctors, said it expects ""vaccine availability to be limited to begin with, meaning only small numbers of vaccine may be given in December and most vaccinations taking place in early 2021"". Managing expectations seemed to be a key theme of Monday's televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam were at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The PM said we must not ""slacken our resolve"", while Prof Van-Tam said it would not make ""any difference"" for the second wave this winter. Their message was simple - do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But the announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, the jab's ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain, and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome - and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. It could be that one of the many other vaccines being trialled proves more effective in the long-term. But, as Prof Van-Tam said, Monday's news showed the opponent could be beaten. Mr Johnson said levels of Covid-19 remained significant and were doubling in many areas, with recent data showing one in 90 people in England currently has the virus. ""There is a long way before we have got this thing beat,"" he said. He reiterated the government's intention to end England's current lockdown on 2 December and replace it with tiered regional restrictions.

Easing of Scottish Covid rules 'highly unlikely'The first minister does not expect any areas to move to a lower level when restrictions are reviewed on Tuesday.ScotlandComments,"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: FM says easing of restrictions ""highly unlikely"" Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions are ""highly unlikely"" to be eased when they are reviewed on Tuesday, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Tuesday will mark the first review of local measures under Scotland's new five-level alert system. The first minister said the curbs currently in place had undoubtedly had an impact on the spread of the virus. However, she said it was important for this to translate into a ""significant and sustained reduction in cases"". Ms Sturgeon said she ""would not expect areas to go down a level"", and that ""careful judgement"" would be given to whether any councils had to move up a level. What level has your area been put in? How does Scotland's five-level system work? Scotland began its new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions on 2 November, with most of the central belt in level three and much of the rest of the country in level two. This is due to be reviewed on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon said decisions would be made by her cabinet in the morning, then announced at Holyrood in the afternoon. The first minister said the measures currently in place were ""undoubtedly having a positive impact"" on the spread of the virus, with the increase in cases having ""pretty much levelled off"". The number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 19 on Monday, to 1,226, while the number in intensive care dropped by six to 105. However, Ms Sturgeon said there was a ""very real concern"" that overall case numbers were not yet falling. She said: ""Although there are positive signs, it's really important we start to see these translate into significant and sustained decline in Covid cases and we cannot be sure we are yet seeing that. ""So I think it is highly unlikely that we will see any significant easing of restrictions announced tomorrow. ""We can't afford for cases simply to plateau at their current quite high level - we need them to fall, otherwise we will be badly exposed by any rise in cases as we go further into winter."" There has been speculation that some areas, including Glasgow and Fife, could move up a level in the alert system, while some local leaders in areas like the Borders and Aberdeen have called for their levels to be reduced. When deciding on levels, ministers consider a range of data on case numbers and hospital admissions as well as issues like travel patterns and how closely local areas are interconnected. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It's not just the data on any given day we look at, we have to look at the trend and satisfy ourselves before any area moves down a level that a downward trend has been established and we think it is sustainable. ""Moving down a level is not a neutral act. It leads to opening up, and that leads to an increase in transmission, so we have to make sure the levels there are low enough to cope with that. ""I would not anticipate much easing of restrictions when we announce the first review outcome. ""I would not expect areas to go down a level. We are looking at whether there is a case for any part of the country to go up a level. ""We want to avoid that, but we have to make careful judgements."" Asked specifically about Glasgow - which accounted for 363 out of the 912 new cases registered on Monday - Ms Sturgeon said there had been a ""levelling off"" in cases locally. However, she said ministers had to consider whether the current restrictions ""allow us to continue to move that to a declining position"", or whether ""something more"" had to be done. Ms Sturgeon said she would announce on Tuesday whether the current travel advice barring people from moving in or out of level three areas would be backed up by new laws. And she said she was ""not anticipating"" a return to nation-wide restrictions, although she said she could not rule this out in future. The first minister also welcomed ""good news"" about vaccine development, as it emerged that one under developmentcan prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. She said: ""There is a long way to go of course, but this is news that should give us all some tentative hope - and it should give us some motivation to keep our efforts up in the meantime to keep the virus in check."" Meanwhile, the government is reviewing the status of anyone licensed to own a mink in Scotland after concerns about anew mutated strain of coronavirus linked to mink farms in Denmark.

Easing of Scottish Covid rules 'highly unlikely',"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: FM says easing of restrictions ""highly unlikely"" Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions are ""highly unlikely"" to be eased when they are reviewed on Tuesday, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Tuesday will mark the first review of local measures under Scotland's new five-level alert system. The first minister said the curbs currently in place had undoubtedly had an impact on the spread of the virus. However, she said it was important for this to translate into a ""significant and sustained reduction in cases"". Ms Sturgeon said she ""would not expect areas to go down a level"", and that ""careful judgement"" would be given to whether any councils had to move up a level. What level has your area been put in? How does Scotland's five-level system work? Scotland began its new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions on 2 November, with most of the central belt in level three and much of the rest of the country in level two. This is due to be reviewed on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon said decisions would be made by her cabinet in the morning, then announced at Holyrood in the afternoon. The first minister said the measures currently in place were ""undoubtedly having a positive impact"" on the spread of the virus, with the increase in cases having ""pretty much levelled off"". The number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 19 on Monday, to 1,226, while the number in intensive care dropped by six to 105. However, Ms Sturgeon said there was a ""very real concern"" that overall case numbers were not yet falling. She said: ""Although there are positive signs, it's really important we start to see these translate into significant and sustained decline in Covid cases and we cannot be sure we are yet seeing that. ""So I think it is highly unlikely that we will see any significant easing of restrictions announced tomorrow. ""We can't afford for cases simply to plateau at their current quite high level - we need them to fall, otherwise we will be badly exposed by any rise in cases as we go further into winter."" There has been speculation that some areas, including Glasgow and Fife, could move up a level in the alert system, while some local leaders in areas like the Borders and Aberdeen have called for their levels to be reduced. When deciding on levels, ministers consider a range of data on case numbers and hospital admissions as well as issues like travel patterns and how closely local areas are interconnected. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It's not just the data on any given day we look at, we have to look at the trend and satisfy ourselves before any area moves down a level that a downward trend has been established and we think it is sustainable. ""Moving down a level is not a neutral act. It leads to opening up, and that leads to an increase in transmission, so we have to make sure the levels there are low enough to cope with that. ""I would not anticipate much easing of restrictions when we announce the first review outcome. ""I would not expect areas to go down a level. We are looking at whether there is a case for any part of the country to go up a level. ""We want to avoid that, but we have to make careful judgements."" Asked specifically about Glasgow - which accounted for 363 out of the 912 new cases registered on Monday - Ms Sturgeon said there had been a ""levelling off"" in cases locally. However, she said ministers had to consider whether the current restrictions ""allow us to continue to move that to a declining position"", or whether ""something more"" had to be done. Ms Sturgeon said she would announce on Tuesday whether the current travel advice barring people from moving in or out of level three areas would be backed up by new laws. And she said she was ""not anticipating"" a return to nation-wide restrictions, although she said she could not rule this out in future. The first minister also welcomed ""good news"" about vaccine development, as it emerged that one under developmentcan prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. She said: ""There is a long way to go of course, but this is news that should give us all some tentative hope - and it should give us some motivation to keep our efforts up in the meantime to keep the virus in check."" Meanwhile, the government is reviewing the status of anyone licensed to own a mink in Scotland after concerns about anew mutated strain of coronavirus linked to mink farms in Denmark.

'Good progress' on airport testing - minister,"The UK is making ""good progress"" in developing a testing regime to reduce the quarantine period for international arrivals, the transport secretary has said. The ""test and release"" programme could allow a ""much reduced"" self-isolation period, Grant Shapps said. It is currently 14 days for many international arrivals. Mr Shapps also said rapid tests being used in Liverpool could ""open the way"" for quarantine-free air travel. He told an airport industry conference that the government aimed to launch the ""test and release"" programme after England's lockdown ends - currently due to be 2 December. ""Beyond the lockdown, this should encourage many more people to book flights with confidence knowing there is an option that allows them to shorten self isolation,"" the transport secretary said. The tests would be paid for by passengers arriving in the UK but the Department for Transport would not comment on how much they might cost. In other developments: The first effective coronavirus vaccine can preventmore than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, a preliminary analysis shows. Developers Pfizer and BioNTech described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"" Wales' 17-day firebreak lockdown has ended, meaning people can travel anywhere within the country, two households can again form a bubble and businesses that shut can now reopen Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidthe country's Covid-19 restrictions are ""highly unlikely"" to be easedwhen they are reviewed on Tuesday The coronavirus mutation causing concern in Denmarkhas arisen before in mink in the Netherlands, scientists have said - but it did not spread to humans there Mr Shapps said the government was working with other countries to help establish an ""international standard"" for self-isolation and testing to be carried out before travelling to and from the UK, to stop passengers having to quarantine on arrival in their destination country. And he said quick-turnaround tests being trialled in Liverpool gave ""some hope for optimism"" as they could ""open the way for non-quarantine air travel"". The air travel industry has beenhit hard by the drop in passenger numberssince the start of the pandemic, with airlines such as British Airways and EasyJetcutting thousands of jobs. Airline and airport groups have called on governments around the world to provide financial support for the struggling industry. Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon told the conference it was ""inconceivable"" the government had not taken more action to limit job losses across the aviation industry, adding that Mr Shapps's ""warm words"" needed ""to be translated into action"". Anyone arriving into the UK must self-isolate for 14 days unless travelling from a countrylisted by the government,external, with some exceptions for certain occupations. The mass coronavirus testing programme launched in Liverpool last week is the first trial of whole-city testing in England. All residents are being offered regular Covid-19 tests - whether or not they have symptoms. Children aged 11 and over will be tested in schoolsas part of the scheme, the city's council has said. The pilot includes amix of existing swab tests and the new lateral flow tests- which can provide a result within an hour without the need to use a lab. Testing a whole city for Covid: How will it work? Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? Earlier, Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast the new ""lateral flow"" test was available to everyone in Liverpool and could be a ""major breakthrough"" if successful. ""A test is only as good as the speed with which you can turn a result around,"" he said. ""What we've really been focusing on more recently is a faster test, so that people can act more quickly to prevent the spread of the virus so this, if we can make it work, is a major breakthrough."" BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher said rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests neededhigh levels of the virus in the body to work. It is not yet clear how good they are at catching people in the early stages of the infection, when the virus is still taking hold. They are similar to pregnancy tests and are easy, cheap and fast. Fluid from a nasal swab or saliva goes on to one end of the test, then a marking appears if the person is positive. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? The prime minister said last month that he shared ""people's frustrations"" at the turnaround times for results, following criticism of England's test-and-trace system. Mr Johnson's comments came after figures for the week ending 14 October showed that just 15.1% of people who were tested received their result within 24 hours. Last week, the government said it had hit its target of having the capacity tocarry out 500,000 coronavirus tests a day across the UK by the end of October. The data for 31 October showed just over 525,000 tests could be done - a doubling of capacity in two months. However, just under 300,000 tests were actually carried out. Mr Johnson previously said mass testing had""the potential to be a powerful new weapon in our fight against Covid-19"". However, some health experts have criticised the Liverpool trial, with Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, warning that plans to test asymptomatic people went against advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to prioritise tests for those displaying symptoms. Meanwhile on Sunday, another156 people in the UK were reported to have diedwithin 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, with a further 20,572 cases of the virus.

"Father jailed over death of blind teenage sonJohn Doak's blind son, 15-year-old Jack Mitchell, died from shaking injuries he received as a baby.Essex","John Doak admitted manslaughter of his 15-year-old son who died as a teenager A father who admitted causing the death of his teenage son by shaking him as a baby has been jailed for three years. Jack Mitchell, 15, from Harwich, Essex, died in March 2016 from a pulmonary infection and pneumonia. His biological father John Doak, 37, of Spalding, Lincolnshire, had denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Chelmsford Crown Court. Justice John Cavanagh said only Doak knew what happened as he was alone with the child when the incident happened. David Emanuel, defending Doak, said that according to an expert report ""what probably happened was the loss of control temporarily while trying to stop him crying"". Justice Cavanagh said Jack suffered severe brain damage, required 24-hour care, was blind and unable to talk, had limited ability to move and had a ""very poor... if non-existent"" quality of life as a result of the assault. ""The cause of his death was a shaking-type assault that you inflicted on Jack many years previously, on May 22 2001, when he was only four months old. ""In the intervening period, Jack suffered from brain damage and from other very serious health problems that were the direct result of your assault on him. ""However, I sentence you on the basis that you did not intend to kill him or to cause him really serious harm."" Mr Emanuel added that unemployed lorry driver Doak was married with three children and three step-children. He said Doak ""grieves for (Jack) every day"" and was otherwise of good character.

LiveLivePM to hold Covid update after vaccine breakthrough11 minutes ago,"UK PM Boris Johnson warns we cannot rely on vaccine news as a solution But deputy CMO for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, is hopeful of vaccine by Christmas First Covid vaccine 90% effective, preliminary Pfizer analysis shows Stock markets soar on vaccine hopes Wales' 17-day 'firebreak' lockdown has ended and new rules have come into force In the US, President-elect Joe Biden names his coronavirus advisory team Edited by Julian Joyce Well, that's us over and out for today. Here's a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world this evening: And following the Downing Street conference thelatest coronavirus figures,externalhave been released. There have been a further 21,350 cases of coronavirus across the UK and a further 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. That takes the total number of deaths by this measure to 49,063. The figures tend to be lower on a Monday as there is a lag in reporting over the weekend. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky says he has tested positive for Covid-19 but that he ""feels fine"". Writing on Twitter, the 42-year-old said he would go into self-isolation and would continue to work. ""It's gonna be fine,"" he posted. The former comedian-turned-politician joins other world leaders who contracted coronavirus, including Donald Trump in the US, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro.

Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Prof Van Tam is all about the metaphors tonight! First, with a football reference, we were told we hadnât won the cup but we now know the keeper can be beaten. Then we were asked to imagine a cold, rainy station platform with the bright lights of a train coming down the track - but various hurdles to overcome before we could get on board. Whatever the metaphor the message is clear: the vaccine news is positive but itâs still far from a solution. And while the metaphors might be attracting some mirth on Twitter, thereâs a serious point to them too. The science can be complex. What's key is finding a way to get across the essential information in way we can all understand. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Managing expectations seems to be a key theme of the televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam are at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The prime minister says we must not âslacken our resolveâ, while Prof Van-Tam says it will not make âany differenceâ for the second wave this winter. Their message is simple â do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But todayâs announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, its ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome â and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. The prime minister is asked how distribution of the vaccine would be prioritised. He says ministers will âlook at where the doses will be most appropriately distributedâ and that âeverything flowsâ from driving down the R rate. He adds that âpeople are pulling togetherâ under the current restrictions, and that he believes they will get the R rate to below one. One journalist points out there is global excitement about the vaccine and asks the PM how confident he is that it can be delivered. The prime minister says he is âvery hopefulâ as the vaccine task force has been  âsecuring supplies for the UK for some time now"". But Jonathan Van-Tam warns that âmany thingsâ can go wrong with vaccines during manufacture. âEvery single batch has to be quality assured and released. Things can and do and have always gone wrong,â he says.
âWe have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes.â Boris Johnson says he is optimistic about the UKâs prospects for next year, but adds that he does not want to âlet people run away with the ideaâ that todayâs news is a âslam dunkâ. Jonathan Van-Tam says that there is an ""enormous mental health burdenâ on people during lockdown. âOne of the things we can do to try and make the restrictions as short as possible is to follow them to the letter,â he says. The prime minister adds a cautious note, warning it is âcrucial that we do not overdo itâ.
âWe cannot let our enthusiasm tonight run away with us, folks,â he says. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Despite todayâs positive vaccine announcement, the PM struck a deliberately cautious tone. Boris Johnson stressed that news of an effective vaccine was not yet a solution. Number 10 clearly doesnât want the suggestion of a scientific breakthrough to be any sort of green light for people to flout lockdown rules at what he described as a critical moment. The PM has been among the most optimistic â perhaps hopeful - in the past about science providing the way out of this pandemic. But the message today was, 'weâre not there yet', calling instead for the public to keep their resolve. Boris Johnson will know the political and economic difficulties facing Downing St are far from over too. Making a football reference Jonathan Van-Tam says that ""we haven't won the cup yet"", but what it ""does tell you is that the keeper can be beaten"". The deputy chief medical officer for England said we do not yet know what the vaccine breakthrough means for when we can get back to a normal life. ""Frankly weâre in the middle of the second wave and I donât see the vaccines making any difference for the wave we are now in. ""Iâm hopeful that it may prevent future waves but this one we have to battle through to the end without a vaccine. We have to keep pressing hard for now."" Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the Pfizer vaccine news is an ""important scientific breakthrough"" but warns that the message is to stand fast and not get overexcited about where we are. He says the next step will be to see safety data which he expects to see in the coming days. Van-Tam says if it does get to the stage where vaccines are authorised for use in the UK there will have to be decisions made by the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation as to who gets priotiry. This list cannot be finalised yet, he says. The prime minister is joined by Brigaidier Joe Fossey who has led the army's support for the mass testing pilot in Liverpool. Holding up a lateral flow test Brigadier Fossey says they offer the chance for more regular and rapid testing. He says: ""Our message to the people of Liverpool is clear: we are set up and ready for you to come and get tested. Please do not hesitate."" He says what they are trialling is a ""possible route out of lockdown and a way to get on with our lives"". The prime minister said that mass testing is still in its infancy and at present is no substitute for the national restrictions, social distancing and hand hygiene and ""all the rest"". ""I know it has been a hard first week of the autumn restrictions,"" he said. But Johnson added the country must get through this until 2 December when the current lockdown measures will expire and ""we plan to move forward with a tiered approach"". The prime minister says despite a vaccine being on the horizon we must continue to do everything we can to keep the R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - down. He warns that the number of Covid patients in hospital has risen to 13,000 as of 5 November, and says ""we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak"". Boris Johnson says that it is important more than ever to follow the rules but says we must hope and believe mass testing will help. He urges people in Liverpool to get tested and says ""we have tested thousands of people but there is still more to do"". Meanwhile, Joe Biden has made his first speech about coronavirus after forming a panel made up of 13 scientists to advise him as he prepares to take office. He tells Americans that regardless of how they voted in the election, they should wear masks in order to protect themselves and other citizens. ""Wear a mask, it's the single most potent weapon against the virus,"" he says. Face coverings have become politically divisive in the US. Biden says the vaccine development process must be transparent so Americans can have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine. He notes it won't be available for many months yet. ""The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. Although I'm not in office yet I'm just laying out what we expect to do and hope some of it can be done between now and the time I'm sworn in."" He adds that ""there's a need for bold action"" as cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up. His remarks contrast with many of Donald Trump's who at times underplayed the severity of the pandemic. Boris Johnson begins by saying that people are asking that ""does the progress towards a vaccine made today mean we are at the beginning of the end to our troubles"". ""We have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go,"" he says. But he adds if and when the vaccine is ready to be sued the UK is ""towards the front of the pack"" as it has already ordered 40 million doses. There will be an NHS-led vaccine programme, Johnson says. He adds he must stress that ""these are very, very early days"" and the distant toot of the scientific bugle is louder but still someway off. Prime Minister Boris Johnson begins speaking at the Downing Street news conference. Today he is joined by Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, and Brigadier Joe Fossey. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter News that the first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19 has meant vaccine conspiracy theories are being shared again on social media. For months, theyâve been spreading in local Facebook groups, on Instagram pages and in WhatsApp chats. The false claims include the baseless theory that a vaccine could be a way for Microsoft boss Bill Gates to secretly insert microchips into people â so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has debunked this particular claim in the past.Nevertheless, Bill Gatesâs name has been trending on Twitter since the announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech. Rumours have also been circulating about when the announcement happened â with the suggestion that it was deliberately timed to happen after Joe Biden was declared president-elect. Thereâs currently no evidence to support this claim. When you see these sorts of claims, remember to think about why a post was shared, how it makes you feel and to pause before passing it on. Get in touch if youâre seeing speculation like this on social media that you want me to investigate:Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Today's news that avaccine can prevent more than 90% of peoplefrom getting Covid-19 is based on preliminary analysis. There's still a way to go before any vaccine can be given to the wider public and our lives can go back to how they were pre-pandemic. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps puts this news into context. This video can not be played Covid vaccine: what does the Pfizer vaccine news mean? Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to host a Downing Street news conference shortly. It follows today's news that the company behind a vaccine trial has said it is 90% effective against the virus.

"'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protectionThe vaccine is a ""significant step"" forward for getting life back to normal, but challenges remain.","The first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, a preliminary analysis shows. The developers - Pfizer and BioNTech - described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"". Their vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns have been raised. The companies plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of the month. No vaccine has gone from the drawing board to being proven highly effective in such a short period of time. There are still huge challenges ahead, but the announcement has been warmly welcomed with scientists describing themselves smiling ""ear to ear"" and some suggesting life could be back to normal by spring. ""I am probably the first guy to say that, but I will say that with some confidence,"" said Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University. Stock markets rocket on Covid vaccine hopes Analysis: Have we finally got a vaccine? Who would get the coronavirus vaccine and how? A vaccine - alongside better treatments - is seen as the best way of getting out of the restrictions that have been imposed on all our lives. The data shows that two doses, three weeks apart, are needed. The trials - in US, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Turkey - show 90% protection is achieved seven days after the second dose. However, the data presented is not the final analysis as it is based on only the first 94 volunteers to develop Covid so the precise effectiveness of the vaccine may change when the full results are analysed. Dr Albert Bourla, the chairman of Pfizer, said: ""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis."" Prof Ugur Sahin, one of the founders of BioNTech, described the results as a ""milestone"". This video can not be played Sarah Montague reacted with excitement upon hearing Professor Bell's views on the significance of today's vaccine news A limited number of people may get the vaccine this year. Pfizer and BioNTech say they will have enough safety data by the third week of November to take their vaccine to regulators. Until it has been approved it will not be possible for countries to begin their vaccination campaigns. The two companies say they will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. Each person needs two doses. The UK should get 10 million doses by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered. Not everyone will get the vaccine straight away and countries are each deciding who should be prioritised. Hospital staff and care home workers will be near the top of every list because of the vulnerable people they work with, as will the elderly who are most at risk of severe disease. The UK is likely to prioritise older resident in care homes and the people that work there. But it saysa final decision has not been made,external, saying it will depend on how well the vaccine works in different age-groups and how the virus is spreading. People under 50 and with no medical problems are likely to be last in the queue. There are still many unanswered questions as this is only interim data. We do not know if the vaccine stops you spreading the virus or just from developing symptoms. Or if it works equally well in high-risk elderly people. The biggest question - how long does immunity last - will take months or potentially years to answer. There are also massive manufacturing and logistical challenges in immunising huge numbers of people, as the vaccine has to be kept in ultra-cold storage at below minus 80C. The vaccine appears safe from the large trials so far but nothing, including paracetamol, is 100% safe. There are around a dozen vaccines in the final stages of testing - known as a phase 3 trial - but this is the first to show any results. It uses a completely experimental approach - that involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code - in order to train the immune system. Previous trials have shown the vaccine trains the body to make both antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T-cells to fight the coronavirus. The UK's chief medical advisor Prof Chris Whitty said the results showed the ""power of science"" and was a ""reason for optimism"" for 2021. Allow Twitter content?

LiveLivePM to hold Covid update after vaccine breakthrough10 minutes ago,"UK PM Boris Johnson warns we cannot rely on vaccine news as a solution But deputy CMO for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, is hopeful of vaccine by Christmas First Covid vaccine 90% effective, preliminary Pfizer analysis shows Stock markets soar on vaccine hopes Wales' 17-day 'firebreak' lockdown has ended and new rules have come into force In the US, President-elect Joe Biden names his coronavirus advisory team Edited by Julian Joyce Well, that's us over and out for today. Here's a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world this evening: And following the Downing Street conference thelatest coronavirus figures,externalhave been released. There have been a further 21,350 cases of coronavirus across the UK and a further 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. That takes the total number of deaths by this measure to 49,063. The figures tend to be lower on a Monday as there is a lag in reporting over the weekend. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky says he has tested positive for Covid-19 but that he ""feels fine"". Writing on Twitter, the 42-year-old said he would go into self-isolation and would continue to work. ""It's gonna be fine,"" he posted. The former comedian-turned-politician joins other world leaders who contracted coronavirus, including Donald Trump in the US, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro.

Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Prof Van Tam is all about the metaphors tonight! First, with a football reference, we were told we hadnât won the cup but we now know the keeper can be beaten. Then we were asked to imagine a cold, rainy station platform with the bright lights of a train coming down the track - but various hurdles to overcome before we could get on board. Whatever the metaphor the message is clear: the vaccine news is positive but itâs still far from a solution. And while the metaphors might be attracting some mirth on Twitter, thereâs a serious point to them too. The science can be complex. What's key is finding a way to get across the essential information in way we can all understand. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Managing expectations seems to be a key theme of the televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam are at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The prime minister says we must not âslacken our resolveâ, while Prof Van-Tam says it will not make âany differenceâ for the second wave this winter. Their message is simple â do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But todayâs announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, its ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome â and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. The prime minister is asked how distribution of the vaccine would be prioritised. He says ministers will âlook at where the doses will be most appropriately distributedâ and that âeverything flowsâ from driving down the R rate. He adds that âpeople are pulling togetherâ under the current restrictions, and that he believes they will get the R rate to below one. One journalist points out there is global excitement about the vaccine and asks the PM how confident he is that it can be delivered. The prime minister says he is âvery hopefulâ as the vaccine task force has been  âsecuring supplies for the UK for some time now"". But Jonathan Van-Tam warns that âmany thingsâ can go wrong with vaccines during manufacture. âEvery single batch has to be quality assured and released. Things can and do and have always gone wrong,â he says.
âWe have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes.â Boris Johnson says he is optimistic about the UKâs prospects for next year, but adds that he does not want to âlet people run away with the ideaâ that todayâs news is a âslam dunkâ. Jonathan Van-Tam says that there is an ""enormous mental health burdenâ on people during lockdown. âOne of the things we can do to try and make the restrictions as short as possible is to follow them to the letter,â he says. The prime minister adds a cautious note, warning it is âcrucial that we do not overdo itâ.
âWe cannot let our enthusiasm tonight run away with us, folks,â he says. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Despite todayâs positive vaccine announcement, the PM struck a deliberately cautious tone. Boris Johnson stressed that news of an effective vaccine was not yet a solution. Number 10 clearly doesnât want the suggestion of a scientific breakthrough to be any sort of green light for people to flout lockdown rules at what he described as a critical moment. The PM has been among the most optimistic â perhaps hopeful - in the past about science providing the way out of this pandemic. But the message today was, 'weâre not there yet', calling instead for the public to keep their resolve. Boris Johnson will know the political and economic difficulties facing Downing St are far from over too. Making a football reference Jonathan Van-Tam says that ""we haven't won the cup yet"", but what it ""does tell you is that the keeper can be beaten"". The deputy chief medical officer for England said we do not yet know what the vaccine breakthrough means for when we can get back to a normal life. ""Frankly weâre in the middle of the second wave and I donât see the vaccines making any difference for the wave we are now in. ""Iâm hopeful that it may prevent future waves but this one we have to battle through to the end without a vaccine. We have to keep pressing hard for now."" Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the Pfizer vaccine news is an ""important scientific breakthrough"" but warns that the message is to stand fast and not get overexcited about where we are. He says the next step will be to see safety data which he expects to see in the coming days. Van-Tam says if it does get to the stage where vaccines are authorised for use in the UK there will have to be decisions made by the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation as to who gets priotiry. This list cannot be finalised yet, he says. The prime minister is joined by Brigaidier Joe Fossey who has led the army's support for the mass testing pilot in Liverpool. Holding up a lateral flow test Brigadier Fossey says they offer the chance for more regular and rapid testing. He says: ""Our message to the people of Liverpool is clear: we are set up and ready for you to come and get tested. Please do not hesitate."" He says what they are trialling is a ""possible route out of lockdown and a way to get on with our lives"". The prime minister said that mass testing is still in its infancy and at present is no substitute for the national restrictions, social distancing and hand hygiene and ""all the rest"". ""I know it has been a hard first week of the autumn restrictions,"" he said. But Johnson added the country must get through this until 2 December when the current lockdown measures will expire and ""we plan to move forward with a tiered approach"". The prime minister says despite a vaccine being on the horizon we must continue to do everything we can to keep the R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - down. He warns that the number of Covid patients in hospital has risen to 13,000 as of 5 November, and says ""we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak"". Boris Johnson says that it is important more than ever to follow the rules but says we must hope and believe mass testing will help. He urges people in Liverpool to get tested and says ""we have tested thousands of people but there is still more to do"". Meanwhile, Joe Biden has made his first speech about coronavirus after forming a panel made up of 13 scientists to advise him as he prepares to take office. He tells Americans that regardless of how they voted in the election, they should wear masks in order to protect themselves and other citizens. ""Wear a mask, it's the single most potent weapon against the virus,"" he says. Face coverings have become politically divisive in the US. Biden says the vaccine development process must be transparent so Americans can have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine. He notes it won't be available for many months yet. ""The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. Although I'm not in office yet I'm just laying out what we expect to do and hope some of it can be done between now and the time I'm sworn in."" He adds that ""there's a need for bold action"" as cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up. His remarks contrast with many of Donald Trump's who at times underplayed the severity of the pandemic. Boris Johnson begins by saying that people are asking that ""does the progress towards a vaccine made today mean we are at the beginning of the end to our troubles"". ""We have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go,"" he says. But he adds if and when the vaccine is ready to be sued the UK is ""towards the front of the pack"" as it has already ordered 40 million doses. There will be an NHS-led vaccine programme, Johnson says. He adds he must stress that ""these are very, very early days"" and the distant toot of the scientific bugle is louder but still someway off. Prime Minister Boris Johnson begins speaking at the Downing Street news conference. Today he is joined by Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, and Brigadier Joe Fossey. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter News that the first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19 has meant vaccine conspiracy theories are being shared again on social media. For months, theyâve been spreading in local Facebook groups, on Instagram pages and in WhatsApp chats. The false claims include the baseless theory that a vaccine could be a way for Microsoft boss Bill Gates to secretly insert microchips into people â so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has debunked this particular claim in the past.Nevertheless, Bill Gatesâs name has been trending on Twitter since the announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech. Rumours have also been circulating about when the announcement happened â with the suggestion that it was deliberately timed to happen after Joe Biden was declared president-elect. Thereâs currently no evidence to support this claim. When you see these sorts of claims, remember to think about why a post was shared, how it makes you feel and to pause before passing it on. Get in touch if youâre seeing speculation like this on social media that you want me to investigate:Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Today's news that avaccine can prevent more than 90% of peoplefrom getting Covid-19 is based on preliminary analysis. There's still a way to go before any vaccine can be given to the wider public and our lives can go back to how they were pre-pandemic. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps puts this news into context. This video can not be played Covid vaccine: what does the Pfizer vaccine news mean? Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to host a Downing Street news conference shortly. It follows today's news that the company behind a vaccine trial has said it is 90% effective against the virus.

Soldier's medal-winning heroic actions questioned,"Sjt Deacon Cutterham was presented with his medal at Buckingham Palace in 2012 The heroic acts that earned a former British soldier a medal have been called into question by some of those who served alongside him, days before he plans to sell his medal collection. Deacon Cutterham was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Crossfor picking up and hurling away a Taliban grenade. But some soldiers who served with Mr Cutterham in Helmand province have told BBC News they dispute what happened that day in Afghanistan in 2011. Mr Cutterham denies their claims. Some of his former colleagues in the 1st Battalion the Rifles chose to speak to the BBC after readingreports that Mr Cutterham expects his collection of seven medals to fetch up to Â£120,000 when sold at auction on Thursday. ""I don't believe he earned that medal and now he might make money from it,"" said one soldier, who added that it was ""abhorrent"" to hold the auction so close to Remembrance Day on 11 November. Another said: ""We didn't care if he wanted to tell people how brave he was. What we care about now is him making financial gain from this."" Grenade rescue soldier honoured Hero soldier's medals 'to fetch Â£120,000' Mr Cutterham, 37, from Bristol, joined the Army at 16 and served in Iraq and Afghanistan during a 19-year military career. The grenade incident happened when, with the 1st Battalion the Rifles, he was leading a patrol in Nahr-e-Saraj District in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan. Deacon Cutterham has given several interviews about the incident. In 2012 he described what happened to the BBC: ""Grenade came over the top. With that I shouted 'grenade' and then advanced on it, picked the grenade up and and then posted it, and it literally went off as soon as I pulled my hand away - and prevented me and my lead scout from getting serious injuries or death."" In other accounts he said the grenade was thrown over a wall and then landed in a ditch: ""I had seen exactly where it had landed but couldn't see it in the stream. ""I quickly placed my hand in the water to search for it and placed my hand directly on the grenade, shouted to take cover and posted it."" The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, which is one level down from the Victoria Cross, is awarded in recognition of acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations. Mr Cutterham's name was put forward by his officers, and their recommendations would have been passed up the chain of command. The citation on Mr Cutterham's award reads: ""The action itself was utterly courageous, carried out with composure and clarity of thought. ""Cutterham's gritty leadership and gallant act saved lives and inspired his men."" No-one disputes that a grenade did go off that day. Everyone on Mr Cutterham's patrol - and back at the patrol base - said they heard an explosion. ""We believe a grenade was thrown, but it was his,"" one of his former comrades told the BBC. Another soldier, who says he carried out an equipment check when the patrol returned to base, claimed: ""There was one grenade missing."" The soldiers the BBC has spoken to also questioned why any member of the Taliban who was close enough to a British army patrol to throw a grenade did not follow up with any further attack. They spoke to the BBC on condition that their names not be used because most are still serving soldiers. One soldier said: ""He [Mr Cutterham] says he saw someone running away. Nobody else did. Nor was a single shot fired on that patrol."" The BBC has been told by several sources that a drone was flying above the patrol at the time and the video feed showed no sign of enemy activity in the area or any individuals nearby. The BBC asked the Ministry of Defence to provide any statements from anyone on the patrol who could back up Mr Cutterham's account, but none were given. A BBC request to interview someone from the MoD in response to the allegations was turned down, but the ministry said in a statement: ""Acts of courage that warrant an honour or award are rigorously scrutinised before being approved. ""If serving personnel have a grievance, there is a formal process for them to register their complaint through the chain of command, which would be looked into accordingly."" Several of the soldiers who spoke to the BBC said they did raise concerns at the time, but were told they were only doing so because they disliked Mr Cutterham. Most of those who spoke to the BBC have admitted they disliked him. Mr Cutterham did not award himself an honour. It was the decision of his officers to put his name forward. But in this case some soldiers clearly question the process. One said: ""If you have a medal it makes you look good; it makes the commanders look good."" He added: ""You have to look to history when it comes to medals, there are witnessesâ¦ there's been other people backing up what they've done."" The BBC approached Mr Cutterham for an interview on several occasions. He said in a statement by email: ""I'm extremely disappointed that people are questioning the events of that day. I strongly deny these claims."" He added that the incident had an enormous impact on his life and that he has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health issues.

'Mutant coronavirus' seen before on mink farms,"Mink are kept in crowded conditions, ideal for spreading a virus A mutant form of coronavirus found in Denmark has arisen previously in mink, scientists have revealed. The mutated virus, which appears to have spread from animals to humans in Denmark, has been detected retrospectively at a mink farm in the Netherlands, according to a leading Dutch expert. The mink were culled and the mutated strain did not infect humans, he said. Six countries have reported coronavirus outbreaks at mink farms. They include the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Italy and the US. Mink are known to be susceptible to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, which can spread rapidly from animal to animal in conditions where thousands of animals are kept in close proximity. What's the science behind mink and coronavirus? Denmark to cull up to 17 million mink amid coronavirus fears Coronavirus: Hauliers included in Denmark restrictions. The farmed weasel-like animals have become infected by farm workers during the pandemic, and have occasionally passed the virus on to humans, raising the risk of the virus acquiring mutations. Danish scientists are worried that genetic changes in a mink-related form of the virus, infecting a dozen people, has the potential to make future vaccines less effective. The genetic change is in the spike protein of the virus, which is important in the body's immune response, and a key target for vaccines. The Danish government has ordered widespread culling of mink The Danish genome sequences were recently released on a public database, allowing scientists in other countries to search for evidence of the mutation. Prof Wim van der Poel, a veterinary expert at Wageningen University, said analysis of genetic data from the Netherlands revealed one previous case of the mutation at a mink farm in early May. He told BBC News: ""We have once seen a mutant virus with a comparable mutation in the spike protein encoding region, in mink in the Netherlands, but this mutant did not spread to humans and the mink of the involved farm were culled."" The Netherlands launched a widespread cull of mink after signs, in a small number of cases, that humans had picked up coronavirus from mink. Mink, like their relatives, ferrets, are susceptible to respiratory viruses The fur industry Denmark is the world's biggest producer of mink fur and its main export markets are China and Hong Kong Millions of animals are being culled due to concerns over coronavirus, but the country has not passed legislation aimed at closing its mink fur sector The Netherlands, another top exporter of mink, has fast-tracked an existing plan to phase out fur farming, bringing the deadline forward from 2024 to 2021 France announced recently that it would ban farming mink for fur by 2025 and Poland may follow suit Fur farming is banned in the UK. The genetic data from Denmark was released on an international database a few days ago, with some scientists questioning why it had not been released sooner. ""I think that it is most disappointing that the data have only just reached the light of day,"" said Prof James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge in the UK. He said the genetic changes needed careful evaluation, as reports from Denmark suggested an effect on immunity. ""This may be what triggered the enhanced quarantine measures for travellers from Denmark. But far more careful evaluation is urgently needed."" Mink farming required ""enhanced biosecurity (or suspension) at this time"", he added. It is normal for viruses to change over time and accumulate mutations, but experts are particularly concerned when viruses pass between humans and animals. This video can not be played Scientists believe another pandemic will happen during our lifetime A number of animals have caught the virus from humans, but mink appear particularly susceptible. Prof Dirk Pfeiffer, of the Royal Veterinary College in London, said while mutations in viruses happen all the time as they spread, the question is whether these change the characteristics of the virus. ""At this stage, it seems to be that there may be issues with vaccine effectiveness, but this is still unclear,"" he said. Effective surveillance is needed to detect emergence of new pathogens early, and then have an effective way of responding, he added. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, an agency of the European Union, has said it will publish risk assessments on the spread of Sars-CoV-2 in mink farms this week. It remains to be seen if the Danish mutation in the Sars-CoV-2 virus will be detected in mink farms in other countries. The outbreak of this mutated variant has become known as ""cluster 5"". In Sweden, there have been outbreaks at mink farms in the south-east part of the country. Scientists reported that the genetic mutation found in Danish mink had not been detected so far.

Four in 10 keep 'money secrets' from loved ones,"Almost four in 10 people are keeping ""money secrets"" from their loved ones, including hiding debt problems, the Money & Pensions Service (MaPS) says. The most common secrets are hidden credit cards (37%), undisclosed loans (23%) and secret savings accounts (21%), the government body said. Millennials aged 25-34 were the most secretive generation, with three in five hiding details of their finances. There are ""numerous reasons"" for it, said Sarah Porretta of MaPS. ""A secret savings account could act as a buffer for those who want to escape a difficult relationship; an unpaid bill could be kept under wraps in order to protect anxious family members. ""For many who keep money secrets, it can be a feeling of shame or embarrassment that debts have spiralled out of control."" The survey,external, which covered 5,200 people nationwide, suggests there is still a stigma around talking about your personal finances in Britain. What help is available to pay my bills? Credit card freeze extended ahead of new lockdown 'Poorer households see debts rise' during lockdown Almost 40% of respondents said they stayed silent about concerns, often due to feeling embarrassed or a fear of being judged. The survey also found people in relationships tended to underestimate the extent of money secrets their partner kept from them. While 23% of people in relationships suspected their spouse hid things, nearly half admitted to having hidden things themselves. This video can not be played ""In our generation the whole saving concept's gone out the window"" One respondent, who preferred not to be named, told MaPS: ""I was once close to bankruptcy due to credit cards and loans which I did not reveal to my partner until it couldn't be hidden any longer. I admitted the issues eventually and we sorted it."" Another said: ""I didn't tell my husband when I lost control of our credit card debt and ended up juggling cards and minimum payments. ""Eventually I admitted it to him and actually acknowledged the amount of debt I now had - he supported me to get onto a debt payment plan which I have been paying for just over a year now, and we are far more financially stable."" The survey marksTalk Money Week,external, which is encouraging people who are struggling financially in the pandemic to talk it over with a friend, family member or expert. MaPS says it could help make money problems more manageable, benefiting people's health, relationships and overall wellbeing. Have you kept ""money secrets"" from loved ones?

'Horror film' couple guilty of murder,"Julia Rawson was last seen alive on 12 May 2019 A man obsessed with horror films has been convicted along with his boyfriend of murdering and dismembering a woman in their flat. Nathan Maynard-Ellis, 30, took Julia Rawson home after meeting her in a pub in Dudley, West Midlands, in May 2019. He and David Leesley, 25, then killed her and hid her body parts in undergrowth, the trial at Coventry Crown Court was told. Maynard-Ellis was also found guilty of rape charges relating to another woman. The four rapes, an attempted rape, and threats to kill were revealed when a woman came forward after his murder arrest. Both men had admitted perverting the course of justice and concealing a body, but had denied murder. This video can not be played The moment murderer and victim meet Jurors heard Maynard-Ellis had a fascination with decapitation and horror films and had been addicted to fantasies about the ""sexualised killing of women"". His victim would have seen swords and spiders mounted on the walls of the Tipton flat, reptiles kept in tanks, and ""gory face masks"" of horror film characters, Karim Khalil QC, prosecuting, told jurors at the start of the trial. Ms Rawson ""could not have known that she was about to enter a flat of horrors"", he said. ""But she must have realised this very soon after she went in."" Nathan Maynard-Ellis and David Leesley had admitted perverting the course of justice and concealing a body, but had denied murder Tracey Barrett, a neighbour of the two killers, told the BBC their flat ""was the making of horror stories"", with Freddy Krueger figures and Chucky dolls. Police said Maynard-Ellis had gone out the night of the murder with the aim of finding a victim. ""Unfortunately that victim was Julia"", Det Insp Jim Colclough, from West Midlands Police, said. Maynard-Ellis and Leesley's home had Chucky dolls and other horror movie paraphernalia The murderers' bookshelf featured works on serial killers Ms Rawson, 42, was struck about the head. Her remains, including her severed head, hands and feet, were found on 12 and 29 June last year in two different locations, near a canal and on wasteland. After identifying Maynard Ellis from CCTV video when he was with Ms Rawson at the pub, he was arrested on suspicion of kidnap and officers discovered a bloodstain underneath a new underlay in the living room of the couple's flat. Det Insp Colclough described the killing as ""a terrible, terrible thing to have taken place"". Ms Rawson, who was reported missing by friends, came from a close-knit family and was a talented musician and a fun-loving character, he said. ""Of course her family are absolutely devastated,"" he said. Julia Rawson met Nathan Maynard-Ellis in the Bottle and Cork pub in Dudley In a statement, Ms Rawson's family said her loss was ""felt as keenly today as when we heard she had first gone missing"". ""Her death has had a devastating impact on us, the mutilation of her body and the callous way in which her remains were scattered has revolted us,"" they said. The judge, Mr Justice Soole, told the jury: ""It has been a very demanding case because of the subject matter."" Maynard-Ellis and Leesley will be sentenced at a later date.

Firebreak lockdown ends and new regulations begin,"This video can not be played 'Good feeling' as shops reopen after firebreak Shoppers have been hitting Wales' high streets as the nation's 17-day lockdown ends. New nationwide regulations allow non-essential shops to reopen and up to four people from different households to meet both indoors and outside. From Monday peoplecan travel anywhere within Wales,external, restaurants, pubs and gyms can reopen and two households can again form a bubble. But some shoppers in Cardiff said not everyone was social distancing. Friends Lara Walters and Casey Baos met up for lunch in Cardiff on Monday Casey Baos, 17, was in the capital to meet her friend Laura Walters, 18, for lunch and a catch-up. She said: ""It is too busy to social distance - people just walk wherever."" Another Cardiff shopper Has Hirani said: ""It looks like everyone is doing their Christmas shopping - it is much busier than I anticipated. ""But I'm not sure anyone is sticking to the social distancing rules so that's slightly concerning but understandable at the same time."" Has Hirani said Cardiff was busier than she had anticipated First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast the firebreak had aimed to ""turn back the tide"" of rising cases and hospital admissions, but the impact would not be visible for some weeks. But the lifting of restrictions did not mean that people could do whatever they wanted, he added. Shoppers queuing outside Zara in Cardiff on Monday afternoon ""The fewer people we meet, the fewer journeys we all make, the more we work from home, the safer we will all be,"" he said. What can you do after Wales' firebreak ends? Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? How many Covid-19 deaths and cases in Wales? ""Coronavirus isn't something that happens to somebody else. It can happen just as easily to you and what you do, the decisions you make, are the decisions that keep you and other people safe."" At a press conference Mr Drakeford called for people to ""careful and cautious"" and to only travel when ""essential"". ""The fact that you can travel is not an invitation to travel and it's certainly not an instruction to travel,"" he said. Wales' lockdown- which the Welsh Government said would help prevent the health service in Wales becoming ""overwhelmed"" - ends just a few days afterEngland's four-week lockdownstarted. Wales has seen almost 7,000 coronavirus cases in the last seven days and thedeath toll is now more than 2,000 peoplesince the pandemic began. The number of patients in Welsh hospitals with coronavirus is now the highest since the height of the pandemic in April - and areas like Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent have some of the worst Covid-19 infection rates in the UK. But Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said on Sunday the country was starting to seea plateauing in the case rate. He added: ""It's still at a high rate which means that there's still a reservoir of coronavirus within our communities."" This video can not be played 'Our success and failure lies in the hands of every one of us,' Mark Drakeford said Opposition parties have called for more local targeted action in future. Wales had 17 separate local lockdowns before the firebreak period. Andrew RT Davies, health spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""Nobody wants further to see further lockdowns, but if they are to be imposed again, then they have to be targeted and based on ultra-accurate and localised data, which city-wide testing could provide."" Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said ""where we have more localised clusters or areas of particularly high prevalence, it makes sense to have a more enhanced set of rules"". Mr Drakeford said local lockdowns have not been ruled in future and they will be imposed ""where that is necessary"". Hot Gossip's Sara Bailey said the rise in cases ""brought home"" the dangers of Covid-19 in Rhondda Cynon Taf Sara Bailey, who runs the Hot Gossip cafe in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf - recently one of the top 10 Covid hotspots in the UK - welcomed being able to reopen but admitted she was also feeling ""apprehensive"". ""Cases gradually crept up to the point where it became very close to home. I think that's brought it home for a lot of people,"" she said. ""I understand why we needed the firebreak. The local restrictions were strangling the business and it was difficult, it was very challenging."" She added this year would be ""a write off"" in terms of profitability, but the challenge was ""staying afloat"" with the hope of recovery next year. ""We can reopen and at least make some progress and have a chance of turning things around in the run-up to Christmas,"" she said. Gift shop owner Ceredig Davies has concerns over people from Covid hotspots visiting Aberystwyth Ceredig Davies is a Ceredigion county councillor and runs Aberystwyth gift shop Mona Lisa. When asked how he felt about people from parts of Wales withhigher Covid case ratesbeing able to visit Ceredigion, which has one of the lowest case rates in Wales, he said: ""To be honest, that is a worry. ""I look at places like the south Wales Valleys where they've got a high Covid rate and with all due respect I hope they stay there. ""We want to keep this a low Covid area."" He added: ""Just because the two-week lockdown is over we shouldn't be complacent, we should be on our guard and follow restrictions."" Mr Davies also felt the Welsh Government's new restrictions were complicated which meant ""some people just don't follow them"". Pub landlord Ian Blair of The Ship and Castle in Aberystwyth said he has decided to remain closed while the rules remain unclear. ""I just sensed that the message we are getting from the first minister really is, if you can, stay shut. Stay out of the way, step back for a bit. And that's what we've decided to do."" He said adapting to new rules during the pandemic has been ""extremely stressful"". ""We're getting a lot of mixed messages and I think the trade needs to have more clarity,"" he said. Mobile hairdresser Kate Wingfield is restricting her work to her county and four clients a day to reduce the risk People inCaerphilly county were the first in Walesto be put into a ""local lockdown"" after a surge of coronavirus cases - but for the first time since having stricter rules imposed on 8 September, all residents are now able to leave the county Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) was the second local authority area to be put under tighter Covid restrictions a week later - but now Wales has scrapped local rules for a ""simpler"" nationwide approach. Kate Wingfield, a mobile hairdresser from Llanharan in RCT said: ""You've got to be super careful - I'm entering places that family members aren't allowed to enter. ""I am nervous about it but I wear a visor and a mask and use hand sanitiser. ""It's more that I'm crossing houses that concerns me... I'm house hopping basically."" Is Wales coming out of lockdown too early? Wales national lockdown in new year 'likely' Has the firebreak lockdown had an impact? Meanwhile the first minister has said that talks involving the four governments of the UK about arrangements for Christmas will take place later this week. Mr Drakeford told the press conference the meeting would now be a weekly event to discuss issues relevant to all four nations. He said his office had been contacted by staff of cabinet office minister Michael Gove ""to get a date in the diary this week, and the topic of that meeting will be a common approach to Christmas"". Mr Drakeford alsowelcomed new findings from trials of a potential coronavirus vaccine, but cautioned it was unlikely to represent ""a magic bullet"" that means coronavirus is about to ""disappear out of our lives"". During the firebreak some supermarket aisles selling non-essential items were closed off Thenew regulations made by the Welsh ministerscover everything from seeing friends and family to travel and visiting pubs and restaurants. They impose limits on meeting other people, prohibit people from entering or leaving Wales without areasonable excuse, impose requirements on people who have tested positive for coronavirus, and contain rules for public-facing business and services. Two families can form a bubble and meet up in each other's homes, as happened prior to the firebreak lockdown. Up to 15 people can take part in activities indoors and up to 30 outdoors - providing social distancing, hand hygiene and other Covid safety measures are followed. Merthyr remains one of the worst-hit areas in the UK when it comes to cases per 100,000 people Groups offour people from different householdscan meet indoors or outdoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants -  again, providing social distancing, hand hygiene and other Covid safety measures are followed. People from Wales can again holiday within Wales but international travel should be for essential reasons only so foreign holidays are still not allowed. People will still be allowed to make visits to another person's home in Wales if they are concerned about their mental well-being, Mr Drakeford said.

UK-EU trade talks resume in London,"Michel Barnier (right) is returning to London for the talks with Lord Frost EU and UK officials have resumed trade talks in London at the start of another key week for the negotiations. They are trying to bridge what the two sides have said are still significant differences on fishing quotas and competition issues. Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the ""outlines"" of an agreement were clear and a deal was ""there to be done"". But he has insisted the UK is prepared to leave the single market and customs union on 31 December without agreement. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart Lord Frost are in a race against the clock to conclude a future economic partnership in time for it to come into force when the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The UK left the EU on 31 January but continues to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year. If there is no agreement at that point, trade between the two will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules - with tariffs set to be introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs for firms and consumers. Brexit will be 'brutal' for UK, warns ex-PM Major What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? How many trade deals has the UK done? Has US election slowed down Brexit negotiations? Both sides say they want to avoid this although the EU has said it will not do a deal ""at any price"". The UK has said it is prepared to accept what it calls ""Australian terms"" - which it conceives as limited sector-by-sector agreements mirroring those the EU currently has with Australia.  But it would mean the UK would largely be trading on WTO rules. Mr Johnson told the Associated Press on Sunday that a more comprehensive deal on trade in all goods and services, based on the EU's agreement with Canada, was ""there to be done"". ""I've always been a great enthusiast for a trade deal with our European friends and partners,"" he said.""The broad outlines are pretty clear, we just need to get on and do it if we can."" Following a phone call with Mr Johnson on Saturday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said some progress had been made in recent weeks after the EU agreed to discuss specific legal texts. But she said ""large differences"" remained over the question of access to British fishing waters from 2021 and regulations on workers' rights, environmental protection, and state aid designed to maintain a ""level-playing field"". Ahead of his visit to London,Mr Barnier tweeted,externalthat any deal must ""respect the interests and values of the EU and its 27 member states"". The meeting comes as the House of Lords look likely to vote down controversial clauses in the government's Internal Market Bill. The clauses would give ministers powers to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement reached with the EU, including obligations on state aid rules. Government's Brexit plan gets MPs' final backing Gove stands by Brexit bill after EU concerns What is the row over 'internal markets' all about? US President-elect Joe Biden has previously been openly critical of the bill, fearing it could lead to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - and has warned this could be a deal-breaker for any US-UK trade deal. Speaking to the BBC, Environment Secretary George Eustice said the bill was ""all about protecting peace and stability"" arguing that it ensured Northern Ireland businesses have ""unfettered access to GB markets"". But Conservative peer Michael Howard is opposed to the bill, alongside Labour's Charlie Falconer, who told BBC News the government should ""stop digging"". He argued that the bill, would push the EU into having to close the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland to protect the bloc's single market. Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney described Mr Biden as ""a real friend of Ireland"" and added that his election would give Downing Street ""pause for thought... to ensure that the Irish issues are prioritised as we try to close out this phase of the Brexit negotiation"". While Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC a Biden presidency would bring ""a degree of clarity"" to the Brexit talks. He said UK-EU negotiations would be helped by Mr Biden's clear stance on the Northern Ireland peace process. On Monday the prime minister announced that he was establishing a new Office for Investment to encourage investors to do business in a post-Brexit UK. ""Our departure from the European Union is not and has never been about walling our islands off from the outside world, rather, it is about building bridges to friends, allies and trading partners old and new in every corner of every continent"" he wrote in aLinkedIn article,external. He said the Office for Investment would be ""a targeted, agile organisation designed for the fast-moving society in which we now live, and a great big flashing neon sign that advertises both our openness to the world and our desire to do business with it.""

UK signs deals for virus vaccine doses,"The UK government has signed deals for a further 90 million doses of coronavirus vaccine. The vaccines are being developed by the Belgian pharmaceutical company Janssen and the US biotech company Novavax. It means the UK has placed orders for six experimental vaccines, taking its potential stockpile to 340 million doses. In theory, there should be enough for everyone in the UK to get five doses. Most of the vaccines require only two. With most vaccine trials ending in failure, the government is effectively hedging its bets, hoping that at least one of the vaccines it has purchased proves safe and effective. The price being paid has not been revealed. How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? UK signs deals for 90 million virus vaccine doses Human trial of new coronavirus vaccine starts Kate Bingham, chair of the UK government Vaccine Taskforce, told the BBC: ""We don't know if any of these vaccine formats that we've acquired will actually work. There are no licensed vaccines for any human coronavirus."" She added it was a ""priority"" to ensure the UK has ""sufficient vaccine"" for groups ""who are most at risk from coronavirus infection"". This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: ""The government's strategy to build a portfolio of promising vaccine candidates will ensure we have the best chance possible of finding one that works. ""Today's agreements will not only benefit people in the UK but will ensure fair and equitable access of a vaccine around the world, potentially protecting hundreds of millions of lives."" The government has now purchased experimental coronavirus vaccines that have been developed using four different scientific approaches: Adenovirus vaccines: 100 million doses Oxford University/AstraZeneca; 30 million doses Janssen mRNA vaccines: 30 million doses BioNTech/Pfizer Inactivated whole virus vaccines: 60 million doses Valneva Protein adjuvant vaccines:  60 million doses GSK/Sanofi; 60 million doses Novavax It takes Britain's potential stockpile to a total of 340 million doses - one of the biggest in the world. The Oxford and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines are in advanced, phase three clinical trials, with tens of thousands of volunteers recruited. It is possible that some indication on how effective they are could come in late autumn, but that is not guaranteed. The government says if the Janssen and Novavax vaccine trials go well, the first deliveries could take place in mid-2021. The UK has also agreed to co-fund a clinical study of the Janssen vaccine. By the end of the year, there could be at least half a dozen different coronavirus vaccines in clinical trials in the UK - and members of the public are beingencouraged to register their interest online,,externalbecause without medical volunteers we will not know if any of the vaccines actually works.

Have we finally got a coronavirus vaccine?,"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

"Virgin Hyperloop tests first passenger journeyThe ""sci-fi"" travel concept involves travelling in pods inside vacuum tubes at very high speeds.","Trial passengers Sara Luchian and Josh Giegel - who both work at Virgin Hyperloop - inside their pod Virgin Hyperloop has trialled its first ever journey with passengers, in the desert of Nevada. The futuristic transport concept involves pods inside vacuum tubes carrying passengers at high speeds. In the trial, two passengers - both company staff - travelled the length of a 500m test track in 15 seconds, reaching 107mph (172km/h). However, this is a fraction of Virgin's ambitions for travel speeds of more than 1,000km/h. Virgin Hyperloop is not the only firm developing the concept but nobody has carried passengers before. Sara Luchian, director of customer experience, was one of the two on board and described the experience as ""exhilarating both psychologically and physically"" to the BBC shortly after the event. She and chief technology officer Josh Giegel wore simple fleeces and jeans rather than flights suits for the event, which took place on Sunday afternoon outside of Las Vegas. Ms Luchian said the journey was smooth and ""not at all like a rollercoaster"" although the acceleration was ""zippier"" than it would be with a longer track. Neither of them felt sick, she added. She said that their speed was hampered by the length of the track and acceleration required. The Virgin Hyperloop test track in the Nevada desert The concept, which has spent years in development,builds on a proposal by Tesla founder Elon Musk. Some critics have described it as science fiction. It is based on the world's fastest magnetic levitation (maglev) trains, then made faster by speeding along inside vacuum tubes. TheMaglev train speed world record was set in 2015when a Japanese train reached 374mph in a test run near Mount Fuji. Founded in 2014, Virgin Hyperloop received investment from the Virgin Group in 2017. It was previously known as Hyperloop One and Virgin Hyperloop One. In a BBC interview in 2018, then Virgin Hyperloop One boss Rob Lloyd, who has since left the firm, said the speed would in theory enable people to travel between Gatwick and Heathrow airports, 45 miles apart on opposite sides of London, in four minutes. Virgin says the pods could reach speeds of over 1,000km/h Los Angeles-based Virgin Hyperloop is also exploring concepts in other countries, includinga hypothetical 12 minute connection between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, which takes more than an hour by existing public transport. Critics have pointed out that Hyperloop travel systems would involve the considerable undertaking of both getting planning permission and then constructing vast networks of tubes for every travel path. Ms Luchian acknowledges the potential difficulties, saying: ""Of course there's a lot of infrastructure to be built but I think we've mitigated a lot of risk that people didn't think was possible."" She added: ""Infrastructure is such an important focus for so many people in government. We know people are looking for solutions. They're looking for the transportation of the future. We can keep building today's or yesterday's transport systems and keep encountering the same problems they bring or we can really look to build something that solves those problems.""

BBC promises investigation into Earl Spencer claimPrincess Diana's brother says he was deceived by Panorama's Martin Bashir ahead of a 1995 interview.,"Martin Bashir's Panorama interview with Princess Diana was broadcast in 1995 Former BBC chairman Michael Grade has said allegations that Martin Bashir used forged bank statements to convince Princess Diana to do a 1995 interview were ""a very, very serious matter"". The BBC has promised to launch an investigation into the claims made by Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's brother. Earl Spencer says the former Panorama reporter made false and defamatory claims about senior royals. Lord Grade said the BBC should now hold itself to account.

'Real living wage' rises to Â£9.50 an hour,"Over 250,000 people who work for an employer who has voluntarily signed up to the ""real living wage"" are set for a pay boost of 20p to Â£9.50 an hour. This is not to be confused with the compulsory National Living Wage, which is currently Â£8.72 an hour for anyone over the age of 25. Real living wage employers in London will pay Â£10.85 an hour, a 10p rise. The increase is designed to help workers and families through the pandemic. Over 800 more employers have accredited with the Living Wage Foundation since the start of lockdown, including Tate and Lyle, Network Rail, Capital One and the All England Lawn Tennis Club. They join a network of almost 7,000 employers across the UK who are already paying this recommended rate to ensure all staff earn a wage that meets the real cost of living, and covers everyday needs. Manchester clubs urged to pay 'real living wage' Businesses urged to honour wages pledge Latest research by the Living Wage Foundation shows that there are still 5.5 million jobs - 20% of all employees - still paying less than the real Living Wage in the UK. Northern Ireland had the highest proportion of jobs paying below the Living Wage of 25.3%, while Scotland had the lowest at 15.2%. Jobs held by women were more likely to be paid below the Living Wage in April 2020 than those held by men. This gap has narrowed slightly since 2012 and continued to narrow in 2019-2020, but 60% of below-Living-Wage jobs - 3.3 million jobs - were held by women in April 2020. The hospitality sector had the highest proportion of jobs paid below the Living Wage at 70.8%, followed by the arts, entertainment and recreation sector at 36.8%. The highest numbers of jobs paid below the Living Wage are in the wholesale and retail sectors with 1.3 million jobs, but they are much larger than the hospitality and arts, entertainment and recreation sectors. Cook Food is a hand-prepared ready meals provider based in Kent with 90 retail shops and a home delivery service that started in 1997. Cook Food says it has paid its staff a real living wage, even during difficult times for the business The firm accredited with the Living Wage Foundation in 2015 and says that it has continued to pay its workers a real living wage even during a couple of years when it wasn't doing so well. ""People are really important, a key part of our success,"" Cook Food's people director Alison Payne told the BBC. She said that being able to afford to make ends meet was a key problem for young adults under the age of 25, who are not covered by the compulsory National Living Wage. One of her employees, aged 24, previously had to work two jobs - a total of 56 hours a week - in order to afford to live. But after joining Cook Food and being paid a real living wage, she was earning more working just 40 hours a week. Since lockdown, the firm has increased its sick pay allowance, to help employees who might have to self-isolate. ""If we want to provide really good service in our shops and provide really good quality food, it's important to pay people well,"" said Ms Payne. ""We really do find the more we take care of people, the more they take care of us.""

Stock markets soar on Pfizer Covid vaccine news,"Stock markets have rocketed on hopes of a potential breakthrough in the search for a vaccine against Covid-19. Drugs firm Pfizer's own shares climbed 9% after it said that preliminary analysisindicated that its coronavirus vaccine was 90% effective. Markets, already buoyed after a clear end to the US election, piled on gains. The FTSE 100 jumped nearly 5%. But some of the initial optimism appeared to fade by the end of the trading session. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had jumped 5.6% in opening trade, closed up about 3%. The S&P 500 also retreated from its morning leap, ending just 1.1% higher, short of a new record. Meanwhile the Nasdaq, where many of the tech firms that have benefited from the lockdowns are listed, fell 1.5%. Covid vaccine: First 'milestone' vaccine offers 90% protection Coronavirus vaccine: When will we have one? The vaccine hopes revived investor appetite for airlines, hotels, energy firms and others hit hardest by the pandemic, sending shares soaring - in some cases by more than 40%. Firms lifted by the pandemic dived, in contrast, dived. Such sizable swings are rare. In the case of the UK, the FTSE 100 added roughly Â£82bn to the value of its shares in the market's best day since March - and one of the ten largest ever single-day gains for the index. Markets are primarily about sentiment - does tomorrow look better than today - and in that regard there has been a radical and probably permanent sea change. With more vaccines in development that optimism could grow. What this result demonstrates is that while the virus is not yet beaten it is beatable. That ray of light has lit up stock markets around the world. As always, some people in the markets are already looking for something else to worry about. If we are returning to a semblance of normality in the months ahead, do the US authorities really need a stimulus package as big as the $3tn to $4tn being discussed by the Biden team? But for now, the markets, like the rest of us, are enjoying the warm glow of the first significant sentiment boost since the virus started ravaging the world economy. Read more here. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, called it ""very very unusual"", but said that a vaccine was ""one of the things that markets have been waiting for"". However, he told the BBC there were ""still lots and lots of questions around the vaccine"" and it was still too early to say when economies would bounce back or whether the market surge would be sustained. In the UK, shares in travel firms - which have been hit hard by the pandemic - saw the biggest rises, with British Airways owner IAG soaring 25%. Elsewhere in the sector, EasyJet shares rose 34%, while aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce surged almost 45%. Another sector of the economy that has been hit hard by coronavirus is hospitality - catering firm Compass Group saw its shares rise more than 21%. US-listed Royal Caribbean cruises meanwhile were up 29%, while travel booking firm Expedia jumped 24% and Disney climbed almost 12%. However, shares in those companies that have benefitted in the crisis fell sharply given the hopes of a successful vaccine. Shares in grocery delivery firm Ocado - which has seen sales soar amid the shift towards online shopping - dropped more than 11% Takeaway ordering firm Just Eat fell more than 8% And in the US, Zoom fell more than 17% and exercise bike firm Peloton was down more than 20% Drugmakers have been racing to be the first to develop a successful coronavirus vaccine. If Pfizer's vaccine is authorised, the number of doses will be limited initially. Many questions also remain, including how long the vaccine will provide protection. Stock markets hadalready been rallyingin response Saturday's declaration that Joe Biden had won the race to become the next US president. The Pfizer announcement then pushed market optimism ""exceedingly high"", but it ""could fade"" said Neil Wilson. ""We should not be jumping any guns here, but ultimately a vaccine that works effectively would be good for the economy and favours the cyclical parts of the market that we thought were going to struggle,"" he said. ""It's clear the market is forward looking and pricing in recovery in a number of beaten-down areas next year."" Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""The Pfizer announcement is not yet a panacea, but adds to investor sentiment which had already been buoyed by the Biden victory, and has sent markets to strongly positive levels."" He noted that airline and related stocks had been rising rapidly, while ""housebuilders, banks and retailers are all in the boat currently being lifted by a rising tide"". ""It is still early days, and the practicalities point to any meaningful distribution not being available until the first few months of next year,"" he added. ""Even so, the news is without question a positive development and has certainly captured the imagination of investors.""

"Easing of Scottish Covid rules 'highly unlikely'Scotland's coronavirus restriction levels are due to be reviewed on Tuesday, but changes are unlikely.Scotland","This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: FM says easing of restrictions ""highly unlikely"" Scotland's Covid-19 restrictions are ""highly unlikely"" to be eased when they are reviewed on Tuesday, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Tuesday will mark the first review of local measures under Scotland's new five-level alert system. The first minister said the curbs currently in place had undoubtedly had an impact on the spread of the virus. However, she said it was important for this to translate into a ""significant and sustained reduction in cases"". Ms Sturgeon said she ""would not expect areas to go down a level"", and that ""careful judgement"" would be given to whether any councils had to move up a level. What level has your area been put in? How does Scotland's five-level system work? Scotland began its new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions on 2 November, with most of the central belt in level three and much of the rest of the country in level two. This is due to be reviewed on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon said decisions would be made by her cabinet in the morning, then announced at Holyrood in the afternoon. The first minister said the measures currently in place were ""undoubtedly having a positive impact"" on the spread of the virus, with the increase in cases having ""pretty much levelled off"". The number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 19 on Monday, to 1,226, while the number in intensive care dropped by six to 105. However, Ms Sturgeon said there was a ""very real concern"" that overall case numbers were not yet falling. She said: ""Although there are positive signs, it's really important we start to see these translate into significant and sustained decline in Covid cases and we cannot be sure we are yet seeing that. ""So I think it is highly unlikely that we will see any significant easing of restrictions announced tomorrow. ""We can't afford for cases simply to plateau at their current quite high level - we need them to fall, otherwise we will be badly exposed by any rise in cases as we go further into winter."" There has been speculation that some areas, including Glasgow and Fife, could move up a level in the alert system, while some local leaders in areas like the Borders and Aberdeen have called for their levels to be reduced. When deciding on levels, ministers consider a range of data on case numbers and hospital admissions as well as issues like travel patterns and how closely local areas are interconnected. Ms Sturgeon said: ""It's not just the data on any given day we look at, we have to look at the trend and satisfy ourselves before any area moves down a level that a downward trend has been established and we think it is sustainable. ""Moving down a level is not a neutral act. It leads to opening up, and that leads to an increase in transmission, so we have to make sure the levels there are low enough to cope with that. ""I would not anticipate much easing of restrictions when we announce the first review outcome. ""I would not expect areas to go down a level. We are looking at whether there is a case for any part of the country to go up a level. ""We want to avoid that, but we have to make careful judgements."" Asked specifically about Glasgow - which accounted for 363 out of the 912 new cases registered on Monday - Ms Sturgeon said there had been a ""levelling off"" in cases locally. However, she said ministers had to consider whether the current restrictions ""allow us to continue to move that to a declining position"", or whether ""something more"" had to be done. Ms Sturgeon said she would announce on Tuesday whether the current travel advice barring people from moving in or out of level three areas would be backed up by new laws. And she said she was ""not anticipating"" a return to nation-wide restrictions, although she said she could not rule this out in future. The first minister also welcomed ""good news"" about vaccine development, as it emerged that one under developmentcan prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. She said: ""There is a long way to go of course, but this is news that should give us all some tentative hope - and it should give us some motivation to keep our efforts up in the meantime to keep the virus in check."" Meanwhile, the government is reviewing the status of anyone licensed to own a mink in Scotland after concerns about anew mutated strain of coronavirus linked to mink farms in Denmark.

"Canary Islands sees 1,600 migrants over weekendThe islands have seen a sharp increase in the number of migrants from West Africa in recent months.Europe","There has been a sharp rise in the number of migrants arriving in the Canary Islands More than 1,600 African migrants have been rescued at sea or reached Spain's Canary Islands over the weekend, Spanish emergency services said. About 1,000 arrived on Saturday alone, setting out on about 20 barely seaworthy boats. One person was flown to hospital by helicopter. There has been a sharp increase in the number of migrants from West Africa attempting to reach the Canary Islands in recent months. The island chain is just 100km (60 miles) off the coast of North Africa. Canary Islands see new influx of African migrants 140 migrants drown in year's deadliest shipwreck According to the Spanish government, more than 11,000 arrivals have been recorded in the Canary Islands this year compared with 2,557 during the same period last year. A spokeswoman for Canary services told AFP news agency the migrants had arrived on the islands of Gran Canaria, Tenerife and El Hierro. The body of one person who died during the perilous journey was recovered by rescuers on El Hierro, the spokeswoman said. Images taken from Arguineguin port in Gran Canarias this weekend show migrants queuing up to receive assistance. According to the Spanish government, more than 11,000 arrivals have been recorded in the Canary Islands this year Last month at least 140 migrants bound for Europe drowned after a boat carrying around 200 people sank off the coast of Senegal. The boat caught fire andcapsized shortly after leaving the town of Mbour, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. About 60 people were rescued, according to reports. It is believed the migrants were attempting to reach mainland Europe via the Canary Islands. At least 414 people are known to have died along this route so far this year according to the IOM. A total of 210 fatalities were recorded on the same stretch in the whole of 2019.

Who would get the coronavirus vaccine and how?,"If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won't be enough to go around. Research labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine. Unprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. So who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind? Vaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed. To date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox -  and that took 200 years. The rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations. Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine. Russia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of immune response in patients and has rolled out the vaccine for public use while late-stage trials continue. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced. Neither are on the World Health Organization's list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans. Some of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. Pfizer and BioNTech say preliminary analysis shows their vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. They plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November. Pfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful. There are dozens of other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way. Not all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time. But even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear. Oxford vaccine trial paused as participant falls ill How close to developing a vaccine are we? Governments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved. The UK government, for example,has signed dealsfor undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. But not all countries are in a position to do likewise. Organisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates ""a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations"". This in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries. In the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example. Dr MariÃ¢ngela SimÃ£o, the WHO's assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check. ""The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more."" The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field. At least 94 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine planknown as Covax,external, which aims to raise $2bn (Â£1.52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get ""rapid, fair and equitable access"" to Covid-19 vaccines. The facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed. Having a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021. ""With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,"" says Gavi's CEO Dr Seth Berkley. ""If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe."" While billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine. Prices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (Â£24 to Â£28). AstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine ""at cost"" - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic. The Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (Â£2.28) a dose. But patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases. In the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way. Other countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population. People receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged. In the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill. Although the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won't be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. ""Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,"" Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President told the BBC. As the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised. The Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers. As more vaccine is produced, allocation is increased to cover 20% of the population - this time prioritising over 65s and other vulnerable groups. After everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process. ""The only certainty is that there won't be enough - the rest is still up in the air,"" says Dr Simao. Gavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount. Dr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, ""to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access"". A lot depends on which vaccine is successful. The ideal vaccine has a lot to live up to. It needs to be affordable. It needs to generate strong, long-lasting immunity. It needs a simple refrigerated distribution system and manufacturers must be able to scale-up production rapidly. The WHO, UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF / Doctors Without Borders), already have effective vaccination programmes in place around the world with the so called ""cold chain"" facilities - cooler trucks and solar fridges to keep vaccines at the right temperature as they travel from factory to field. World vaccine delivery 'will need 8,000 jumbo jets' But adding a new vaccine to the mix could pose huge logistical problems for those already facing a difficult environment. Vaccines usually need to be kept refrigerated - usually between 2C and 8C. That's not too much of a challenge in most developed countries, but can be an ""immense task"" where infrastructure is weak and electricity supply and refrigeration unstable. ""Maintaining vaccines under cold chain is already one of the biggest challenges' countries face and this will be exacerbated with the introduction of a new vaccine,"" MSF medical adviser Barbara Saitta told the BBC. ""You will need to add more cold chain equipment, make sure you always have fuel (to run freezer and refrigerators in absence of electricity) and repair/replace them when they break and transport them wherever you need them."" AstraZeneca has suggested their vaccine would need the regular cold chain between 2C and 8C. But at present it looks like the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine would need ultra-cold chain - storage at -80C before being distributed. Welcoming the Pfizer announcement, Dr Richard Hatchett, of Cepi acknowledged that would ""remain a challenge for use in some settings"". ""This is something which will have to be addressed if the vaccine is to be made broadly available,"" he said. But the Ebola vaccine also needed very low temperatures, so it is not impossible. ""To keep the Ebola vaccine at -60Â°C or colder we had to use a special cold chain equipment to store and transport them, plus we had to train staff to use all this new equipment,"" said Barbara Saitta. There is also the question of the target population. Vaccination programmes usually target children, so agencies will have to plan how to reach people that normally are not part of the immunization program. As the world waits for the scientists to do their bit, many more challenges await. And vaccines are not the only weapon against coronavirus. ""Vaccines are not the only solution,"" Says Dr Simao, of the WHO. ""You need to have diagnostics. You need to have a way to decrease mortality, so you need therapeutics, and you need a vaccine. ""Besides that, you need everything else - social distancing, avoiding crowded places and so on."" ENDGAME:When will life get back to normal? EASY STEPS:What can I do?

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him.

Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors.

The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

"Joe Biden pushes forward with plans for officeHis team says his priorities are the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, racism and climate change.","This video can not be played Biden and Harris call for unity in victory speeches US President-elect Joe Biden is to make tackling the coronavirus pandemic his top priority following his win over Donald Trump, his team says. Announcing the first steps in his transition plan, his team said there would be more testing and Americans would be asked to wear masks. On Monday, Mr Biden is expected to name a 12-member coronavirus task force. His win remains a projection as key states still count votes. Mr Trump does not plan to concede, his campaign says. Mr Trump is launching legal challenges to the results in several key states. He has made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud, but election officials say there is no evidence that the vote was rigged against him. Mr Biden is forging ahead with his plans for assuming power in January after major US networks called the election in his favour on Saturday. Follow all the latest live updates Five US voters who changed the race Being with Trump the day he lost the election Election results in maps and charts That reportedly also includes a slew of executive orders -written orders issued by the presidentto the federal government that do not require congressional approval - aimed at reversing controversial Trump policies. According to US media: Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which the US officially left on Wednesday He will reverse the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization He will end thetravel ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries He will reinstate an Obama-era policy of granting immigration status to undocumented migrants who entered the US as children In his first speech as president-elect on Saturday, Mr Biden said it was ""time to heal"" the US and vowed ""not to divide but to unify"" the country. Addressing Trump supporters directly, he said: ""We have to stop treating our opponents as enemies."" He and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris have launcheda website for the transition,external, saying the team will also focus on the economy, tackling racism and climate change. The projected election result means Mr Trump becomes the first one-term president since the 1990s. Meanwhile, the General Services Administration, a government agency tasked with recognising the president-elect and beginning the transition process, has so far not done so. Its administrator Emily Murphy, who was appointed by Mr Trump, has given no indication when this could happen. Until then, Mr Biden's transition team cannot access government funds or communicate with the federal agencies it will be staffing. Media reports suggested senior Republicans remained divided over how to react to Mr Biden's victory, with some refusing to publicly acknowledge the result of the ballot. The Republican leader in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, told Fox News that all recounts and legal challenges should be completed, adding: ""Then and only then, America will decide who won the race."" But former Republican President George W Bush congratulated Mr Biden on his victory, saying the American people could have confidence that the election had been fundamentally fair and that its outcome was clear. He also congratulated Mr Trump on a hard-fought campaign. The president-elect is vowing a major shift in the way the White House approaches coronavirus after Mr Trump repeatedly downplayed its gravity and resisted public health measures including wearing masks and social distancing. The US election took place in the shadow of the virus, which has killed more than 237,000 people in the country The Biden team has said it will ensure all Americans had access to regular and free testing and provide ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"". The task force will be led by former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy and a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, David Kessler. Mr Biden also wants rules mandating the wearing of masks across the country, which he says would save thousands of lives. He plans to call on every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their own household and wants state governors and local authorities to make this obligatory. The president-elect has regularly appeared in public wearing a mask while Mr Trump has largely avoided doing so. Read more: Could the election be decided in courts?

US cases rose by more than 100,000 on Sunday for the fifth day in a row while more than 237,000 people have died. Earlier this month top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the US ""could not possibly be positioned more poorly"" as the country approached winter and people spent more time congregating indoors. Mr Biden also announced plans to reboot the virus-hit US economy, which has seen millions more people become unemployed, by boosting manufacturing, investing in infrastructure, making childcare more affordable and reducing the wealth gap between different ethnic groups. In another break with the Trump era - which saw Mr Trump accused of stoking of racial tensions and failing to condemn white supremacist groups - Mr Biden aims to make addressing racism a central pillar of his administration. He wants measures including better access to affordable housing for black and minority communities, fair treatment and pay for workers and enabling the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, which sets monetary policy - to do more to reduce racial wealth disparities. Mr Biden also wants to transform US policing by banning the use of chokeholds that have been involved in high-profile deaths at the hands of police, stopping the transfer of ""weapons of war"" to police forces and creating a national police oversight commission. He further plans to reduce the US prison population, which at more than two million people is the biggest in the world and includes a disproportionate number of black and minority inmates, and focus more on ""redemption and rehabilitation"". This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" ""Our criminal justice system cannot be just unless we root out the racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system,"" his plan says. The US has been roiled by protests against police brutality in the run-up to the election. Footage ofthe death of George Floyd in police custodyin Minneapolis in May sparked outrage around the world, and exit poll showed that racial inequality was the second-biggest factor determining how people voted after the economy. President Trump will hold a series of campaign-style rallies across the country to build support for the legal fights challenging the outcome, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The BBC projected Mr Biden's victory on Saturday after gains in the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Nevada propelled him over the 270 electoral college vote threshold required to clinch the White House. Mr Trump has not spoken in public since the numbers were announced, but he has repeated previous claims of voter fraud in tweets, which have been marked by Twitter as a ""disputed"" claim. The president played golf at the Trump National Golf course in Virginia on Sunday but did not talk to reporters After Mr Biden was projected to win Mr Trump remained defiant, saying Mr Biden was ""falsely posing as the winner"" and insisting the election was ""far from over"". The president took more than 70 million votes, the second-highest tally in history. Mr Trump has vowed to contest the election results on several fronts. A recount will be held in Georgia - where the margins are tight - and Mr Trump wants the same in Wisconsin, but recounts rarely change results. He has also vowed to take legal action to the Supreme Court, alleging voting fraud without evidence. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to challenge this in the state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career The Trump campaign has filed a lawsuit over ballots cast on election day in Arizona that it claims were incorrectly rejected. Arizona's secretary of state, however, said in a statement that the case was ""grasping at straws"". Votes in some states are continuing to be counted and results are never official until final certification, which occurs in each state in the weeks following the election. This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in their state capitals to vote on 14 December. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him.

Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added.

As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win.

Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader.

""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too.

""Beyond the lockdown, this should encourage many more people to book flights with confidence knowing there is an option that allows them to shorten self isolation,"" the transport secretary said. The tests would be paid for by passengers arriving in the UK but the Department for Transport would not comment on how much they might cost. In other developments: The first effective coronavirus vaccine can preventmore than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, a preliminary analysis shows. Developers Pfizer and BioNTech described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"" Wales' 17-day firebreak lockdown has ended, meaning people can travel anywhere within the country, two households can again form a bubble and businesses that shut can now reopen Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidthe country's Covid-19 restrictions are ""highly unlikely"" to be easedwhen they are reviewed on Tuesday The coronavirus mutation causing concern in Denmarkhas arisen before in mink in the Netherlands, scientists have said - but it did not spread to humans there Mr Shapps said the government was working with other countries to help establish an ""international standard"" for self-isolation and testing to be carried out before travelling to and from the UK, to stop passengers having to quarantine on arrival in their destination country. And he said quick-turnaround tests being trialled in Liverpool gave ""some hope for optimism"" as they could ""open the way for non-quarantine air travel"". The air travel industry has beenhit hard by the drop in passenger numberssince the start of the pandemic, with airlines such as British Airways and EasyJetcutting thousands of jobs. Airline and airport groups have called on governments around the world to provide financial support for the struggling industry. Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon told the conference it was ""inconceivable"" the government had not taken more action to limit job losses across the aviation industry, adding that Mr Shapps's ""warm words"" needed ""to be translated into action"". Anyone arriving into the UK must self-isolate for 14 days unless travelling from a countrylisted by the government,external, with some exceptions for certain occupations. The mass coronavirus testing programme launched in Liverpool last week is the first trial of whole-city testing in England. All residents are being offered regular Covid-19 tests - whether or not they have symptoms. Children aged 11 and over will be tested in schoolsas part of the scheme, the city's council has said. The pilot includes amix of existing swab tests and the new lateral flow tests- which can provide a result within an hour without the need to use a lab. Testing a whole city for Covid: How will it work? Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? Earlier, Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast the new ""lateral flow"" test was available to everyone in Liverpool and could be a ""major breakthrough"" if successful. ""A test is only as good as the speed with which you can turn a result around,"" he said. ""What we've really been focusing on more recently is a faster test, so that people can act more quickly to prevent the spread of the virus so this, if we can make it work, is a major breakthrough."" BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher said rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests neededhigh levels of the virus in the body to work. It is not yet clear how good they are at catching people in the early stages of the infection, when the virus is still taking hold. They are similar to pregnancy tests and are easy, cheap and fast. Fluid from a nasal swab or saliva goes on to one end of the test, then a marking appears if the person is positive. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? The prime minister said last month that he shared ""people's frustrations"" at the turnaround times for results, following criticism of England's test-and-trace system. Mr Johnson's comments came after figures for the week ending 14 October showed that just 15.1% of people who were tested received their result within 24 hours. Last week, the government said it had hit its target of having the capacity tocarry out 500,000 coronavirus tests a day across the UK by the end of October. The data for 31 October showed just over 525,000 tests could be done - a doubling of capacity in two months. However, just under 300,000 tests were actually carried out. Mr Johnson previously said mass testing had""the potential to be a powerful new weapon in our fight against Covid-19"". However, some health experts have criticised the Liverpool trial, with Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, warning that plans to test asymptomatic people went against advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to prioritise tests for those displaying symptoms. Meanwhile on Sunday, another156 people in the UK were reported to have diedwithin 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, with a further 20,572 cases of the virus.

"Joe Biden pushes forward with plans for officeHis team says his priorities are the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, racism and climate change.US Election 2020","This video can not be played Biden and Harris call for unity in victory speeches US President-elect Joe Biden is to make tackling the coronavirus pandemic his top priority following his win over Donald Trump, his team says. Announcing the first steps in his transition plan, his team said there would be more testing and Americans would be asked to wear masks. On Monday, Mr Biden is expected to name a 12-member coronavirus task force. His win remains a projection as key states still count votes. Mr Trump does not plan to concede, his campaign says. Mr Trump is launching legal challenges to the results in several key states. He has made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud, but election officials say there is no evidence that the vote was rigged against him. Mr Biden is forging ahead with his plans for assuming power in January after major US networks called the election in his favour on Saturday. Follow all the latest live updates Five US voters who changed the race Being with Trump the day he lost the election Election results in maps and charts That reportedly also includes a slew of executive orders -written orders issued by the presidentto the federal government that do not require congressional approval - aimed at reversing controversial Trump policies. According to US media: Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which the US officially left on Wednesday He will reverse the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization He will end thetravel ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries He will reinstate an Obama-era policy of granting immigration status to undocumented migrants who entered the US as children In his first speech as president-elect on Saturday, Mr Biden said it was ""time to heal"" the US and vowed ""not to divide but to unify"" the country. Addressing Trump supporters directly, he said: ""We have to stop treating our opponents as enemies."" He and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris have launcheda website for the transition,external, saying the team will also focus on the economy, tackling racism and climate change. The projected election result means Mr Trump becomes the first one-term president since the 1990s. Meanwhile, the General Services Administration, a government agency tasked with recognising the president-elect and beginning the transition process, has so far not done so. Its administrator Emily Murphy, who was appointed by Mr Trump, has given no indication when this could happen. Until then, Mr Biden's transition team cannot access government funds or communicate with the federal agencies it will be staffing. Media reports suggested senior Republicans remained divided over how to react to Mr Biden's victory, with some refusing to publicly acknowledge the result of the ballot. The Republican leader in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, told Fox News that all recounts and legal challenges should be completed, adding: ""Then and only then, America will decide who won the race."" But former Republican President George W Bush congratulated Mr Biden on his victory, saying the American people could have confidence that the election had been fundamentally fair and that its outcome was clear. He also congratulated Mr Trump on a hard-fought campaign. The president-elect is vowing a major shift in the way the White House approaches coronavirus after Mr Trump repeatedly downplayed its gravity and resisted public health measures including wearing masks and social distancing. The US election took place in the shadow of the virus, which has killed more than 237,000 people in the country The Biden team has said it will ensure all Americans had access to regular and free testing and provide ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"". The task force will be led by former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy and a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, David Kessler. Mr Biden also wants rules mandating the wearing of masks across the country, which he says would save thousands of lives. He plans to call on every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their own household and wants state governors and local authorities to make this obligatory. The president-elect has regularly appeared in public wearing a mask while Mr Trump has largely avoided doing so. Read more: Could the election be decided in courts? 'Let's work together!' - How world reacted to Biden win 'We in Africa are proud of her success' Five questions for Biden on the economy Who is potential US first lady Jill Biden? US cases rose by more than 100,000 on Sunday for the fifth day in a row while more than 237,000 people have died. Earlier this month top US virus expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the US ""could not possibly be positioned more poorly"" as the country approached winter and people spent more time congregating indoors. Mr Biden also announced plans to reboot the virus-hit US economy, which has seen millions more people become unemployed, by boosting manufacturing, investing in infrastructure, making childcare more affordable and reducing the wealth gap between different ethnic groups. In another break with the Trump era - which saw Mr Trump accused of stoking of racial tensions and failing to condemn white supremacist groups - Mr Biden aims to make addressing racism a central pillar of his administration. He wants measures including better access to affordable housing for black and minority communities, fair treatment and pay for workers and enabling the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, which sets monetary policy - to do more to reduce racial wealth disparities. Mr Biden also wants to transform US policing by banning the use of chokeholds that have been involved in high-profile deaths at the hands of police, stopping the transfer of ""weapons of war"" to police forces and creating a national police oversight commission. He further plans to reduce the US prison population, which at more than two million people is the biggest in the world and includes a disproportionate number of black and minority inmates, and focus more on ""redemption and rehabilitation"". This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" ""Our criminal justice system cannot be just unless we root out the racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system,"" his plan says. The US has been roiled by protests against police brutality in the run-up to the election. Footage ofthe death of George Floyd in police custodyin Minneapolis in May sparked outrage around the world, and exit poll showed that racial inequality was the second-biggest factor determining how people voted after the economy. President Trump will hold a series of campaign-style rallies across the country to build support for the legal fights challenging the outcome, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The BBC projected Mr Biden's victory on Saturday after gains in the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Nevada propelled him over the 270 electoral college vote threshold required to clinch the White House. Mr Trump has not spoken in public since the numbers were announced, but he has repeated previous claims of voter fraud in tweets, which have been marked by Twitter as a ""disputed"" claim. The president played golf at the Trump National Golf course in Virginia on Sunday but did not talk to reporters After Mr Biden was projected to win Mr Trump remained defiant, saying Mr Biden was ""falsely posing as the winner"" and insisting the election was ""far from over"". The president took more than 70 million votes, the second-highest tally in history. Mr Trump has vowed to contest the election results on several fronts. A recount will be held in Georgia - where the margins are tight - and Mr Trump wants the same in Wisconsin, but recounts rarely change results. He has also vowed to take legal action to the Supreme Court, alleging voting fraud without evidence. If the election result is challenged, it would require legal teams to challenge this in the state courts. State judges would then need to uphold the challenge and order a recount, and Supreme Court justices could then be asked to overturn a ruling. This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career The Trump campaign has filed a lawsuit over ballots cast on election day in Arizona that it claims were incorrectly rejected. Arizona's secretary of state, however, said in a statement that the case was ""grasping at straws"". Votes in some states are continuing to be counted and results are never official until final certification, which occurs in each state in the weeks following the election. This must be done before 538 chosen officials (electors) from the Electoral College - which officially decides who wins the election - meet in their state capitals to vote on 14 December. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? The electors' votes usually mirror the popular vote in each state. However, in some states this is not a formal requirement. The new president is officially sworn into office on 20 January after a transition period to give them time to appoint cabinet ministers and make plans. The handover of power takes place at a ceremony known as the inauguration, which is held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.

Soldier's medal-winning heroic actions questionedSome who served with Deacon Cutterham in Afghanistan dispute his account of a Taliban attack.,"Sjt Deacon Cutterham was presented with his medal at Buckingham Palace in 2012 The heroic acts that earned a former British soldier a medal have been called into question by some of those who served alongside him, days before he plans to sell his medal collection. Deacon Cutterham was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Crossfor picking up and hurling away a Taliban grenade. But some soldiers who served with Mr Cutterham in Helmand province have told BBC News they dispute what happened that day in Afghanistan in 2011. Mr Cutterham denies their claims. Some of his former colleagues in the 1st Battalion the Rifles chose to speak to the BBC after readingreports that Mr Cutterham expects his collection of seven medals to fetch up to Â£120,000 when sold at auction on Thursday. ""I don't believe he earned that medal and now he might make money from it,"" said one soldier, who added that it was ""abhorrent"" to hold the auction so close to Remembrance Day on 11 November. Another said: ""We didn't care if he wanted to tell people how brave he was. What we care about now is him making financial gain from this."" Grenade rescue soldier honoured Hero soldier's medals 'to fetch Â£120,000' Mr Cutterham, 37, from Bristol, joined the Army at 16 and served in Iraq and Afghanistan during a 19-year military career. The grenade incident happened when, with the 1st Battalion the Rifles, he was leading a patrol in Nahr-e-Saraj District in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan. Deacon Cutterham has given several interviews about the incident. In 2012 he described what happened to the BBC: ""Grenade came over the top. With that I shouted 'grenade' and then advanced on it, picked the grenade up and and then posted it, and it literally went off as soon as I pulled my hand away - and prevented me and my lead scout from getting serious injuries or death."" In other accounts he said the grenade was thrown over a wall and then landed in a ditch: ""I had seen exactly where it had landed but couldn't see it in the stream. ""I quickly placed my hand in the water to search for it and placed my hand directly on the grenade, shouted to take cover and posted it."" The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, which is one level down from the Victoria Cross, is awarded in recognition of acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations. Mr Cutterham's name was put forward by his officers, and their recommendations would have been passed up the chain of command. The citation on Mr Cutterham's award reads: ""The action itself was utterly courageous, carried out with composure and clarity of thought. ""Cutterham's gritty leadership and gallant act saved lives and inspired his men."" No-one disputes that a grenade did go off that day. Everyone on Mr Cutterham's patrol - and back at the patrol base - said they heard an explosion. ""We believe a grenade was thrown, but it was his,"" one of his former comrades told the BBC. Another soldier, who says he carried out an equipment check when the patrol returned to base, claimed: ""There was one grenade missing."" The soldiers the BBC has spoken to also questioned why any member of the Taliban who was close enough to a British army patrol to throw a grenade did not follow up with any further attack. They spoke to the BBC on condition that their names not be used because most are still serving soldiers. One soldier said: ""He [Mr Cutterham] says he saw someone running away. Nobody else did. Nor was a single shot fired on that patrol."" The BBC has been told by several sources that a drone was flying above the patrol at the time and the video feed showed no sign of enemy activity in the area or any individuals nearby. The BBC asked the Ministry of Defence to provide any statements from anyone on the patrol who could back up Mr Cutterham's account, but none were given. A BBC request to interview someone from the MoD in response to the allegations was turned down, but the ministry said in a statement: ""Acts of courage that warrant an honour or award are rigorously scrutinised before being approved. ""If serving personnel have a grievance, there is a formal process for them to register their complaint through the chain of command, which would be looked into accordingly."" Several of the soldiers who spoke to the BBC said they did raise concerns at the time, but were told they were only doing so because they disliked Mr Cutterham. Most of those who spoke to the BBC have admitted they disliked him. Mr Cutterham did not award himself an honour. It was the decision of his officers to put his name forward. But in this case some soldiers clearly question the process. One said: ""If you have a medal it makes you look good; it makes the commanders look good."" He added: ""You have to look to history when it comes to medals, there are witnessesâ¦ there's been other people backing up what they've done."" The BBC approached Mr Cutterham for an interview on several occasions. He said in a statement by email: ""I'm extremely disappointed that people are questioning the events of that day. I strongly deny these claims."" He added that the incident had an enormous impact on his life and that he has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health issues.

There have been a further 21,350 cases of coronavirus across the UK and a further 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test.

Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Prof Van Tam is all about the metaphors tonight! First, with a football reference, we were told we hadnât won the cup but we now know the keeper can be beaten. Then we were asked to imagine a cold, rainy station platform with the bright lights of a train coming down the track - but various hurdles to overcome before we could get on board. Whatever the metaphor the message is clear: the vaccine news is positive but itâs still far from a solution. And while the metaphors might be attracting some mirth on Twitter, thereâs a serious point to them too. The science can be complex. What's key is finding a way to get across the essential information in way we can all understand. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Managing expectations seems to be a key theme of the televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam are at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The prime minister says we must not âslacken our resolveâ, while Prof Van-Tam says it will not make âany differenceâ for the second wave this winter. Their message is simple â do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But todayâs announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, its ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome â and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. The prime minister is asked how distribution of the vaccine would be prioritised. He says ministers will âlook at where the doses will be most appropriately distributedâ and that âeverything flowsâ from driving down the R rate. He adds that âpeople are pulling togetherâ under the current restrictions, and that he believes they will get the R rate to below one. One journalist points out there is global excitement about the vaccine and asks the PM how confident he is that it can be delivered. The prime minister says he is âvery hopefulâ as the vaccine task force has been  âsecuring supplies for the UK for some time now"". But Jonathan Van-Tam warns that âmany thingsâ can go wrong with vaccines during manufacture. âEvery single batch has to be quality assured and released. Things can and do and have always gone wrong,â he says.
âWe have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes.â Boris Johnson says he is optimistic about the UKâs prospects for next year, but adds that he does not want to âlet people run away with the ideaâ that todayâs news is a âslam dunkâ. Jonathan Van-Tam says that there is an ""enormous mental health burdenâ on people during lockdown. âOne of the things we can do to try and make the restrictions as short as possible is to follow them to the letter,â he says. The prime minister adds a cautious note, warning it is âcrucial that we do not overdo itâ.
âWe cannot let our enthusiasm tonight run away with us, folks,â he says. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Despite todayâs positive vaccine announcement, the PM struck a deliberately cautious tone. Boris Johnson stressed that news of an effective vaccine was not yet a solution. Number 10 clearly doesnât want the suggestion of a scientific breakthrough to be any sort of green light for people to flout lockdown rules at what he described as a critical moment. The PM has been among the most optimistic â perhaps hopeful - in the past about science providing the way out of this pandemic. But the message today was, 'weâre not there yet', calling instead for the public to keep their resolve. Boris Johnson will know the political and economic difficulties facing Downing St are far from over too. Making a football reference Jonathan Van-Tam says that ""we haven't won the cup yet"", but what it ""does tell you is that the keeper can be beaten"". The deputy chief medical officer for England said we do not yet know what the vaccine breakthrough means for when we can get back to a normal life. ""Frankly weâre in the middle of the second wave and I donât see the vaccines making any difference for the wave we are now in. ""Iâm hopeful that it may prevent future waves but this one we have to battle through to the end without a vaccine. We have to keep pressing hard for now."" Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the Pfizer vaccine news is an ""important scientific breakthrough"" but warns that the message is to stand fast and not get overexcited about where we are. He says the next step will be to see safety data which he expects to see in the coming days. Van-Tam says if it does get to the stage where vaccines are authorised for use in the UK there will have to be decisions made by the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation as to who gets priotiry. This list cannot be finalised yet, he says. The prime minister is joined by Brigaidier Joe Fossey who has led the army's support for the mass testing pilot in Liverpool. Holding up a lateral flow test Brigadier Fossey says they offer the chance for more regular and rapid testing. He says: ""Our message to the people of Liverpool is clear: we are set up and ready for you to come and get tested. Please do not hesitate."" He says what they are trialling is a ""possible route out of lockdown and a way to get on with our lives"". The prime minister said that mass testing is still in its infancy and at present is no substitute for the national restrictions, social distancing and hand hygiene and ""all the rest"". ""I know it has been a hard first week of the autumn restrictions,"" he said. But Johnson added the country must get through this until 2 December when the current lockdown measures will expire and ""we plan to move forward with a tiered approach"". The prime minister says despite a vaccine being on the horizon we must continue to do everything we can to keep the R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - down. He warns that the number of Covid patients in hospital has risen to 13,000 as of 5 November, and says ""we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak"". Boris Johnson says that it is important more than ever to follow the rules but says we must hope and believe mass testing will help. He urges people in Liverpool to get tested and says ""we have tested thousands of people but there is still more to do"". Meanwhile, Joe Biden has made his first speech about coronavirus after forming a panel made up of 13 scientists to advise him as he prepares to take office. He tells Americans that regardless of how they voted in the election, they should wear masks in order to protect themselves and other citizens. ""Wear a mask, it's the single most potent weapon against the virus,"" he says. Face coverings have become politically divisive in the US. Biden says the vaccine development process must be transparent so Americans can have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine. He notes it won't be available for many months yet. ""The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. Although I'm not in office yet I'm just laying out what we expect to do and hope some of it can be done between now and the time I'm sworn in."" He adds that ""there's a need for bold action"" as cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up. His remarks contrast with many of Donald Trump's who at times underplayed the severity of the pandemic. Boris Johnson begins by saying that people are asking that ""does the progress towards a vaccine made today mean we are at the beginning of the end to our troubles"". ""We have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go,"" he says. But he adds if and when the vaccine is ready to be sued the UK is ""towards the front of the pack"" as it has already ordered 40 million doses. There will be an NHS-led vaccine programme, Johnson says. He adds he must stress that ""these are very, very early days"" and the distant toot of the scientific bugle is louder but still someway off. Prime Minister Boris Johnson begins speaking at the Downing Street news conference. Today he is joined by Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, and Brigadier Joe Fossey. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter News that the first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19 has meant vaccine conspiracy theories are being shared again on social media. For months, theyâve been spreading in local Facebook groups, on Instagram pages and in WhatsApp chats. The false claims include the baseless theory that a vaccine could be a way for Microsoft boss Bill Gates to secretly insert microchips into people â so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has debunked this particular claim in the past.Nevertheless, Bill Gatesâs name has been trending on Twitter since the announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech. Rumours have also been circulating about when the announcement happened â with the suggestion that it was deliberately timed to happen after Joe Biden was declared president-elect. Thereâs currently no evidence to support this claim. When you see these sorts of claims, remember to think about why a post was shared, how it makes you feel and to pause before passing it on.

Global Covid-19 cases surge past 50 million,"Countries have imposed a number of measures as they try to curb the spread of the virus The total of confirmed coronavirus cases has surged past 50 million following record numbers of new cases in several countries. More than 1.25 million people have now died after contracting the virus, according to Johns Hopkins university. But the numbers are thought to be higher because of insufficient testing in many countries. A second wave of the virus has accounted for a quarter of all cases, Reuters reported. Europe, with more than 12.5 million cases and 305,700 deaths, is again a hotspot after being the first epicentre of the pandemic earlier this year. In the US just under 10 million have tested positive. It has seen more than 125,000 cases per day three days in a row. The states of North and South Dakota have the highest rates of death per capita. Tracking the global pandemic How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? US President-elect Joe Biden hasvowed a much more aggressive approachto the pandemic, after Mr Trump repeatedly downplayed its gravity and resisted public health measures including wearing masks and social distancing. Mr Biden has vowed to name a group of top scientists to his coronavirus task force as early as Monday, wants more testing and plans to call on every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their own household. This video can not be played Get a closer look at how scientists develop a Covid-19 vaccine He is likely to take charge when the pandemic is at its peak in the country, former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr Scott Gottlieb says. Dr Gottlieb told US media that the rate of new infections would probably be starting to decrease by late January, and ""the only question is going to be how many people have died in the course of this and how many people have been infected"". In Europe, France on Sunday recorded 38,619 new cases - many less than Saturday's record increase of 86,852 cases. However the health ministry said it had problems collecting data and there would be a correction on Monday. Olympic champion Kohei Uchimura in action at an event in Tokyo seen as a crucial trial run for next year's postponed Olympics France also registered 271 deaths, bringing the total to 40,439. The country is just over a week into a second lockdown with the aim of curbing the spread of the virus. Under the lockdown restrictions, expected to be in place until 1 December, people can only leave their homes to go to work if they cannot work from home, to buy essential goods, seek medical help or to exercise for one hour a day. In the UK - which has seen the highest number of deaths in Europe - there were 20,572 new cases and 156 new deaths, bringing the total to 49,044 deaths. However the latest figures from the UK's Office for National Statistics suggest the increase in infections may be stabilising around the UK, with the rate of increase slower than in recent weeks. India and Brazil have also been hard hit.

Biden 'seeks to quickly reverse' Trump policies,"President-elect Joe Biden made his first appointments, naming a group of scientists and experts who will lead his administration's response to Covid-19 However, President Donald Trump is still planning legal challenges to the results in some key states Biden says it will take time to develop a vaccine, and urges Americans to wear a mask to reduce Covid-19 transmissions Biden and President Trump both welcome news that a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is 90% effective Biden advisers are discussing who can fill key posts after the Democrat pledged the most diverse cabinet in history Results from the states of Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Alaska are still outstanding Edited by Helier Cheung Thank you for joining us for our ongoing coverage of the 2020 US presidential election. It's been nearly a week since the 3 November election day, and there are another 10 weeks to go until Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Prof Van Tam is all about the metaphors tonight! First, with a football reference, we were told we hadnât won the cup but we now know the keeper can be beaten. Then we were asked to imagine a cold, rainy station platform with the bright lights of a train coming down the track - but various hurdles to overcome before we could get on board. Whatever the metaphor the message is clear: the vaccine news is positive but itâs still far from a solution. And while the metaphors might be attracting some mirth on Twitter, thereâs a serious point to them too. The science can be complex. What's key is finding a way to get across the essential information in way we can all understand. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Managing expectations seems to be a key theme of the televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam are at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The prime minister says we must not âslacken our resolveâ, while Prof Van-Tam says it will not make âany differenceâ for the second wave this winter. Their message is simple â do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But todayâs announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, its ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome â and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. The prime minister is asked how distribution of the vaccine would be prioritised. He says ministers will âlook at where the doses will be most appropriately distributedâ and that âeverything flowsâ from driving down the R rate. He adds that âpeople are pulling togetherâ under the current restrictions, and that he believes they will get the R rate to below one. One journalist points out there is global excitement about the vaccine and asks the PM how confident he is that it can be delivered. The prime minister says he is âvery hopefulâ as the vaccine task force has been  âsecuring supplies for the UK for some time now"". But Jonathan Van-Tam warns that âmany thingsâ can go wrong with vaccines during manufacture. âEvery single batch has to be quality assured and released. Things can and do and have always gone wrong,â he says.
âWe have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes.â Boris Johnson says he is optimistic about the UKâs prospects for next year, but adds that he does not want to âlet people run away with the ideaâ that todayâs news is a âslam dunkâ. Jonathan Van-Tam says that there is an ""enormous mental health burdenâ on people during lockdown. âOne of the things we can do to try and make the restrictions as short as possible is to follow them to the letter,â he says. The prime minister adds a cautious note, warning it is âcrucial that we do not overdo itâ.
âWe cannot let our enthusiasm tonight run away with us, folks,â he says. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Despite todayâs positive vaccine announcement, the PM struck a deliberately cautious tone. Boris Johnson stressed that news of an effective vaccine was not yet a solution. Number 10 clearly doesnât want the suggestion of a scientific breakthrough to be any sort of green light for people to flout lockdown rules at what he described as a critical moment. The PM has been among the most optimistic â perhaps hopeful - in the past about science providing the way out of this pandemic. But the message today was, 'weâre not there yet', calling instead for the public to keep their resolve. Boris Johnson will know the political and economic difficulties facing Downing St are far from over too. Making a football reference Jonathan Van-Tam says that ""we haven't won the cup yet"", but what it ""does tell you is that the keeper can be beaten"". The deputy chief medical officer for England said we do not yet know what the vaccine breakthrough means for when we can get back to a normal life. ""Frankly weâre in the middle of the second wave and I donât see the vaccines making any difference for the wave we are now in. ""Iâm hopeful that it may prevent future waves but this one we have to battle through to the end without a vaccine. We have to keep pressing hard for now."" Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the Pfizer vaccine news is an ""important scientific breakthrough"" but warns that the message is to stand fast and not get overexcited about where we are. He says the next step will be to see safety data which he expects to see in the coming days. Van-Tam says if it does get to the stage where vaccines are authorised for use in the UK there will have to be decisions made by the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation as to who gets priotiry. This list cannot be finalised yet, he says. The prime minister is joined by Brigaidier Joe Fossey who has led the army's support for the mass testing pilot in Liverpool. Holding up a lateral flow test Brigadier Fossey says they offer the chance for more regular and rapid testing. He says: ""Our message to the people of Liverpool is clear: we are set up and ready for you to come and get tested. Please do not hesitate."" He says what they are trialling is a ""possible route out of lockdown and a way to get on with our lives"". The prime minister said that mass testing is still in its infancy and at present is no substitute for the national restrictions, social distancing and hand hygiene and ""all the rest"". ""I know it has been a hard first week of the autumn restrictions,"" he said. But Johnson added the country must get through this until 2 December when the current lockdown measures will expire and ""we plan to move forward with a tiered approach"". The prime minister says despite a vaccine being on the horizon we must continue to do everything we can to keep the R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - down. He warns that the number of Covid patients in hospital has risen to 13,000 as of 5 November, and says ""we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak"". Boris Johnson says that it is important more than ever to follow the rules but says we must hope and believe mass testing will help. He urges people in Liverpool to get tested and says ""we have tested thousands of people but there is still more to do"". Meanwhile, Joe Biden has made his first speech about coronavirus after forming a panel made up of 13 scientists to advise him as he prepares to take office. He tells Americans that regardless of how they voted in the election, they should wear masks in order to protect themselves and other citizens. ""Wear a mask, it's the single most potent weapon against the virus,"" he says. Face coverings have become politically divisive in the US. Biden says the vaccine development process must be transparent so Americans can have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine. He notes it won't be available for many months yet. ""The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. Although I'm not in office yet I'm just laying out what we expect to do and hope some of it can be done between now and the time I'm sworn in."" He adds that ""there's a need for bold action"" as cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up. His remarks contrast with many of Donald Trump's who at times underplayed the severity of the pandemic. Boris Johnson begins by saying that people are asking that ""does the progress towards a vaccine made today mean we are at the beginning of the end to our troubles"". ""We have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go,"" he says. But he adds if and when the vaccine is ready to be sued the UK is ""towards the front of the pack"" as it has already ordered 40 million doses. There will be an NHS-led vaccine programme, Johnson says. He adds he must stress that ""these are very, very early days"" and the distant toot of the scientific bugle is louder but still someway off. Prime Minister Boris Johnson begins speaking at the Downing Street news conference. Today he is joined by Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, and Brigadier Joe Fossey. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter News that the first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19 has meant vaccine conspiracy theories are being shared again on social media. For months, theyâve been spreading in local Facebook groups, on Instagram pages and in WhatsApp chats. The false claims include the baseless theory that a vaccine could be a way for Microsoft boss Bill Gates to secretly insert microchips into people â so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has debunked this particular claim in the past.Nevertheless, Bill Gatesâs name has been trending on Twitter since the announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech. Rumours have also been circulating about when the announcement happened â with the suggestion that it was deliberately timed to happen after Joe Biden was declared president-elect. Thereâs currently no evidence to support this claim. When you see these sorts of claims, remember to think about why a post was shared, how it makes you feel and to pause before passing it on. Get in touch if youâre seeing speculation like this on social media that you want me to investigate:Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Today's news that avaccine can prevent more than 90% of peoplefrom getting Covid-19 is based on preliminary analysis. There's still a way to go before any vaccine can be given to the wider public and our lives can go back to how they were pre-pandemic. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps puts this news into context. This video can not be played Covid vaccine: what does the Pfizer vaccine news mean? Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to host a Downing Street news conference shortly. It follows today's news that the company behind a vaccine trial has said it is 90% effective against the virus.

The rowdy protests that changed 14 million lives," Their rebellious protests to change the law Their rebellious protests to change the law A train pulls into Cardiff Queen Street Station on a bright spring morning and the carriage doors slide open. Quickly, a young man in a black beanie hat launches himself out of his wheelchair from the platform onto the train carriage floor. To the surprise of the passengers, he handcuffs himself to a handrail. Further along the platform, others have done the same. The man in the hat is pulled from the train by two police officers who struggle to keep hold of him. He twists and turns, managing to break free for a few seconds in a vain attempt to get back on board. The train’s going nowhere. That’s what this small group of protesters want. By disrupting the service, they’re hoping to highlight something they come up against daily - the difficulties of accessing public transport. One officer tells a young demonstrator she’s causing an obstruction to the train. But the woman tells him from her wheelchair that the station itself is the obstruction. “I couldn’t access Platform 3,” she says. The woman is initially arrested, but then let off with a warning. It’s difficult for the police to put people in wheelchairs in their inaccessible vans - and that’s why, she reckons, she’s been “de-arrested”. This dramatic protest - in spring 1995 - was just one of many staged on buses and trains across the UK in the fight for disabled civil rights. Back then, it was not illegal to discriminate against disabled people in many areas of everyday life.

This dramatic protest - in spring 1995 - was just one of many staged on buses and trains across the UK in the fight for disabled civil rights. Back then, it was not illegal to discriminate against disabled people in many areas of everyday life.  Barbara Lisicki felt angry and ignored. “There was no sense of outrage anywhere until we started really pushing it,” she says. “Disabled people were so clearly socially excluded.” In the early 1970s, Barbara was living in north London with her mum and brothers. As a young child, she was “non-disabled”. She couldn’t get on with the rules at her “posh and very strict school” and her sense of personal justice was already being tested. “I got expelled. It was a convent run by nuns. I was rejecting the mindless discipline and religious zealotry. “I built up so many detentions there wasn’t enough time in the year for me to do them all.” Barbara Lisicki with her former partner and fellow campaigner Alan Holdsworth  Soon afterwards, Barbara developed a high temperature which wouldn’t go away - it was an early sign that her life was going to change. Eventually, she ended up at a specialist juvenile rheumatology hospital in Taplow, Buckinghamshire. She remained there for over a year. Barbara tells me she was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis which causes pain, swelling and stiffness in her joints. It’s an autoimmune condition usually affecting the hands, feet and wrists. As Barbara puts it: “It’s basically where your body starts attacking itself.” She made some friends at Taplow, but describes the overall experience as “horrible and oppressive”. Once again, she found herself breaking the rules - regularly escaping the ward with an older girl. In the hospital, they were made to use wheelchairs so as not to put too much weight on their hips. “But we used to dump the wheelchairs in the bushes and hitchhike to the pub,” says Barbara. “They’d be sending out search parties and we’d be down there having a vodka and lime. I was 16.” Barbara Lisicki Barbara acknowledges she was smart, well-read and “a player”. She got a degree at university and a postgraduate teaching qualification. “I thought: ‘I’m not going to be able to do a manual or factory job. Basically, I’m going to have to do something where I can sit down a lot!’” But she struggled to get a teaching job. That’s when her “get it” moment happened. She realised that employers were unwilling to offer a job to a disabled person. Many disabled people have “get it” moments, including me. I'm blind, and when I was in my early 20s a security guard tried to stop me taking my guide dog into a cinema. Other staff helped me, but for the whole film I was worried I’d be made to leave, when I hadn’t done anything wrong. Barbara says her opportunities were blocked by discrimination. “I put down [on application forms] I had a long-term condition - I’m not even sure I used the term disabled person. I simply wasn’t getting jobs.” “Everybody I qualified with on the teaching course got taken on except me. I’d done better than many of them - achieving credits and distinctions. “It just struck me then, it was because I had an impairment. I was a disabled person.”  Barbara Lisicki felt angry and ignored. “There was no sense of outrage anywhere until we started really pushing it,” she says. “Disabled people were so clearly socially excluded.” In the early 1970s, Barbara was living in north London with her mum and brothers.

She was the young woman arrested - and then de-arrested - at Cardiff Queen Street Station. For her, it started in 1990 when she got a call from a friend asking if she fancied hijacking a bus. Back then, few buses were accessible and wheelchair users had to give several days’ notice to travel by train. Even then, they were put in the guard’s van because of lack of space in the carriages. She found herself in central London on a direct action protest run by CAT, the Campaign for Accessible Transport. They knew their wheelchairs meant they couldn’t actually get on a bus, but they could block traffic on Oxford Street. “I realised then that buses should be for everyone, including us. Up to that point, I just thought it was my fault I couldn’t walk and couldn’t get on,” she says. “It’s actually possible to invent a ramp or a lift for the bus, whereas for me to be medically-cured was not within the realms of possibility at that time.” Sue and 14 others were arrested, but charges against them were later dropped. She’s convinced it’s because the magistrates’ courts weren’t accessible. Sue Elsegood at a 1990s bus protest (above) and more recently (below)   Disabled people then, as now, didn’t want to be seen as charity cases. In 1989, Barbara Lisicki went on television to say so. She didn’t accept the negative portrayals, as she saw it, of disabled people on shows like Children in Need. “If you make a disabled person an object of charity, you’re not going to see them as your equal,” she told BBC executives on the discussion programme, Network. “It isn’t just about individuals giving money. It isn’t just about having mass appeals on television. It’s about having rights. I want people to realise that disabled people have no rights.” ITV was not spared. In 1988, it started its own charity extravaganza. Telethon was on air for 27 hours non-stop over the late May Bank Holiday. The main studio was filled with a cheering audience, giant cheques were waved in the air, and an array of famous faces performed for the cameras. Alan Holdsworth Alan Holdsworth, Barbara’s partner during the 1990s and fellow campaigner, got a phone call from a youth worker asking if he’d seen the negative way disabled people, she felt, were shown on screen. “She told me her young people were really pissed off with it. Was there anything we could do?” Alan, Barbara and friends were often asked to protest - they were known for their ability to organise. But Telethon was different. “It was the easiest action ever to organise,” says Alan who staged demos in both 1990 and 1992. “I couldn’t believe how many people hated it. I’d never watched it. I don’t want to watch that kind of thing, the images were just so pathetic.” Sue Elsegood was, like Barbara, part of a network of demonstrators determined to bring about change.

But the provocative slogan stuck. And Piss on Pity T-shirts began to make appearances at later demos - after all, it would be more difficult for police to insist on them being removed. “I’ve now sold about 20,000 of them,” says Alan. At the 1992 Telethon, Alan and Barbara staged “Block Telethon” - a demonstration and street-party with speeches, songs and comedy - outside ITV’s studios on London’s South Bank. Over 1,000 activists blocked the road making it difficult for celebrities’ cars to get into the building. ITV’s 1992 Telethon was to be the last.

People were drawn to them to hear about these exciting protests - where we’d be chaining ourselves to buses and getting arrested,” says Sue Elsegood. “They both had a political vision as to how we could challenge structural inequalities - and the demonstrations were powerful and quite sexy really.” In 1993, Sue, Barbara and Alan helped form a new group, the Disabled People’s Direct Action Network - or DAN. Over the next few years, DAN would stage many dramatic, non-violent protests across the UK. Barbara and Alan also used their alter egos - sharp-tongued comedian Wanda Barbara and singer-songwriter Johnny Crescendo - to drum up support at “Tragic But Brave” roadshow events and “Workhouse” cabarets. “We went around disability organisations performing and telling jokes,” says Alan. “We then talked to them in the bar afterwards to see what they wanted to do.” “The comedy and music was all about our experiences as disabled people.

A by-election was to be held in the safe Conservative seat, after the death of MP Robert Adley. The Tory candidate, Rob Hayward, had already been an MP - but had lost his seat at the 1992 general election. In parliament, he’d upset campaigners when he “talked out” (deliberately wasted time) a reading of a disabled civil rights bill put forward by a Labour MP. It meant the bill couldn’t become law. A week later he apologised to MPs. DAN protesters in Christchurch Enraged, DAN members spent a day chasing him in their wheelchairs around Christchurch during his campaign. The tide was already turning against John Major’s Conservative government, but Alan Holdsworth believes DAN played a part in Rob Hayward’s defeat. The Liberal Democrats took Christchurch.

But it was the resourceful and unruly way DAN members approached public transport that really caught attention. Wheelchairs blocked main roads and DAN members either handcuffed themselves to buses - or pulled themselves underneath vehicles - to prevent them from moving. In February 1995, they brought traffic on Westminster Bridge in central London to a standstill. Barbara argued with a furious bus driver, Sue was carried away in her wheelchair by police, while Alan handcuffed himself to a double-decker. And the chants were infectious. They call us wheelchair warriors, we’re kicking up some fuss And we will keep on marching ‘til you let us on the bus At the Cardiff station protest - where Sue was let off by police - Alan was actually arrested and charged with obstructing a train. Barbara recalls how she and a friend were arrested at a London bus protest and taken to a police station with accessible cells. “They didn’t search us. We must’ve looked too innocent,” she says. “We had a camera with us and took photos in our cell.”  From 1982 to the mid-1990s there were 14 failed attempts to get civil rights legislation for disabled people through parliament. But thanks to both DAN’s direct action protests - and more traditional campaigning from Rights Now, a wider alliance of disability groups - the time for change was approaching.

Disabled people hoped for the same legal protection offered to ethnic minorities under the Race Relations Act, and women under the Sex Discrimination Act. In 1994, the Minister for Disabled People, Sir Nicholas Scott, had to apologise for misleading MPs over the government’s undercover attempts to kill a Labour private members bill, which would have given disabled people equal rights. Two months’ later he was replaced in the job by William Hague, who helped draft a new bill - a political compromise between government and parliament - that stood a better chance of becoming law. The Disability Discrimination Act, or DDA, passed on 8 November 1995. “An Act to make it unlawful to discriminate against disabled persons in connection with employment, the provision of goods, facilities and services or the disposal or management of premises; to make provision about the employment of disabled persons; and to establish a National Disability Council.” But still campaigners felt it didn’t go far enough. Unlike the race and sex discrimination acts, there was no body with legal powers to make sure the new rules were being enforced. The Disability Rights Commission wasn’t established until 1999. Barbara Lisicki describes the National Disability Council set up instead as an “ineffective compromise body”. Some measures outlined in the DDA, including the “reasonable adjustments” service providers had to make so disabled people had access, didn’t have to be in place for nearly a decade. And what about being able to get on and off buses and trains more easily? That would need more legislation and more years of waiting. Barbara is both critical and pragmatic about the DDA. “We accepted we had some level of victory because legislation had finally been passed. But we were all aware it was weak and wasn’t going to do what was needed.” DAN’s work was not finished. There were more protests.

It was late 1997, a few months after Tony Blair had moved into Number 10, and DAN heard that Labour wanted to reduce the welfare budget. They rolled up at the gates of Downing Street. “We took the paint in takeaway food containers, so it looked like we’d taken our lunch with us as tourists. We threw it, spelling out the words ‘Blair’s blood’. “The cuts were going to make us bleed, make us suffer, as disabled people. We knew there were lots of people who wouldn’t be able to afford their heating with the benefit cuts he was proposing.” Sue remembers how one activist had a seizure during the protest. “He fell out of his chair and got covered in paint. The police didn’t know what to do. They went in to arrest us all but didn’t want to get red paint on their uniforms. “It wasn’t permanent damage, we were non-violent. We were out to get a message across and to reverse Blair’s policy. And we did, he didn’t go ahead with it at that time.” Podcast: Ouch - where real disability talk happens It’s a quarter of a century since the Disability Discrimination Act gave disabled people a legal starting point in the struggle for full civil rights. The positive thing that most people agree on is that it acknowledged in law, for the first time, that disabled people were discriminated against. Ten years ago, the DDA and more than 100 other separate pieces of legislation in England, Wales and Scotland, were rolled together into one piece of law, the Equality Act 2010. DAN has been disbanded but, since the March lockdown, some old members have been meeting up on Zoom - a chance to reminisce. “When you were chained to a train or bus, you had to rely on other members to keep you safe. You didn’t want the driver heading off with you still attached,” says Sue. “There’s still that really strong bond between us. It’s because we had to trust each other with our lives.” Author: Damon Rose Editor/Producer: Paul Kerley Long reads editor: Kathryn Westcott Photography: Getty Images, PA Media, Shutterstock and Emma Lynch Additional images: Sue Elsegood, David Hevey (Wanda Barbara poster), Alan Holdsworth (aka Johnny Crescendo), Barbara Lisicki,Dave Lupton(Crippen cartoons) Video: BBC News and BBC Disability Programmes Unit/Rave Productions Thanks to Alex Cowan at theNational Disability Arts Collection and Archive How the falling boys were saved The story of the Mangrove Nine Emma's long wait for a life-saving call"
"Lack of ventilator supplies 'hit' disabled peopleThe pandemic is making it hard to get medication and breathing equipment, a BBC survey suggests.UK","Fi Anderson says she only has one remaining ventilator filter, even though it should be changed daily Some disabled people in the UK have been struggling to obtain essentials such as medication and breathing equipment during the Covid pandemic, research for the BBC suggests. Some 60% of those who rely on social care told a YouGov survey they were finding it hard to obtain at least one of their necessities. Charity WellChild said people felt more ""forgotten than they ever have been"". But ministers say the needs of disabled people were being considered. The Department of Health and Social Care says it has sufficient stocks and patients should contact their local care provider. Like one in 20 of those survey respondents who receive social care, Fi Anderson, a mother of two with muscular dystrophy from Bolton in Greater Manchester, said she has faced problems obtaining breathing apparatus. Her local hospital told her to re-use the filter for her portable ventilator, recommending she boil it, because supplies were so short.

Podcast: Ouch - where real disability talk happens Views: Where now for disability rights? She ended up using a dirty filter for six months when it should be changed every day. ""I appreciate the government is in a difficult position and is trying to increase the supply, but it's not happening fast enough. It's putting us at increased risk of hospitalisation,"" she said. ""I'm scared I will end up with pneumonia from using dirty filters too long and the girls will end up without a mum."" Disabled people who rely on social care - which funds equipment and other support to allow them to live independent lives - also said they had struggled to obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks. Many of them receive funding directly to employ carers in their home, so they also need to provide them with PPE during the coronavirus crisis. The survey, which the BBC commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of the Disability Discrimination Act, asked more than 1,000 people about life in the UK with a disability and how it has changed in the shadow of a pandemic. More than 65% felt their rights had regressed, and 71% said disabled people's needs had been overlooked. What questions do you have about the DDA?

""They've struggled with the right PPE, access to their usual therapies, respite, across the board, there has been a lack of clarity for disabled people what their path should be through this pandemic."" Many of the nurses at Wellchild working with disabled children and young people who use ventilators report that they are experiencing problems with the supply of vital equipment, Ms Parker said. She said this has happened despite reassurances from the government that there would not be problems in the event of a second wave. Justin Tomlinson, minister for disabled people, defended the government's record and said it had sought to create ""good awareness"" of disability issues to ensure ""our support is inclusive"". He said the government is developing a national strategy for disabled people, which is setting challenges for each department to ""remove barriers in society and help create a more inclusive society"".

Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Prof Van Tam is all about the metaphors tonight! First, with a football reference, we were told we hadnât won the cup but we now know the keeper can be beaten. Then we were asked to imagine a cold, rainy station platform with the bright lights of a train coming down the track - but various hurdles to overcome before we could get on board. Whatever the metaphor the message is clear: the vaccine news is positive but itâs still far from a solution. And while the metaphors might be attracting some mirth on Twitter, thereâs a serious point to them too. The science can be complex. What's key is finding a way to get across the essential information in way we can all understand. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Managing expectations seems to be a key theme of the televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam are at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The prime minister says we must not âslacken our resolveâ, while Prof Van-Tam says it will not make âany differenceâ for the second wave this winter. Their message is simple â do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But todayâs announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, its ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome â and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. The prime minister is asked how distribution of the vaccine would be prioritised. He says ministers will âlook at where the doses will be most appropriately distributedâ and that âeverything flowsâ from driving down the R rate. He adds that âpeople are pulling togetherâ under the current restrictions, and that he believes they will get the R rate to below one. One journalist points out there is global excitement about the vaccine and asks the PM how confident he is that it can be delivered. The prime minister says he is âvery hopefulâ as the vaccine task force has been  âsecuring supplies for the UK for some time now"". But Jonathan Van-Tam warns that âmany thingsâ can go wrong with vaccines during manufacture. âEvery single batch has to be quality assured and released. Things can and do and have always gone wrong,â he says.
âWe have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes.â Boris Johnson says he is optimistic about the UKâs prospects for next year, but adds that he does not want to âlet people run away with the ideaâ that todayâs news is a âslam dunkâ. Jonathan Van-Tam says that there is an ""enormous mental health burdenâ on people during lockdown. âOne of the things we can do to try and make the restrictions as short as possible is to follow them to the letter,â he says. The prime minister adds a cautious note, warning it is âcrucial that we do not overdo itâ.
âWe cannot let our enthusiasm tonight run away with us, folks,â he says. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Despite todayâs positive vaccine announcement, the PM struck a deliberately cautious tone. Boris Johnson stressed that news of an effective vaccine was not yet a solution. Number 10 clearly doesnât want the suggestion of a scientific breakthrough to be any sort of green light for people to flout lockdown rules at what he described as a critical moment. The PM has been among the most optimistic â perhaps hopeful - in the past about science providing the way out of this pandemic. But the message today was, 'weâre not there yet', calling instead for the public to keep their resolve. Boris Johnson will know the political and economic difficulties facing Downing St are far from over too. Making a football reference Jonathan Van-Tam says that ""we haven't won the cup yet"", but what it ""does tell you is that the keeper can be beaten"". The deputy chief medical officer for England said we do not yet know what the vaccine breakthrough means for when we can get back to a normal life. ""Frankly weâre in the middle of the second wave and I donât see the vaccines making any difference for the wave we are now in. ""Iâm hopeful that it may prevent future waves but this one we have to battle through to the end without a vaccine. We have to keep pressing hard for now."" Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the Pfizer vaccine news is an ""important scientific breakthrough"" but warns that the message is to stand fast and not get overexcited about where we are. He says the next step will be to see safety data which he expects to see in the coming days. Van-Tam says if it does get to the stage where vaccines are authorised for use in the UK there will have to be decisions made by the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation as to who gets priotiry. This list cannot be finalised yet, he says. The prime minister is joined by Brigaidier Joe Fossey who has led the army's support for the mass testing pilot in Liverpool. Holding up a lateral flow test Brigadier Fossey says they offer the chance for more regular and rapid testing. He says: ""Our message to the people of Liverpool is clear: we are set up and ready for you to come and get tested. Please do not hesitate."" He says what they are trialling is a ""possible route out of lockdown and a way to get on with our lives"". The prime minister said that mass testing is still in its infancy and at present is no substitute for the national restrictions, social distancing and hand hygiene and ""all the rest"". ""I know it has been a hard first week of the autumn restrictions,"" he said. But Johnson added the country must get through this until 2 December when the current lockdown measures will expire and ""we plan to move forward with a tiered approach"". The prime minister says despite a vaccine being on the horizon we must continue to do everything we can to keep the R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - down. He warns that the number of Covid patients in hospital has risen to 13,000 as of 5 November, and says ""we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak"". Boris Johnson says that it is important more than ever to follow the rules but says we must hope and believe mass testing will help. He urges people in Liverpool to get tested and says ""we have tested thousands of people but there is still more to do"". Meanwhile, Joe Biden has made his first speech about coronavirus after forming a panel made up of 13 scientists to advise him as he prepares to take office. He tells Americans that regardless of how they voted in the election, they should wear masks in order to protect themselves and other citizens. ""Wear a mask, it's the single most potent weapon against the virus,"" he says. Face coverings have become politically divisive in the US. Biden says the vaccine development process must be transparent so Americans can have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine. He notes it won't be available for many months yet. ""The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. Although I'm not in office yet I'm just laying out what we expect to do and hope some of it can be done between now and the time I'm sworn in."" He adds that ""there's a need for bold action"" as cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up. His remarks contrast with many of Donald Trump's who at times underplayed the severity of the pandemic. Boris Johnson begins by saying that people are asking that ""does the progress towards a vaccine made today mean we are at the beginning of the end to our troubles"". ""We have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go,"" he says. But he adds if and when the vaccine is ready to be sued the UK is ""towards the front of the pack"" as it has already ordered 40 million doses. There will be an NHS-led vaccine programme, Johnson says. He adds he must stress that ""these are very, very early days"" and the distant toot of the scientific bugle is louder but still someway off. Prime Minister Boris Johnson begins speaking at the Downing Street news conference. Today he is joined by Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, and Brigadier Joe Fossey. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter News that the first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19 has meant vaccine conspiracy theories are being shared again on social media. For months, theyâve been spreading in local Facebook groups, on Instagram pages and in WhatsApp chats. The false claims include the baseless theory that a vaccine could be a way for Microsoft boss Bill Gates to secretly insert microchips into people â so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has debunked this particular claim in the past.Nevertheless, Bill Gatesâs name has been trending on Twitter since the announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech. Rumours have also been circulating about when the announcement happened â with the suggestion that it was deliberately timed to happen after Joe Biden was declared president-elect. Thereâs currently no evidence to support this claim. When you see these sorts of claims, remember to think about why a post was shared, how it makes you feel and to pause before passing it on. Get in touch if youâre seeing speculation like this on social media that you want me to investigate:Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Today's news that avaccine can prevent more than 90% of peoplefrom getting Covid-19 is based on preliminary analysis.

Quick Covid test could be 'breakthrough' - minister,"The UK is making ""good progress"" in developing a testing regime to reduce the quarantine period for international arrivals, the transport secretary has said. The ""test and release"" programme could allow a ""much reduced"" self-isolation period, Grant Shapps said. It is currently 14 days for many international arrivals. Mr Shapps also said rapid tests being used in Liverpool could ""open the way"" for quarantine-free air travel. He told an airport industry conference that the government aimed to launch the ""test and release"" programme after England's lockdown ends - currently due to be 2 December. ""Beyond the lockdown, this should encourage many more people to book flights with confidence knowing there is an option that allows them to shorten self isolation,"" the transport secretary said. The tests would be paid for by passengers arriving in the UK but the Department for Transport would not comment on how much they might cost. In other developments: The first effective coronavirus vaccine can preventmore than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, a preliminary analysis shows. Developers Pfizer and BioNTech described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"" Wales' 17-day firebreak lockdown has ended, meaning people can travel anywhere within the country, two households can again form a bubble and businesses that shut can now reopen Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidthe country's Covid-19 restrictions are ""highly unlikely"" to be easedwhen they are reviewed on Tuesday The coronavirus mutation causing concern in Denmarkhas arisen before in mink in the Netherlands, scientists have said - but it did not spread to humans there Mr Shapps said the government was working with other countries to help establish an ""international standard"" for self-isolation and testing to be carried out before travelling to and from the UK, to stop passengers having to quarantine on arrival in their destination country. And he said quick-turnaround tests being trialled in Liverpool gave ""some hope for optimism"" as they could ""open the way for non-quarantine air travel"". The air travel industry has beenhit hard by the drop in passenger numberssince the start of the pandemic, with airlines such as British Airways and EasyJetcutting thousands of jobs. Airline and airport groups have called on governments around the world to provide financial support for the struggling industry. Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon told the conference it was ""inconceivable"" the government had not taken more action to limit job losses across the aviation industry, adding that Mr Shapps's ""warm words"" needed ""to be translated into action"". Anyone arriving into the UK must self-isolate for 14 days unless travelling from a countrylisted by the government,external, with some exceptions for certain occupations. The mass coronavirus testing programme launched in Liverpool last week is the first trial of whole-city testing in England. All residents are being offered regular Covid-19 tests - whether or not they have symptoms. Children aged 11 and over will be tested in schoolsas part of the scheme, the city's council has said. The pilot includes amix of existing swab tests and the new lateral flow tests- which can provide a result within an hour without the need to use a lab. Testing a whole city for Covid: How will it work? Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? Earlier, Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast the new ""lateral flow"" test was available to everyone in Liverpool and could be a ""major breakthrough"" if successful. ""A test is only as good as the speed with which you can turn a result around,"" he said. ""What we've really been focusing on more recently is a faster test, so that people can act more quickly to prevent the spread of the virus so this, if we can make it work, is a major breakthrough."" BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher said rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests neededhigh levels of the virus in the body to work. It is not yet clear how good they are at catching people in the early stages of the infection, when the virus is still taking hold. They are similar to pregnancy tests and are easy, cheap and fast. Fluid from a nasal swab or saliva goes on to one end of the test, then a marking appears if the person is positive. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? QUARANTINE:Who must self-isolate after arriving in the UK? The prime minister said last month that he shared ""people's frustrations"" at the turnaround times for results, following criticism of England's test-and-trace system. Mr Johnson's comments came after figures for the week ending 14 October showed that just 15.1% of people who were tested received their result within 24 hours. Last week, the government said it had hit its target of having the capacity tocarry out 500,000 coronavirus tests a day across the UK by the end of October. The data for 31 October showed just over 525,000 tests could be done - a doubling of capacity in two months. However, just under 300,000 tests were actually carried out. Mr Johnson previously said mass testing had""the potential to be a powerful new weapon in our fight against Covid-19"". However, some health experts have criticised the Liverpool trial, with Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, warning that plans to test asymptomatic people went against advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to prioritise tests for those displaying symptoms. Meanwhile on Sunday, another156 people in the UK were reported to have diedwithin 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, with a further 20,572 cases of the virus.

There have been a further 21,350 cases of coronavirus across the UK and a further 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test.

Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Prof Van Tam is all about the metaphors tonight! First, with a football reference, we were told we hadnât won the cup but we now know the keeper can be beaten. Then we were asked to imagine a cold, rainy station platform with the bright lights of a train coming down the track - but various hurdles to overcome before we could get on board. Whatever the metaphor the message is clear: the vaccine news is positive but itâs still far from a solution. And while the metaphors might be attracting some mirth on Twitter, thereâs a serious point to them too. The science can be complex. What's key is finding a way to get across the essential information in way we can all understand. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Managing expectations seems to be a key theme of the televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam are at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The prime minister says we must not âslacken our resolveâ, while Prof Van-Tam says it will not make âany differenceâ for the second wave this winter. Their message is simple â do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But todayâs announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, its ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome â and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. The prime minister is asked how distribution of the vaccine would be prioritised. He says ministers will âlook at where the doses will be most appropriately distributedâ and that âeverything flowsâ from driving down the R rate. He adds that âpeople are pulling togetherâ under the current restrictions, and that he believes they will get the R rate to below one. One journalist points out there is global excitement about the vaccine and asks the PM how confident he is that it can be delivered. The prime minister says he is âvery hopefulâ as the vaccine task force has been  âsecuring supplies for the UK for some time now"". But Jonathan Van-Tam warns that âmany thingsâ can go wrong with vaccines during manufacture. âEvery single batch has to be quality assured and released. Things can and do and have always gone wrong,â he says.
âWe have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes.â Boris Johnson says he is optimistic about the UKâs prospects for next year, but adds that he does not want to âlet people run away with the ideaâ that todayâs news is a âslam dunkâ. Jonathan Van-Tam says that there is an ""enormous mental health burdenâ on people during lockdown. âOne of the things we can do to try and make the restrictions as short as possible is to follow them to the letter,â he says. The prime minister adds a cautious note, warning it is âcrucial that we do not overdo itâ.
âWe cannot let our enthusiasm tonight run away with us, folks,â he says. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Despite todayâs positive vaccine announcement, the PM struck a deliberately cautious tone. Boris Johnson stressed that news of an effective vaccine was not yet a solution. Number 10 clearly doesnât want the suggestion of a scientific breakthrough to be any sort of green light for people to flout lockdown rules at what he described as a critical moment. The PM has been among the most optimistic â perhaps hopeful - in the past about science providing the way out of this pandemic. But the message today was, 'weâre not there yet', calling instead for the public to keep their resolve. Boris Johnson will know the political and economic difficulties facing Downing St are far from over too. Making a football reference Jonathan Van-Tam says that ""we haven't won the cup yet"", but what it ""does tell you is that the keeper can be beaten"". The deputy chief medical officer for England said we do not yet know what the vaccine breakthrough means for when we can get back to a normal life. ""Frankly weâre in the middle of the second wave and I donât see the vaccines making any difference for the wave we are now in. ""Iâm hopeful that it may prevent future waves but this one we have to battle through to the end without a vaccine. We have to keep pressing hard for now."" Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the Pfizer vaccine news is an ""important scientific breakthrough"" but warns that the message is to stand fast and not get overexcited about where we are. He says the next step will be to see safety data which he expects to see in the coming days. Van-Tam says if it does get to the stage where vaccines are authorised for use in the UK there will have to be decisions made by the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation as to who gets priotiry. This list cannot be finalised yet, he says. The prime minister is joined by Brigaidier Joe Fossey who has led the army's support for the mass testing pilot in Liverpool. Holding up a lateral flow test Brigadier Fossey says they offer the chance for more regular and rapid testing. He says: ""Our message to the people of Liverpool is clear: we are set up and ready for you to come and get tested. Please do not hesitate."" He says what they are trialling is a ""possible route out of lockdown and a way to get on with our lives"". The prime minister said that mass testing is still in its infancy and at present is no substitute for the national restrictions, social distancing and hand hygiene and ""all the rest"". ""I know it has been a hard first week of the autumn restrictions,"" he said. But Johnson added the country must get through this until 2 December when the current lockdown measures will expire and ""we plan to move forward with a tiered approach"". The prime minister says despite a vaccine being on the horizon we must continue to do everything we can to keep the R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - down. He warns that the number of Covid patients in hospital has risen to 13,000 as of 5 November, and says ""we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak"". Boris Johnson says that it is important more than ever to follow the rules but says we must hope and believe mass testing will help. He urges people in Liverpool to get tested and says ""we have tested thousands of people but there is still more to do"". Meanwhile, Joe Biden has made his first speech about coronavirus after forming a panel made up of 13 scientists to advise him as he prepares to take office. He tells Americans that regardless of how they voted in the election, they should wear masks in order to protect themselves and other citizens. ""Wear a mask, it's the single most potent weapon against the virus,"" he says. Face coverings have become politically divisive in the US. Biden says the vaccine development process must be transparent so Americans can have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine. He notes it won't be available for many months yet. ""The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. Although I'm not in office yet I'm just laying out what we expect to do and hope some of it can be done between now and the time I'm sworn in."" He adds that ""there's a need for bold action"" as cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up. His remarks contrast with many of Donald Trump's who at times underplayed the severity of the pandemic. Boris Johnson begins by saying that people are asking that ""does the progress towards a vaccine made today mean we are at the beginning of the end to our troubles"". ""We have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go,"" he says. But he adds if and when the vaccine is ready to be sued the UK is ""towards the front of the pack"" as it has already ordered 40 million doses. There will be an NHS-led vaccine programme, Johnson says. He adds he must stress that ""these are very, very early days"" and the distant toot of the scientific bugle is louder but still someway off. Prime Minister Boris Johnson begins speaking at the Downing Street news conference. Today he is joined by Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, and Brigadier Joe Fossey. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter News that the first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19 has meant vaccine conspiracy theories are being shared again on social media. For months, theyâve been spreading in local Facebook groups, on Instagram pages and in WhatsApp chats. The false claims include the baseless theory that a vaccine could be a way for Microsoft boss Bill Gates to secretly insert microchips into people â so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has debunked this particular claim in the past.Nevertheless, Bill Gatesâs name has been trending on Twitter since the announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech. Rumours have also been circulating about when the announcement happened â with the suggestion that it was deliberately timed to happen after Joe Biden was declared president-elect. Thereâs currently no evidence to support this claim. When you see these sorts of claims, remember to think about why a post was shared, how it makes you feel and to pause before passing it on. Get in touch if youâre seeing speculation like this on social media that you want me to investigate:Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Today's news that avaccine can prevent more than 90% of peoplefrom getting Covid-19 is based on preliminary analysis.

Lack of ventilator supplies 'hit' disabled people,"Fi Anderson says she only has one remaining ventilator filter, even though it should be changed daily Some disabled people in the UK have been struggling to obtain essentials such as medication and breathing equipment during the Covid pandemic, research for the BBC suggests. Some 60% of those who rely on social care told a YouGov survey they were finding it hard to obtain at least one of their necessities. Charity WellChild said people felt more ""forgotten than they ever have been"". But ministers say the needs of disabled people were being considered. The Department of Health and Social Care says it has sufficient stocks and patients should contact their local care provider. Like one in 20 of those survey respondents who receive social care, Fi Anderson, a mother of two with muscular dystrophy from Bolton in Greater Manchester, said she has faced problems obtaining breathing apparatus. Her local hospital told her to re-use the filter for her portable ventilator, recommending she boil it, because supplies were so short.

Podcast: Ouch - where real disability talk happens Views: Where now for disability rights? She ended up using a dirty filter for six months when it should be changed every day. ""I appreciate the government is in a difficult position and is trying to increase the supply, but it's not happening fast enough. It's putting us at increased risk of hospitalisation,"" she said. ""I'm scared I will end up with pneumonia from using dirty filters too long and the girls will end up without a mum."" Disabled people who rely on social care - which funds equipment and other support to allow them to live independent lives - also said they had struggled to obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks. Many of them receive funding directly to employ carers in their home, so they also need to provide them with PPE during the coronavirus crisis. The survey, which the BBC commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of the Disability Discrimination Act, asked more than 1,000 people about life in the UK with a disability and how it has changed in the shadow of a pandemic. More than 65% felt their rights had regressed, and 71% said disabled people's needs had been overlooked. What questions do you have about the DDA?

According tothe latest figures from the Office for National Statistics,external, nearly six out of 10 deaths from Covid-19 were of disabled people. Tara Parker, director of programmes at WellChild, criticised the government for failing to recognise the needs of disabled people. She said: ""It's a complete lack of contingency planning and thought about disabled people and their families. ""They've struggled with the right PPE, access to their usual therapies, respite, across the board, there has been a lack of clarity for disabled people what their path should be through this pandemic."" Many of the nurses at Wellchild working with disabled children and young people who use ventilators report that they are experiencing problems with the supply of vital equipment, Ms Parker said. She said this has happened despite reassurances from the government that there would not be problems in the event of a second wave. Justin Tomlinson, minister for disabled people, defended the government's record and said it had sought to create ""good awareness"" of disability issues to ensure ""our support is inclusive"". He said the government is developing a national strategy for disabled people, which is setting challenges for each department to ""remove barriers in society and help create a more inclusive society"".

UK-EU trade talks to resume in London,"Michel Barnier (right) is returning to London for the talks with Lord Frost EU and UK officials have resumed trade talks in London at the start of another key week for the negotiations. They are trying to bridge what the two sides have said are still significant differences on fishing quotas and competition issues. Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the ""outlines"" of an agreement were clear and a deal was ""there to be done"". But he has insisted the UK is prepared to leave the single market and customs union on 31 December without agreement. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart Lord Frost are in a race against the clock to conclude a future economic partnership in time for it to come into force when the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The UK left the EU on 31 January but continues to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year. If there is no agreement at that point, trade between the two will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules - with tariffs set to be introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs for firms and consumers. Brexit will be 'brutal' for UK, warns ex-PM Major What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? How many trade deals has the UK done? Has US election slowed down Brexit negotiations? Both sides say they want to avoid this although the EU has said it will not do a deal ""at any price"". The UK has said it is prepared to accept what it calls ""Australian terms"" - which it conceives as limited sector-by-sector agreements mirroring those the EU currently has with Australia.  But it would mean the UK would largely be trading on WTO rules. Mr Johnson told the Associated Press on Sunday that a more comprehensive deal on trade in all goods and services, based on the EU's agreement with Canada, was ""there to be done"". ""I've always been a great enthusiast for a trade deal with our European friends and partners,"" he said.""The broad outlines are pretty clear, we just need to get on and do it if we can."" Following a phone call with Mr Johnson on Saturday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said some progress had been made in recent weeks after the EU agreed to discuss specific legal texts. But she said ""large differences"" remained over the question of access to British fishing waters from 2021 and regulations on workers' rights, environmental protection, and state aid designed to maintain a ""level-playing field"". Ahead of his visit to London,Mr Barnier tweeted,externalthat any deal must ""respect the interests and values of the EU and its 27 member states"". The meeting comes as the House of Lords look likely to vote down controversial clauses in the government's Internal Market Bill. The clauses would give ministers powers to override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement reached with the EU, including obligations on state aid rules. Government's Brexit plan gets MPs' final backing Gove stands by Brexit bill after EU concerns What is the row over 'internal markets' all about? US President-elect Joe Biden has previously been openly critical of the bill, fearing it could lead to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - and has warned this could be a deal-breaker for any US-UK trade deal. Speaking to the BBC, Environment Secretary George Eustice said the bill was ""all about protecting peace and stability"" arguing that it ensured Northern Ireland businesses have ""unfettered access to GB markets"". But Conservative peer Michael Howard is opposed to the bill, alongside Labour's Charlie Falconer, who told BBC News the government should ""stop digging"". He argued that the bill, would push the EU into having to close the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland to protect the bloc's single market. Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney described Mr Biden as ""a real friend of Ireland"" and added that his election would give Downing Street ""pause for thought... to ensure that the Irish issues are prioritised as we try to close out this phase of the Brexit negotiation"". While Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC a Biden presidency would bring ""a degree of clarity"" to the Brexit talks. He said UK-EU negotiations would be helped by Mr Biden's clear stance on the Northern Ireland peace process. On Monday the prime minister announced that he was establishing a new Office for Investment to encourage investors to do business in a post-Brexit UK. ""Our departure from the European Union is not and has never been about walling our islands off from the outside world, rather, it is about building bridges to friends, allies and trading partners old and new in every corner of every continent"" he wrote in aLinkedIn article,external. He said the Office for Investment would be ""a targeted, agile organisation designed for the fast-moving society in which we now live, and a great big flashing neon sign that advertises both our openness to the world and our desire to do business with it.""

UK's nuclear future to be decided at key meeting,"Nuclear power's role in the UK's future energy strategy will be discussed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson with  the chancellor and business secretary at a meeting this month. It comes ahead of a new 10-point plan for the UK to hit net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The report is expected to be published next week. The government insists it remains committed to the construction of new nuclear power stations. They are part of an overall strategy to decarbonise the UK's electricity supply. The trilateral meeting between Number 10, Number 11 and the Business Department will discuss what form that should take. New nuclear plant at Sizewell set for green light Nature reserve fears impact of nuclear plant The nuclear battle on the Suffolk coast Of the six sites originally identified a decade ago, three have seen contractors pull out and only one is under construction - at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The government is not expected to explicitly single out which project will get the go-ahead, but officials told the BBC that Sizewell in Suffolk is the only project ready to go if the government is to hit a target of starting construction of new nuclear within this parliament. The Stop Sizewell C campaign projected images onto the Beis building ahead of the meeting While there is strong union support for the transfer of jobs skills and new opportunities from Somerset to Suffolk,there is considerable local resistanceto a massive construction project, which activists say will pose an ecological threat to important local wildlife areas. The government is also considering bringing forward a ban on new petrol and diesel engines from its current official target of 2040, to 2035 or earlier. It's thought the new time frame will be somewhere between 2030 and 2034. The 10-point plan is also expected to include: New investment in technology to capture carbon at the point fossil fuels are burnt Research into how hydrogen can replace fossil fuels A significant expansion of the role of offshore wind Turbines at Blyth Offshore Demonstrator Wind Farm built by EDF Its also expected that the government will set a new target for heating homes with ground-source heat pumps. The replacement of 25 million gas boilers in UK homes is recognised as one of the hardest parts of the move to net zero carbon by 2050. Although many energy industry experts remain sceptical that small nuclear reactors can play a significant role, the BBC understands that the government has big ambitions to progress this technology, and that it will form an important part of the government's long term plans.

Here's a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the UK and around the world this evening: And following the Downing Street conference thelatest coronavirus figures,externalhave been released. There have been a further 21,350 cases of coronavirus across the UK and a further 194 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. That takes the total number of deaths by this measure to 49,063. The figures tend to be lower on a Monday as there is a lag in reporting over the weekend. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky says he has tested positive for Covid-19 but that he ""feels fine"". Writing on Twitter, the 42-year-old said he would go into self-isolation and would continue to work. ""It's gonna be fine,"" he posted. The former comedian-turned-politician joins other world leaders who contracted coronavirus, including Donald Trump in the US, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro.

Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Prof Van Tam is all about the metaphors tonight! First, with a football reference, we were told we hadnât won the cup but we now know the keeper can be beaten. Then we were asked to imagine a cold, rainy station platform with the bright lights of a train coming down the track - but various hurdles to overcome before we could get on board. Whatever the metaphor the message is clear: the vaccine news is positive but itâs still far from a solution. And while the metaphors might be attracting some mirth on Twitter, thereâs a serious point to them too. The science can be complex. What's key is finding a way to get across the essential information in way we can all understand. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Managing expectations seems to be a key theme of the televised briefing. Both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Englandâs deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam are at pains to inject a bit of realism into some of the euphoria over the vaccine news. The prime minister says we must not âslacken our resolveâ, while Prof Van-Tam says it will not make âany differenceâ for the second wave this winter. Their message is simple â do not drop your guard against the virus. It is easy to understand why. The world has been waiting so long for positive vaccine news. But todayâs announcement is just the first hurdle of many. Safety has still to be proved, its ability to stop transmission rather than just prevent disease is not yet known, how long immunity lasts is uncertain and whether it works with older people is still to be confirmed. Other regulatory hurdles will have to be overcome â and that is before we even think about manufacture and distribution. The prime minister is asked how distribution of the vaccine would be prioritised. He says ministers will âlook at where the doses will be most appropriately distributedâ and that âeverything flowsâ from driving down the R rate. He adds that âpeople are pulling togetherâ under the current restrictions, and that he believes they will get the R rate to below one. One journalist points out there is global excitement about the vaccine and asks the PM how confident he is that it can be delivered. The prime minister says he is âvery hopefulâ as the vaccine task force has been  âsecuring supplies for the UK for some time now"". But Jonathan Van-Tam warns that âmany thingsâ can go wrong with vaccines during manufacture. âEvery single batch has to be quality assured and released. Things can and do and have always gone wrong,â he says.
âWe have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes.â Boris Johnson says he is optimistic about the UKâs prospects for next year, but adds that he does not want to âlet people run away with the ideaâ that todayâs news is a âslam dunkâ. Jonathan Van-Tam says that there is an ""enormous mental health burdenâ on people during lockdown. âOne of the things we can do to try and make the restrictions as short as possible is to follow them to the letter,â he says. The prime minister adds a cautious note, warning it is âcrucial that we do not overdo itâ.
âWe cannot let our enthusiasm tonight run away with us, folks,â he says. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Despite todayâs positive vaccine announcement, the PM struck a deliberately cautious tone. Boris Johnson stressed that news of an effective vaccine was not yet a solution. Number 10 clearly doesnât want the suggestion of a scientific breakthrough to be any sort of green light for people to flout lockdown rules at what he described as a critical moment. The PM has been among the most optimistic â perhaps hopeful - in the past about science providing the way out of this pandemic. But the message today was, 'weâre not there yet', calling instead for the public to keep their resolve. Boris Johnson will know the political and economic difficulties facing Downing St are far from over too. Making a football reference Jonathan Van-Tam says that ""we haven't won the cup yet"", but what it ""does tell you is that the keeper can be beaten"". The deputy chief medical officer for England said we do not yet know what the vaccine breakthrough means for when we can get back to a normal life. ""Frankly weâre in the middle of the second wave and I donât see the vaccines making any difference for the wave we are now in. ""Iâm hopeful that it may prevent future waves but this one we have to battle through to the end without a vaccine. We have to keep pressing hard for now."" Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, says the Pfizer vaccine news is an ""important scientific breakthrough"" but warns that the message is to stand fast and not get overexcited about where we are. He says the next step will be to see safety data which he expects to see in the coming days. Van-Tam says if it does get to the stage where vaccines are authorised for use in the UK there will have to be decisions made by the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation as to who gets priotiry. This list cannot be finalised yet, he says. The prime minister is joined by Brigaidier Joe Fossey who has led the army's support for the mass testing pilot in Liverpool. Holding up a lateral flow test Brigadier Fossey says they offer the chance for more regular and rapid testing. He says: ""Our message to the people of Liverpool is clear: we are set up and ready for you to come and get tested. Please do not hesitate."" He says what they are trialling is a ""possible route out of lockdown and a way to get on with our lives"". The prime minister said that mass testing is still in its infancy and at present is no substitute for the national restrictions, social distancing and hand hygiene and ""all the rest"". ""I know it has been a hard first week of the autumn restrictions,"" he said. But Johnson added the country must get through this until 2 December when the current lockdown measures will expire and ""we plan to move forward with a tiered approach"". The prime minister says despite a vaccine being on the horizon we must continue to do everything we can to keep the R number - the rate at which the virus spreads - down. He warns that the number of Covid patients in hospital has risen to 13,000 as of 5 November, and says ""we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak"". Boris Johnson says that it is important more than ever to follow the rules but says we must hope and believe mass testing will help. He urges people in Liverpool to get tested and says ""we have tested thousands of people but there is still more to do"". Meanwhile, Joe Biden has made his first speech about coronavirus after forming a panel made up of 13 scientists to advise him as he prepares to take office. He tells Americans that regardless of how they voted in the election, they should wear masks in order to protect themselves and other citizens. ""Wear a mask, it's the single most potent weapon against the virus,"" he says. Face coverings have become politically divisive in the US. Biden says the vaccine development process must be transparent so Americans can have confidence in the Covid-19 vaccine. He notes it won't be available for many months yet. ""The challenge before us right now is still immense and growing. Although I'm not in office yet I'm just laying out what we expect to do and hope some of it can be done between now and the time I'm sworn in."" He adds that ""there's a need for bold action"" as cases, hospitalisations and deaths are all going up. His remarks contrast with many of Donald Trump's who at times underplayed the severity of the pandemic. Boris Johnson begins by saying that people are asking that ""does the progress towards a vaccine made today mean we are at the beginning of the end to our troubles"". ""We have cleared one significant hurdle but there are several more to go,"" he says. But he adds if and when the vaccine is ready to be sued the UK is ""towards the front of the pack"" as it has already ordered 40 million doses. There will be an NHS-led vaccine programme, Johnson says. He adds he must stress that ""these are very, very early days"" and the distant toot of the scientific bugle is louder but still someway off. Prime Minister Boris Johnson begins speaking at the Downing Street news conference. Today he is joined by Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, and Brigadier Joe Fossey. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter News that the first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19 has meant vaccine conspiracy theories are being shared again on social media. For months, theyâve been spreading in local Facebook groups, on Instagram pages and in WhatsApp chats. The false claims include the baseless theory that a vaccine could be a way for Microsoft boss Bill Gates to secretly insert microchips into people â so they can be tracked. BBC Reality Check has debunked this particular claim in the past.Nevertheless, Bill Gatesâs name has been trending on Twitter since the announcement from Pfizer and BioNTech. Rumours have also been circulating about when the announcement happened â with the suggestion that it was deliberately timed to happen after Joe Biden was declared president-elect. Thereâs currently no evidence to support this claim. When you see these sorts of claims, remember to think about why a post was shared, how it makes you feel and to pause before passing it on. Get in touch if youâre seeing speculation like this on social media that you want me to investigate:Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk Today's news that avaccine can prevent more than 90% of peoplefrom getting Covid-19 is based on preliminary analysis. There's still a way to go before any vaccine can be given to the wider public and our lives can go back to how they were pre-pandemic. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps puts this news into context. This video can not be played Covid vaccine: what does the Pfizer vaccine news mean? Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to host a Downing Street news conference shortly. It follows today's news that the company behind a vaccine trial has said it is 90% effective against the virus.

'Biden Bounce' sees Japan shares hit 29-year highShares across Asia have seen healthy gains with the race for the White House finally over.Business,"Shares around the world have seen healthy gains with the race for the White House finally over Global markets have rallied in response to Saturday's declaration that Joe Biden has won the US election. The end of uncertainty about the race's outcome saw London's FTSE 100 rise 1.5% to 5,994.58 points in early trade, with similar gains seen across Europe. Asian shares also jumped, with Japan's Nikkei 225 climbing 2.1% to 24,839.84 - it's highest level since 1991. There were similar gains in Australia, China and Hong Kong while oil and currency markets also climbed. Donald Trump has yet to concede and Mr Biden's win remains a projection as key states are still counting votes. However, the Democrat is forging ahead with his plans for assuming power in January after major US networks called the election in his favour on Saturday. Randeep Somel, director of global equities at M&G, told the BBC: ""First and foremost it looks as if the uncertainty of who is going to be the president is going away, with world leaders coming out and openly congratulating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. ""I think the markets can focus now on the policies that Joe Biden is likely to enact going forward as opposed to this constant, 'is it going to be litigious? Are we looking at another potential Bush-Gore event like we saw in 2000, where it took 6-7 weeks to realise what was going to happen."" How will Joe Biden change US trade relations? Joe Biden pushes forward with plans for office US election results in maps and charts Mr Biden has already said he will reverse many Trump era policies, including rejoining the Paris Climate agreement on his first day in office in January. There are also hopes that the new administration will expand fiscal stimulus in the US and widen measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19. However, Mr Biden could struggle to enact key planks of his agenda as its looks unlikely the Democrats with have control of both houses in Congress. This means the Senate may be able to block any big regulatory or tax policies, a plus for some businesses. This video can not be played Biden and Harris call for unity in victory speeches In China, the main shares benchmark - the Shanghai Composite - rose almost 2% on Monday, as investors viewed the Biden win as positive for trade and technology policy. Relations between Donald Trump and China deteriorated during his four-year tenure, sparking a tariff war in 2018 that imposed taxes on imported goods from both countries. ""The market is taking the Biden win as a positive, as he is not very likely to fight a new trade war with China. The chance for a new tech war is also drifting lower,"" said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie bank. Bruce Pang, an economist at Hong-Kong based China Renaissance, agreed: ""We think the Chinese authorities might be betting on a less confrontational but more predictable Biden administration that they can work with."" The best performer in Asia was Japan's Nikkei 225, which hit a near 30-year high - although the index remains well below the highs of the late 1980s. Alongside the election result, strong earnings from Japanese car makers such as Toyota were credited for the gains. ""The Nikkei 225 is breaking out and is a poster child of strength and momentum,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokers Pepperstone. However, it was a different story at Japan Airlines, which saw its shares sink after saying it would raise as much as 168bn yen (Â£1.2bn) by selling new shares to support its finances during the coronavirus crisis.

Virgin Hyperloop tests first passenger journeys,"Trial passengers Sara Luchian and Josh Giegel - who both work at Virgin Hyperloop - inside their pod Virgin Hyperloop has trialled its first ever journey with passengers, in the desert of Nevada. The futuristic transport concept involves pods inside vacuum tubes carrying passengers at high speeds. In the trial, two passengers - both company staff - travelled the length of a 500m test track in 15 seconds, reaching 107mph (172km/h). However, this is a fraction of Virgin's ambitions for travel speeds of more than 1,000km/h. Virgin Hyperloop is not the only firm developing the concept but nobody has carried passengers before. Sara Luchian, director of customer experience, was one of the two on board and described the experience as ""exhilarating both psychologically and physically"" to the BBC shortly after the event. She and chief technology officer Josh Giegel wore simple fleeces and jeans rather than flights suits for the event, which took place on Sunday afternoon outside of Las Vegas. Ms Luchian said the journey was smooth and ""not at all like a rollercoaster"" although the acceleration was ""zippier"" than it would be with a longer track. Neither of them felt sick, she added. She said that their speed was hampered by the length of the track and acceleration required. The Virgin Hyperloop test track in the Nevada desert The concept, which has spent years in development,builds on a proposal by Tesla founder Elon Musk. Some critics have described it as science fiction. It is based on the world's fastest magnetic levitation (maglev) trains, then made faster by speeding along inside vacuum tubes. TheMaglev train speed world record was set in 2015when a Japanese train reached 374mph in a test run near Mount Fuji. Founded in 2014, Virgin Hyperloop received investment from the Virgin Group in 2017. It was previously known as Hyperloop One and Virgin Hyperloop One. In a BBC interview in 2018, then Virgin Hyperloop One boss Rob Lloyd, who has since left the firm, said the speed would in theory enable people to travel between Gatwick and Heathrow airports, 45 miles apart on opposite sides of London, in four minutes. Virgin says the pods could reach speeds of over 1,000km/h Los Angeles-based Virgin Hyperloop is also exploring concepts in other countries, includinga hypothetical 12 minute connection between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, which takes more than an hour by existing public transport. Critics have pointed out that Hyperloop travel systems would involve the considerable undertaking of both getting planning permission and then constructing vast networks of tubes for every travel path. Ms Luchian acknowledges the potential difficulties, saying: ""Of course there's a lot of infrastructure to be built but I think we've mitigated a lot of risk that people didn't think was possible."" She added: ""Infrastructure is such an important focus for so many people in government. We know people are looking for solutions. They're looking for the transportation of the future. We can keep building today's or yesterday's transport systems and keep encountering the same problems they bring or we can really look to build something that solves those problems.""

Medical supplies for disabled people 'hit' by Covid,"Fi Anderson says she only has one remaining ventilator filter, even though it should be changed daily Some disabled people in the UK have been struggling to obtain essentials such as medication and breathing equipment during the Covid pandemic, research for the BBC suggests. Some 60% of those who rely on social care told a YouGov survey they were finding it hard to obtain at least one of their necessities. Charity WellChild said people felt more ""forgotten than they ever have been"". But ministers say the needs of disabled people were being considered. The Department of Health and Social Care says it has sufficient stocks and patients should contact their local care provider. Like one in 20 of those survey respondents who receive social care, Fi Anderson, a mother of two with muscular dystrophy from Bolton in Greater Manchester, said she has faced problems obtaining breathing apparatus. Her local hospital told her to re-use the filter for her portable ventilator, recommending she boil it, because supplies were so short.

Podcast: Ouch - where real disability talk happens Views: Where now for disability rights? She ended up using a dirty filter for six months when it should be changed every day. ""I appreciate the government is in a difficult position and is trying to increase the supply, but it's not happening fast enough. It's putting us at increased risk of hospitalisation,"" she said. ""I'm scared I will end up with pneumonia from using dirty filters too long and the girls will end up without a mum."" Disabled people who rely on social care - which funds equipment and other support to allow them to live independent lives - also said they had struggled to obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks. Many of them receive funding directly to employ carers in their home, so they also need to provide them with PPE during the coronavirus crisis. The survey, which the BBC commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of the Disability Discrimination Act, asked more than 1,000 people about life in the UK with a disability and how it has changed in the shadow of a pandemic. More than 65% felt their rights had regressed, and 71% said disabled people's needs had been overlooked. What questions do you have about the DDA?

According tothe latest figures from the Office for National Statistics,external, nearly six out of 10 deaths from Covid-19 were of disabled people. Tara Parker, director of programmes at WellChild, criticised the government for failing to recognise the needs of disabled people. She said: ""It's a complete lack of contingency planning and thought about disabled people and their families. ""They've struggled with the right PPE, access to their usual therapies, respite, across the board, there has been a lack of clarity for disabled people what their path should be through this pandemic."" Many of the nurses at Wellchild working with disabled children and young people who use ventilators report that they are experiencing problems with the supply of vital equipment, Ms Parker said. She said this has happened despite reassurances from the government that there would not be problems in the event of a second wave. Justin Tomlinson, minister for disabled people, defended the government's record and said it had sought to create ""good awareness"" of disability issues to ensure ""our support is inclusive"". He said the government is developing a national strategy for disabled people, which is setting challenges for each department to ""remove barriers in society and help create a more inclusive society"".

'Biden Bounce' sees Japan shares hit 29-year high,"Shares around the world have seen healthy gains with the race for the White House finally over Global markets have rallied in response to Saturday's declaration that Joe Biden has won the US election. The end of uncertainty about the race's outcome saw London's FTSE 100 rise 1.5% to 5,994.58 points in early trade, with similar gains seen across Europe. Asian shares also jumped, with Japan's Nikkei 225 climbing 2.1% to 24,839.84 - it's highest level since 1991. There were similar gains in Australia, China and Hong Kong while oil and currency markets also climbed. Donald Trump has yet to concede and Mr Biden's win remains a projection as key states are still counting votes. However, the Democrat is forging ahead with his plans for assuming power in January after major US networks called the election in his favour on Saturday. Randeep Somel, director of global equities at M&G, told the BBC: ""First and foremost it looks as if the uncertainty of who is going to be the president is going away, with world leaders coming out and openly congratulating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. ""I think the markets can focus now on the policies that Joe Biden is likely to enact going forward as opposed to this constant, 'is it going to be litigious? Are we looking at another potential Bush-Gore event like we saw in 2000, where it took 6-7 weeks to realise what was going to happen."" How will Joe Biden change US trade relations? Joe Biden pushes forward with plans for office US election results in maps and charts Mr Biden has already said he will reverse many Trump era policies, including rejoining the Paris Climate agreement on his first day in office in January. There are also hopes that the new administration will expand fiscal stimulus in the US and widen measures to reduce the spread of Covid-19. However, Mr Biden could struggle to enact key planks of his agenda as its looks unlikely the Democrats with have control of both houses in Congress. This means the Senate may be able to block any big regulatory or tax policies, a plus for some businesses. This video can not be played Biden and Harris call for unity in victory speeches In China, the main shares benchmark - the Shanghai Composite - rose almost 2% on Monday, as investors viewed the Biden win as positive for trade and technology policy. Relations between Donald Trump and China deteriorated during his four-year tenure, sparking a tariff war in 2018 that imposed taxes on imported goods from both countries. ""The market is taking the Biden win as a positive, as he is not very likely to fight a new trade war with China. The chance for a new tech war is also drifting lower,"" said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie bank. Bruce Pang, an economist at Hong-Kong based China Renaissance, agreed: ""We think the Chinese authorities might be betting on a less confrontational but more predictable Biden administration that they can work with."" The best performer in Asia was Japan's Nikkei 225, which hit a near 30-year high - although the index remains well below the highs of the late 1980s. Alongside the election result, strong earnings from Japanese car makers such as Toyota were credited for the gains. ""The Nikkei 225 is breaking out and is a poster child of strength and momentum,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokers Pepperstone. However, it was a different story at Japan Airlines, which saw its shares sink after saying it would raise as much as 168bn yen (Â£1.2bn) by selling new shares to support its finances during the coronavirus crisis.

Cafes and restaurants 'to reopen with no alcohol',"Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Ireland closed their doors to sit-in customers in mid-October The NI Executive has failed to reach a decision on whether to extend or change Covid-19 restrictions regarding the hospitality sector. Ministers held a series of meetings throughout Monday but were unable to agree what steps to take. One option being considered would be to allow cafes to open but licensed premises would remain closed. It is understood hairdressers and beauticians would be allowed to open with certain restrictions in place. Ten further coronavirus-related deaths were reported by Stormont's Department of Health on Monday, along with 471 more cases. Of the 10 deaths, nine occurred within the most recent 24-hour reporting period, while one happened prior to it. In the Republic of Ireland, one further coronavirus-related death was reported on Monday and there have been 270 new confirmed cases. The Republic's death toll now stands at 1,948 since the pandemic began and a total of 65,659 cases of the disease have been diagnosed. Pubs, restaurants and cafes across Northern Irelandclosed their doors to sit-in customers on Friday 16 October under stricter Covid-19 restrictions. Hair and beauty salons also had to shut for four weeks. The first minister had said the current coronavirus restrictions would end at midnight on Thursday. It had been expected that ministers were going to agree a partial reopening of the sector, allowing restaurants to open but unable to serve booze and keeping alcohol-only pubs shut for another fortnight. On Sunday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neillsaid the sale of alcohol was a factor in reaching a decision because ""defences come down when alcohol is taken"". Ms O'Neill said cafes and coffee shops were a different matter. In other coronavirus developments on Monday: Health Minister Robin Swann has welcomed thenews about a vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTechand says there is apossibility that vaccination of at-risk people in NI could begin by the end of this year Millcroft Care Home in Enniskillen says six of his residents have now died after contracting the virus. Twenty-one residents have tested positive - three are still in hospital - and 12 staff have been affected.News of the outbreakfirst emerged at the weekend. Police say they have now issued 1,983 penalty notices (fines) in NI since March and 48 Â£1,000 fines for people who have failed to self-isolate. Five hundred premises - 86 commercial and 414 private - have received prohibition notices 561 PSNI staff are currently absent from duty because of coronavirus - 477 of them are in self-isolation. Ms O'Neill said the executive was looking at reopening some areas of the hospitality industry Belfast restaurant owner Michael Deane said he was appalled at the idea not to allow premises to serve alcohol, He appealed to the executive to ""stop making us the bogeyman"". He told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that his business had lost close to Â£2m. ""I think they should just tell us to close until this is all over, fund the hospitality business and leave it at that,"" he added. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill urged the first and deputy first ministers to ""make the right call to save thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses"" by allowing licensed premises to reopen on 13 November. ""We really need the executive to make sure that the focus is on getting the entire hospitality sector back up and running again this Friday to save a significant amount of jobs and businesses,"" he said. ""We now face a really important part of the year and although we are live to the fact that this will be an extremely challenging trading period, we need to have the doors open. ""Hundreds of businesses are struggling and now in debt as they try to keep staff in the face of mounting bills and a lack of financial aid from the government, which covers very little in reality."" Hair and beauty salons also had to shut for four weeks on 17 October Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, urged ministers to reconsider their decision to give businesses ""a fighting chance"" to remain open. Speaking to Good Morning Ulster, he said: ""Suggesting that alcohol will not be allowed to be sold in premises is one which no logic or evidence has been offered for, and would suggest there is a lack of understanding around the viability of businesses like restaurants."" He said he has spoken to many businesses that do not believe it will be viable to open with the new restrictions. He added that grant support launched by the executive several weeks ago has not been paid to businesses yet and many that were forced to close will not be able to avail of it. Meanwhile Justice Minister Naomi Long is self isolating after developing a persistent cough. The Alliance leader took to social media to say she had booked a test for Covid-19. She said on Twitter: ""Hopefully, with a clear test and 10 days isolation, we'll be able to get it back on track next week. Still, very frustrating but has to be done."" Ms Long said she was following the official advice she had received. Department of Health guidance says if a person has a negative test, they are not required to self-isolate, as long aseveryone they live with who has symptoms has tested negative; they feel well enough; and are not a close contact of a confirmed case.,external Ms Long is the latest executive minister to self isolate and follows assembly members including Conor Murphy, Pam Cameron, John Stewart andMichelle O'Neill who have all had stay at home in recent weeks.

Thousands protest in Georgia against poll result,"Protesters have demanded a new vote Police in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, have fired water cannons at crowds protesting against the results of last week's parliamentary election. Thousands of people gathered outside the Central Election Commission to demand a new vote, after accusing the governing party of rigging the poll. The Georgian Dream party has denied the accusations of fraud. International election observers said ""fundamental freedoms were respected"" but criticised aspects of the process. Georgian Dream, which was founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili and has been in power since 2012, secured over 48% of votes in the 31 October election. The victory gives the party the right to form the country's next government. But the thousands of protesters who marched in Tbilisi rejected the result and called for the resignation of both the police chief and the election commission. Thousands of people marched through the capital Tbilisi on Saturday ""What Georgian Dream did during the elections amounts to a coup,"" 33-year-old pharmacist Theona Lanchava told the AFP news agency. ""We will force them to call new polls."" The protesters and the country's main opposition parties accuse the ruling party and its supporters of electoral fraud and voter intimidation. Eight opposition parties have already said they would boycott parliament over the results of the vote, Reuters news agency reports. International election observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted that ""pervasive allegations of pressure on voters and blurring of the line between the ruling party and the state reduced public confidence in some aspects of the process"". However, they also added that the vote had been competitive and that ""overall, fundamental freedoms were respected"". The protest took place a day before a new overnight curfew comes into effect in the country's major cities amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Georgia, which has a population of just 3.7 million people, has recorded more than 57,000 coronavirus cases and 475 deaths since the pandemic began.

Five US voters who changed the race,"About 160 million Americans - the most in US history - cast their votes for president this election, but the results held some surprises. Donald Trump pulled in more Latino support than expected in some key states - decisively, perhaps, in Florida - while Joe Biden was able to convince many young progressives (the more liberal-leaning wing of the Democratic Party) to vote for him. Although Biden has been declared the winner, Democrats will have to think hard about how they do better with some minority communities and people without university degrees. And Republicans will have to find a way to pull back members of their own party who feel turned off by Trumpism. We talked to five voters who represent a demographic that helped sway the election results. (Note: The exit poll statistics we use are preliminary exit poll results.You can learn more about it here.) Christopher Badillo is a young progressive who reluctantly voted for Joe Biden. Of voters 18-29, 62% of them voted for Joe Biden. What does this moment mean for you? This is the start of the work, not the end. We need to get back to work. I need to go back into my community and start doing the work to organise for a Democratic infrastructure that will actually make progressive change. In my area of Florida, the Democrats have lost a lot of local seats. We need to reflect on how we build up Democratic candidates that serve the community but who can also win. Why did so many first-time voters come out for Biden? I think my generation is more politicised than any generation before. That means we're more involved and more informed about politics. The large voter turnout didn't necessarily come from enthusiasm for Joe Biden, but more from an understanding that Donald Trump is the most dangerous president that we've had in modern history. I think a lot of young people saw Joe Biden as the only other alternative. How does the country come together? If we're going to define unity as everybody coming together and singing in the streets, that's just not going to happen. We're going to have to work to get ourselves to the point where we feel like our country is one. That's going to be a long process because our systems are truly broken and it's going to take all of us to put it back together. How Biden voters think nation can heal Gabriel Montalvo is a Latino voter who switched from Democrat to Republican this year to cast his vote for Donald Trump. Over 32% of Latino voters went for Trump, more than was expected. What does this moment mean for you? The mainstream media has jumped the gun projecting that Biden will win the electoral college. Nothing has changed since yesterday and President Trump's campaign has signalled that he will mount vigorous legal action in multiple swing states on Monday. The Americans political process continues and this is the media playing psychological warfare to make President Trump seem like a sore loser in the court of public opinion. Why did so many Hispanic voters come out for Trump? Prior to the 2016 election, I was a far-left Democrat. Beyond being a Democrat, I was a communist until I learned what the ideology really meant. I had my own ""walk away"" moment from thinking that way and the Trump campaign did a great job with actual outreach to the minority community. It seems like the Republican Party has gone back to its roots, where it's not about that country club mentality. Lincoln was our first Republican president and he helped give people rights in the United States. The current president and administration has created a bigger tent for the Republican Party, and Trump was able to convey that message. This video can not be played Why did so many Latinos back Trump? How does the country come together? I do think the country can heal. There's going to be people on either side that don't support this election but it should never get to the point of violence. You have a right to protest but you do not have a right to riot. But Biden's win is seen as disingenuous to a lot of us. A'Kayla Sellers is a young African-American woman who fully supports Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. African-Americans came out in strong support of Joe Biden, with over 87% casting their vote for the former vice-president. A'Kayla's state of South Carolina helped secure the nomination for Joe Biden in the primaries when he trounced Bernie Sanders among African-American voters in the state. What does this moment mean for you? This moment means so much to me because Biden is a glimmer of hope not just for Democrats, for all Americans. To make America equitable we need a sense of stability and normalcy. It was empowering for me to vote for Biden in South Carolina but it's also discouraging because we are still a very Republican state. This video can not be played 'Now the world sees our vote matters' - how Biden depended on black voters Why did so many black women come out for Biden? Being a black woman is not a monolith. Some of us live in cities, some of them are rural areas, so our needs are very different. But I think black women recognised that Biden and Harris would implement policies that are going to directly benefit us - health care, maternal mortality, school to prison pipeline. We came out because we knew that we had a duty to vote for them. How does the country come together? When Biden's president, he's not going be a president for the Democrats. He has stated firmly that he is a president for all, he is going to be a president for America. When he served as our vice-president, he was a vice-president to all. He's going to provide policies and opportunities that's going to affect everybody that's going to make living here in America more equitable. He's here to help everyone, not just one party. Taylor Golden is a white woman who became energised about politics for the first time in 2016 - because of Trump. Over half of white women are believed to have cast their vote for Donald Trump in 2020. What does this moment mean for you? It's so exhausting because Trump has been fighting his entire presidency. People never left him alone to let him do his job.  I'm exhausted, I'm so tired of it. I've had to turn off social media and unplug and calm myself not to stress about it. I don't believe in the results, Biden can't legally become president yet. I believe that everything will be settled in the Supreme Court. If Biden does win, it's going to be a crappy next four years. It will inspire me to get involved more for the next election with the Republicans in my town. Why did so many white women come out for Trump? I believe suburban white women are starting to wake up and get more involved. I think they definitely had an influence in the election, there were a ton of ""women for Trump"" groups that popped up that I was a part of. He has a lot of, a lot of female fans despite what the media says and what people would have you think. Every woman I know voted for him. I definitely had a sense we were going to make a difference. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" How does the country come together? I think we have so much division right now in our country, it's heartbreaking. I think the truth will bring unity, whatever that truth is. I know that a lot of my Republicans friends, if Biden wins, we're not going to go to the streets rioting and burning stuff. We will use our voice in a legal and peaceful way. And I think that's probably one of the biggest differences - that the right is not controlled by radical emotion like the left, we control our emotion. So to bring unity I think the truth has to come out honestly. James is a lifelong Republican who voted for Joe Biden. It was his first time voting for a Democrat. He represents the group of anti-Trump moderate Republicans and independents who were able to be swayed away from the president by Biden's centrist enough policies. What does this moment mean for you? For me, it means the nation will return to a sense of civility in its politics. Biden is a seasoned politician who has all sorts of personal connections in the Senate. Even if the Senate remains in Republican hands, I believe that Biden as president will be able to reach across the aisle and get things done. This is the first time I've ever voted for a Democrat for president. The very first time. I'm looking forward to Trump being gone so I can become a Republican again. Why did independents and moderate Republicans come out for Biden? People are tired of a president that isn't  presidential. I'm interested in fiscal restraint. On social issues, I tend to be not conservative, but rather moderate. Look at what the president has done. The last four years have been a total mess. In a tweet by the president on election night, he refers to the polls and spells it p-o-l-e-s. This guy is not terribly smart and does not have an educated mind. How does the country come together? I fear that Trump will set himself up with his own TV network. Certainly a running commentary for the next four years as he seeks to run for president again in 2024. He will continue for the next four years to spout this nonsense about massive fraud and there's no evidence of massive fraud. It's just amazing to me the kind of stuff he says. What happens now?

What legal challenges is Trump planning?,"President Trump's supporters protesting over the election outcome in Pennsylvania President Trump is continuing to pursue legal challenges to the US election results, despite state electors having formally nominated Joe Biden as the next president. There's nothing to stop Mr Trump's legal team from filing further lawsuits, but experts say the chances of success are increasingly slim. So what legal cases remain? This is where Mr Trump has launched most of his legal challenges - and where he has suffered a series of losses in the courts. Although Mr Biden has been certified the winner in the state with a margin of over 80,000 votes, the president has maintained his attempts to overturn the result. On 20 December,his campaign team released a statement,externalsaying they were continuing to pursue complaints surrounding postal ballots in the state. The campaign wants the US Supreme Court to take up a number of issues that courts in Pennsylvania have already rejected. One of these issues is the claim that voters in Democrat-leaning areas were given more of an opportunity to correct mistakes on their postal ballots than elsewhere. When they initially lost the case, his lawyers took it to a federal appeals court. It was rejected there too, with the judge saying: ""Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here."" It seems unlikely the US Supreme Court will hear any further appeal and legal experts say even if it did the case would have little chance of success. A poll watcher observing the count in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania The president's legal team also allege hundreds of thousands of postal ballots were counted without proper oversight from poll watchers. This followed a legal tussle over where these observers were allowed to position themselves during the count - with the Trump team arguing that poll watchers were prevented from seeing what was going on. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court eventually ruled that election officials had not violated state law. Does US postal voting lead to fraud? No, voting machines didn't delete millions of Trump ballots The 'dead voters' who are still alive The courts in Pennsylvania also rejected a string of legal challenges by the Trump campaign based on around 9,000 postal ballots they said lacked information, such as the date the ballot was cast or the voter's address. The Trump legal team did have one a small victory over how long voters should be given to provide proof of identification if it was missing or unclear on their postal ballots. The deadline was 12 November, but following a court ruling this was reduced by three days. A series of lawsuits in Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Arizona have all so far failed to have an impact. These are states where Mr Biden has been certified as the winner. An election worker checks a ballot in Detroit - which is within Wayne County, Michigan InMichigan, the Trump campaign filed a federal lawsuit to block the certification of results in Wayne County, citing complaints from poll watchers - but this was dropped after a similar challenge was rejected at state-level InArizona, a lawsuit claimed some legal votes were rejected, citing problems with voting machines - but Arizona's Secretary of State said this was ""grasping at straws"", and the suit was dropped InGeorgia, an attempt was made to stop the count in Chatham County, alleging problems with ballot processing - but the lawsuit was rejected by a judge who said there was ""no evidence"" of improper ballot mixing InNevada, a suit asked that Mr Trump be named the winner in the state or that the results be void with no winner certified, alleging illegal voting. This was rejected by the state's Supreme Court, stating there was ""no credible or reliable evidence"" of fraud InWisconsin, Trump's legal team have argued around 220,000 ballots were unlawfully cast, as they seek to overturn the result there. The suit has been rejected by the state's Supreme Court Wisconsin underwent a partial recount in Dane and Milwaukee counties, and Georgia had a state-wide recount - both confirmed Mr Biden as the winner. There was also a suit filed by the state of Texas, backed by President Trump, which claimed the results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were unlawful because of changes to voting procedures due to the coronavirus pandemic. The US Supreme Court refused to hear the bid,saying Texas didn't have legal standing to bring the case. President Trump has repeatedly said his legal challenges should be heard by the US Supreme Court, but he's acknowledged this could be hard. The most viral US vote claims debunked With little success in the lower courts, it's unclear if the US Supreme Court would be willing to hear any of the president's legal challenges. ""There's no standard process for bringing election disputes to the Supreme Court"" says Prof Richard Briffault of Columbia University Law School.  ""It's very unusual and it would have to involve a very significant issue."" To date, the 2000 election is the only one to be decided by the US Supreme Court. In that year, Democrat Al Gore lost Florida state - and the presidential election - by 537 votes out of a total of almost six million cast in the state. This was followed by ahighly controversial recount process that lasted over a month,external- until the Supreme Court ruled to stop recounting and in favour of Republican George W Bush, who became president.

How Biden voters think nation can heal,"This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" Minutes after Joe Biden had been declared the next president of the United States, people in Washington, DC began to flood the streets. Streams of people - banging pans, honking horns, clutching signs - moved to the city's Black Lives Matter Plaza, swarming the barricaded border of the White House to celebrate. For hours after the announcement, masked Biden supporters remained to cheer, dance and sing. ""Everyone is just joyous,"" said DC resident Andrew Jackson, dressed in a shirt covered with photos of Kamala Harris, now the vice-president-elect. ""Look at the atmosphere, it's crazy."" The collective jubilation makes sense here: 93% of voters in Washington this year cast their ballot for the Democratic ticket. Just beneath the excitement was palpable relief. Every person I spoke to mentioned the anxiety and stress of the past week, and now the exhale knowing that Mr Biden will be president. ""All the anxiety is gone,"" Mr Jackson said. ""The last four years it felt like we were just stuck under a dark cloud, but that cloud's been lifted."" As much as this relief is a response to the Democrats' win, it seemed to be just as much a reaction to the last four years of President Donald Trump - who still has two months left in office. Why Donald Trump lost The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris How will Biden change US foreign policy? For every sign or t-shirt celebrating Mr Biden or Ms Harris, there was one directed at Mr Trump - mocking the current president and applauding his looming departure. And just as often as a voter would reference Mr Biden, they would mention Mr Trump, and what they described as his divisive, damaging agenda. ""Everybody's excited to see the back of Trump,"" said Margaret O'Gorman, 54.  ""We are in a complete U-turn from where we were."" Repairing that division has been an animating theme of Mr Biden's candidacy. He has vowed to be a president for all Americans, to restore the ""soul of America"" and fix the national discord he blames on Mr Trump. It might be a tough sell for some 70 million Americans who cast their ballot for Mr Trump this year - roughly eight million more than sent him to the White House in 2016. But for those gathered outside the White House on Saturday, it is a welcome message. For some in Washington DC the elation was unconfined Brandishing a ""Former Republicans for Biden"" sign, Ken Wright said he is confident that the next president will reach across the aisle, and embrace Republican voters. ""Biden is about compromise, Trump was not. I'm very optimistic that Biden's going to do what he's always done."" ""I think this atmosphere proves that the country can ease now back into some regularity,"" said Vincent Moten, holding the hand of his partner, Derrick Petit. ""Now that we're here, the idea is what can we do to come together. Let's agree on some baseline stuff - I'm a human, so I should have the rights that you have and then start from there. For Anisley Valdas, 32, the key to moving forward is to understand where Trump voters are coming from, ""why people feel angry, why people feel disenfranchised"". Anisley Valdas said she thinks Joe Biden will be a president for all Americans ""I think trying to understand people's pain and their suffering is a way to start to get us on the right track,"" she said. Born in Cuba, America's political divides cut through her family. In this year's election, Ms Valdas voted for Mr Biden - splitting from her sister, cousins and the majority of Cuban immigrants in her hometown of Miami. Ms Valdas said she was ""angry and disappointed"" that her own family had voted for a candidate who, she said, ""demonstrated such hatred and bigotry"", for people of colour. She hasn't spoken to her sister since learning the results, she said, after an argument this week about the election. When she does, she said, she will tell her that ""Biden is the president for everyone. You just don't know it yet."" What happens now?

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win.

Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader.

""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

It's been nearly a week since the 3 November election day, and there are another 10 weeks to go until Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president.

Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Long-serving defence secretaries have been polarising figures. But a defence secretary who serves in the role over a period of years and is supported by the president provides continuity for those at the defence department and for US military allies. In contrast, Trump distanced himself from Defence Secretary Mark Esper publicly and then sacked him. If Christopher Miller, the National Counterterrorism Center director, becomes acting defence secretary, as Trump has planned, he will be the fifth to serve under the Trump administration - and is only likely to serve for a short amount of time before the Biden administration kicks in. Whoever the new defence secretary is under Biden, they are likely to remain in place longer than their predecessor, with the open support of their boss. This will make things easier for people who work at the Pentagon and for the nationâs allies too. As a recap, earlier today President-Elect Joe Biden gave a speech after after he was briefed on the US Covid-19 situation. He promised to ""spare no effort"" battling the pandemic. This video can not be played Biden: ""I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around"" Raffensperger briefs the media on vote counting last week Georgia's Republican secretary of state, who is facing calls to resign from the state's two Republican senators, is out with a new statement hitting back at their claims that he mishandled the election. Brad Raffensperger, whose office oversees Georgia's election, said he would not quit and blamed his partyâs lawmakers - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - for their own predicament. âThe voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,â he wrote. He called election day a âresounding successâ and said that he understands the senators are âirritatedâ to have to go to a runoff race after not winning a large enough majority of the vote. Raffensperger concludes his statement saying: âAs a Republican, I am concerned about Republicans keeping the US Senate. I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on thatâ. As President Trump continues to dispute the projected result of the US election, false or misleading claims have been circulating about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who accused the Democrats of trying to ""steal"" election, without providing evidence. Here are a few of the most recent - and false - claims. Read our fact-checker about five vote fraud claims which have gone viral. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Bolsonaro has supported a Trump presidency Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has faced a
barrage of criticism from the media for his failure to congratulate Joe
Biden on his victory in the US elections. Prominent commentators said this
left the right-wing Brazilian leader ""isolated"" at home and abroad. ""Isolated in Brazil and in the world,
Bolsonaro maintains silence about the USA,"" Brazilian news website
UOL said. In the months leading up to US
election, Brazilian media had widely reported on Bolsonaro's open support
for President Donald Trump. Daily Folha de Sao Paulo noted that
Bolsonaro was accompanied by the leaders of Russia, China and Mexico in
not formally congratulating Biden, but it said that the other three presidents
""at least presented justifications"", while Bolsonaro's silence
was complete so far. However, Vice-President Hamilton Mourao said he
believed the president was waiting for what he called the post-election
""imbroglio"" (a fancy word that means ""a confusing situation"") in the US to end before taking a position. This
""imbroglio"" involved ""discussion, if there were false votes, or
if there weren't false votes"", Mourao was reported to have said. Brazilian news website G1
reported that ""political advisers and also military members of the
government"" were recommending that Bolsonaro ""recognise Joe Biden's
victory as soon as possible"". ""The worry is, increasingly, that
Brazil might be left isolated in international diplomacy,"" the
website said. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter For months White House Press Secretary Kayleigh
McEnany brushed off certain undesired political questions as being better
directed at the Trump campaign, not the White House. On Monday, however,
McEnany appeared at a press conference to directly discuss the campaign and
allegations the Trump team was making of widespread voter fraud. Once again a Trump administration official is inhabiting a
grey area of the law, where US government officials are forbidden from engaging
in campaign politics but there is little mechanism for holding them to those
rules. McEnany is one of the most effective â and loyal -
spokespeople for the president. She worked for the Republican party before being tapped
for her current White House assignment. That might explain why - in these last,
desperate days â she is stepping off the sidelines to make the case for why it
was Trump, not Joe Biden, who won last weekâs election. Still without offering supporting evidence, however, even
Trumpâs most skilled advocates have little chance of turning the tide, both in
US courts and the court of public opinion. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, who Trump fired earlier today without giving a reason, said in a recent interview that he was the rare cabinet official willing to stand up to Trump. In an interview withMilitary Times,externalon 4 November and released today, he rejected allegations that he was a ""yes man"" to his boss. The newspaper notes that his critics in the administration, and Trump himself, have called Esper ""Yesper"" due to his reputation for being obedient to Trump. âMy frustration is I sit here and say, âHmm, 18 Cabinet members. Whoâs pushed back more than anybody?â Name another Cabinet secretary thatâs pushed back,â he said. ""Have you seen me on a stage saying, âUnder the exceptional leadership of blah-blah-blah, we have blah-blah-blah-blah?â""' He also added that he did not intend to quit the job, despite areas of disagreement with Trump. âYeah, look, I mean â my soldiers donât get to quit,â he said. ""So if Iâm going to quit, it better be over something really, really big. And otherwise, look, Iâm going to do what Iâve always done, which is try and shape it the best I can.â Esper clashed with the White House earlier this year, over Trump's threat to use the military to quell public unrest during protests over racial injustice. Trump's White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany says: ""This election is not yet over. Far from it."" ""We have only begun the process"" of tabulating votes and disputing totals, she says. She goes on to accuse Democrats of ""welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal votingâ and Pennsylvania voting officials of barring poll-watchers from ""meaningful"" observation of the count in Philadelphia. Her claim is incorrect, as Trump campaign officials were permitted into the room where votes have been counted. The Trump campaign is hoping to have ballots that are postmarked 3 November, and received after 3 November but before 6 November, thrown out on the basis that they arrived ""late"". In fact, it is normal for ballots to be counted after election day. Because of the record number of postal ballots due to the virus, officials in Pennsylvania gave a three day grace period for ballots to arrive at election centres. As McEnany was speaking, Fox News cut away from the event, saying they could not continue to air claims for which no evidence has been provided. Allow Twitter content?

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany kicks thing off, by stating she is there ""in a personal capacity"". This video can not be played President Biden meets the Covid-19 experts As one of his first actions as president-elect, Biden has assembled a 13-member panel of health experts tasked with providing ""clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance"" on the pandemic. The task force includes former surgeon-general Vivek Murthy, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014 and removed by President Trump in 2017. Other members include former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration David Kessler, and Yale University epidemiology professor Marcella Nunez-Smith. The panel also includes oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel, who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, who has served as White House chief of staff under Obama and mayor of Chicago. Another member is Rick Bright, a former top government vaccine official who was fired by the Trump administration after submitting a whistleblower complaint to Congress. He claimed that the Trump team had failed to heed his guidance to prepare for the pandemic by stocking up on medical supplies such as face masks. âLives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost,â he testified to Congress in May. Kayleigh McEnany's involvement in the campaign has been criticised Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany will host a press conference in Washington DC in the coming minutes. In a press release, the campaign says the purpose of the event is ""to discuss Pennsylvania litigation and give an overview of the post-Election Day landscape"". It's worth mentioning that McEnany's role in the campaign has been criticised by some as a violation of the Hatch Act, a rule which prohibits certain employees of the White House from engaging in political activities. McEnany has previously dismissed that criticism, saying that she is acting as an an individual and not as a federal worker. Georgia Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue Georgia's two Republican senators - who will face runoff elections after not securing a wide enough margin of the vote last week - have issued a joint statement calling for the Georgia secretary of state to resign. Brad Raffensperger, who is also a Republican, oversees the state's election process. Biden has a narrow lead of 0.2% in the normally-Republican stronghold and a recount has already been started there. âThe management of Georgia elections has become an embarrassment for our state. Georgians are outraged, and rightly so,"" write Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. ""We believe when there are failures, they need to be called out - even when itâs in your own party,"" they say, charging that Raffensperger ""has failed to deliver honest and transparent elections"". Trump has made claims of ""tremendous corruption and fraudâ being perpetrated by Democratic officials - but Georgia has a Republican governor, Republican legislature and Republican officials who oversee voting. Last week, a top election official in Raffensperger's office poured cold water on the Republican's theory of foul play. âI think if anyone was trying to rig a system they would see something less close than this,â said Gabriel Sterling, adding that he too is a Republican. Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has shared a photo from his phone call to Biden to congratulate him on his victory. ""Weâve worked with each other before, and weâre ready to pick up on that work and tackle the challenges and opportunities facing our two countries - including climate change and Covid-19,"" the Liberal Party politician said in his accompanying tweet.

Biden will be the third US president that Trudeau has worked with, after Trump and Obama before him. Trudeau has strained to have good relations with Trump, and has gone to unusual lengths to keep from speaking out against him. After he was asked about Trump's decision to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo-op outside a church, he responded with anepic 21 second pausewhile he collected his thoughts to form a diplomatic response. in recent history, US presidents have made Canada the destination of their first foreign visit when taking office, a way to underscore the deep ties between the neighbouring nations, thought President Trump didn't follow that tradition. Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell was just speaking on the Senate floor. He defended President Trump's right to challenge the election results and not concede. ""No states have yet certified election results,"" he noted. This is true - states have until 8 December to certify their electors. McConnell continued to say all legal ballots should count and the process must be ""transparent"". ""If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them to be brought to light and if Democrats feel confident they have not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny,"" the majority leader added. Experts have long said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. ""We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options,"" McConnell said. ""The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power over the legal rights of any citizen, including the president."" Only three Republican Senators have thus far acknowledged Biden's win. Republican President George W Bush has also congratulated Biden on his win. This video can not be played Joe Biden will a natural conciliator, says Gordon Brown Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Biden will work to bring the international community together and give leadership on issues like global health, the economy and climate change. Biden is a ""natural conciliator"", says the former Labour Party leader. ""He wants to bring people together, both within the United States of America where he's already talking about unifying the country,"" he says. ""And he wants to bring the international community together and bring some leadership which has clearly been missing."" The former Labour prime minister on how he believes Joe Biden will change the US presidency. David Bossie, the Trump advisor who was chosen by the campaign to oversee the legal challenges to the vote across the US, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Bossie, who was Trumpâs deputy campaign manager in 2016 and is now the head of the Citizens United conservative group, was tapped to take over the legal effort on Friday. Earlier today, Housing Secretary Ben Carson announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Over the weekend, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive. Both men were at Trump's side at several key events in the closing days of the president's losing campaign. Republican attorneys general across the US have filed a joint brief to the US Supreme Court contesting vote counts in Pennsylvania. The officials argue that the state's court ""overstepped"" when it allowed ballots post-marked by 3 November but received after the date to be counted. The move is to back Pennsylvania Republicans who have already requested that the US Supreme Court should get these ballots tossed out. Even if the top court takes up the case (which appears unlikely) and delivers Republicans a win, it would not have an impact on Biden's win in the state. His margin is over 45,000 votes so far and counting continues. The Republican attorneys' brief claims that the decision to include the late-arriving post ""exacerbated
the risk of mail-in ballot fraud"". Experts have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud in postal voting. Pennsylvania's mail voting law was approved last year by the state's Republican-majority legislature. Senator Susan Collins has joined a handful of Republican lawmakers to offer congratulations to Biden and Harris. Collins congratulated Biden ""on his apparent victory"" and said ""transitions are important, and the president-elect and the vice-president-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern"" after the inauguration. The centrist Maine senator, who won re-election by a narrower margin than expected, added that Trump ""should be afforded the opportunity"" to challenge the results. ""While we have a clear direction, we should continue to respect that process,"" she said. ""I urge people to be patient."" Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski are the two others Senate Republicans to congratulate Biden. The three names are worth mentally jotting down: these party moderates are most likely to work across the aisle with a Biden administration. Though Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, a President Biden may still need support from Republicans in the Senate, where the majority has yet to be determined. Donald Trump supporters have spoken to the BBC about the Pennsylvania election result. With nearly all of the votes in Pennsylvania counted, Biden has been projected to overturn Trump's narrow 2016 win with a narrow win of his own. Supporters of the president in Bradford County, northern Pennsylvania, gave their reactions and thoughts about what Biden could do for them.

Why Donald Trump lostWhat a Biden presidency means for the UKBeing with Trump the day he lost the electionThe unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris,"Let the 2020 election bury the mistaken notion once and for all that the 2016 election was a historical accident, an American aberration. Donald Trump won more than 70 million votes, the second highest total in American history. Nationally, he has more than a 47% share of his vote, and looks to have won 24 states, including his beloved Florida and Texas. He has an extraordinary hold over large swathes of this country, a visceral connection that among thousands of supporters has brought a near cult-like devotion. After four years in the White House, his supporters studied the fine print of his presidency and clicked enthusiastically on the terms and conditions. Any analysis of his political weakness in 2020 also has to acknowledge his political strength. However, he was defeated, becoming one of only four incumbents in the modern era not to get another four years. Also he has become the first president to lose the popular vote in consecutive elections. Live updates with reaction and analysis Five reasons Biden won the election Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 partly because he was a norm-busting political outsider who was prepared to say what had previously been unsayable. But Donald Trump also lost the presidency in 2020 partly because he was a norm-busting political outsider who was prepared to say what had previously been unsayable. Though much of the Trump base might well have voted for him if he had shot someone on Fifth Avenue, his infamous boast from four years ago, others who supported him four years ago were put off by his aggressive behaviour. This was especially true in the suburbs. Joe Biden improved on Hillary Clinton's performance in 373 suburban counties, helping him claw back the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and enabling him to gain Georgia and Arizona. Donald Trump has a particular problem with suburban women. We witnessed again in the 2020 presidential election what we had seen in the 2018 mid-term election - more highly-educated Republicans, some of whom had voted for Trump four years ago prepared to give him a chance, thought his presidency was too unpresidential. Though they understood he would be unconventional, many found the manner in which he defied so many customs and behavioural norms off-putting and often offensive. This video can not be played How US networks reported the Biden win They were put off by his aggressiveness. His stoking of racial tensions. His use of racist language in tweets maligning people of colour. His failure, on occasions, to adequately condemn white supremacy. His trashing of America's traditional allies and his admiration for authoritarian strongmen, such as Vladimir Putin. His strange boasts about being ""a very stable genius"" and the like. His promotion of conspiracy theories. His use of a lingua franca that sometimes made him sound more like a crime boss, such as when he described his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors, as ""a rat"". What happens now? Making history - the first woman vice-president What Biden's victory means for rest of world US election results in maps and charts Election results in full Then there was what critics derided as his creeping authoritarianism, seen after the election in his refusal to accept the result. A telling moment for me during this campaign came in Pittsburgh, when I chatted with Chuck Howenstein on the stoop of his terraced home. A Trump supporter in 2016, he voted for Joe Biden. ""People are tired,"" he told me. ""They want to see normalcy back in this country. They want to see decency. They want to see this hatred stop. They want to see this country united. And that together is going to bring Joe Biden the presidency."" A political problem for Trump was that he failed to expand his support beyond his core Trump base. Nor did he try hard to do so. In 2016, he won 30 states and often governed as if he was the president solely of conservative, red America. The most deliberately divisive president of the past 100 years, he made little attempt to woo blue America, the 20 states that voted for Hillary Clinton. After four exhausting years, many voters simply wanted a presidency they could have on in the background - an occupant of the White House who would behave in a more conventional manner. They had tired of the infantile name-calling, the ugly language and the ceaseless confrontation. They wanted a return to some kind of normalcy. But the 2020 election was not a re-run of the 2016 election. This time he was the incumbent, not the insurgent. He had a record to defend, including his mishandling of a coronavirus outbreak which by Election Day had killed more than 230,000 Americans. In this age of negative partisanship, where politics is often driven by loathing of the opposition, he was not pitted against a hate figure like Hillary Clinton. The defining moment of the Trump presidency The night American democracy hit rock bottom A letter to our newborn American daughter The time when America stopped being great Joe Biden was hard to demonise, which is partly why the Democratic establishment was so keen to have him as its presidential nominee. This 77-year-old centrist also did the job he was hired to do, which was to claw back white working class voters in the Rust Belt. The question of why Trump lost the presidency turns also on a more interesting and arguable question - when did he lose the presidency? Was it in the immediate aftermath of his victory in 2016, when people who had voted for Trump partly as a protest vote against the Washington political establishment instantly had misgivings? After all, many of those voters never expected him to win. Was it in the first 24 hours of his presidency, when he delivered his ""American Carnage"" inaugural address - which portrayed the country as a near dystopia of shuttered factories, left-behind workers and wealth ""ripped"" from middle class homes - before he ranted about the crowd size and vowed to continue using Twitter? By sundown of his first full day in charge, it had become clear that Donald Trump would seek to change the presidency more than the presidency changed him. Was it more cumulative, the snowball effect of so many scandals, so many slurs, so much staff turn-over, and so much chaos? Or was it as a result of the coronavirus, the biggest crisis that engulfed his presidency? Before the virus arrived on these shores, Trump's political vital signs were strong. He had survived his impeachment trial. His approval ratings matched the highest level it had been - 49%. He could boast a strong economy and the advantage of incumbency: the twin factors that usually secure a sitting president a second term. Often presidential elections turn on a simple question: is the country better off now than it was four years ago? After Covid hit, and the economic crisis that followed, it became almost impossible to make that case. This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus But it is wrong to say that the Trump presidency was inevitably doomed by the coronavirus. Presidents often emerge from national convulsions stronger. Crises can often bring out greatness. That was true for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose rescuing of America from the Great Depression made him politically unassailable. George W Bush's initial response to the attacks of September 11th also boosted his popularity, and helped him win a second term. So it was by no means preordained that Covid would finish Donald Trump. It was his botched handling of the crisis that contributed to his fall. Still, again it is worth remembering that Donald Trump remained politically viable up until the end, despite the country experiencing its worst public health crisis in more than a 100 years, its biggest economic crisis since the 1930s and also its most widespread racial turbulence since the late 1960s. Much of red America, and much of a conservative movement he came to dominate, will yearn for his return. He will continue to be the dominant figure in the conservative movement for years to come. Trumpism could end up having the same transformative effect on American conservatism as Reaganism. The outgoing president will remain a deeply polarizing figure, and could run again in 2024. These disunited states have not suddenly become united again, not least because so many Americans will harbour such different emotions about Trump, ranging from devotion to abject hate. The country surely has not heard or seen the last of the most unorthodox president in its history. Follow Nick on Twitter,external Eat your way to power!Can a bacon sandwich affect your chances?

What a Biden presidency means for the UKBeing with Trump the day he lost the electionThe unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris,"The election of Joe Biden leaves Boris Johnson facing a substantial diplomatic repair job. The two men have never met. Last December the president-elect described the prime minister as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump. There are people around Mr Biden who remember bitterly how Mr Johnson once suggested President Obama harboured anti-British sentiment because of his part-Kenyan ancestry. Mr Biden and his team think Brexit is an historic mistake. They would not want Britain to leave the EU without a trade deal, particularly if it involved breaking commitments made in the Northern Ireland protocol. Last month Mr Biden warned publicly in a tweet that a future UK-US trade deal was contingent on the UK not unravelling the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland. There is an expectation among many observers that when President Biden seeks to repair transatlantic relationships, he may focus more of his attention on Paris and Berlin than London. And when Mr Biden does turn his attention to the UK, he may put pressure on Mr Johnson to repair its relations with the EU just when the prime minister wants to focus his ""global Britain"" foreign policy elsewhere, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. Joe Biden and a life in politics What Biden's victory means for rest of world How will Biden change US foreign policy? So the government has a lot of work to do to in improving its relations with the incoming administration. That has not been made easier by a reluctance of Conservatives in recent years to meet Democrats when visiting Washington. ""We just couldn't persuade ministers ever to go and see Democrats on the Hill,"" one diplomatic source told me. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, did meet the influential Democratic senator Chris Coons in September. The prime minister's foreign affairs adviser, John Bew, has also been cultivating links with those close to Mr Biden. But they are both playing catch-up. Joe Biden's camp see Boris Johnson as very similar to Donald Trump That said, sometimes too much can be made of past comments and personal animus. Mr Biden is considered a pragmatist and under him the United States may well prove a more stable and predictable ally to the UK than was the case in the last four years. Mr Trump's America First policy will be replaced by one that recognises America's place in a multilateral, international system from which the UK benefits. A Biden presidency would renew US support for Nato the World Health Organisation and the World Trade Organisation, all of which are priorities for the UK. And there are issues where Mr Biden's views align significantly with the UK's: being tough on Russia; reviving the Iran nuclear deal; combatting human rights abuses in China and elsewhere; agreeing new carbon emission reduction targets. Next year's COP26 summit, delayed because of Covid, will attempt to agree coordinated action on climate change This last issue is, perhaps, the most important. The UK will want to use its chairmanship next year of the United Nations COP26 climate change summit to forge a bond with the Biden administration, hoping to act as a broker between the US and other countries, especially China, in agreeing a deal. The UK will still, of course, come under pressure to support America's confrontation with China, which is held as strongly by Democrats as Republicans. Johnson congratulates Biden on US election win 'Let's work together!' World reacts to Biden win Has US election slowed down Brexit negotiations? But British policymakers hope that under Biden, the US will share a closer position with the UK, one that challenges malign behaviour by China - such as in Hong Kong and Xinjiang - but also engages on global issues such as climate change. They also hope to forge a new alliance of liberal democratic countries to counter the influence of autocratic governments around the world. The truth, though, is that Mr Biden's priorities will be overwhelmingly domestic - namely fixing America's economy and the Covid crisis. Relations with the UK - including a possible free trade deal - will not be a top priority. And for all Mr Biden's internationalist instincts, there will be no return to America's global interventionism of the past. That means that despite Mr Biden's arrival in the White House, the UK post-Brexit may still have to forge a new role in the world, one that does not automatically slipstream behind US foreign policy.

Being with Trump the day he lost the electionThe unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris,"Trump arrives back at the White House after playing golf Over the past four years, I have seen President Donald Trump on good days and bad days. But 7 November, the day he lost the election, was a day like no other. Dressed in a black windbreaker, dark trousers and a white MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat the president left the White House a few minutes before 10:00.He had spent the early part of his day tweeting,externalabout election fraud. Now he leaned forward slightly, as if he were pushing into the wind. He climbed into a dark vehicle and headed to his golf club, Trump National in Sterling, Virginia, about 25 miles (40km) from the White House. In that moment, he projected an air of confidence. It was a lovely day, perfect for golf, and he was going to spend the day at the club. But the people who worked for him seemed on edge. ""How are you doing?"" I asked one of the junior staffers. ""Fine,"" she said. She smiled, but her eyes narrowed. She looked down at her phone. The White House has been through some trauma in the days since the election. It was only on Tuesday, but it feels like a lifetime ago. Many of the desks in the West Wing were empty when I walked through the building on Saturday morning. Several staffers have been infected with the coronavirus, and they were out of the office. Others were in quarantine. Then, starting at about 11:30, while the president was at his golf club, the BBC and the US networks began calling the election for Joe Biden, his Democratic rival. This video can not be played How US networks reported the Biden win I was sitting in an Italian restaurant about a mile from the club when I heard the news. I'm a member of the White House press pool, a small group of journalists who travel with the president. We were all waiting for him to emerge from the club. ""He's toxic,"" said one woman outside the restaurant, who had, like most of her neighbours in this Democratic-leaning area, voted for his rival. Others wondered aloud when the president would leave the club and go back to the White House. The minutes passed, then hours. ""He's taking his time,"" said a law-enforcement officer, quietly, to a colleague. The president was in no hurry to leave. At the club, he was surrounded by friends. Outside the gates, supporters shouted at me and the other reporters: ""Defund the media!"" This video can not be played Donald Trump is seen playing golf as Joe Biden's win is announced A woman in sturdy heels and a red-white-and-blue bandana carried a sign reading ""Stop the steal."" A man drove his truck up and down the road in front of the club flying several flags, including one depicting the president standing on a tank, as if he were commander of the world. It showed how his supporters see him and how Mr Trump has seen himself for the past four years. Finally, he headed out of the club and began his journey home. His critics were waiting - in the thousands. The president's motorcade roared through Virginia, with me riding in the motorcade in a van that narrowly avoided a crash on Fairfax County Parkway. Sirens blared. The closer we got to the White House, the bigger the crowds became: people were out to celebrate his defeat. Someone held up a sign: ""You lose and we all win."" People honked and jeered. Critics of the president were seen carrying placards on Saturday Then we got back at the White House, the president went in through a side door, an entrance that presidents rarely use. His shoulders were slumped, and his head down. He glanced over and saw me and the others in the press pool and gave us a thumbs-up. It was a half-hearted gesture; he did not raise his hand high or shake a fist, the way he often does. Whether at the White House or at the golf club, the president has never wavered: he makes unsubstantiated claims about election fraud and insists he will be vindicated. He tweeted in the morning about ""illegally received"" votes and by late afternoon he was declaring defiantly in all caps. ""I WON THE ELECTION."" Allow Twitter content?

"Rashford welcomes school holiday supportThe government is to spend about Â£400m to support poor children and their families in England, in a climbdown.Family & Education","This video can not be played 'The families deserve the U-turn' - Rashford The government is to spend more than Â£400m to support poor children and their families in England, following a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. A winter grant scheme, to be run by councils, will provide support with food and bills, and a holiday food and activities programme is to be expanded. Rashford said it would improve the lives of almost 1.7 million children. The move represents a climbdown for the government, which had said Universal Credit was the best way to help. From the package of support, a Â£170m ring-fenced fund will be distributed through councils, with at least 80% earmarked for help with food and bills. This will receive funding from the beginning of December until the end of March. The holiday food and activities programme will be expanded with a Â£220m investment to cover Easter, summer and Christmas in 2021. On top of that, there will be a Â£16m cash boost for the nation's food banks. Rashford renews call for an end to child hunger Government changes its mind after Rashford campaign Rashford becomes MBE in birthday honours Rashford: 'No child should be going to bed hungry' Prime Minister Boris Johnson telephoned the Manchester United and England player on Saturday to tell him of the new plans. Speaking after he took part in United's 3-1 Premier League win against Everton, Rashford said: ""Following the game today, I had a good conversation with the prime minister to better understand the proposed plan, and I very much welcome the steps that have been taken to combat child food poverty in the UK."" Rashford said he remained concerned about the children who would miss out on help ""because their family income isn't quite low enough"". However, he added: ""The intent the government have shown today is nothing but positive and they should be recognised for that. ""The steps made today will improve the lives of near 1.7 million children in the UK over the next 12 months, and that can only be celebrated."" Rashford also told the BBC Mr Johnson had agreed to speak with the footballer's child food poverty taskforce. ""I am fully committed to this cause, and I will fight for the rest of my life for it, because in my mind, no child should ever go hungry in the United Kingdom,"" the player said. Seeing the role everyone had played in supporting the most vulnerable children had been ""the greatest moment of my life,"" he added. Rashford's campaign began in June, after the government insisted it would not provide vouchers over the summer holidays for the 1.3 million children in England who were receiving free school meals in term time. The government had previously given this support during the first coronavirus lockdown in April. Rashford's campaignled to the government changing its policyto allow children to claim free meals during the summer holidays. The footballer then called for free meals to be provided over the October half-term, with more than a million people signing a petition he set up. But the government refused, saying enough support was being provided through the benefit system. Last month, it whipped Conservative MPs to vote against a Labour motion in the House of Commons that called for the extension of free school meal provision. This prompted a number of local authorities to say they would continue offering free school meals throughout the week's holiday in spite of that. In October, a Downing Street spokesman said it was ""not for schools to regularly provide food to pupils during the school holidays."" They added: ""We believe the best way to support families outside of term time is through Universal Credit rather than government subsidising meals."" Marcus Rashford has prompted the government to act before. Now he's done it again. It is the second time the prime minister has picked up the phone to the 23-year-old footballer, whose campaign has struck a chord with many, and left many Conservatives acknowledging privately for some time they would have to change tack. Strikingly, Rashford insists this isn't about politics, or criticising Boris Johnson, it's about helping poor families. ""We're not against him. That's the main reason I was happy to talk to him,"" he told BBC Breakfast. But what also stands out is he's moving onto the next strand of his campaign - arguing that more families should get help. Given his success so far, don't bet against him pursuing this pretty doggedly in the months ahead. Announcing the support package, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the government knew it was a challenging time for many, and insisted it had consistently supported the lowest paid families by boosting welfare support. ""We want to make sure vulnerable people are cared for throughout this difficult time and, above all, no one should go hungry or be unable to pay their bills this winter,"" she added. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said Labour had been campaigning for such a change, adding: ""This should have been announced weeks ago to help the children at risk of going hungry over half term."" She added that ministers needed to bring forward a long-term plan to child poverty. England's children's commissioner Anne Longfield welcomed the move but called on ministers to ""go further"" with Universal Credit support by retaining a Â£20 increase. ""Hunger does not take a holiday when schools close and a long-term solution to the growing number of children in poverty is urgently needed,"" she said. Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, who also chairs the End Child Poverty Coalition, said Rashford deserved ""enormous credit for pushing the issue of poverty to the top of the public's agenda"", adding that the government should be acknowledged for ""listening"". James Toop, chief executive, of food charity Bite Back 2030, said: ""It's great that Boris has listened to the voices of our young people who have been campaigning for meal provision through the holidays to be a priority through this crisis."" Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said the scheme was particularly welcome. ""Christmas will not be the same this year - and it is therefore even more important that we ensure that children have food and are kept warm."" Head teachers also welcomed the scheme but questioned why it could not have been in place for October's half term. Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders' union the NAHT, said while the expansion of the activities programme was a positive move, it ""falls short in addressing fully the issue of holiday hunger"". He added: ""We would question whether provision of food to those going hungry should be dependent upon them attending an activity, which for a whole host of reasons might not be suitable, available or accessible for particular groups."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the winter grant would help them find the best way to help families and individuals most in need, but called on the government to ""adequately fund councils so they can provide wider long-term preventative support to all households who need it"".
