Ice cream and empty robe up for Plinth,"The End by Heather Phillipson: Described as exploring the extremes of shared experience, from commemorations and celebrations to mass protests, all while being observed by a drone's camera A scoop of ice cream covered in parasites and an empty robe are some of the new proposals for the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square. Also put forward is a recreation of a sculpture destroyed by so-called Islamic State. Maquettes of the proposed works will be on display at the National Gallery until 26 March. The two winners will then be chosen. The two chosen works will be unveiled on the plinth in 2018 and 2020. The Fourth Plinth Programme invites world-class artists to make new works for the capital. A maquette is a small preliminary sketch, or wax or clay model, from which a work of art is elaborated. The new proposals are: High Way by DamiÃ¡n Ortega: Described as a playful and precarious construction of a truck, oil cans, scaffold and a ladder Untitled by Huma Bhabha: Described as an imposing figure, the scale reflecting a modern comic sci-fi movie The Invisible Enemy Should Not Exist by Michael Rakowitz: Described as a recreation of the Lamassu, a winged bull and protective deity, which was destroyed by so-called Islamic State in 2015 The Emperor's Old Clothes by Raqs Media Collective: Described as exploring how power can be both present and absent in sculpture The current artwork, David Shrigley's Really Good, will be on the plinth until March 2018. The 7m-high (23ft) sculpture of a hand giving a thumbs up sign was unveiled last September. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""I'm delighted to see that the shortlisted commissions are not just from the UK but from around the globe, a clear sign that London is open to creativity. ""The Fourth Plinth reflects the best of London in so many ways - it is inventive, pioneering, surprising and a source of delight, discussion and debate for millions of Londoners and visitors from across the world."" Mark Wallinger's figure Ecce Homo was the first piece to stand on the empty plinth - in the north-west corner of the square - in 1999. Other works have included Alison Lapper Pregnant by Marc Quinn (2005), Nelson's Ship in a Bottle by Yinka Shonibare (2010) and Elmgreen and Dragset's Powerless Structures, Fig 101 - a sculpture of a boy astride his rocking horse.

Yuvraj and Dhoni seal series for India,"MS Dhoni struck six sixes in his 134 Second one-day international, Cuttack India 381-6 (50 overs):Yuvraj 150 (127), Dhoni 134 (122) England 366-8 (50 overs):Morgan 102 (81), Ashwin 3-65 India won by 15 runs Scorecard Brilliant centuries from Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni gave India a series-clinching 15-run win over England in a thrilling second one-day international. India were reduced to 25-3 in Cuttack before Yuvraj, who struck 150, and Dhoni (134) shared a stand of 256. They helped India to 381-6, the third-highest total made against England. Eoin Morgan blasted an 80-ball hundred, Jason Roy, Joe Root and Moeen Ali all made half-centuries, but England ended 366-8 to go 2-0 down with one to play. That in itself was England's fifth-highest total andtheir second of 350 or more in as many games,but they still have not won a series in this country since 1984-85 and have lost 21 of their past 25 ODIs against India in India. The tourists looked well set to alter that record when Chris Woakes took three wickets in his first three overs, including the prolific Virat Kohli, but Yuvraj and Dhoni destroyed an England attack that had no control of length. An unlikely chase was not out of the question on an ideal batting surface, only for India's spinners to run through the England top order, with the late hitting of Morgan not enough in the face of the home attack's greater nous. Yuvraj (left) and Dhoni shared the second-highest partnership ever made against England in an ODI Before returning for the first match, Yuvraj was out of the India ODI side for more than three years, dropped at the end of a 2013 when he averaged only 19.71 with the bat. Recalled after some excellent domestic form, he made his first ODI century for six years and his highest score, dismantling the England bowling with stylish drives and brutal pulls. England were right to initially probe the left-hander's historical weakness against the short ball, but too slow to change a plan that did not work. Time and again short deliveries were dismissed to the leg-side fence, even after Yuvraj had registered his 14th ODI ton with Jake Ball the most persistent offender. Yuvraj successfully overturned a caught-behind decision on 145 and a double century seemed possible until he edged the excellent Woakes, comfortably the pick of England's bowlers, to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler. Dhoni relinquished the white-ball captaincy to Kohli before this series but once again proved his worth alongside the equally experienced Yuvraj - both 35 and with 580 caps between them. Usually at his best at the end of the innings, Dhoni dealt with the inconvenience of having to arrive in the fifth over by batting until the 48th, initially as a foil for Yuvraj. He was dropped on 43, a tough chance to a retreating Ball off a leading edge, and only really accelerated as he neared a century, announcing his intention with a huge six over long-on off Woakes. From there it was carnage, as Dhoni took 41 runs off the last 20 balls he faced. Overall, India hit 214 from their final 20 overs and 120 off the last 10. Liam Plunkett, ineffective on his return for figures of 2-91, was hammered for three sixes in an over, eventually getting a crumb of comfort when Dhoni hit a full toss to David Willey at deep mid-wicket. England were not fazed by what would have been their highest successful run chase in ODIs, with Root and Roy sharing a stand of 100 that kept the tourists ahead of the curve. However, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin,England's tormentor during their 4-0 Test series defeat,had Root sky a sweep, bowled Ben Stokes and had Buttler stumped down the leg side, while spin partner Ravindra Jadeja found turn to bowl Roy. Still England pressed on, captain Morgan returning to form with sixes over long-on and long-off, and Moeen's leg-side scoring bringing him a 40-ball half-century. When Moeen dragged on to his stumps off Bhuvneshwar Kumar, it looked to be a fatal blow to England's chances, but Morgan kept them alive in a fifty partnership with Plunkett that came in only 24 balls. The Irishman reached his ninth ODI ton only to be run out by bowler Jasprit Bumrah when backing up too far, taking England's hopes with him as he departed. Falling short by 15 in a game of 747 runs, England will reflect on a bowling effort that was too expensive and top-order batting that failed to capitalise on a strong position. Simon Hughes on Test Match Special India got just too many runs. England's bowling wasn't focused enough on Yuvraj Singh and then they lost wickets at the wrong time. It's unfair to blame England's death bowlers, but they still haven't got that right. Woakes is good but they haven't got another person that they can really rely on. India's 381-6 is the third-highest score ever made against England in a one-day international. The partnership of 256 by Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni is the second-highest for any wicket by any opponent against England in ODIs, bettered only by the 286 shared by Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga for Sri Lanka in 2006. Yuvraj is only the sixth man to make a score of 150 or more against England in an ODI. England made their fifth-highest ODI total and their largest batting second. It was also the largest score they have ever made to lose an ODI. 747 runs is the second-most made in an ODI in India, behind the 825 made by the hosts and Sri Lanka in 2009-10. Joe Root has made a half-century in each of the five Tests and two ODIs against India this winter. England captain Eoin Morgan:""We probably weren't at our best with ball or the bat but we still competed and it's tremendously disappointing not to get over the line. ""Bowling to MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh is very difficult at times. The margin for error is quite small and the challenge is to break the partnership a little earlier. ""We showed a lot of fight, we have a huge amount of talent. It's been a magnificent day's cricket."" India captain Virat Kohli:""I said to the team that if we had had a good start then where could we have ended up today? MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh brought stability and wonders to the team, their batting rate was outstanding. ""A 380 target, we thought, was a bit too far-fetched, but we bowled at the most difficult phase because of the dew and the ball was very hard to execute - and the guys showed great character. ""If we had not picked out the wickets in the middle then I'm not sure where the game would have gone."" Man-of-the-match Yuvraj Singh:""In the domestic season I've been hitting the ball really well and I've been working hard on my fitness. The results showed today. ""Me and MS Dhoni understand the situations really well, we started by hitting the ball down the ground really well and not taking any risks. Then we attacked when the time was right."" ""Diet has been the key, as you pass 30 you've got to work hard on your fitness - I learned that from Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble, all the greats.""

Australia's Robertson started with 74, but O'Sullivan made 63 and 51 as the pair shared the first six frames. Neither player were at their best but Englishman O'Sullivan won the seventh, and a fluked red helped him take the next, before winning with a 68 break.

Brexit: The mind games,"Psychology is always part of tense negotiations. In her Lancaster House speech this weekTheresa May sought to seize back the advantagebefore the real battles start at the end of March.  She wanted Europe to know that Britain would not be coming to meetings on the defensive, cap in hand. During the 40 minutes of her speech she managed to shift the balance of power a little. A few days before she spoke I had been in Brussels and had spoken to a very senior European figure. He was pessimistic. Mrs May, in his view, did not have a good relationship with other European leaders. He thought the negotiations could ""go wrong from the start"" and was in no doubt that in those circumstances the UK would be the loser. He pointed out that Brexit was not high on the agenda for voters in the other 27 EU states. It was a way of saying that in the forthcoming negotiations the UK was the needy one. Britain would have to compromise. What he reflected is the widely-held view in the EU that the divorce will be messy, that real damage will be done to the British economy. Mrs May chose to exude confidence. The UK was determined to become a ""champion of world trade"" and was unafraid of negotiations turning difficult. The message was delivered with clarity and was intended to shape the mindset of those with whom Britain would be negotiating. Donald Trump has intimated that he wants a fast-track trade deal with the UK Two factors had strengthened Mrs May's hand. Firstly, the intervention of Donald Trump. The president-elect declared he was willingto fast-track a trade deal with the UK.There was no more talk about Britain being consigned to the back of the queue. Secondly, and most importantly, the British economy has performed much better than was predicted. Consumer confidence has remained high and crucially the economy has bought Mrs May some political space and strengthened her hand. Her speech was conciliatory in part. She made it clear she wanted the EU to succeed and did not seek the unravelling of the European Union and wanted Britain to ""remain a good friend"". Brexit Live - rolling text and video updates Europe reacts to May's Brexit speech Theresa May Davos speech: UK will be a global leader on trade Donald Trump praises UK's Brexit decision That was an important gesture because it is quite clear that some of those who backed Brexit would relish the break-up of the EU. And her stance was in marked contrast to that of Mr Trump who predicted last weekend that ""others would leave"" and that it would be difficult to keep the EU together. One EU ambassador to the UK said it sounded like Nigel Farage had briefed Mr Trump. What Mr Trump has done is to encourage European leaders to circle the wagons by accusing Angela Merkel of making a ""catastrophic mistake"" with her welcoming of refugees, so chipping away at her authority. Mrs May, in contrast, was offering to be a good neighbour. But, much as she offered friendship, there was no disguising the fist inside the gloved hand. If there was any attempt to punish the UK for breaking away it would do ""calamitous self-harm"" she said and ""would not be the act of a friend"". Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico has warned against an agreement that would strengthen the UK at the expense of the EU Britain, if necessary, would go it alone. ""No deal would be better than a bad deal."" It was an attempt to seize the psychological advantage in the talks, by reducing the threat of them failing. She was clear that the UK was leaving the single market but sought a ""bold and ambitious free trade agreement"". If that was denied and high tariffs were introduced then Europe's leaders would have to answer to their voters. ""I do not believe,"" she said, ""that the EU's leaders will seriously tell German exporters, French farmers, Spanish fishermenâ¦ that they want to make them poorer, just to punish Britain and make a political point."" That was a way of saying that if the talks turned ugly then all sides would suffer damage but that Britain would not flinch from telling European voters that their leaders were putting ideology above economic self-interest. This is an important undercurrent to the negotiations. I have never seen Europe's leaders so unsure and anxious about the future of the European project. They genuinely fear that if another country was to leave it would mark the end of the EU. That is what underpins the unity they have shown so far. It is also why they insist that Britain must not be able to walk away with a deal that was better than they would have got by staying on the inside. Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico said it would not be ""right for the 27 remaining EU countries to emerge weakened and Britain strengthened"". So, in its negotiating strategy, the UK has to talk up the mutual economic benefits of compromise. Regarding the City of London, the message is that there is a mutual interest in its continued health. Here again, the UK is arguing that the EU needs access to pools of capital and it needs the financial skills that only the City offers. Protecting the pre-eminence of the City will be central to the UK's Brexit aims The UK also wanted to leave a threat on the table: that if a deal could not be done the UK would take any measure to protect its economy, including turning it into a low tax area on the edge of mainland Europe. May wanted to give her European audience some incentives. Firstly, that Europe needs the UK economy but also that it needed Britain's intelligence services and armed forces. She was not offering security as a bargaining chip but she knew her pitch would resonate in parts of Eastern Europe and the Baltic States where they have grown uncertain of the Nato umbrella and are grateful for the sight of British forces on training exercises. These are all strings that can be pulled as negotiations unfold over the next two years. For all the strategy that lay behind Mrs May's speech, the headline that resonated around Europe was that Britain was leaving the single market. Some European papers accused Britain of turning inwards and of being ""Little Britain"". The UK can live with those opinions but its position over the customs union is far more problematic. The UK wants to leave the customs union because it wants the freedom to negotiate trade deals with other countries. At the same time it wants to avoid tariffs and trade barriers. The prime minister has spoken of negotiating associate membership of the customs union with special access for certain sectors like car manufacturing. This will be a tough part of the negotiations. To other EU states it looks like the cherry-picking they have vowed to resist. Securing a trade agreement will take time and, almost certainly, some transitional arrangement. Mrs May, however, insists a trade deal can be negotiated within two years. That is hugely ambitious but she fears a transition would involve continuing to pay into the EU budget and accepting EU rules and that would be rejected by elements within her party. Failure, however, conjures up the danger of the UK going over the cliff edge without a deal. That is a powerful card for the other EU countries and for MEPs in the European parliament who will have to vote on all this. The dilemma for the 27 EU members is this: they believe it is necessary to demonstrate that leaving the EU is painful and risky. The UK must be seen to suffer, but the question is whether they can do that without hurting themselves. What Mrs May did was to remind Europe that it does not hold all the cards. This was round one in the psychology of doing a deal. Many European leaders did not like the message and warned that ""Britain can't dictate the terms of separation"", with the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, saying it would be like negotiating not with an EU member but with a '""third country"".

Amol Rajan: How newspapers reacted to May's speech,"Britain's newspapers are for the most part deeply hostile to the EU, and committed to making a success of Brexit. At the same time, they have created a narrative about the referendum result which casts it as a victory for the common man and woman against a liberal, metropolitan establishment that counts the mainstream media - whatever that now means - as its weapon of choice. This is one of the more pleasing ironies about the state of media in Britain today. A brief glance at this week's headlines gives ample evidence of what psychologists call confirmation bias - the tendency to interpret events in a way that accords with pre-existing prejudices. For papers who backed Leave, Theresa May's speech showed a stern commitment to freedom and love of country. The Mail, Sun, Telegraph and Express, who between them have done most to advance the Brexit cause, lauded the prime minister's speech. The Mail has been a strong backer of May, seeing her as much the most plausible Tory leader in the aftermath of David Cameron's resignation, and contrasting her ostensible gravitas with the lightweights in her cabinet. Just for clarity, I'm paraphrasing the Mail's position there rather than mine, and doing so based on several conversations with the most senior figures there. Picture choices matter so much in newspapers. I must say I am a very big fan of cartoons on front pages, as thisCharlie Hebdo front page,externalfrom my previous job shows you, and theMail's use of a cartoon,externalto show the prime minister looking defiant in a way redolent of the Dad's Army title sequence achieves its desired effect. Similarly theSun has her looking cheerful,externalnext to supportive furniture (the headline and sub-headline). The Telegraph and the Guardian use similar pictures but by using a much tighter crop, a blue background and a positive headline, the Telegraph seem to endorse the prime minister; whereas the Guardian seem to issue scepticism about her chances of success. Interestingly, the Financial Times, which like the Guardian backed Remain, also usesexactly the same picture,external, albeit with a different crop. Their headline, being longer than most of the others, equivocates. Wednesday's front pages alone provide ample evidence of the way the same events are interpreted in wildly different ways by different newspapers - always and without fail in accordance with their prejudices. In some ways, Fleet Street, as romantics like me still sometimes call it, is basically the industrialisation of confirmation bias. Does that matter, when newspapers are in swift decline? Of course it does, and hugely so. Despite their perpetual shrinkage, newspapers are still read by millions of people across Britain. Moreover, they exert huge - some would argue disproportionate - influence on the news agenda of broadcasters like the BBC, Sky and ITV. And in my experience, Westminster is still obsessed, to a really bizarre degree, with trying to influence newspapers. This was perhaps understandable 20 years ago; but today, when fake news goes viral, it seem strange to me how much politicians care about headlines on page 17 of daily publications. And yet they do. Which is why the other important point about Fleet Street is that it is strongly weighted toward Brexit, and in that sense in touch with voters who, albeit by a small margin, voted to Leave. Most papers are delighted with the referendum result and support the prime minister. Given the sheer complexity of Brexit negotiations, it's lucky for Theresa May that, despite having backed Remain herself, she can generally count on Britain's newspapers to back her every move in Brussels. That is not a luxury many previous prime ministers have enjoyed.

Netflix's gamble pays off,"Netflix took a decision to invest in original content Hundreds of movies disappeared from Netflix over 2016, the result of the streaming serviceâs decision to end several key content deals with top studios and distributors. It was a brave move - particularly given that its main rivals, such as Hulu, jumped at the chance to take on some of those titles Netflix decided it no longer wanted. The reason for the cull? Original content. Netflix was being bold - its aspirations were no longer to be your on-demand DVD collection, but instead the place where you discovered and consumed new and exclusive shows. So rather than pay money out to studios for the right to show existing content, it instead ploughed its cash into shows such as Stranger Things,The Crown, Luke Cage and theremake of Gilmore Girls. In 2016, those âNetflix Originalsâ - already a term you could argue has become synonymous with quality - came thick and fast. The firm said it produced 600 hours of original programming last year - and intends to raise that to about 1,000 hours in 2017. Its budget to achieve that is $6bn (Â£4.9bn) - a billion more than last year. On Wednesday we learned the company has been rewarded handsomely for putting its eggs in the original content basket. After hours trading on Wednesday saw the companyâs stock rise by as much as 9% on the news it had added 7.05 million new subscribers in the last three months of 2016. Thatâs far greater than the 5.2 million they had anticipated, and left them ending the year with 93.8 million subscribers in total - and an expectation of breaking the symbolic 100 million mark by the end of March. The kids of Stranger Things become overnight superstars - and helped earn Netflix millions In all, 2016 saw Netflix take in $8.83bn (Â£7.1bn) in revenue - with a profit of $186.7m (Â£151.6m). All looking good, then - but thereâs still work to do. In a letter to shareholders, Netflix underlined, as it is obliged to do, the potential risks to its success going forward - chiefly globalisation and competition. While international expansion has been rapid, with the majority of the new sign-ups are coming from outside of the US, it will require a lot of expenditure for Netflix to dominate with original content in the 189 other countries it serves. It has put some of its budget into non-English language shows, such as â3%â, a Portuguese sci-fi series. Intriguingly, Netflix noted that many English viewers opted to watch the dubbed version, providing an unexpected added audience. Still, when local TV players kick into action and give up so-called linear TV - episodes once a week, and so on - in favour of Netflixâs model thereâs a chance the companyâs head start could be clawed back. The company notes that theBBCbecame the first âmajor linear networkâ to push into a âbinge-firstâ strategy, and it expects American network HBO to follow suit pretty soon. The company also took a somewhat unusual political step in its earnings, drawing attention to the ongoing debate over so-called net neutrality. Net neutrality is the concept that all data traffic on the internet is treated equally - and that internet service providers (ISPs) cannot, for example, charge extra for data-heavy services like video streaming. The cost could be passed on to either companies like Netflix or the consumer - but is currently not allowed. However, there are concerns the incoming Trump administration may abolish the current laws that ensure net neutrality. Netflix said any weakening of net neutrality laws would not affect its business in any significant way, but stressed, as many advocates have done, that it would hinder competition across the board. âStrong net neutrality is important to support innovation and smaller firms,â the company wrote. ""No one wants ISPs to decide what new and potentially disruptive services can operate over their networks, or to favour one service over another. We hope the new US administration and Congress will recognise that keeping the network neutral drives job growth and innovation.â Finally, Netflix reiterated its reluctance to get into the business of broadcasting live sport - something the company argued was the last real incentive for someone to have a traditional cable or satellite subscription. My hunch there is that itâs biding its time. Netflix boss Reid Hastings said his company was not interested in going after sports rights Right now, sports rights - even for just one market - cost astronomical amounts of cash. But if big cable firms continue to be weakened by the likes of Netflix, their spending power will decrease. At which point the new players could see the prospect of getting a far better deal than if they were to go after it today. What Netflix has made clear is that itâs no longer content with signing up content to show only in select markets, itâs instead focusing on deals that can be shown in every country. How much would global rights to the Premier League be worth, I wonder?

Ben Wright: Is teetotal Trump in good company?,"As Donald Trump becomes US president on Friday many will reach for a drink. Washington DC will be whirl of parties, galas and balls. The celebrities may be skipping it this year but the US capital will still swing to the sound of clinking glasses and popping corks. Across the country, celebrating Trump supporters will toast his swearing-in with a drink while others will numb their nerves with booze. Around the world, alcohol will help with this historic transition. In north London, for instance, the Old Queens Head pub is throwing an Armageddon-themed party to mark the start of Donald Trump's presidency. But the man himself will not be boozing through his first hours as the most powerful politician in the world. In fact, he won't touch a drop of alcohol on Friday night or on any day of his presidency. ""I've never had a drink,"" Donald Trump told Fox News after his election last November. Unlike George W Bush, who was teetotal in office after giving up booze on his 40th birthday, Mr Trump has eschewed alcohol his whole life, making him a first among modern US presidents. Donald Trump's teetotalism stems from the early death of his older brother Freddie The reason for Mr Trump's sobriety is because his adored older brother Freddie died of illness stemming from alcoholism at the age of 42. ""It was a very tough period of time,"" he said, that convinced him never to drink. ""If you don't start you're never going have a problem. If you do start you might have a problem. And it's a tough problem to stop,"" Mr Trump told Fox. Who was second-longest serving US president? Tapes show Richard Nixon as Watergate scandal loomed BBC History: John F Kennedy What is fascinating is his view that one drink could spiral into addiction. He discussed his fear that he might have a gene that would make moderate drinking impossible. His approach to alcohol is also a window into a personality that appears to crave control over others. Mr Trump ordered his children to follow his example. Every day he would drum the message into them: No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. ""I've been very tough on my children with respect to drink,"" he said. So how do the teetotal presidents compare with those who enjoyed the pleasures of a drink? George W Bush went dry after years of heavy boozing and swapped a compulsion for drink for an obsession with fitness. Remembered largely for the invasion of Iraq, George W's foreign policy record might not be seen as the best advertisement for a teetotal presidency. Franklin Roosevelt (right) had a particular reverence for ""cocktail hour"" Nor might the idealistic but muddled foreign policy of Jimmy Carter, another teetotal president. Life in the Carter White House was drearily dry and a chore for its more sociable visitors. Senator Ted Kennedy remembered arid evenings of earnest discussion. ""You'd arrive about 6.00 or 6.30pm, and the first thing you would be reminded of, in case you needed reminding, was that he and Rosalynn had removed all the liquor in the White House. No liquor was ever served during Jimmy Carter's term. He wanted no luxuries nor any sign of worldly living,"" Kennedy wrote. The moderate drinkers fare better. Franklin D Roosevelt frequently tops the list of America's greatest presidents, the commander-in-chief who defeated the Great Depression and led the US through World War Two. Throughout these turbulent years, FDR kept a martini close at hand and prized the rituals of cocktail hour, when he mixed stiff drinks for friends on his White House study desk. The conviviality of cocktail hour undoubtedly helped FDR unwind and briefly relieved the immense pressure he was under. John F Kennedy would occasionally sip a daiquiri but preferred women to wine and kept a clear head through the brinkmanship of the Cuban Missile Crisis. But other presidents were more reckless with their drinking. Both Johnson and Kennedy enjoyed a drink Lyndon Johnson was well known in Washington for his capacity to guzzle Cutty Sark whisky and soda when he was Democratic majority leader in the Senate, a habit he took to the White House. Johnson, who told his doctor after a heart attack that the only things he enjoyed in life were ""whisky, sunshine and sex"", enjoyed entertaining at his Texas ranch where the booze flowed. LBJ's special assistant for domestic affairs, Joseph A Califano, remembered a ride around the ranch with the president: ""As we drove around we were followed by a car and a station wagon with Secret Service agents. The president drank Cutty Sark scotch and soda out of a large, white, plastic foam cup. ""Periodically, Johnson would slow down and hold his left arm outside the car, shaking the cup and ice. A Secret Service agent would run up to the car, take the cup and go back to the station wagon. There another agent would refill it with ice, scotch and soda as the first agent trotted behind the wagon."" But the most disturbing picture of presidential drinking is provided by Richard Nixon, a man prone to morose self-pity who medicated his moods with booze. According to his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, Nixon's trouble was that a small amount of drink would set him off and late-night threats of military action were made when the president was the worse for wear. When North Korea shot down a US spy plane in April 1969, an enraged Nixon allegedly ordered a tactical nuclear strike and told the joint chiefs to recommend targets. According to the historian Anthony Summers, citing the CIA's top Vietnam specialist at the time, George Carver, Henry Kissinger spoke to military commanders on the phone and agreed not to do anything until Nixon sobered up in the morning. Henry Kissinger allegedly witnessed the effects of Richard Nixon's drinking By the early 1970s, Watergate was beginning to choke Nixon's presidency and the president was relying more on drink and sleeping pills to cope with the pressure. On the evening of 11 October 1973, he was incapable of speaking to the British Prime Minister Edward Heath on the phone. Heath was keen to discuss the latest developments of the Arab-Israeli War but a transcript of the conversation between Henry Kissinger and his assistant Brent Scowcroft revealed the president was too drunk to talk to the prime minister. Richard Nixon was a warning to future presidents on the danger of mixing hubris with drink. He is a reminder too of the awesome executive power a US president has when it comes to conducting foreign affairs. With no previous political or military experience, Donald Trump is unlike any incoming president. His hubris is clear to all and his (sober) stream of excitable tweets prove an impetuous temperament. Nixon's example might make us grateful booze is not in the mix too. But some of the most successful presidents found valuable perspective and balance at the bottom of a glass.

Ways the world has already changed,"Man in the mirror: It has been a whirlwind few weeks since Mr Trump won the US presidency Shortly after Donald Trump's shock win in the US election, the BBC consideredthe ways the world could change. Long-standing US domestic and foreign policies, such as a commitment to free trade and membership of Nato, all face an overhaul. But events have moved fast. Here's how Mr Trump's incoming presidency has already changed the world. The final days of the Obama administration might have been very different, with the outgoing president handing over safe in the knowledge that his signature policies will be protected by another Democrat. Instead, his administration has gone on the defensive, scrambling to protect his legacy, laying down what Mr Trump has called ""roadblocks"". There have been sanctions against Russians, a ban on offshore energy drilling, a refusal to veto a UN call to end Israeli settlements and a last-minute rush of deals with Cuba. All of these conflict with pronouncements made by Mr Trump, and could at the very least make life more difficult for the president-elect. What marks does Obama's presidency deserve? The campaign was dogged by baseless stories shared on social media, from a claim that actor Denzel Washington had endorsed Mr Trump (he didn't) to thenotorious ""pizzagate"" conspiracy. After criticism from users, arguably the key gatekeeper, Facebook, announced measures to tackle the problem of fake news. The fake ""pizzagate"" story had real consequences when a man fired shots in the restaurant at the centre of the conspiracy The higher-than-high stakes election did more than anything to highlight the problem, and America was not the only country affected. In Italy, for instance, there were concerns fake news had influenced last month's constitutional referendum. Social media giants face a tricky 2017, trying to balance the freedom enjoyed by their users with a new, unfamiliar role as arbiter-in-chief, perhaps assuming an even bigger role in our lives. World stock markets have enjoyed a strong run since Mr Trump's election, thanks, analysts say, to investors' belief he will boost infrastructure and cut taxes when in office. Mr Trump promised to be the ""greatest jobs president that God ever created"" and has taken credit for a slew of company announcements. But while the Donald may giveth, the Donald can also taketh away. Companies, whole sectors even, have seen share prices rattled by Mr Trump, with some traders reportedly adapting their algorithms to respond instantly to his tweets. Pharmaceutical firms, for instance, were hit during a press conference when Mr Trump said they were ""getting away with murder"". Trump on Twitter: A history of the man and his medium Some of Mr Trump's angriest rhetoric has been directed at China. Beijing was infuriated by a phone call he took from Taiwan's leader, in defiance ofthe ""One China"" policy. But while Mr Trump seems to be squaring up to China, could China see a Trump presidency as an opportunity? Xi Jinping became the first Chinese president to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he defended globalisation, a pointed rebuke to Mr Trump's attacks on free trade. Mr Xi told Davos delegates there was ""no point"" in blaming globalisation for the world's problems China has been stepping up its economic leadership, pushing an expanded free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region. And it could position itself as a leader on climate change, too, with the country's Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin saying it was no Chinese hoax, and that a change in US policy would not affect Beijing's commitment to the issue. Hillary Clinton may have missed her chance to become the first female US president, but could a Trump presidency spur other women to shatter that ultimate glass ceiling? Several groups dedicated to getting more women into politics have seena surge in new members and donations. This video can not be played The new US congress is the most diverse ever - but is it enough? The election was ""the kick in the pants that I needed"", as one woman now hoping to run for office put it. And while the US has a disproportionately low number of women in politics, this already seems to be changing with the largest number yet elected to Congress in 2017. Mr Trump had no shortage of detractors during the election, be they foreign powers, business leaders or members of his own party. But it didn't take long for them to come around. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who all but disowned Mr Trump in the campaign, pledged on election night to work ""hand-in-hand"" with the next US leader. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson once declared Donald Trump ""unfit"" to hold the presidency, before calling for an end to the ""whinge-o-rama"" over his win. Tech leaders, many of whom had railed against Mr Trump, ended up meeting him at Trump Tower. Perhaps refusing to work with the new president simply is not an option. But are his new fans meeting him on common ground, or has Mr Trump dragged the US - and the rest of the world - to uncharted territory?

What time is Trump president?,"This video can not be played Trump's inauguration: An insider's tour Hundreds of thousands of people poured into Washington to watch Donald Trump being sworn in as the 45th US president. All eyes were on the US Capitol as Mr Trump formally replaced President Barack Obama in the White House. Here is a guide to the historic transition. The newly elected US president is sworn into office by the Chief Justice of the United States every four years by noon (17:00 GMT) on 20 January, as prescribed by the US Constitution. Historically, the incoming president was inaugurated on 4 March, but the period of delay was shortened when the 20th Amendment was ratified in 1933. Was Obama second-longest serving US president? The tweets that say so much and reveal so little Will Trump's election lead to more women in politics? The oath is part of a ceremony marking the peaceful transition of power on the steps in front of the US Capitol. The ceremony is then followed by a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue and later celebrated through a series of inaugural balls. An estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people are expected to travel to Washington for the inauguration 1.Trump leaves from Blair House on Friday morning2.St John's Episcopal Church for morning service3.White House coffee with Obama4.US Capitol for Oath of office and address5.National Mall, where spectators watch parade6.Trump walks past his hotel as he leads the parade to his new home FRIDAY, 20 JANUARY Mr Trump attended a morning service at St John's Episcopal Church near the White House Mr Trump and his wife, Melania, had coffee with President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. 10:30 (15:30 GMT)The couples took a motorcade to the Capitol. Inauguration ceremony began with musical performances 11:30 (16:30 GMT)Opening remarks followed by Supreme Court Justice swearing in Mr Pence 11:45-12:00 (16:45 - 17:00 GMT)President Obama's term of office ended at precisely noon. Mr Trump took the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice Roberts, at 12:00 (17:00 GMT). He then delivered his inaugural address 13:00-15:45 (18:00-20:45 GMT)President Trump signed a series of documents in a room at the US Capitol before dining with lawmakers at the inaugural luncheon 15:45-17:00 (20:45-22:00 GMT)Mr Trump and Mr Pence embarked on a 1.5 mile (2.4km) parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House 19:00-23:00 (00:00-04:00 GMT)Mr Trump, Mr Pence and their wives will attend three official inaugural balls SAT, 21 JANUARY 10:00 (15:00 GMT)Mr Trump and Mr Pence attend the interfaith National Prayer Service at the Washington National Cathedral 10:00 (15:00 GMT)The Women's March on Washington begins President Obama and the first lady accompanied Mr Trump in a motorcade to the US Capitol for the official ceremony, where they were joined by members of Congress, politicians as well as supporters. Former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, who lost to Mr Trump in November's election, are attending. George W Bush and his wife, Laura, as well as Jimmy Carter, are also there. George HW Bush, who was inhospital for respiratory problems, wrote a letter to Mr Trump wishing him well and apologising for missing the event due to health concerns. An estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people were expected to flood the nation's capital on Friday for the inauguration, but it is unclear whether they will be there in celebration or protest, officials said. President Barack Obama drew an estimated 1.8 million people to Washington when he took office eight years ago. More than 1.8 million people attended President Obama's 2009 inauguration The ""level of enthusiasm"" and demand for hotel rooms has not reached that of previous inaugurations, according to Elliott Ferguson, president of Destination DC, the city's convention and tourism bureau. In fact, some hotels have reduced the minimum-night stay from four nights to two. Other hotels are only 50% full, but higher-end hotels appeared to have more bookings, he added. More than 50 House Democrats are publicly refusing to attend the ceremony amid a feud between the newly elected president and the civil rights activist and congressman, John Lewis. Mr Lewis is among the congressmen who will not be in attendance. Some lawmakers have said they will instead attend the Women's March on Washington, a protest set to take place a day after the inauguration. Trump inauguration boycott escalates Several demonstrations both protesting and supporting Mr Trump will take place around the city over the weekend. Most notably, the Women's March on Washington is estimated to draw crowds of 200,000 people on 21 January. It sets out to demonstrate for racial and gender equality, affordable healthcare, abortion rights and voting rights - issues perceived to be under threat from a Trump presidency. The motorcycle group Bikers for Trump will also host a rally for the incoming president after the ceremony and before the inauguration parade. Other protests include: Anti-war and anti-nuclear weapons rally attended by former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein #DisruptJ20 Festival of Resistance, organised by the DC Counter-Inaugural Welcoming Committee #Trump420 march, hosted by marijuana advocates who plan to hand out 4,200 free joints (which is legal in Washington) Mr Trump has enlisted the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Radio City Rockettes, country stars Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood, 3 Doors Down as well as America's Got Talent contestant and singer Jackie Evancho to perform over the course of two days. Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight also spoke at the welcome concert, telling the crowd: ""God answered all our prayers"" by electing Mr Trump. This video can not be played Trump's 'soft sensuality' inauguration Evancho, 16, who took second place on the talent show, sang the national anthem. The Trump transition team had reportedly struggled to secure high-profile entertainers. A number of artists turned down the opportunity to play, including Elton John, Welsh singer Charlotte Church and American DJ Moby. Dreamgirls star Jennifer Holliday announced she had dropped an inauguration performance to stand in solidarity with the LGBT community while a Bruce Springsteen tribute band also decided to skip the event out of respect for the Boss, who is vocally critical of Mr Trump. The newly sworn-in president and vice-president will also stop by three official inaugural balls, which are typically attended by the incoming administration's supporters. The soon-to-be 45th president has vowed to roll back many of Mr Obama's policies on ""day one"" in office, but it is unclear whether that begins on Friday or Monday. The new White House press secretary, Sean Spicer,tweeted,externalthat the president was signing three things in a ceremony at an ornate room within the US Capitol: a waiver bill enabling Gen James Mattis to serve as Defence Secretary, the formal nominations to go to the Senate, and a proclamation for a national ""day of patriotism"". But Mr Trump hadtold the Times,externalearlier this week that ""day one"" would not begin until Monday. ""I mean my day one is going to be Monday because I don't want to be signing and get it mixed up with lots of celebration,"" he told the newspaper.

Boris's war of words,"If you ever wanted to see what Boris Johnson would look like mocked up as Steve McQueen in The Great Escape, then look no further than the Sun. It says the foreign secretary was ""defiant"",externalafter being criticised for comparing French President Francois Hollande to a guard in a World War Two escape movie. The paper mocks those who took offence as ""delicate flowers"" and hopes Theresa May does not ""lock Boris in the cooler"" - the punishment usually given to McQueen for his attempted break-outs. The Times says Mr Johnson ""ruffled feathers"",externalwith his words, while theDaily Mirror calls him ""oafish"",externaland says he put fragile relations at risk. The Daily Express sees him fighting back against EU bullies,external, while theDaily Telegraph dismisses the row,externalas a ""phoney controversy"". It says Mr Johnson was just being ""characteristically colourful"" with his words. But one of his loudest critics, the European Parliament's leading Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, is making his voice heard again. In an article for the Guardian,external, he says Britain's demands heading into talks with the EU are ""unreasonable"". ""It is an illusion to suggest that the UK will be permitted to leave the European Union but then be free to opt back into the best parts of the project,"" he says, before concluding that Brexit will be ""a sad and exhausting process"". On its front page, theTimes says cost-cutting measures by the NHS have raised fears,externalabout patient safety. It says one in five newly-approved drugs could be rationed by NHS England to save money, even if they have been judged cost-effective by doctors, so patients will suffer longer waits for medication. Cancer charities tell the paper the change will be devastating to patients. The Times also says drug companies will no longer launch new medicines early in Britain. NHS England has declined to comment. British tourists who had been hoping to soak up some winter sun in The Gambia are packing their bags and ""scrambling"" to leave,according to the Guardian,external, after a political crisis caused the Foreign Office to advise against travel there. ""There is panic,"" says one tourist official. The Sun says British travellers have complained of shambolic organisation. The Times says the scenes of crisis,externalare depressingly predictable. President Yahya Jammeh can avert bloodshed by doing the right thing, it says, or condemn his country to isolation and be remembered as a pariah. The i newspaper,externalsuggests that an ""evocative slice of authentic Americana"", painted by none other than Bob Dylan, might actually be a picture of the pier at Blackpool. Sharp-eyed observers who saw the watercolour at a London gallery found it was identical to a picture posted on the internet by a British photographer. Even a bird on a lamp-post was identical.The photographer tells the Telegraph,externalhe is not angry but ""astonished"" that his work has been appropriated by a Nobel laureate - and labelled as being Norfolk, Virginia. The paper suggests the singer was perhaps unconsciously influenced by playing three concerts at Blackpool's Winter Gardens in 2013.

Who's performing at Trump's big day?,"Althougha host of big names have turned him down, Donald Trump has gathered a number of stars for his official inauguration celebrations. Meanwhile, other stars are appearing at alternative and anti-Trump events. The official inauguration celebrations kicked off on Thursday with the Make America Great Again! concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC as part of the Welcome Celebration. The bill included hard rockers 3 Doors Down (above), who have had two US number one albums. Country singer Toby Keith joined them at the event. He released a statement explaining his decision. ""I don't apologise for performing for our country or military,"" he said. ""I performed at events for previous presidents Bush and Obama and over 200 shows in Iraq and Afghanistan for the USO [United Service Organizations]."" Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight also put in an appearance. He endorsed Mr Trump during the presidential election campaign, saying Mr Trump is ""an answer to our problems"" and ""will save our nation"". During his speech on Thursday, Voight said: ""We have been witnessed to a barrage of propaganda that left us all breathless with anticipation, not knowing if God could reverse all the negative lies against Mr Trump, whose only desire was to make America great again."" American-Indian DJ RaviDrums provided further entertainment.He said he was ""on the fence"",externalwhen he was first asked to perform. ""But I talked to my dad and he said this is a great honour. My dad came to America from India with $8 and a one-way ticket to pursue the American dream. This is the dream!"" But - although Dreamgirls star Jennifer Holliday was announced as a performer at the concert, shedropped out after a vicious backlash,external. ""I woke up, and there was like this whole thing of terrible tweets and things on my Instagram,"" she said. ""I live a pretty reclusive life. I pretty much stay to myself. You're not on the radio and then one morning you wake up and everybody hates you."" The honour of singing the national anthem during the main inauguration event itself on Fridayhas gone to 16-year-old Jackie Evancho, who came second on America's Got Talent in 2010. Sam Moore, of legendary soul duo Sam and Dave, will lead the line-up at Liberty and Freedom: The Official Presidential Inaugural Balls. He said: ""I was a participant in the civil rights movement and have seen many positive changes and advancement in my 81 years of living in this wonderful country, but I know we must all join hands and work together with our new president."" The Radio City Rockettes will also turn on the style at the official balls - even though the decisioncaused consternation among some members of the troupe. Other performers at the balls will include Tim Rushlow and his Big Band, Silhouettes, Pelican212, The Piano Guys, Circus 1903, Cache Olson, Lexi Walker and Erin Boheme. There are alternatives to the official balls - the Peace Ball, for liberal activists, will feature Solange Knowles. Grammy-winning jazz musician Esperanza Spalding will also star at the Peace Ball in Washington. Rock band Audioslave will play their first concert for 11 years at an Anti-Inaugural Ball in Los Angeles, organised by rock/hip-hop crossover band Prophets of Rage on Friday. Veteran folk rocker Jackson Browne - who initially supported Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders - will play at the same anti-Trump event.

Brexit donor launches news website,"This video can not be played Amol Rajan reports on the launch of the Westmonster website Arron Banks, the former UKIP donor who bankrolled the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, is making a move into the media sector by backing an anti-establishment news website. I can reveal thatWestmonster,externalis co-owned by Michael Heaver, former press adviser to Nigel Farage. The 27-year-old, who together with Mr Banks will own 50% of the website, will edit it day to day. Modelled on theDrudge Report,external, the American aggregator site that generates huge traffic, Westmonster will be powered by the social media reach of Leave.EU, the campaign to which Mr Banks gave close to Â£7m - the largest donation in British political history. Leave.EU has nearly800,000 followers,externalon Facebook and Mr Heaver believes he can use that base to generate substantial traffic from day one. Westmonster will publish some original news, and Mr Heaver hopes to enlist more celebrity writers than backbench MPs. The site will launch with an article from Nigel Farage, and Mr Heaver is open about wanting to ape the opinionated, anti-establishment, highly provocative tone ofBreitbart.,external This launch is significant for several reasons. It shows that the anti-establishment media which helped to power the campaign of Donald Trump is coming to Britain. It's no coincidence that Westmonster is launching the day before Mr Trump's inauguration - an event that will be attended, almost alone among Brits, by Nigel Farage, Arron Banks, and Mr Banks's business associate Andy Wigmore, who are together hosting a celebratory party on Saturday night in a hotel across the road from the White House. Banks has booked out an entire floor of the Hay-Adams Hotel on Saturday night, and - logistics permitting - the plan is for the new President to attend, along with his close friend the Governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant. It also marks a significant acceleration of Mr Banks's involvement in British public life. I spent time with him in the nondescript offices of his insurance company on the edge of Bristol on Tuesday, with a Premier Inn on one side and the M4-M5 junction on the other. Arron Banks donated millions to the Brexit campaign He is an extremely intriguing character, as thissuperb profilefor Radio 4 pointed out. Hetweets vigorously,externaland his politics do not fit into the anachronistic right-left spectrum through which so much of Westminster is still naively interpreted. For instance, he favours nationalisation of Britain's railways and some utilities over their present near-monopoly status, harbours a visceral hatred of many Tories, and has had several conversations with Labour MPs about wooing them over to the populist Momentum-style movement that he intends to launch in the coming months. I alsorevealed in Decemberthat he has expressed interest in more traditional media - that is, The Daily Telegraph. Now, as I put to him yesterday, he has become Britain's latest media baron. He helps to show how the rise of digital media has not so much blurred the distinction between media and politics as abolished it; how the culture wars raging in the US are being imported here; and how traditional media - including the BBC - face ferocious competition like never before.

'Twerking man' among ad complaints list,"Moneysupermarket's ""twerking businessman"" featured in two adverts Moneysupermarket's twerking businessman in high heels and Paddy Power's cat-kicking blind footballers were some of the most-complained-about ads of 2016. Moneysupermarket's dancing bodyguard Gary, twerking businessman Dave and dancing builder Colin were all in the top 10, the advertising watchdog said. The Paddy Power advert was first shown in 2010 but still drew 450 complaints. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said none on the list ""crossed the line"" from bad taste to offence. Three Moneysupermarket price comparison website adverts attracted 2,491 complaints between them. Some viewers found the bodyguard's dance moves ""distasteful"", and the ads with the businessman and the builder as homophobic. 1. MoneySuperMarket.com (dancing bodyguard) 1,063 2.

Mars/Maltesers (disability) 151 Source: Advertising Standards Authority An advert for dating website Match.com showing a woman removing her female partner's top and kissing her received 896 complaints. It was seen as sexually explicit and inappropriately scheduled. The Paddy Power advert featured men playing blind football and inadvertently kicking a cat due to the sound of a bell round its neck. The ASA had already ruled the majority of viewers would see the advert as humorous and not humiliating or undermining to blind people, and so did not investigate it again. The bookmaker's advert about Scottish football fans not minding not qualifying for Euro 2016 - because they could bet on England to lose - was complained about for being racist and anti-English. Also in the top 10 were Smart Energy's Gaz and Leccy cartoon characters, the Home Office's Disrespect Nobody domestic violence campaign, Maltesers featuring a woman in a wheelchair and Gourmet Burger Kitchen's references to giving up vegetarianism. The complaint about the Home Office's ad was that it implied only men were responsible for domestic abuse and it could discourage male victims from coming forward. ASA chief executive Guy Parker said: ""The ads that attract the highest number of complaints are often not the ones that need banning. ""Our action leads to thousands of ads being amended or withdrawn each year, mostly for being misleading, but there wasn't one misleading ad in the top 10. ""In the list there are a number of ads, which while advertising their product or service, have also sought to present a positive statement about diversity but were in fact seen by some as doing the opposite. ""In all those cases, we thought people generally would see the ads in a positive light and that the boundary between bad taste and serious or widespread offence had been navigated well enough, often through using sensible scheduling restrictions.""

Sir Patrick Stewart to star as poo emoji,"Sir Patrick Stewart is joined by James Corden in the cast of the animated film He has played many of Shakespeare's greats and been lauded for film roles in Star Trek and X-Men.

Vegemite back in Australian ownership,"This video can not be played Vegemite is back under Australian ownership after it is sold by US food giant Mondelez. Vegemite will return to Australian ownership after Bega Cheese agreed to buy a range of well-known food brands in a deal worth A$460m (Â£280m; $345m). Bega said it would acquire Vegemite, ZoOSH mayonnaise and Bonox beef extract from Mondelez International. The deal will also give the dairy producer the right to use the Kraft brand under licence. Mondelez announced it would now focus on ""core brands"" in Australia and New Zealand including Cadbury and Oreos. Vegemite - a dark-coloured, Vitamin-B rich, bitter but apparently addictive yeast extract - is a national icon. Fans of Vegemite spread it on sandwiches or toast, and sometimes mix it with cheese, salad and peanut butter. ""The wonderful heritage and values that Vegemite represents and its importance to Australian culture makes its combination with Bega Cheese truly exciting,"" Bega executive chairman Barry Irvin said. For decades, Australians bemoaned the loss the brand to the US-owned Kraft in 1935, though it is still manufactured in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Mondelez took control of the brand in 2012 after a restructuring at Kraft. Mondelez International vice president Amanda Banfield said: ""It's been a privilege stewarding this brand, which is found in almost every Australian household and is part of the fabric of the nation.""

New secondary school league tables19 January 2017 (09:08:50),"As new-style secondary school league tables for England are published, the BBC News website takes you through the changes that are taking place this year. Until this year, secondary school performance has been judged mainly by what proportion of pupils get five GCSEs at grade A*-C, including English and maths. Instead two new measures, known asAttainment 8,externalandProgress 8,external, have been adopted. These will now be used by the government to judge whether schools are performing adequately. For many years, teachers and heads had complained that to judge a school by its results in five GCSEs alone was unfair, because it did not offer broader information about the ability of the pupils being taught. Obviously if a high-achieving child comes to a school, it will not take as much effort to get them to a good GCSE grade as it would a lower-achieving child. So schools which were working with more challenging pupils with low prior attainment were effectively marked down in the league tables, because this extra challenge was not considered. There was also concern that the benchmark only assessed pupils who got results at grade C and above. The new measure takes into account achievement from grades A*-G. Taphereto search for the results for your area. In basic terms, it aims to measure how well a school is serving its pupils by looking at where they started and where they end up. It does this by looking at attainment in eight GCSE, or equivalent, subjects from grade A*-G for each pupil. These results are then compared against the results of other pupils who came into secondary schools nationally with the same attainment levels. A figure for those results across the school year group is then calculated. This result is then set within confidence levels, which set out how accurate the government believes the Progress 8 score is. Progress 8 scores generally fall somewhere between -1 and 1. The number (which is pretty abstract to all but the statisticians, as Progress 8 scores generally fall somewhere between -1 and 1) is then placed into one of five bands: well above average above average average below average well below average. It is these bandings which will be of most use to parents. Attainment 8 is about the raw results across individual pupils' best eight subjects. But they are not just any old subjects. English and maths are compulsory - and worth double points. Then there is the choice of three subjects from theEnglish Baccalaureate,external(core academic subjects), and any other three from the DfE's approved list of qualifications - including vocational qualifications. The results are only recorded at the school level and an average score per pupil is calculated and published. The maximum number of points per school is 80 points per pupil. The national average across all state secondary school is 49.9 this year. The short answer is that it is thought to be fairer to see a pupil's best achievement across a broader spectrum of subjects. Teachers and head teachers had complained that the five good GCSEs measure was too narrow. They also argued that the more recently introduced English Baccalaureate was too prescriptive and only relevant for the more academic students. If attainment across a broader range of subjects are be counted, then arts subjects and vocational qualifications count for something in school accountability as well. This has been a key concern, because the new measures are more complicated to read than the old tables based on five GCSE scores. Progress 8 scores are far more abstract in that they generally fall somewhere between -1 and 1. However, there are some figures in brackets below each score on the tables which measure how confident statisticians are that the figure above is accurate. When the DfE trialled the new measures on panels of parents, many were confused by these scores and so the banded descriptions were introduced to aid understanding. Secondary head teachers say that while is important for parents to look at a school's Progress 8 score, they should focus broadly on the descriptions such as ""above average"". Parents may also wish to look at schools' Attainment 8 scores to have an overall idea of how they  perform on GCSE results. School performance measures are used just as much by officials to monitor standards and ultimately Progress 8 is an accountability measure. A school is considered potentially failing if its Progress 8 score falls in the well below average band. No, these new measures apply to England only. However, there have been changes in terms of school accountability recently in Wales and Scotland. Data on how well Scottish pupils doin reading, writing and numeracy was published for the first time, as part of a new Curriculum for Excellence. The Welsh Assembly hasrecently reintroduced the publication of performance information,after abolishing it in 2001, in an attempt to raise standards. Schools are now given a colour code - green, yellow, amber or red - according to how well they are performing. School league tables are not published in Northern Ireland.

How safe is Sophie the Giraffe?18 January 2017 (08:30:16),"It has been a favourite with children, and parents, for generations. But after mould was found inside the toy by some parents, people online and at home are asking: ""Just how safe is my Sophie the Giraffe?"" First launched in 1961, it is a squeaky toy giraffe, made from 100% natural rubber. Children seem to enjoy chewing on it, especially when they are teething. Tens of millions have been sold over the years, and its easy-to-grab shape means that paediatricians, as well as dentists have recommended it. There have been at least two cases reported of parents finding mould in the toy. And because Sophie is so ubiquitous, the issue has become a real talking point. Dentist Dana Chianese from New Jersey reported noticing air coming out of a hole in the toy that smelled musty. So she cut it open, only to find ""smelly, ugly mould"",externalliving in the toy. And almost a year ago, Stephanie Oprea from the US posted areview on Amazon,externalreporting a similar problem. ""Beware. If you have a drooly baby, moisture will get in the hole and you'll end up with mould. We've had ours for two years and the entire inside is coated with black mould,"" she wrote. This week - after her review was picked up by media - she added: ""I realise this will not be everyone's experience, but it was mine."" Sophie has a hole that lets air in and out, and which makes the toy squeezable. But that also means moisture can get inside. This liquid is usually either the saliva of a child chewing the giraffe, or the result of parents cleaning it. Mould needs two things to grow - water and warmth - and so over time, mould can grow inside the toy. Mould spores are in the air that we breathe every day, so most people, babies and adults, can deal with them. Most doctors agree that while it is not ideal that children are exposed to mould, most moulds are fairly harmless unless the child has an extremely susceptible immune system. Dr Richard Loh, a consultant immunologist at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Perth, Western Australia said that in his more than 20 years in the field, he was not aware of any research linking mould on toys to health concerns. ""Mould is all around us. If your child is in the park, picking up leaves and bits of grass, licking them and chewing them, there'll be mould there. We encounter mould a lot and in general we do not get ill. ""Would I knowingly give a child a toy with mould on it? Of course not. But if I discovered it afterwards, there'd be no need to be horrified or worried."" Dr Loh added there were extremely rare cases where people were allergic to mould. And he stressed severely mouldy environments, such as rooms left damp after flooding, could pose a health risk. Sophie the Giraffe is made by French firm Vuilli, (which incidentally calls it Sophie la Girafe). Vuilli said it had not been sent the mouldy toys for inspection, but that complaints were taken seriously and that children's safety, along with parental satisfaction, were its main priorities. It also said there were clear instructions on how to clean the toy correctly - including wiping with a damp cloth rather than immersing it in water and not putting it in the microwave or steam steriliser. Giraffes aren't the only animals at risk It seems not. ""If you take any bath toy that has been in the water and played with for a long time, then you cut it open, there's a good chance you'll find mould,"" Dr Loh said. And so while the giraffe seems to be at the heart of this particular story, things like rubber ducks are also susceptible.

Alkaline swindle,"The father of the alkaline diet, Robert O Young, is hailed as an inspiration by one of the UK's most popular food writers, Natasha Corrett, but he faces a jail sentence for practising medicine without a licence. One patient who believed he could cure her cancer, British army officer Naima Houder-Mohammed, paid thousands of dollars for his alkaline treatment, which consisted mainly of intravenous infusions of baking soda. In May 2009 Naima Houder-Mohammed was commissioned as a captain in the British army. The following year, tragedy struck. Naima was diagnosed with breast cancer. She received treatment and was declared cancer-free. But in 2012, while training with the army skiing team, it was discovered the cancer had returned. Her condition was so serious she was offered end-of-life care. ""She refused to accept that this was the end,"" recalls her friend and former fellow officer, Afzal Amin. ""Naima was a fighter. She fought to get through selection for Sandhurst. She fought through Sandhurst and she fought her way through her life in everything she dealt with - army skiing or whatever it may have been. And this for her was another fight in that long list of victories."" Naima Houder-Mohammed As her medical options were limited, Naima did what many of us would do - she turned to the internet for a solution. She came across Dr Robert O Young, an American alternative health writer selling a message of hope for cancer patients online. Naima began an email correspondence with him, which reveals how pseudo-science can be used to manipulate the vulnerable. Young is the author of a series of books called the pH Miracle, which has sold more than four million copies around the world. These books lay out his ""alkaline approach"" to food and health which has influenced many others, including the work of the British clean-eating guru Natasha Corrett, whose Honestly Healthy brand promotes her take on an alkaline diet. In the introduction to her book Honestly Healthy Cleanse, the food writer says acidity in the body causes ""dis-ease"", which can show itself in ""everyday discomforts"" like acne, dry skin and bloating, ""to much more serious illnesses, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and obesity"" She says Young ""discovered that eating a plant-based diet free from processed foods can help to cure terminal diseases in the body"" She adds that his work is not recognised by the medical industry, ""perhaps because giant pharmaceutical organisations wouldn't be able to make money out of doctors prescribing vegetables"" In one email Young sent to Naima in July 2012, he told her ""there is a great need for a daily regime focused onâ¦ hyper-perfusing the blood with alkalinity"". He went on: ""I would suggest your healing program is going to take at least 8 - 12 weeks. It will not be easy but you will be in a controlled environment that will give you the care you need."" Naima set about raising the money she would need -  in one email Young mentioned a figure of $3,000 (Â£2,440) per day. Naima's family used their savings, ran fund-raising events and managed to pull together tens of thousands of pounds with the help of a charity so that Naima could be treated by Young. But the treatment did not have the outcome she was hoping for. Email from Robert O Young to Naima Houder-Mohammed On one recent sun-kissed Californian morning, we drove up into the hills outside San Diego to visit Young. As we turned off Paradise Mountain Road, the parched golden grass eventually gave way to groves of avocado trees and we entered a millionaire's paradise known as the ""pH Miracle Ranch"". The front door, preposterously set behind a moat, is reached by walking across some stone slabs. As Young welcomed us into the ranch, our eyes were drawn to an empty spherical fish-tank built into the wall that separated the living area from the kitchen. Noting our interest, he began to share his alkaline view of the world, starting with what he calls the fish-bowl metaphor. ""If the fish is sick - what would you do? Treat the fish or change the water?"" He went on: ""The human body in its perfect state of health is alkaline in its design."" This video can not be played Inside the ""ph Miracle Ranch"" of Robert Young The pH of our blood is 7.4, which is slightly alkaline, so Young is broadly correct - although different compartments of our bodies, such as our stomach, function at very different pHs. But then Young's ""alkaline living"" vision becomes complete fantasy. Young believes that in order to maintain the pH of our blood, we have to eat ""alkaline"" foods. The main problem with this view is that it doesn't appear to take into account the stomach, which functions at a pH of about 1.5 and is the most acidic compartment in the body. Thus, everything we consume, regardless of its starting pH, becomes acidic before passing into the intestines. Also, the categorisation of foods into alkaline or acidic does not appear to follow any consistent rules, with certain citrus fruits (full of citric acid) considered to be alkaline, for instance. However, Young's view that alkalinity is good and acidity is bad goes beyond food. He told us: ""All sickness and disease can be prevented by managing the delicate pH balance of the fluids of the body."" He believes that when your blood becomes acidic, something weird happens, and your blood cells transform into bacteria - a phenomenon he calls pleomorphism - thereby resulting in a diseased state. This, frankly wild, view goes against all current scientific understanding. When we put this to him, he simply disagreed, saying: ""Germs are nothing more than the biological transformation of animal, human or plant matter. They're born out of that."" This is post-truth. Dr Giles Yeo with Robert O Young at the ""pH Miracle Ranch"" The biggest problem is that because Young believes that disease emerges from acidity, then by extension disease can be reversed with alkalinity - echoing his fish-bowl metaphor that you don't treat the disease, but you change the environment. When Young said Naima would be cared for in a controlled environment, he meant the pH Miracle Ranch, which has a large area set aside as a ""clinic"" to treat cancer. Young told us he uses the term ""cancerous"" as an adjective to describe a state of acidity. Since 2005 he has brought more than 80 terminally ill patients to stay at his ranch for months at a time. Treatment has included intravenous infusions of an alkaline solution of sodium bicarbonate - the same Arm and Hammer stuff you stick in your fridge to absorb smells. This was the ""healing programme"" that was being sold to Naima. There is no doubting the impact of Young's message. In an email, Naima wrote to him: ""I'll be pronounced text book perfect in a few months."" According to her friend Afzal Amin: ""Naima was supremely confident that, with her willpower and this therapy, she would be healed. That was the overriding emotion in her that yes, I am going to better."" We put it to Young that someone like Naima, in a terminally ill state, who was desperate for a cure, would buy anything, try anything to help get better. He responded: ""But I wasn't selling her anythingâ¦ I didn't force her to come here, it was her decision."" Yet, in one email Young insisted on Naima paying for her treatment, before she stepped on to the plane. All in all, Naima and her family paid Young more than $77,000 (Â£62,700) for the treatment. Young told us: ""The doctors need to be paid and the people that are doing the massages need to be paid and the colonics, but I gave her the best price to make sure that those people were paid."" There is no evidence whatsoever that infusing an alkaline solution into your bloodstream will do anything against cancer. When we raised this with Young, he said: ""These things need to be studied."" After about three months at Young's facility, her condition worsened and she was taken to hospital. Naima was brought back to the UK and died with her family. She was 27. Afzal Amin told us: ""They feel utterly betrayed. It's just horrific that somebody could exploit people for money. This is I think for them the most disturbing element, that for something as cheap as money he was just able to destroy people's lives."" Dr Giles Yeo presents Horizon'sClean Eating - The Dirty Truth, produced by Tristan Quinn, on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT, Thursday 19 January In the UK, you canwatch it on iPlayerafter transmission Young's activities at the pH Miracle Ranch have not gone unnoticed by the authorities. In 2011 the Medical Board of California began an undercover investigation after concerns were raised by a woman treated there. Investigators were able to establish the prognosis of 15 cancer patients treated at the ranch - none of them outlived it. One patient, Genia Vanderhaeghen, died from congestive heart failure - fluid around the heart - while being treated. Young told us he was ""out of town"" at the time. According to an invoice we obtained, she had been given 33 intravenous sodium bicarbonate drips, each charged at $550 (Â£448), over 31 days. Some were administered by Young himself. Robert O Young Last year Young was convicted of two charges of practising medicine without a license, and now faces up to three years in prison. In court it was revealed that he is not a medical doctor and bought his PhD from a diploma mill. We asked him if he felt remorse for what he had done. He said: ""I don't have remorse because of the thousands if not millions of people that have been helped through the [alkaline diet] programme."" We asked Natasha Corrett to comment on the influence of Robert Young on Honestly Healthy. She told us: ""We believe that our bodies should be fuelled with healthy and nutritious ingredients but we also believe that life is about having things in moderation."" Update, October 2018: Robert O Young was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison in 2017 for practicing medicine without a license.

Pious vs secular,"The existing chasms in Turkish society are deepening Hours after the Reina nightclub attacker was caught in Istanbul this week, the Turkish government's press office sent out a tweet, quoting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""I served as PM of Turkey for 14 years,"" it said. ""People's life style has never been interfered with and will not be henceforth."" It was a repetition of what the president had said in his first speech after the New Year's Eve attack - ""Nobody's lifestyle in Turkey is under systematic threat. I ask the liars saying it: who interfered with your food or drink or clothes?"" Mr Erdogan was responding to allegations that his Islamist-leaning government fostered a climate in which non-Muslim celebrations and alcohol-fuelled parties could be targeted. In the run-up to the Reina attack, posters and pro-government newspapers carried pictures of a Santa Claus figure being punched and warnings not to celebrate New Year. In the end, Reina appears to have been targeted as a high-profile location full of tourists, rather than because of what it represented. But the attack has revived a debate over whether Turkey's secular side feels threatened by its pious one. Tributes to the 39 victims remain outside the Reina nightclub Who were the victims? Aftermath in pictures A glamorous nightclub The narrow streets of Asmali Mescit in central Istanbul were once teeming with nightlife. Alcohol flowed and music played late into the night. Today, most bars have closed down or are largely empty. It's partly because of the security threat, as the number of foreign tourists plummets and Turks fear venturing out, but also partly because of government restrictions on alcohol. Under strict laws passed in 2013, an alcohol-licensed bar must be more than 100 metres from a school or a mosque and bars can no longer have tables outside. Kamil Erturk has had to close a bar because its alcohol licence was revoked ""The whole system is geared around impossible regulations so we can't renew our alcohol licence,"" said bar-owner Kamil Erturk. ""They come and say 'your bar stools are too high' or 'if you're a restaurant and people dance after dinner, you're violating your licence'."" Mr Erturk had to close his second bar because his alcohol licence was revoked. ""When Erdogan says nobody's lifestyle is under threat, I can only laugh bitterly,"" he said. ""It's not just alcohol, we feel the pressure in every sphere. They manipulate public opinion through the media and online trolls. Anyone who wants to lead a different life is under threat."" Turkey's secular-religious divide has always existed. The Turkish Republic founded by Ataturk in 1923 aimed to look westwards, with a secular constitution and strict control of religion, which for decades ostracised the conservatives. When Mr Erdogan came to power in 2003, he appeared to bring together the two wings, revoking a decades-long ban on women's headscarves in public institutions but at the same time winning support from many liberals. But the expanded middle class that emerged under his rule clamoured for more, and his spirit of inclusiveness cracked. Nationwide anti-government protests in 2013 sparked by development plans on Istanbul's Gezi Park were the tipping point. Islamic women's fashion has become Turkey's fifth-largest industry ""Most of us in the park were saying 'stop meddling with how I want to lead my life',"" said one of the protest organisers, who was afraid to give his name - an indication in itself of how Turkey has changed. He went on: ""Erdogan was saying women should have at least three kids and there was growing pressure on secular institutions. When it came to asking for more democracy - or true democracy - they said we were separatists or detrimental to society."" From the former deputy prime minister telling women not to laugh in public, to Mr Erdogan calling anybody who drinks ""an alcoholic"" or rejecting mixed-sex university dormitories, the lifestyle rhetoric has hardened, emboldening the conservatives. A woman wearing shorts was recently beaten on a public bus; a party in a record shop during Ramadan was attacked by local Islamists; and pro-government newspapers blast out headlines against secularism or leftists. There's a siege mentality in the government and a sense of two visions of the country colliding. Elif Devecioglu says women wearing headscarves used to be marginalised by Turkish society ""We who wear headscarves were the ones who were oppressed before this government"", said Elif Devecioglu, a designer of Islamic women's fashion, which has become Turkey's fifth-largest industry. ""Academics were taking 17-year-old girls into a room to persuade us not to wear headscarves. It was psychological violenceâ¦ a crime against humanity. This government has the intention to represent all sides but 14 years is not a long time to change mentalities."" Much has changed in Turkey in a relatively short time, and the pious now hold power while the secularists feel under threat. But Turkey also feels dangerously polarised - a trend likely to deepen as constitutional change is disputed. Mr Erdogan wants to appoint himself head of the executive, scrapping the prime minister and giving the president sweeping powers to appoint ministers and choose most judges. He argues, with the support of his government, that it will unburden Turkey from unwieldy parliamentary coalitions. The opposition says it'll entrench totalitarianism. Today's Turkey faces myriad threats and challenges, and yet its response is to fracture, to deepen existing chasms in society. The country is increasingly at war with itself. Who were the victims?

#courgettecrisis,"This video can not be played Last month, UK suppliers told the BBC produce from the continent was being ""treated like gold"" Anyone trying to stock their kitchen full of vegetables may have noticed a shortage of their favourite greens or salad items. It started last month with some supermarkets having problems stocking courgettes and spinach, while iceberg lettuce is now being rationed by some chains. Retailers have blamed empty shelves on bad weather in Spain and Italy. A combination of flooding, cold weather and poor light levels in southern Europe is said to have created the""perfect storm"" of poor growing conditions. During the winter months, Spain's south-eastern Murcia region supplies 80% of Europe's fresh produce. But after suffering its heaviest rainfall in 30 years, only 30% of Murcia's growing fields are useable. Snow covers crops in a field in the countryside in Murcia This has coincided with a cold snap in Italy, which normally exports vegetables at this time of the year but is now having to import them. The effects of shortages are particularly pronounced in Britain, which imports an estimated 50% of its vegetables and 90% of its fruit. The Grocer magazine's fresh and chilled foods editor, Kevin White, told the BBC he could not recall the weather affecting supplies so severely. Courgettes and spinach supplies have been severely affected by the cold weather. Jordi Vorderman, UK sales manager at Dutch vegetable supplier Valstar Holland, said courgette prices were the worst affected, but that ""the cost of everything imported from Spain and Italy is sky-high at the moment"". Philippe Binard, of Freshfel Europe which represents the fresh produce industry, said the problems afflicting vegetable production were unprecedented and had left the yield of courgettes, aubergines, tomatoes, broccoli and peppers from Spain down by about 25%. Iceberg lettuces and cabbages have also been affected, with experts unsure where the shortages could fall next. Fruit and vegetable wholesaler Nick Padley told BBC News that more than 90% of Europe's iceberg lettuce came from one small region in south-east Spain. He said: ""There's a gap of about six weeks on iceberg lettuce, nothing is coming from Spain for six to eight weeks. Our supplier is now going to be bringing in iceberg from America which is obviously costing more. It's a tough time."" BBC News spoke to traders at New Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market, who said they were struggling to meet demand and were planning to import produce from the US. Michael Goodwin said: ""I've been in this trade for 40-odd years and I've never known it so bad, where everything is so dear. I've got plenty of English parsnips, potatoes and carrots but foreign produce is like gold."" At New Covent Garden market, vegetable seller Mark Gregory said: ""Whereas normally courgettes are Â£6 or Â£7 [a crate], they're now 20-22 quid and we're struggling to get them. ""We usually have a couple of pallets full of them, this morning we've got just 80 boxes."" He is awaiting delivery of a lorry load of courgettes which should have arrived on Wednesday but will not be in the UK until Friday. Mr Vorderman said some supermarkets were not prepared to buy courgettes at such high prices and would rather leave their shelves empty. Tessa Knowles, who goes to Italy each week buying fruit and vegetables for a wholesaler, said: ""Prices have rocketed. The cold weather has devastated their crops out there. It's also affected the upcoming fruit on trees so we may still feel the longer-term effects."" Another trader, Tom Craig, said: ""Because there's so little produce coming over, the prices have escalated out of control. ""It normally is a little bit more expensive in January because of the bad weather but this year is exceptionally bad. Aubergines are Â£20 [a crate], peppers are two or three pounds dearer than they are normally at this time of year so it's very hard."" This man's quest for courgettes ended in failure Supermarkets can chase the sun to get seasonal produce all year round, but the rest of Europe will also be looking for new sources for their produce - all of which could push up prices even further. Wholesalers have told the BBC they know of customers who have cleared supermarket shelves to try to supply restaurants and caterers. Though customers have noticed some empty shelves, not all the supermarkets are reporting shortages. Co-op said it was not experiencing any shortages, and Sainsbury's said it was working to maintain its courgette supply for customers. Similarly, Lidl said: ""We are working closely with our suppliers to maintain the supply of products affected by the weather conditions in Europe."" On a shortage of iceberg lettuce, Tesco said it was ""working with our suppliers to resolve them as quickly as possible"".

The meat killer,"The ""impossible burger"" - as good as the real thing? ""My company's goal is to wipe out the animal farming industry and take them down,"" Patrick Brown tells me. The grey-haired, former paediatrician turned professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, now turned start-up founder, may be softly spoken but he doesn't mince his words. A vegan, he's come to the World Economic Forum in Davos to evangelise about how ditching meat can save the planet. At Davos, where helping the United Nations reach its goal of eradicating hunger by 2030 is one of its goals, he's got a receptive audience. A pop-up barbecue - set up by Brazilian charity Gastromotiva amid the snowy slopes - draws daily crowds. The company helps young people out of poverty by training them as chefs and creates its dishes out of food surplus that otherwise would have been thrown away. It neatly illustrates the point that a staggering one third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, around 1.3bn tonnes, which if used could help address the issue. Does living to 100 mean we'll work forever? The successful women embracing âgirl powerâ For city or country? Davos coverage in full But Mr Brown's target is not the Davos elites but the masses. The firm he set up almost seven years ago -Impossible Foods,external- is aiming to make the perfect meatless burger for ""the hardcore meat lover"". This video can not be played Serving up food waste in Davos The 62-year-old came up with the idea during a sabbatical. Freed from admin and teaching responsibilities, instead of hitting the beach he pondered what was the most important problem in the world he could do something about. The issue he hit upon was animal farming due to its environmental impact. While he personally has been a vegan for years, he said this was a personal choice and had nothing to do with his decision. Rattling off statistics staccato style he says the sector uses a third of the world's water supply and land, with the greenhouse gas impact second only to the power industry. But while startling, he admits such facts won't change people's minds or behaviour, or persuade them to eat ""cardboard food"". Instead, he decided to try to solve the problem scientifically. ""A different way of looking at it is that it's not a problem that people love meat and dairy products. The problem is that we produce them using animals, which is completely inefficient,"" he says. So he set his mind to creating a burger - with the same nutritional value, taste and texture of ground beef -  just without using an animal. The vegan pattie is made from wheat, coconut oil, potatoes and, crucially, heme The Californian firm's 70 scientists doing research and development treated the issue in the same manner as a biomedical one, says Mr Brown, figuring out the problem and working out what exactly it was in meat that made it so appealing. ""We needed to understand it in actionable terms so we could make deliberate choices to deliver those characteristics to consumers,"" he says. The magic ingredient turned out to be a compound called heme. Their research identified this as the thing which made meat distinct, giving it a richer taste and its bloody, red colour. The firm has now figured out a way to produce heme on a large scale cost effectively by using fermentation. So far the resulting burger is available in just four high-end restaurants, although Mr Brown says this will soon expand to seven. The decision to choose expensive restaurants seems at odds with his desire to persuade the masses to ditch meat. But Mr Brown argues that strategically it makes sense. ""We can only produce small volume so we have to get maximum brand building from every pound of product we make,"" he says. The vegan burger is currently only sold in four high-end restaurants He argues that by choosing well-known establishments - largely known for their meat offerings - it will help further the firm's name. But you won't see ""vegan burger"" on the menu. ""It's divisive,"" says Mr Brown. Instead it's called the ""impossible burger"", with the small print explaining that the product is made from plants. ""People don't have to change their beliefs or buy into anything philosophically. The burden is on us to make a delicious and affordable burger,"" he says. By the end of this year, production will ramp up, and he and his research and development team will double to 140 people. But can it really compete with the mass market burger chains such as McDonald's and Burger King? Mr Brown says he's already talking to places ""of that ilk"" but currently he remains focused on development rather than sales. Patrick Brown came up with the idea of the vegan burger during a sabbatical Pushed on whether the burger can also compete on price, he is unequivocal. ""By the end of the year we will be selling the product at a price where thousands of restaurants can sell it to their customers at the same price range as other stuff, and we will make money on every pound of [fake] meat that we sell,"" he says. Ultimately, he claims the cost of their burger will be ""substantially cheaper"" than a burger from a cow. ""The economics are so much in our favour. It takes a lot of resources to produce a pound of beef,"" he says. Mr Brown isn't the only confident one. The firm has attracted funding from some big-name venture capital firms including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and Horizons Ventures, which invests on behalf of Hong Kong business tycoon Li Ka-shing. He says this investment is supporting research and development, which will continue as it moves on to replicating other meat products and fish in the same manner. And ultimately in the battle of cow versus meatless burger Mr Brown says he's got no doubts that he will win. ""I'm so completely confident I'm going to win this competition. ""A cow did not evolve to be eaten. It was just there and it's not getting any better at this. The product we have is now better than a month ago. We're optimising it for deliciousness.""

SportHamilton backs new team-mate Bottas18 January 2017 (21:29:47),"Nico Rosberg, middle, retired after winning the world title for the first time last season Lewis Hamilton has backed Mercedes replacing Nico Rosberg with Valtteri Bottas, says team boss Toto Wolff. Mercedessigned the Finn this weekafter agreeing a deal to buy him out of his Williams contract to replace Rosberg, who retired after winning last year's world title. Wolff said: ""Lewis said he thought Valtteri was a nice guy. ""One of the guys he actually got along with well in Formula 1 and he felt he was a good option."" Wolff, who was talking to Finnish commentator Oskari Saari for a podcast, said he believed there might be less tension between Hamilton and the 27-year-old Finn than there was between the triple world champion and Rosberg. ""I think that works well,"" he added. ""It was OK already between Nico and Lewis, but there was the luggage of the past... Now it is a completely new relationship and there is no animosity. ""There will be moments where it is going to be difficult, but I think that how the personalities are for the team it's going to be a good situation and one that is maybe a bit easier to handle than the past. But I could be wrong."" BBC Sport revealed on Monday that Bottas hadsigned a one-year contract,with options to extend it into subsequent seasons. Wolff said that was because a number of leading drivers' contracts were up for renewal at the end of the 2017 season - including multiple world champions Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso of Ferrari and McLaren - and Mercedes wanted to keep their options open. ""We wouldn't have chosen Valtteri if we thought that he was not good enough to continue with the team,"" said Wolff. ""But, as a matter of fact, the market is very dynamic at the moment. Next year options open - young drivers, Sebastian, Fernando, Valtteri, many of them. So it is about understanding that - and Valtteri does. ""Equally we have great faith and confidence in him that he can stay with us for a long time, but now we need to see how the season goes.""

Ranked 117 in the world and a wildcard entry for the Australian Open, no one expected the 30-year-old to step out onto the Rod Laver Arena and shock six-time winner Novak Djokovic. It was a mammoth, energy-sapping effort in five sets and nearly five hours of tennis, too. In fact, Istomin felt the need to apologise to Djokovic for being on such form today. Having lost back-to-back sets after winning the opener, the Uzbek could have been forgiven for thinking the momentum was with the world number two and defending champion, but he turned it around to take what he called the ""biggest win"" of his career.  Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 4-6 Istomin So what does that result mean for Andy Murray? Well, six-time winner Novak Djokovic was surely considered world number one Murray's biggest threat to winning a first Australian Open title.

He polishes off this one with a couple of big serves that Djokovic has no answer to. Fascinating stuff. *Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 2-3 Istomin Has that break rattled Djokovic? He's not won six Australian Open titles without having to dig deep a few times, but the Serb has only lost to a player ranked outside the top 100 once in the past seven years - that was to Juan Martin del Potro at last year's Olympics. And with that, Istomin wins a challenge on his serve that was called out. Things are looking good for the 30-year-old Uzbek at the minute. *Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 2-3 Istomin So Istomin comes up with another backhand that Djokovic is unable to return and that gives the world number 117 two break points. Djokovic saves the first, but Istomin has him on the run for the second and then that formidable backhand comes into play once again with a winner down the line this time.

Ranked 117 in the world and a wildcard entry for the Australian Open, no one expected the 30-year-old to step out onto the Rod Laver Arena and shock six-time winner Novak Djokovic. It was a mammoth, energy-sapping effort in five sets and nearly five hours of tennis, too. In fact, Istomin felt the need to apologise to Djokovic for being on such form today. Having lost back-to-back sets after winning the opener, the Uzbek could have been forgiven for thinking the momentum was with the world number two and defending champion, but he turned it around to take what he called the ""biggest win"" of his career.  Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 4-6 Istomin So what does that result mean for Andy Murray? Well, six-time winner Novak Djokovic was surely considered world number one Murray's biggest threat to winning a first Australian Open title. The Scot's lost five finals in the past seven years - four of which were to Djokovic - in Melbourne, but with the defending champion out, it might just be Murray's time...

Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 4-6 Istomin World number 117 Denis Istomin on his win against Novak Djokovic:""I was playing so good today. I surprised myself as well today. I want to thank my team, mum, you do a good job. ""So much emotion on my mind, I cannot hold it. But I want to say thank you for coming to support me. From the third set I had cramp in my leg, I don't know how I held it.Â ""It is the biggest win (of my career) for me and means so much, now I feel I can play with these guys and be with them on the same level."" Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 4-6 Istomin That's fantastic from Denis Istomin, surely the win of his career. As for Novak Djokovic, he departs the Rod Laver Arena to huge cheers from the Melbourne crowd, but the world number two is out in four hours and 48 minutes. Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 4-6 Istomin Wow! Another big, big serve from the wildcard world number 117 and he's beaten the six-time Australian Open champion! *Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 4-5 Istomin Istomin watched that forehand Djokovic approach, leaned forward and fired in one of his trademark backhands, but this time it's wide. His next serve is huge though - and that's two match points... *Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 4-5 Istomin So, four hours and 47 minutes into this second round match it's Denis Istomin who has the chance to serve for what would be the upset of the tournament. The wildcard uses that backhand to great effect again as Djokovic can only reply with a weak forehand into the net, and the Serb finds the net again as the world number 117 moves to 30-0. Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 4-5 Istomin* Denis Istomin sends a backhand long after taking the opening point and has a little chuckle to himself, another long backhand follows and this time he's visibly frustrated. Novak Djokovic makes its 40-15 and then takes the game to leave Istomin having to serve out for the match. Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 3-5 Istomin* BBC Radio 5 live If you want to listen in to this cracker, then we've got online only radio coverage available via the link at the top of the page. *Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 3-5 Istomin Novak Djokovic is staring at the baseline in front of him in disbelief, Denis Istomin is catching it almost every time and giving the Serb little room to find a winner. He goes 30-0 on serve before challenging a huge, huge serve that he felt caught the corner of the service box - and he's got this one right as well!Â And how about an ace to finish off? Istomin thinks he's got it, but that's a let...he was already walking.Â Djokovic 6-7 7-5 6-2 6-7 3-4 Istomin* Well now it's Novak Djokovic cruising through a service game, and he'll be very thankful for a brief respite.

Morissette's manager admits $5m fraud,"Morissette's former business manager has admitted stealing $4.8m from the singer The former business manager of pop star Alanis Morissette has admitted stealing over $7m (Â£5.7m) from the singer and other celebrities, US prosecutors say. Jonathan Schwartz was charged with fraud over claims he transferred the singer's money into his own accounts. When initially confronted about the theft, Mr Schwartz lied and said he had invested the money in an illegal marijuana growing business. Mr Schwartz handled Morissette's finances between 2009 and 2016. He was responsible for collecting revenue, managing her accounts and organising the payment of bills on her behalf. At the federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Mr Schwartz admitted to stealing $4.8m from Morissette and more than $2m from other celebrity clients, who have not been named. His lawyer, Nathan Hochman, said Mr Schwartz had co-operated fully with the investigation and had accepted responsibility. The singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette Morissette sues over fraud Mr Schwartz now faces a jail sentence of between four and six years if convicted on criminal charges. Last year,Morissette sued Schwartz and his former company GSOfor $15m in damages, claiming that he transferred money to his own accounts without permission. It led to an internal investigation at the company, with GSO later issuing a statement saying that it was ""shocked"" to discover that Schwartz had been using the money to sustain a lavish lifestyle. The lawsuit was later dropped by Morissette after a settlement was reached. The Canadian-born singer, whose hits include Ironic and You Oughta Know, discovered the fraud after she appointed a new manager, who noticed sizeable discrepancies in her accounts. Mr Schwartz is due to appear in court on criminal charges on 1 February.

Teetotal Trump and the drinking presidents,"As Donald Trump becomes US president on Friday many will reach for a drink. Washington DC will be whirl of parties, galas and balls. The celebrities may be skipping it this year but the US capital will still swing to the sound of clinking glasses and popping corks. Across the country, celebrating Trump supporters will toast his swearing-in with a drink while others will numb their nerves with booze. Around the world, alcohol will help with this historic transition. In north London, for instance, the Old Queens Head pub is throwing an Armageddon-themed party to mark the start of Donald Trump's presidency. But the man himself will not be boozing through his first hours as the most powerful politician in the world. In fact, he won't touch a drop of alcohol on Friday night or on any day of his presidency. ""I've never had a drink,"" Donald Trump told Fox News after his election last November. Unlike George W Bush, who was teetotal in office after giving up booze on his 40th birthday, Mr Trump has eschewed alcohol his whole life, making him a first among modern US presidents. Donald Trump's teetotalism stems from the early death of his older brother Freddie The reason for Mr Trump's sobriety is because his adored older brother Freddie died of illness stemming from alcoholism at the age of 42. ""It was a very tough period of time,"" he said, that convinced him never to drink. ""If you don't start you're never going have a problem. If you do start you might have a problem. And it's a tough problem to stop,"" Mr Trump told Fox. Who was second-longest serving US president? Tapes show Richard Nixon as Watergate scandal loomed BBC History: John F Kennedy What is fascinating is his view that one drink could spiral into addiction. He discussed his fear that he might have a gene that would make moderate drinking impossible. His approach to alcohol is also a window into a personality that appears to crave control over others. Mr Trump ordered his children to follow his example. Every day he would drum the message into them: No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. ""I've been very tough on my children with respect to drink,"" he said. So how do the teetotal presidents compare with those who enjoyed the pleasures of a drink? George W Bush went dry after years of heavy boozing and swapped a compulsion for drink for an obsession with fitness. Remembered largely for the invasion of Iraq, George W's foreign policy record might not be seen as the best advertisement for a teetotal presidency. Franklin Roosevelt (right) had a particular reverence for ""cocktail hour"" Nor might the idealistic but muddled foreign policy of Jimmy Carter, another teetotal president. Life in the Carter White House was drearily dry and a chore for its more sociable visitors. Senator Ted Kennedy remembered arid evenings of earnest discussion. ""You'd arrive about 6.00 or 6.30pm, and the first thing you would be reminded of, in case you needed reminding, was that he and Rosalynn had removed all the liquor in the White House. No liquor was ever served during Jimmy Carter's term. He wanted no luxuries nor any sign of worldly living,"" Kennedy wrote. The moderate drinkers fare better. Franklin D Roosevelt frequently tops the list of America's greatest presidents, the commander-in-chief who defeated the Great Depression and led the US through World War Two. Throughout these turbulent years, FDR kept a martini close at hand and prized the rituals of cocktail hour, when he mixed stiff drinks for friends on his White House study desk. The conviviality of cocktail hour undoubtedly helped FDR unwind and briefly relieved the immense pressure he was under. John F Kennedy would occasionally sip a daiquiri but preferred women to wine and kept a clear head through the brinkmanship of the Cuban Missile Crisis. But other presidents were more reckless with their drinking. Both Johnson and Kennedy enjoyed a drink Lyndon Johnson was well known in Washington for his capacity to guzzle Cutty Sark whisky and soda when he was Democratic majority leader in the Senate, a habit he took to the White House. Johnson, who told his doctor after a heart attack that the only things he enjoyed in life were ""whisky, sunshine and sex"", enjoyed entertaining at his Texas ranch where the booze flowed. LBJ's special assistant for domestic affairs, Joseph A Califano, remembered a ride around the ranch with the president: ""As we drove around we were followed by a car and a station wagon with Secret Service agents. The president drank Cutty Sark scotch and soda out of a large, white, plastic foam cup. ""Periodically, Johnson would slow down and hold his left arm outside the car, shaking the cup and ice. A Secret Service agent would run up to the car, take the cup and go back to the station wagon. There another agent would refill it with ice, scotch and soda as the first agent trotted behind the wagon."" But the most disturbing picture of presidential drinking is provided by Richard Nixon, a man prone to morose self-pity who medicated his moods with booze. According to his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, Nixon's trouble was that a small amount of drink would set him off and late-night threats of military action were made when the president was the worse for wear. When North Korea shot down a US spy plane in April 1969, an enraged Nixon allegedly ordered a tactical nuclear strike and told the joint chiefs to recommend targets. According to the historian Anthony Summers, citing the CIA's top Vietnam specialist at the time, George Carver, Henry Kissinger spoke to military commanders on the phone and agreed not to do anything until Nixon sobered up in the morning. Henry Kissinger allegedly witnessed the effects of Richard Nixon's drinking By the early 1970s, Watergate was beginning to choke Nixon's presidency and the president was relying more on drink and sleeping pills to cope with the pressure. On the evening of 11 October 1973, he was incapable of speaking to the British Prime Minister Edward Heath on the phone. Heath was keen to discuss the latest developments of the Arab-Israeli War but a transcript of the conversation between Henry Kissinger and his assistant Brent Scowcroft revealed the president was too drunk to talk to the prime minister. Richard Nixon was a warning to future presidents on the danger of mixing hubris with drink. He is a reminder too of the awesome executive power a US president has when it comes to conducting foreign affairs. With no previous political or military experience, Donald Trump is unlike any incoming president. His hubris is clear to all and his (sober) stream of excitable tweets prove an impetuous temperament. Nixon's example might make us grateful booze is not in the mix too. But some of the most successful presidents found valuable perspective and balance at the bottom of a glass.

Incredible journey of Trump's mother,"By 1934 Mary Anne MacLeod had become a glamorous New Yorker. This photo, was taken on the steps of a Long Island swimming pool With Donald Trump being elected to be the US president for the second time we look back at his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born and brought up on the Hebridean island of Lewis but emigrated to New York to live a very different life. Mary Anne was one of tens of thousands of Scots who travelled to the US and Canada in the early years of the last century looking to escape economic hardship at home. She first left Lewis for New York in 1930, at the age of 18, to seek work as a domestic servant. Six years later she was married to successful property developer Frederick Trump, the son of German migrants and one of the most eligible men in New York. The fourth of their five children, Donald John, as he is referred to on the islands, is about to become US president for the second time. His mother was born in 1912 in Tong, about three miles from Stornoway, the main town on the isle of Lewis. Genealogist Bill Lawson, who has traced the family tree of Mary Anne MacLeod back to the early 19th Century, says her father Malcolm ran a post office and small shop in his later years. Donald Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod, aged 14, sits on the windowsill of a house in the village of Tong Economically, the family would have been slightly better off than the average in the township, he says. However, life during and after World War One, in which 1,000 islanders died, was very hard and many young people were leaving the Western Isles. The Isle of Lewis had also sufferedthe Iolaire disaster in 1919 when 200 servicemen from the island had drownedat the mouth of Stornoway harbour, coming home for the first new year of peace. Mr Lawson says: ""Mary Anne MacLeod was from a very large family, nine siblings, and the move at that time was away from the island. ""The move by Viscount Leverhulme to revive the island had gone bust and there was not much prospect for young people. ""What else could she do?"" Mary Anne en-route to America in the early 1930s Mr Lawson adds: ""Nowadays, you might think of going to the mainland but in those days most people went to Canada. It was far easier to make a life in America and many people had relatives there."" The genealogist says Mr Trump's mother was slightly different in that her sister Catherine, one of eight members of the MacLeod family to have emigrated to America, had moved from Canada to New York. When Catherine returned to Lewis for a visit in 1930, her 18-year-old sister Mary Anne went with her to look for work. It appears that she found work as a nanny with a wealthy family in a big house in the suburbs of New York but lost the job as the US sank into depression after the Wall Street Crash. Mary Anne returned briefly to Scotland in 1934 but by then she had met Fred Trump and soon returned to New York for good. The couple lived in a wealthy area of Queens and Mary Anne was active with charity work. Donald Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, with baby Maryanne in 1938 in Scotland Donald Trump still has three cousins on Lewis, including two who live in the ancestral home, which has been rebuilt since Mary Anne MacLeod's time. All three cousins have consistently refused to speak to the media. Speaking to the BBC in 2017 after Donald Trump's first presidential victory, John A MacIver, a local councillor and friend of the cousins, said: ""I know the family very well. ""They are very nice, gentle people and I'm sure they don't want all the publicity that's around. ""I quite understand that they don't want to talk about it."" Mr MacIver said Mary Anne MacLeod was well-known and much respected in the community and used to attend the church on her visits home. Mary Anne MacLeod at Clydebank in Scotland in 1934 Mr Trump's mother became a US citizen in 1942 and died in 2000, aged 88. But she returned to Lewis throughout her life and always spoke Gaelic, Mr MacIver says. According to genealogist Bill Lawson, surnames are a relatively recent phenomenon on the islands and official records only go back to the early decades of the 19th Century. His research took him back as far as John Roy MacLeod, which in Gaelic is Iain Ruaidh, named for a tendency to red hair. Mary Anne Trump's paternal MacLeods came from Vatisker, a few miles further north of Tong. Her great-grandfather Alexander Roy MacLeod and his son Malcolm were thought to have drowned together while fishing in the 1850s. On Mary Anne's mother's side, the Smiths were among the families cleared from South Lochs area of Lewis in 1826. The period of the Highland Clearances on the mainland had largely missed Lewis but after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 some of the better lands for sheep-grazing on the island were cleared of tenants. In most cases the displaced tenants were relocated elsewhere on Lewis rather than sent overseas. According to Mr Lawson, all four lines of Mary Anne MacLeod's maternal ancestry had been moved to Stornoway parish from elsewhere on the island as a result of the Clearances. His research also found another fishing tragedy when Donald Smith was drowned in October 1868 after his boat was upset in a squall off Vatisker Point. His widow was left with three children, of whom the youngest, Mary - Donald Trump's grandmother - was less than a year old. Mary Trump in 1999, shortly before she died, with daughter Elizabeth, son Donald and his then-girlfriend Melania Knauss Mary succeeded her mother at 13 Tong, but it was the smallest of the crofts in Tong. After her marriage to Malcolm MacLeod, they were able to acquire the Smiths' original croft of 5 Tong and move there. Donald Trump's mother Mary Anne was the youngest of their 10 children. Her businessman son Donald visited the house in which his mother grew up in 2008. On that trip, he said he had been to Lewis once before as ""a three or four-year-old"" but could remember little about it. Donald Trump on a visit to Tong in 2008 It is estimated he spent 97 seconds in the ancestral home during his whistle-stop tour. At the time, he said: ""I have been very busy - I am building jobs all over the world - and it's very, very tough to find the time to come back. ""But this just seemed an appropriate time, because I have the plane... I'm very glad I did, and I will be back again."" He was accompanied by his eldest sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a US federal judge, who has regularly visited her cousins on Lewis. Mr Lawson says: ""If you want to celebrate anyone, you should perhaps celebrate Maryanne, who has done a lot of work for the island. ""Donald arrived off a plane and then disappeared again. One photoshoot, that was it. ""I can't say he left much of an impression behind him."" Donald Trump next to a piper at the opening of The Trump International Golf Links Course in July 2012 .

Final destination,"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Head looks at the cost to human lives of Thailand's poor road safety record. There is a ritual that is now very familiar to Thais, before the two big holiday seasons of the year, in late December for the new year, and in April for the Songkran Festival. The government will set a target for reducing fatalities on Thailand's notoriously dangerous roads, exhorting Thais not to speed, or drink and drive. Sometimes good citizens will run publicity stunts, like the coffin-maker, who last year invited journalists to film the huge stockpile his workers were building up for the holiday season. And every year these efforts fail. The grim statistics of death and injury on the roads are tallied each day in the media with, as often as not, worse figures than the year before. And so it was this last new year - 478 people lost their lives on the roads in just seven days. In one horrific collision in Chonburi on 2 January, 25 people died - some burned to death in a crushed and overcrowded passenger van they could not escape. In the latest high-profile accident, a pick-up truck collided with a passenger van, killing 25 people Thailand's roads are currently ranked the second most lethal in the world after Libya's by the World Health Organization. This status is all the more extraordinary given the fact that Thailand has been peaceful and increasingly prosperous for decades, with governments that in other fields, like healthcare and infrastructure, have made impressive progress. In 2011 the then-government announced the following ten years as Thailand's 'Decade of Action on Road Safety'. It declared 2012 as the year of 100 percent helmet use on motorbikes. In 2015 the Department of Disaster Prevention, which is tasked with road safety in addition to problems like floods and landslides, boldly announced a target of reducing road deaths by 80%. All in vain. The challenge they face is not hard to see. Thailand's rapid development has bequeathed it an unrivalled network of 462,133 roads in the region, nearly all paved, with plenty of multi-lane highways. There are 37 million registered vehicles, 20 million of them motorbikes, and millions more that are unregistered. Driving on a Thai expressway is akin to playing a hyper-caffeinated video game. A cursory web search for road accident videos will throw up examples of breathtaking, sometimes suicidal, recklessness. Drunk driving is a huge problem. In 2014 and 2015 three foreigners, a British couple and a Chilean man, who were cycling around the world, and near the end of their journeys, were killed while travelling through Thailand. A pick-up truck driver, who struck the British couple while trying to reach a hat on the floor of his cab, was fined the equivalent of $30 and given a suspended prison sentence. ""Thailand has beautiful roads"", explains Ratana Winther, the country director for the US-based Asia Injury Prevention Foundation. ""And people tend to go very fast. So the number one killer is speed."" Police Sergeant-Major Kanthachat Nua-on can attest to that. At a speed trap he had set up on a stretch of elevated expressway outside Bangkok, he watched car after car pass him at speeds well in excess of the 80km/h (50 mph) limit. He did not bother to ticket them. ""If we strictly follow what the law says, and issue a ticket for people driving over the speed limit, then we will end up booking everyone."" He booked just one car, travelling at 129km/h. But the fines are small, and more than half of those ticketed do not bother to pay, with little follow-up. There are now 37 million vehicles on Thailand's roads In recent years there have been a number of cases where drivers from wealthy families have killed, and been treated with extraordinary leniency. In 2012 the grandson of the man who made a fortune from the Red Bull energy drink killed a policeman while driving at speed in his Ferrari. He was charged, but has repeatedly failed to show up in court. Another case was that of a 16-year-old girl from an influential family, driving without a license, who struck a passenger van, killing nine of its occupants. She was given a suspended prison sentence, and ordered to do community service - which it turned out two years later she had avoided doing. Some 24,000 people are estimated to die on Thailand's roads each year ""Enforcement is the key"", says Ratana Winther. ""But that is not just about telling the police to enforce the law. The police should be told to prioritise traffic policing over traffic management. ""But it is a multi-sectoral challenge. The punishment needs to be big enough for people to be afraid of it. And the safety campaigns must be continuous, not just at peak seasons. Then we need to move on to issues like improving the engineering of roads."" Former Deputy Transport Minister and safety campaigner Nikorn Chamnong goes further. ""We need to go back and change the DNA of the country,"" he says. ""Education, right back in schools, is important"". He has been petitioning the current military-appointed National Assembly to do more. It is now on the point of approving ten changes to driving laws, including mandating the use of rear seatbelts - overall the largest overhaul of road safety legislation in 40 years. But no-one knows how well these laws will be enforced. Mourners have left flowers at the site of the accident in Chonburi Members of the public are cynical. ""There is a saying, that a true Thai follows his own rules,"" said Pongsak Putta, a motorbike taxi driver, who was hit by a car and injured over the new year. ""As long as it does not happen to them, people do not think safety is an issue,"" said Pornpen Wongbantoon, who complains about the poor driving of the buses she has to take to work. ""Enforcement is everything,"" says Dr Liviu Vedrasco, who works on road safety at the World Health Organization. The government officials he works with are serious about road safety, he believes, but co-ordination is a real challenge. The Road Safety Direction Centre is responsible for leading on the issue, but is subsumed within the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department, which is itself within the Ministry of Interior. Roads are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport. Dr Vedrasco believes the best way to cut the appalling death toll on the roads is to focus on the most vulnerable group, motorbikes, which account for 80% of deaths. ""If you cannot reduce the number of motorbikes, the next best thing is separating them. Make a dedicated lane; maybe not a hundred percent of roads in Thailand, but aim to increase the percentage of roads with separated traffic - this will definitely have a tremendous impact."" The parents of Hathaitip Modpai, one of the victims of the 2 January crash, have been grieving their daughter's death After the shocking collision in Chonburi, the government has promised to phase out passenger vans, which it says are not designed to carry up to 15 people over long distances. The police believe the 64 year-old driver fell asleep at the wheel. He was on his fifth 300km, 3.5 hour journey in 33 hours. Twenty-six-year-old Hathaitip Modpai was one of the victims. She had been travelling in the van back from a new year visit to her parents to Bangkok, where she worked as a car saleswoman. She was an only child. After her funeral, her mother, Wimol, reflected on what the impact of her daughter's death would be. ""I wish the government would do more,"" she said. ""After the accident people got excited for a while, but once the fuss dies down, everything will go back to the way it was before.""

Hard pressed,"The NHS has relied on nurses from home and abroad since its birth NHS staff shortages seem an everyday fact of life - or at least a factor mentioned in several news stories each week. But why do these shortages persist and is there anything that can be done to get rid of them? In this week'sIn Businesson BBC Radio 4, I spoke to historians, economists, nurses, doctors and other healthcare staff to try to get to the bottom of these questions. And to pose another one - does the NHS have the right mix of staff with the right mix of skills or could changing traditional roles rather than just boosting numbers help? The Royal College of Nursing says England is currently short of at least 20,000 nursing staff. And the Royal College of Midwives says the country needs 3,500 more midwives. Meanwhile, GP leaders and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine say the UK urgently needs greater numbers of general practitioners and emergency doctors - just a few of the medical specialities struggling with recruitment and retention right now. Increasingly, an older population, with often complex health needs, adds extra demand. But these problems are far from new. Stephanie Snow, medical historian at the University of Manchester, says staff shortages have existed since the very birth of the NHS, in 1948 - though people are often quick to label recruitment crises as one-off problems. She told the BBC: ""Over the first decade in particular, the NHS expanded its specialist services rapidly and there were many new technologies on board. ""All of these things led to unprecedented increases in the number of staff required. ""By the time we get to the late 1960s, hospitals had to turn to mass recruitment, looking towards countries such as India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka - where courses were taught in English and aligned to the UK's General Medical Council, as a consequence of colonial rule."" Physician associates are a relatively new role within the NHS Meanwhile, Anita Charlesworth, director of Research and Economics at the think tank, the Health Foundation, argues the UK has perpetually trained lower numbers of medical and nursing students than it needs. She said: ""There is not a problem that we don't have enough bright, young people who would meet the standards and would love to have a career in medicine and nursing. ""They just can't get a place. We have systematically trained fewer than we need."" And she suggests being able to recruit doctors and nurses from overseas has offered a ""get out of jail card"" for successive staff shortages. Dr Mark Porter, of the doctors' union, the British Medical Association, argues we have generally staffed a health service we can afford - rather than look at what the population needs. But he says planning for the NHS workforce of the future is not easy. He said: ""It is difficult to get planning perfect for every one of 50 or 60 specialities all of the time. ""The population's needs are genuinely not quite as predictable as one might imagine. ""We know the trajectory illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes are taking over the next five years. ""But what about the next 25 years? ""Will public health messages and new technology be successful, or won't they? ""The answer could give us completely different trajectories in the future."" Nurses starting work on the first day of the NHS For its part, the government says it plans to increase the numbers of doctors and nurses it trains and boost other healthcare staff too. At the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, said: ""My job is to prepare the NHS for the future, and that means doing something today that we have never done properly before, and that's training enough doctors."" The government announcedthere would be up to an extra 1,500 medical school places each year from 2018 in England. And, looking back, the NHS Confederation said there had been an extra 32,467 doctors employed in England in 2014 compared with 2004. Meanwhile, nurse numbers increased by 18,432. Health chiefs also say current plans to scrap nurse bursaries will help increase the number of nurse training places available this year - though whether this will work in practice is unclear and has been disputed by nursing leaders. Other positions such as nurse apprentices and physician associates are being explored. Physician associates (PAs) - trained to do some of the jobs junior doctors do, might be able to cut some pressures on wards. But current numbers are tiny, most cannot prescribe and they are not professionally regulated in the same way doctors are. Ms Charlesworth is worried options for filling shortages quickly might be running out. She said: ""There's a massive gap globally now in the number of doctors and nurses compared to projected demand. ""So India keeps many more of its doctors. ""It has fantastic leading hospitals that are an exciting place to work if you are a young Indian doctor. ""There is a global shortage of clinical healthcare staff."" And of course there is another issue to consider. It is estimated,externalabout 10% doctors and 7% of nurses working in the NHS in England are nationals of other EU countries.

Twenty years later,"Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 This year marks the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover from the UK to China. The BBC's Helier Cheung, who sang in the handover ceremony, shares her personal reflections on the last two decades. As a child, you don't always appreciate when you're witnessing history. On 1 July 1997, I was part of the choir singing in the handover, in front of China's leaders and millions of viewers around the world. It was a historic day. But I was nine at the time, so my most vivid memories were: the sandwiches we ate backstage - they were disgusting the heavy rain - although I glimpsed a rainbow too singing some songs I could only half understand because they were in Mandarin. All of us in the choir had grown up speaking Cantonese. So singing in Mandarin felt both familiar and unfamiliar - it signified a culture we recognised, but did not grow up with. In 1997, I (second from left) got to sing in the handover ceremony Nearly 20 years later, I was back in Hong Kong reporting for the BBC There were lots of dancers with pink fans, and I remember China's then-President Jiang Zemin holding up a piece of calligraphy that read ""Hong Kong's tomorrow will be better"". But that night, I saw on TV that some had been protesting against the handover. It was one of my first lessons about Hong Kong's divisions - some were happy to be part of China again, but others were afraid. I didn't always follow politics then, but politics still affected me. Some of my friends emigrated ahead of the handover, because their parents weren't sure about life under China. And 1997 was also the start of the Asian financial crisis, so I overheard adults talking about stock market crashes, and suicides. As a child, it was more comforting to be oblivious about the news. Even as my friends and I went to secondary school, we rarely thought about developments in mainland China - we were teenagers after all. This all changed in 2003. Hong Kong was hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) which travelled over from southern China. People started wearing face masks to protect themselves from Sars Suddenly whole buildings were being quarantined. School was cancelled - shortly before our exams - as well as our junior high ball. To some, it almost seemed unfair - the virus had spread here after officials in mainland China covered up the outbreak. Yet Hong Kong, which handled the outbreak more transparently, was the focus of a lot of international coverage, and was the city with the most deaths - nearly 300. Temperature checks were a must My friends and I became more pragmatic. We did everything we were told to - wearing face masks, disinfecting our hands and taking our temperatures before school each day. But we kept meeting up in McDonald's after class, as we always did. One friend told me: ""If you die, you die, there's nothing you can do. You just need to do the best you can."" By summertime, Hong Kong was Sars-free. But another crisis, this time political, was rumbling. The government wanted to introduce national security legislation, known as Article 23. It would have outlawed treason, secession and sedition - words I had to look up - and allowed our government to outlaw groups banned in mainland China. The bill struck a nerve. Although many countries outlaw treason and secession, to many Hong Kongers it reminded them too much of mainland China. Activists feared Article 23 would threaten human rights On 1 July 2003, half a million people, including some of my classmates, marched against the bill. A few days later, the government was forced to shelve Article 23, after one of its political allies, a pro-business party, withdrew its support. My friends were jubilant, telling me they had ""made history"". Many felt that, although there was no democracy, it was possible to vote with their feet. Many people wore black to show their opposition to Article 23 The Sars outbreak and Article 23 row made local and Chinese politics seem more relevant to our daily lives. And by the late 2000s, mainland China felt more entwined with Hong Kong than ever. When I was a child, some of my classmates, somewhat cruelly, mocked ""mainlanders"" as people who squatted and were poor. But now, more people were learning Mandarin, and Hong Kong's economic future seemed to depend on China's. China loosened travel restrictions, making it easier for mainland tourists to visit Hong Kong. It gave the economy a much-needed boost, but resentment was also growing. I was studying abroad by then, but whenever I flew home I would hear people gripe about the sheer number of tourists, and how rude some appeared. Mainlanders' shopping trips to Hong Kong have been a source of irritation to people in the city Some tourists bought up huge quantities of baby milk powder, leaving local parents without enough. I could no longer recognise many of the shopping malls my school friends and I used to frequent. We grew up with cheap jewellery stalls and snack shops - but now shopping centres were dominated by designer brands that wealthy Chinese tourists preferred. The other big change was in politics. When I was at school, expressing an interest in politics was more likely to get you teased than admired. But by 2012, students were holding hunger strikes to oppose a government attempt to introduce ""patriotic education"" classes. And in 2014, something surprising, almost unthinkable, happened. Tens of thousands of people, led by students, took over the streets, demanding full democracy. Protesters staged sit ins in Hong Kong's financial district Growing up, it was easy to avoid talking about politics. But with protesters sleeping in the streets for weeks, the subject was suddenly unavoidable. Families and friends started arguing - in person and on Facebook - and ""unfriending"" people they disagreed with. Supporters felt it was worth sacrificing order and economic growth for true democracy, but critics accused the protesters of ""destroying"" Hong Kong. One woman told me her relatives were angry she took part in the protests and now, two years later, they still didn't want to meet her for dinner. ""Hong Kong's become so split,"" she said. Hong Kong was split between ""yellow ribbons"" who supported the protesters, and ""blue ribbons"" who supported the police Recently, after years in the UK, I got to return to Hong Kong as a reporter. A lot feels the same. The territory is still clean, efficient, and obsessed with good food. But young people seem more pessimistic - with politics and soaring house prices their main bugbears. Surveys suggest young people are the unhappiest they have been in a decade - and that up to 60% want to leave. Recently, some have even started to call for independence from China, frustrated with Beijing's influence and the lack of political reform. Their resentment stems from Hong Kong's handover or even the Sino-British negotiations in the 1980s. ""We were never given a choice,"" one activist said. ""No-one ever asked Hong Kongers what they wanted."" Protests have become angrier. Most demonstrations I witnessed growing up were peaceful - even festive. Now, some rallies are more confrontational and prone to clashes, while the government seems less willing to make concessions. Pro-Beijing and pro-democracy protesters sometimes end up clashing It's not surprising that, inan online poll,externalrun by a pro-government party, people chose ""chaos"" as the word to describe Hong Kong's 2016. Fromviolent protests, to legislatorsswearingandscufflingin parliament, politics has definitely been chaotic at times. But, chaotic or not, what really strikes me about Hong Kong is how alive and adaptable it is. Hong Kong's streets are busy late into the night Whether in business or politics, Hong Kong is full of people fighting to be heard. Local entrepreneurs are constantly devising controversial or creative ways to make money - such as renting out ""capsule units"" in their homes, or starting arabbit cafe,external. And, even as artists complain of pressure to self-censor,pop musichas become more political andfresh news websites,externaland satirical news channels have popped up. Hong Kong may be a relatively small territory with a population of 7.3 million, but I love the fact it has never lost its ability to surprise me.

Make no mistake,"Every day, Miqdaad Versi searches newspapers looking for errors concerning Muslims and Islam When one newspaper reported last year that ""enclaves of Islam see UK as 75% Muslim"" last year, Miqdaad Versi's instinct was to challenge it. He believes errors in the reporting of Muslims have become all too common, and has made it his mission to fight for corrections. Miqdaad Versi sits in front of a rather geeky-looking spreadsheet at the offices of the Muslim Council of Britain in east London. He is the organisation's assistant secretary general, but the task in front of him is a personal project. The spreadsheet has on it every story published concerning Muslims and Islam that day in the British media - and he is going through them looking for inaccuracies. If he finds one, he will put in a complaint or a request for a correction with the news organisation, the press regulator Ipso, or both. Mr Versi has been doing this thoroughly since November, and before that on a more casual basis. He has so far complained more than 50 times, and the results are visible. He was personally behind eight corrections in December and another four so far this month. Miqdaad Versi tweets diagrams showing corrections and apologies made following his complaints In the past, corrections to stories were mostly printed when individuals were the victims of inaccurate reporting, but Mr Versi is looking at a whole topic. ""Nobody else was doing this,"" he tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""There have been so many articles about Muslims overall that have been entirely inaccurate, and they create this idea within many Muslim communities that the media is out to get them. ""The reason that's the case is because nobody is challenging these newspapers and saying, 'That's not true.'"" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel. See Catrin Nye's full film on this issue here.,external Mr Versi goes through some of the corrections from December. Five of them concerned a review into integration by Dame Louise Casey. The Sunday Times reported that ""Enclaves of Islam see UK as 75% Muslim"" in a preview of the review. This was incorrect, with the review actually citing a survey of pupils in one largely Asian school who thought 50-90% of the population in Britain were Asian. The paper corrected the article, and later apologised. As the same story was reported in other publications, it led to five corrections. Mr Versi highlights another article, concerning the Muslim president of the National Union of Students (NUS). She was accused on Mail Online of refusing to condemn so-called Islamic State, when she had openly done so. Also in December, he points out a report in the Sun on Sunday confused the identities of two Muslim individuals - one fighting against extremism and one accused of extremism. ""Quite a mix-up,"" says Mr Versi. He has met several newspaper editors and has been pleased with the quick corrections he has received in some cases. But he is concerned that these revisions are not obvious enough to the reader. ""Sometimes the corrections lack a clear acknowledgement of the error they made and often do not include an apology. In addition, they are rarely given the prominence of the original article,"" he says. He adds that while he is concerned with ""significant failings"" in the reporting of Muslims, the same issues ""might also be replicated for refugee, migrant or other groups"". One particularly high-profile correction in December last year - that Mr Versi was not behind - involved a 2015 article in which Mail Online columnist Katie Hopkins wrongly suggested Zahid Mahmood and his brother were extremists with links to al-Qaeda, after they had not been allowed to board a plane to the US. The Mail Online and Ms Hopkins apologised,externaland paid Â£150,000 in damages. At his home in Walthamstow, north-east London, Mr Mahmood says he has forgiven her. He now says it is not her original false accusations that he finds the most upsetting, but the public reaction. ""First they were all against us when Katie Hopkins published the article, and then when she made the apology a year later - then they all turn against her. ""There's no middle ground. It's not just about Katie Hopkins, it's the mindset of people - how they can very easily be led against somebody, or in favour of somebody."" Zahid Mahmood says he holds ""no grudge"" against Mail Online columnist Katie Hopkins Mr Mahmood says he feels this kind of reaction is causing divisions in society, and - keen to do his bit for unity - tells the BBC he is formally inviting Katie Hopkins to his home for tea and coffee. ""We have no grudge against her, and we would like her to learn and know that we are as British as she is. ""In fact, my wife's grandfather and great-grandfather both fought in World War One and World War Two. They fought for the very freedom of this country."" Mr Versi says he wants to improve community relations too. He thinks inaccurate reporting has far-reaching consequences, especially because negative stories are often widely circulated by far-right groups and then the corrections are not. Some free speech campaigners, however, are concerned about this kind of work. Tom Slater, deputy editor of Spiked Online, says these complaints could create a fear of reporting certain issues. ""I, like anyone else, want a press that's going to be accurate... but what we're seeing here is quite concerted attempts to try and often ring-fence Islam from criticism."" Mr Slater says he found a recent correction to a story about a suspected ""honour killing"" particularly problematic. Tom Slater worries such complaints are attempts to ""ring-fence Islam from criticism."" In May 2016, the Mail Online and the Sun used the phrase ""Islamic honour killing"" in their headline. Mr Versi successfully complained to Ipso that Islam does not condone honour killings and that the phrase incorrectly suggested it was motivated by religion. The word ""Islamic"" was removed from the papers' headlines, and at the bottom of the articles they wrote: ""We are happy to make clear that Islam as a religion does not support so-called 'honour killings.'"" Mr Slater says he found that statement added by the papers ""absolutely staggering"". ""We all know a religion is just an assortment of ideas and principles. What these papers were effectively asked to do, and what they did do, was to print one accepted interpretation of a religion - and to me this was just like backdoor blasphemy law."" Mr Versi, however, insists his work is about ensuring the facts are right - not silencing critics. He says there are many examples where Muslims can be rightly criticised and he is not complaining about those. ""All I'm asking for is responsible reporting.""

Man Utd top rich list in record season,"Manchester United generated the most revenue of any football club in the world last season, according to a report published by Deloitte. United dethrone Real Madrid - who held top spot for 11 years - after accumulating a record revenue of 689m euros (Â£515m) during the 2015-16 term. The Premier League club saw commercial revenue grow by 100m euros (Â£71m). Combined revenue for the top 20 clubs during the 2015-16 season grew 12% to 7.4bn euros (Â£6.41bn) - a new record. It is the first time Manchester United have topped the annual Deloitte Football Money League since the 2003-04 season. Real drop down to third, behind Spanish rivals Barcelona, who remain in second spot. German giants Bayern Munich move up a position to fourth and Manchester City also climb a spot to fifth - having generated 524.9 euros (Â£392.6m) - up from 463.5 euros (Â£352.6m) during the previous season. It is the first time they have reached the top five of the annual list. Eight Premier League clubs make the top 20, with revenues totalling nearly 3.2bn euros (Â£2.4bn). Champions Leicester City (20th) enter the top 20 for the first time. They produced a revenue of 172m euros (Â£128m) - which is almost five times the revenue generated two seasons before in 2013-14. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham remain in seventh, eighth, ninth and 12th place, with West Ham in 18th position. Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said Manchester United's record revenues were achieved by ""phenomenal commercial revenue growth"". He added: ""In recent years, their ability to secure commercial partnerships with value in excess of that achievable by their peers has been the crucial factor in enabling the club to regain their place at the top of the money league. ""That said, they'll face strong competition from Barcelona and Real Madrid to retain the top spot in next year's edition, due to the lack of Champions League football, the weakening of the pound against the euro and, over the longer term, as other clubs enter the commercial market demanding similar deals, using United as the precedent.""

Britain's 'trade crusade',"If you ever wanted to see what Boris Johnson would look like mocked up as Steve McQueen in The Great Escape, then look no further than the Sun. It says the foreign secretary was ""defiant"",externalafter being criticised for comparing French President Francois Hollande to a guard in a World War Two escape movie. The paper mocks those who took offence as ""delicate flowers"" and hopes Theresa May does not ""lock Boris in the cooler"" - the punishment usually given to McQueen for his attempted break-outs. The Times says Mr Johnson ""ruffled feathers"",externalwith his words, while theDaily Mirror calls him ""oafish"",externaland says he put fragile relations at risk. The Daily Express sees him fighting back against EU bullies,external, while theDaily Telegraph dismisses the row,externalas a ""phoney controversy"". It says Mr Johnson was just being ""characteristically colourful"" with his words. But one of his loudest critics, the European Parliament's leading Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, is making his voice heard again. In an article for the Guardian,external, he says Britain's demands heading into talks with the EU are ""unreasonable"". ""It is an illusion to suggest that the UK will be permitted to leave the European Union but then be free to opt back into the best parts of the project,"" he says, before concluding that Brexit will be ""a sad and exhausting process"". On its front page, theTimes says cost-cutting measures by the NHS have raised fears,externalabout patient safety. It says one in five newly-approved drugs could be rationed by NHS England to save money, even if they have been judged cost-effective by doctors, so patients will suffer longer waits for medication. Cancer charities tell the paper the change will be devastating to patients. The Times also says drug companies will no longer launch new medicines early in Britain. NHS England has declined to comment. British tourists who had been hoping to soak up some winter sun in The Gambia are packing their bags and ""scrambling"" to leave,according to the Guardian,external, after a political crisis caused the Foreign Office to advise against travel there. ""There is panic,"" says one tourist official. The Sun says British travellers have complained of shambolic organisation. The Times says the scenes of crisis,externalare depressingly predictable. President Yahya Jammeh can avert bloodshed by doing the right thing, it says, or condemn his country to isolation and be remembered as a pariah. The i newspaper,externalsuggests that an ""evocative slice of authentic Americana"", painted by none other than Bob Dylan, might actually be a picture of the pier at Blackpool. Sharp-eyed observers who saw the watercolour at a London gallery found it was identical to a picture posted on the internet by a British photographer. Even a bird on a lamp-post was identical.The photographer tells the Telegraph,externalhe is not angry but ""astonished"" that his work has been appropriated by a Nobel laureate - and labelled as being Norfolk, Virginia. The paper suggests the singer was perhaps unconsciously influenced by playing three concerts at Blackpool's Winter Gardens in 2013.
