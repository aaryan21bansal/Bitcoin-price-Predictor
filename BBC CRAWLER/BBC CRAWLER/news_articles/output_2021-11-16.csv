Liverpool bomber was refused permission for asylum appeal,"Emad Al Swealmeen (on right in light grey jacket) during a service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, alongside the bishop Right Reverend Cyril Ashton The Liverpool bomb attacker was a failed asylum seeker who had been refused permission by judges to appeal to stay in the country. It had been reported - but unconfirmed - that Emad Al Swealmeen lost his asylum claim as long ago as 2014. The BBC has now confirmed he made a legal attempt to gain permission to stay in the UK, but it was rejected without being considered in court. It raises questions as to whether the Home Office then sought to remove him. The Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, a national court that deals with appeals, told the BBC that Al Swealmeen had sought to lodge an appeal after he had lost his case in a lower court that reviews Home Office decisions. But this attempted appeal to the court was refused without ever going to a full hearing - meaning that a judge concluded there were no grounds to overturn the decision. The tribunal has not confirmed when that decision was taken but it is believed to have been in early 2017. Malcolm Hitchcott, a Christian activist in Liverpool, told the BBC he and his wife offered Al Swealmeen a place to stay for eight months from April of that year after he had told them he had lost his case and was destitute. Typically, when someone loses an asylum claim and exhausts their rights to appeal, the Home Office withdraws their financial support and housing and warns them they will be removed from the UK. It is not clear if the Home Office ever told Al Swealmeen he would be removed from the country or whether it took any steps to do so. It is also not yet known where he was seeking asylum from. The Home Office has been contacted for comment. Suspect seemed genuine Christian - church worker Bomb hospital boss thanks 'brave, dedicated' staff Terror threat level 'severe' after Liverpool blast Liverpool explosion: What we know so far Earlier, Mr Hitchcott told BBC Radio Merseyside he and his wife, Elizabeth Hitchcott, had befriended Emad Al Swealmeen, who they also knew as Enzo Almeni when he was destitute. He had come into contact with them through Liverpool Cathedral. There, Christian volunteers worked with predominantly Iranian asylum seekers as they took part in a popular course introducing newcomers to the faith, known as Alpha. Mr Hitchcott said they had not seen Al Swealmeen in the four subsequent years after he left their home. ""He wanted to be a Christian. And he liked what he heard about salvation by faith. And that's what we taught him,"" said Mr Hitchcott. ""He was on the streets, basically... he arrived here on April 2017, he was with us then eight months. During that time we saw him really blossoming as regard to his Christian faith. Every night we used to pray, my wife and him and if there was anybody else in the house we prayed for half an hour or so and studied the scriptures and we had a great time together. ""And I was in no doubt by the time that he left us at the end of that eight months, that he was a Christian."" Malcolm Hitchcott, left, told BBC Merseyside that Al Swealmeen had had ""a real passion for Jesus Christ"" Mr Hitchcott said that he understood that Al Swealmeen had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act some time before his original asylum case was rejected. There have been reports this related to an incident where he had been wielding a knife in public. Ewan Roberts, who works at Asylum Link, a Liverpool-based organisation which supported Al Swealmeen during his application to remain in the UK, said: ""It's quite horrific. There's no place for hate in the world and there's no place for things like that. ""We support thousands of people each year. So when someone that you have helped does something like that it's really hard to deal with it and understand why - we have to try and understand."" This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames Earlier, it emerged that Al Swealmeen had converted to Christianity from Islam. The Diocese of Liverpool's communications director, Stuart Haynes, said he believed Al Swealmeen was baptised in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 - but the cathedral lost contact with him in 2018. The Right Reverend Cyril Ashton, the bishop who confirmed Al Swealmeen and who is pictured with him at the cathedral, said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the bombing. ""His confirmation was one of hundreds I have conducted as a bishop so I have no specific recollection of the individual. The church takes confirmation seriously and I know that he would have been thoroughly prepared with an understanding of the Christian faith. ""It seems that sadly, despite this grounding, the bomber chose a different path for his life.""

University staff to strike in December,"Staff at 74 universities held a 14-day strike over pensions, pay, and conditions last year. Staff at 58 UK universities will go on strike between 1 and 3 December, causing further disruption for students in the run-up to Christmas. They are walking out over pensions, pay and working conditions. The University and College Union (UCU) said more action was ""likely"" if demands were not met, and urged employers to ""get round the table"". Universities UK (UUK) said institutions would ""ensure that students can continue to learn"". The Universities and College Employers Association (UCEA) said strikes were an ""unrealistic attempt"" to reopen pay discussions. The announcement means further turmoil for students, many of whom experienced strikes shortly before months of disruption during the pandemic. University staff back more strikes over pay Academics at 37 universities back strike action At the start of the month,staff at 58 universities voted in favourof more strike action. Some of them are striking over pensions - a dispute which has been rumbling on for nearly a decade, and was reignited because of what the UCU described as a ""flawed valuation"" of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) pension fund. The UCU said it was ""carried out at the start of the pandemic when global markets were crashing"" and would lower members' guaranteed retirement income by 35%. Others are striking over pay and working conditions. The UCUhas demanded,externala Â£2,500 pay increase for members, an end to ""pay injustice"" and zero-hours contracts, and action to tackle ""unmanageable workloads"". Staff at 33 institutions are taking action over both. A further six institutions will not see strikes, but staff voted for action short of a strike over pay. The UCU said this would begin on 1 December, and could last for the five months that staff have a mandate for - and would ""include strictly working to contract and refusing any additional duties"". Jacob Mukherjee, a media, communications and cultural studies lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London, spent entire days in January responding to students' concerns about Covid. ""We feel at breaking point,"" he says. The pandemic caused a ""mass amount of work"". And many staff are on casual contracts that make them feel undervalued. Mr Mukherjee worked this way for seven years himself and has ""lost count"" of the contracts he had. ""The reward for that is a massive cut to our pension, not getting a pay rise and further increasing workloads,"" the 39-year-old UCU representative says. ""Sometimes when you've tried everything else and your back's against the wall, then striking or talking other forms of industrial action is the only option."" Mr Mukherjee acknowledges strikes will disrupt learning but says many students will support them and get a better deal if staff are treated better. ""I would love it if my students took away the message that these things can be fought andâ¦ you can win,"" he adds. The UCU, whichhas published a list,externalof affected institutions, said it had written to UUK and UCEA ""setting out how university bosses could avoid strike action before Christmas"". Its general secretary Jo Grady said she wanted employers to ""get round the table"" and take concerns ""seriously"". ""While we set out pragmatic solutions that could halt widespread disruption to UK campuses, university bosses refuse to revoke unnecessary, swingeing pension cuts or even to negotiate on issues like casualisation and the unbearably high workloads that blight higher education,"" she said. ""A resolution to this dispute is simple. But if employers remain intent on slashing pensions and exploiting staff who have kept this sector afloat during a pandemic then campuses will face strike action before Christmas, which will escalate into spring with re-ballots and further industrial action."" Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, said: ""Staff teaching conditions are student learning conditions. The onus for minimising disruption for students lies with university bosses. They must come back to the table to address the clear issues in how higher education is currently run."" After 18 months of online learning, Millie Innes is ""disheartened"" by the decision to strike. The 21-year-old has had only one ""normal"" semester in three years of English literature and theatre studies at the University of Glasgow, In her first year, strikes meant it was unclear whether classes would be cancelled. Then, the pandemic hit. ""Having to get used to university and in-person classes has been ridiculously challenging after Covid,"" she says. Even things such as meeting new people in lectures have felt ""alien"". ""A strike won't help this transition at all,"" Ms Innes says. And the run-up to Christmas is ""probably the worst time for students to experience a strike"" because many have exams and need extra support and revision classes. But Ms Innes, also an actor, understands the pandemic was also tough for staff, having heard of online classes ""filled with awkward silences and blank screens instead of faces"". ""I can only imagine how intimidating this must be for lecturers,"" she adds. Speaking about strikes over pay, Raj Jethwa, UCEA's chief executive, said industrial action was ""aimed at harming students"" and was an ""unrealistic attempt to try to force"" 146 employers to reopen  a concluded national pay round. On the issues of casual contracts and workload, he said: ""We have made repeated offers of joint work in these areas for two years but UCU has rejected them. UCEA genuinely wishes to engage on these matters as far as we can at a national level, noting that they are ultimately for local negotiations."" A spokesman for Universities UK, speaking about action over pensions, said fewer than 10% of eligible pension scheme members voted yes to strike action in the UCU ballots. ""Strike action will not address the urgent need for reform to keep the scheme affordable,"" he said, adding that UUK was ""fully committed to continuing talks"" about the future of the pension scheme. ""Universities will put in place measures to minimise the impact on students, other staff and the wider university community, and will ensure that students can continue to learn and receive support.""

"Scotland can have 'normal Christmas', says Swinney","People in Scotland can expect a ""normal Christmas"" with some Covid measures, the deputy first minister has said. John Swinney told the BBC that the extension of the vaccine passport scheme and other mitigations would help people live normally. Last winter Scotland was under the toughest level of lockdown restrictions from 26 December until March. Mr Swinney said he wanted to avoid further closure of businesses ""at all possible costs"". He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethe Scottish government was trying to manage Covid to a level that ""enables most of our economy and society to function as close to normality"" as possible. ""I'm very hopeful that this could be a normal Christmas,"" he added. ""It will be a normal Christmas with us all taking care, is what I would say. ""We may have to put in place some additional measures to make sure that is the case."" Live: Nicola Sturgeon's Covid-19 statement to MSPs How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Mr Swinney said such measures included the extension of the vaccine passport scheme, as well as ""intensifying"" the vaccine programme. Earlier, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that vaccine certification could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December. She said a final decision would not be taken until next Tuesday. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Changes to Scotland's coronavirus certification scheme under review The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. A decision had been widely expected to be made this week, with opposition leaders accusing the government of creating ""wholly avoidable uncertainty"" for businesses that could be affected. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs there had been a ""gradual increase"" in new cases of Covid-19 over the last two weeks, with pressure on the health service expected to increase in winter. The first minister said the vaccine passport scheme was making ""an important and proportionate contribution to stemming transmission"". She said the government was also considering whether a negative test result could be provided instead of proof of vaccination, as happens in most other countries that have introduced vaccine passports. She also said choosing not to be vaccinated without good reason was ""deeply irresponsible,"" and urged people to do their ""civic duty"" by getting jabbed. Covid cases in Scotland have started to rise again, having plateaued for several week The government has updated its ""strategic framework,external"" paper with plans for the winter period ahead, with warnings that the country ""risks moving potentially rapidly"" into a challenging situation should a new variant of the virus emerge. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said hospitality venues had been offered a ""stay of execution"", but warned that any expansion of the certification scheme would ""force many premises into closure"". Managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Businesses need time to plan for something major like this, and vague comments like those from Nicola Sturgeon today leave us in limbo for another week as we approach the vital Christmas trading period."" Ministers are watching the situation in Europe very carefully. Many countries there are having to reimpose restrictions because of soaring case numbers. Public health experts don't yet know if this is a new wave that could be coming Scotland's way, or if this is what we already faced back in September. The Scottish government is said to be at a fork in the road, but it can't choose which path to take until it knows the direction of travel of the virus. There is a degree of confidence that three key hurdles have been overcome: pupils are back in school, students have returned to universities and colleges and COP26 has passed without a massive spike in cases. But with Christmas fast approaching, the decision on whether or not to extend vaccine certification will have to be made soon. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said there ""continues to be a sense of anxiety"" among firms about an extension to the scheme, and that ""it would hit consumer confidence and increase costs for businesses"". And the Federation of Small Businesses said there were ""so many unanswered questions about the practicalities of a dramatically expanded scheme"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused the government of having ""a total lack for respect for Scottish businesses"". He said: ""The government has delayed again, creating wholly avoidable uncertainty. Businesses are once again being left in the dark and treated as an afterthought."" The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said ministers should commit to engaging with affected businesses and offer financial support if new measures are introduced. He also said Ms Sturgeon should accept that providing a negative test should have been an option in the system from the outset, saying: ""Testing should always have been at the heart of our Covid reduction strategy."" The first minister said allowing a negative test to be included was a ""finely balanced"" decision, saying it could be argued that the scheme had helped to drive vaccine uptake. However, she said Scotland may now be in a position to include this option due to high levels of uptake of the vaccine. Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government should use the COP26 conference as a model for using regular testing to control the virus rather than vaccine certificates. Data published by Public Health Scotland on Tuesday suggested that only four in every 1,000 delegates tested positive during the Glasgow event, compared with an infection rate of 12 in every 1,000 in Scotland as a whole.

Rafiq tells of 'inhuman' treatment by cricket club,"This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire English cricket is ""institutionally"" racist, says former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq. Rafiq, 30, told a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee that racist language was ""constantly"" used during his time at Yorkshire. In an emotional testimony, he also said the club gave him ""inhuman"" treatment after his son was still-born in 2017. He added the issues he faced at Yorkshire are ""without a shadow of a doubt"" widespread in domestic cricket. Reaction & all the evidence: Rafiq appears before MPs Rafiq said he had lost his career to racism, which is a ""horrible feeling"" but that ""hopefully"" by speaking out there will be ""massive change in five years' time"". ""All I wanted was an acceptance, an apology, an understanding, and let's try and work together to ensure it never happens again,"" he continued. ""I was not going to let this go, no matter how much damage it causes me - I was determined to become a voice for the voiceless."" In wide-ranging testimony, Rafiq also said: All he ever wanted to do was realise his ""dream"" of playing for England Racist language, including terms aimed at his and others' Pakistani heritage, was used ""constantly"" and ""never stamped out"" during his time at Yorkshire The use of such terms was racist and not ""banter"" as the report had concluded It left him feeling ""isolated"" and ""humiliated"", with racist comments made by others in front of team-mates and coaching staff but not challenged The use of such language was so common it ""became the norm"" and people at the club ""didn't think it was wrong"" He ""didn't realise"" and was ""in denial"" about the scale of the problem during most of his first spell at Yorkshire, up until 2014 He thought ""things had changed"" when he returned for his second spell in 2016 But the atmosphere became ""toxic"" after Gary Ballance took over as captain later that year, shortly after former batter Andrew Gale replaced Jason Gillespie as head coach Aged 15 and a practising Muslim, he was pinned down by a senior player at his local cricket club and red wine was poured into his mouth He said he did not drink alcohol again until ""around 2012"" when he felt he had to ""to fit in"" at Yorkshire Asked about claims he had been a ""heavy drinker"", he said he ""wasn't perfect"" and was ""not proud"" of some of the things he did during this time, but that these had ""no relation"" to the racism he was subjected to The report into his allegations was ""shoddy at best"" and the panel failed to speak to key witnesses Rafiq was giving evidence to MPs after a report found he was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the club said they would not discipline anyone. Yorkshire's former chairman Roger Hutton subsequently addressed the committee, followed by representatives from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), including chief executive Tom Harrison. Hutton, who offered his ""profound apologies"" to Rafiq, said Yorkshire's director of cricket Martyn Moxon and former chief executive Mark Arthur ""failed to accept the gravity of the situation"". ""They have not wanted to apologise or take the recommendations of the panel going forward,"" he added. When asked by Damian Green MP if he thought cricket was institutionally racist, Rafiq replied: ""Yes, I do."" In response to a question by Julian Knight MP, chair of the DCMS select committee, on whether the issues he faced were ""replicated"" at other counties, Rafiq said: ""It's a problem up and down the country."" Former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave alleged they received racist abuse while at the club. Essex are facing racism allegations and encouraging those that have experienced discrimination to come forward. Last weekEssex chairman John Faragher resignedfollowing an allegation he used racist language in a 2017 board meeting, which he denies. Former Essex playersZoheb SharifandMaurice Chambershave both alleged they suffered racist abuse at the club. Rafiq said the scale of the problem is ""scary"" and there have been ""denials, briefings, cover-ups, smearing"". He claimed that British Asian representation in professional cricket since 2010 had dropped nearly 40% and that England have missed out on ""a hell of a lot of talent"" because Asian and black cricketers have been subjected to racism. Rafiq also called on the ECB ""to make tangible change"". Anti-racism and anti-fascism campaign group Hope not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles said Rafiq's testimony was ""heartbreaking"" to watch. ""What is most troubling is that what Azeem Rafiq has experienced is not an isolated incident, in cricket or across sport more generally,"" he added. ""Azeem Rafiq's bravery in speaking out against those who abused him needs to be a turning point - this is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with Azeem and run racism out of sport, once and for all."" Yorkshire chairman Lord Patel said it was an ""incredibly difficult day"" for all at the club and that Rafiq's testimony was ""harrowing and upsetting"". He added: ""There is no quick fix to the clear problems which have been identified, and the issues are complex, not least the charge of institutional racism which must be addressed head on."" This video can not be played 'It sounds like the Wild West' - MP Julie Elliott on ECB regulatory process Rafiq said he was subjected to ""inhuman"" treatment after the death of his son, because the club were ""blinded"" to how they should treat him after he raised a complaint about former England player Tim Bresnan in 2017. Rafiq said that the day after his son died, Moxon ""ripped shreds"" off him in a manner he had never seen Moxon use when addressing anyone else at the club. He said he was part of a group of ""six or seven"" players who complained about Bresnan, who now plays for Warwickshire, after which he said the club saw him as a ""trouble-maker"". He added he was the only player of colour in that group and was ""the only one to get repercussions"". Rafiq added that head coach Gale's attitude towards the death of Rafiq's son was that Rafiq was ""making it more than what it is"", and that ""hardly anyone"" asked after his and his wife's wellbeing. At the end of his session, Rafiq said his wife ""has struggled and still continues"" to and that his two young children ""have not had a dad, really, because all I have been worried about is Yorkshire going out to discredit me and how I am going to deal with it"". He added: ""It has been challenging, but I hope today provides some sort of closure and I can treat her for what she deserves."" Warwickshire said the report includes allegations of bullying against Rafiq by Bresnan regarding comments Bresnan made about Rafiq's weight. They said: ""We have spoken to Tim about this and he admits making such a comment. We understand there was no substantiated suggestion of racism against Tim, but he is devastated to learn of the impact of his comments."" Bresnan responded in a statement, stating: ""I have been made aware of the bullying claims made against me and have listened to Azeem Rafiq's account of his time at Yorkshire CCC today with great distress, as I'm sure everyone will have done. ""For any part I played in contributing to Azeem Rafiq's experience of feeling bullied at Yorkshire, I apologise unreservedly."" Gale is currently suspendedas part of an investigation into a tweet he sent in 2010. Moxon is currently absent from work because of a ""stress-related illness"" and Yorkshire said he ""will be given the necessary support"". BBC Sport is approaching Gale for comment. Yorkshire batter Ballance, who played 23 Tests for England, said earlier this month he ""regrets"" using racist language towards Rafiq, who he regarded as his ""best mate in cricket"". Rafiq said he became friends with Zimbabwe-born Ballance when he joined Yorkshire from Derbyshire in 2008 because he felt he was an ""outsider"" as well and that others called Ballance ""things that were out of order"". But he added their relationship ""started to deteriorate"" around 2013 because of Ballance's ""conduct"" and that his ""behaviour was so disgusting"" Rafiq raised it with an agent they shared. Rafiq said they remained ""amicable"" but not close afterwards and that Ballance found the captaincy a ""real struggle"" in 2017, resulting in a ""toxic"" dressing room. He added that Ballance used the name 'Kevin' as a ""derogatory"" term to refer to any player of colour and this was an ""open secret"", including within the England dressing room. Rafiq said that England batter Alex Hales named his dog Kevin ""because it's black"". ""It's disgusting how much of a joke it was,"" said Rafiq. He added that India batter Cheteshwar Pujara was called 'Steve' by coaches, players and the Yorkshire website after bowler Jack Brooks, who now plays for Somerset, started calling Pujara that because he could not pronounce his first name. Pujara said he did not like being called Steve and wouldprefer his team-mates to call him Cheteshwar.,external BBC Sport is approaching Hales and Brooks for comment. Somerset said they ""take a zero-tolerance approach to any form of behaviour which is anything other than inclusive for all, regardless of gender, race, sexuality or any other characteristic"". They added: ""Any case reported will be thoroughly investigated as it is important that we learn lessons from the past and we welcome any information on incidents that may have occurred to help us do so."" More on Ballance's previous response to this story Rafiq alleges former England captain and BBC cricket pundit Michael Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other Asian players in 2009 while they were all at Yorkshire. England bowler Adil Rashid and former Pakistan bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan have corroborated the allegation, whichVaughan ""completely and categorically denies"". ""It's important on Michael that we don't make it all about Michael,"" said Rafiq. ""It was a long time ago. He might not remember it because it doesn't mean anything to him."" England Test captain Joe Root said the Yorkshire racism scandal has ""fractured our game and torn lives apart"" but thathe could not recall any instance of racismduring his time at the club. Rafiq said Root has never used racist language but he found his statement ""hurtful"" because Root was Ballance's housemate and was on nights out when racist language directed at his Pakistan heritage was used. ""Joe might not remember it but that shows just how normal it was - even a good man like him can't see it for what it is,"" he said. ""The environment and institution is the problem."" Rafiq said that following an interview on Sky, former England bowler and Yorkshire team-mate Matthew Hoggard called him and said ""I am sorry if some of the comments made you feel how you described it"". Rafiq said he thanked Hoggard for his apology and really appreciated it. BBC Sport is approaching Hoggard for comment. Rafiq also said that Sky Sports commentator David Lloyd, a former Lancashire captain and England player and later coach, had made disparaging comments about Asian cricketers after Rafiq spoke about his experiences on television. He said there were ""high-profile"" media people ""messaging other members of the media who have supported me, saying stuff like: 'Well, a clubhouse is the lifeblood of a club, and Asian players don't go in there.'"" Rafiq subsequently identified that person as Lloyd. In response, Lloyd said he had ""made some comments about the Asian cricket community"" and that he ""deeply regrets"" his actions. ""I apologise most sincerely to Azeem and to the Asian community for doing this, and for any offence caused,"" he added. Sky said in a statement it was ""investigating the comments"" attributed to Lloyd and that it was ""committed to actively championing inclusion in cricket - and in all sports - and opposing all forms of discrimination"". Rafiq first spoke out last year, claiming ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire left him close to taking his own life. Seven of the 43 allegations were upheld by an independent panel last month and the report found he had been a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" at the club. However, Yorkshire said they will not take disciplinary action against any player, employee or executive. Hutton and Arthur have subsequently resigned, with Hutton's replacement as chairman, Lord Patel, apologising ""unreservedly"" and settling the employment tribunal with Rafiq. Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting international matches by the ECB. Kit supplier Nike, plus several of Yorkshire's sponsors, including Emerald Publishing, Yorkshire Tea, Tetley's beer and leisure club operators David Lloyd, either ended partnerships or said they would not continue deals. BBC Sport is approaching Yorkshire for further comment in response to today's evidence.

What are MSPs earning their extra income from?,"The most prominent example of MSP ""double jobbing"" right now is Conservative leader Douglas Ross With Westminster in turmoil over the question of whether MPs should be allowed to hold second jobs, what is the situation at Holyrood? How many MSPs have reported income on top of their salary, and where is it coming from? Scandals about second jobs have been relatively few and far between at Holyrood. In 2019, even the suggestion that former Conservative leader Ruth Davidson might take up a paid post with a lobbying firm was enough to spark such an outcry thatshe changed her mind and turned the job down. Labour's Neil Findlay actually lodgeda members bill,externalseeking to ban MSPs from certain external jobs, but found relatively few supporters for it across the chamber - despite some sympathy from SNP and Green backbenchers. It may depend on what is categorised as a ""second job"", but at present fully one-third of MSPs - 45 of the 129 - have reported some kind of income above and beyond their Holyrood salary, including members of every party. In the vast majority of cases, the sums of money involved are not huge, and there are many caveats in terms of things like charitable donations and rental arrangements which actually make a loss. However, despite the fact that everything from gifts and funded overseas trips to heritable property and shares must be declared, it can sometimes be difficult to work out exactly how much money some members are making. As at Westminster, registers of interests are not neatly standardised. For example, most MSPs who own companies declare their commercial income as a gross figure, subject to unquantified costs and losses. Some spell out exactly how much they expect to withdraw for themselves, while others offer an estimate of how the pandemic has hit revenues. The same is true of those who rent out property. And adding another layer of complexity, some own a ""part-share"" in a house or firm, and then declare its gross income without detailing precisely what their cut of that might be. And while many MSPs have declared nothing at all, others have been so diligent that they have formally noted their party membership as a potential interest. SNP Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson is managing director of two firms The most prominent example of ""double jobbing"" right now isDouglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader who also serves as MP for Moray. This kind of dual mandate is not particularly unusual. Holyrood has specific rules for just such an occurrence, which mean Mr Ross's MSP salary is reduced, and he donates it to charity - even if he did apparentlyforget to register it with the Westminster authorities. There are also 17 other MSPs who currently hold another elected position - alllocal councillors, and members who were elected to Holyrood for the first time in May. This includes11 SNP members, four Conservatives and two from Labour. Most of these new MSPs have indicated they will be stepping down from their council jobs when local elections roll around in 2022 - presumably to avoid forcing a round of costly by-elections this close to the end of term, although a few former councillors did quit after becoming MSPs in May. And many - although not all - say they will be donating their Â£18,000 salary to charity now that they are receiving a larger salary from parliament. A number of MSPs havecompany directorships- although in many cases with the firms they ran themselves before entering politics. In many cases, these firms are essentially dormant; for example the SNP's Constitution SecretaryAngus Robertsonis managing director of two firms, focused on opinion polling and management consultancy, but says he ""will not undertake any work"" for them having now become an MSP. Among active directorships, the biggest earners are Conservative MSPs - like Aberdeenshire West representativeAlexander Burnett, who owns an estate and is listed as the beneficiary of a pair of trusts which add up to more than Â£30m in value. He has a number of company directorships, the most lucrative being of his own AJA Burnett Estate, which encompasses various agricultural, residential and commercial lettings as well as forestry and sporting interests, and generates a gross annual income of up to Â£580,000. Mr Burnett stated that he expected to withdraw up to Â£180,000 from the firm in 2021-22 - a reasonably rare example of the register being clear about exactly how much money an MSP expects to take home from their business. Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie lets out a flat in Portugal Another Tory MSP,Donald Cameron, owns the Achnacarry Estate in the Highlands - the ancestral seat of Clan Cameron. The estate had income of between Â£830,000 and Â£840,000 last year, with a range of interests from residential, holiday and crofting lets to renewable energy, telecoms and deerstalking. However, Mr Cameron noted this gross figure does not take account of costs and losses to the business, leaving it unclear what the overall level of profit - if any - might have been. In previous years' register entries he has stated that he was not in receipt of any taxable income from the estate, but there is no mention of this on the current register. Mr Cameron is also a non-executive director of the Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust, which pays him between Â£25,000 and Â£30,000 to attend five half-day board meetings per year. He had a similar role with another investment firm, the Murray Income Trust, with the same recorded pay and hours, before retiring on 2 November 2021. Beyond those with large estates, there are a lot of landlords at Holyrood. A total of 24 different MSPs have declaredproperty holdings, from flats to commercial premises to farmland. These properties are scattered across Scotland and beyond - Labour's deputy leaderJackie Baillielets out a flat in Portugal - and range in scale fromRhoda Grant'sone-sixth share of a house in Lewis toEdward Mountain'scollection of cottages in Moray. Letting out a flat may not be a ""second job"" in the traditional sense of requiring regular working hours. But it does mean there is a sizable bloc of MSPs who have an interest to declare when the parliament is considering live issues like rent controls or regulating short-term lets. In terms of the rents being charged, none of the sums involved is particularly staggering. Indeed, a handful of members say their properties yield so little money that they don't turn a profit. Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton sub-lets part of his home on Airbnb. For example, Net Zero SecretaryMichael Mathesonsays he owns a house in the Highlands that generates an income of between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000 a year, but that ""it does not make a profit due to running costs"". It doesn't even need to be a whole property - Lib Dem leaderAlex Cole-Hamiltonbrings in between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000 a year sub-letting part of his home on Airbnb. At the other end of the hospitality scale, two MSPs ownhotelswith their partners. Both ToryRachael Hamiltonand the SNP'sEmma Harperhost guests in the south of Scotland - although Ms Hamilton paid her Â£2,000 of dividends straight back into the company last year, while Ms Harper only takes Â£3,000 in remuneration from her guest house. Ms Harper also volunteers as a nurse, and is not the only MSP working in the health service - Conservative health spokesmanSandesh Gulhaneworks one day a week as aGP. These are of course the kind of ""second jobs"" that politicians routinely point to in defence when the issue comes up - worthy endeavours which contribute both to society and to parliament's collective understanding of a crucial field like primary care. Meanwhile three MSPs also receiveroyalties from booksthey wrote prior to being elected, including Green MSPAriane Burgessand SNP ministers Angus Robertson andJenny Gilruth- who wrote a school textbook in her previous life as a teacher.

Two energy firms stop trading as gas price soars,"Two more energy suppliers with a combined total of 35,500 customers have ceased trading amid a backdrop of high wholesale gas prices. Neon Reef and Social Energy Supply have stopped trading, according to the energy regulator Ofgem. Neon is the larger of the two with 30,000 domestic customers. It means that more than 20 suppliers have now ceased operations since August, affecting more than two million customers overall. Those households have been moved to new suppliers, but generally on more expensive tariffs. Ofgem said that customers of Neon and Social Energy Supply should take meter readings and wait for more information regarding their new supplier. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Why are gas prices so high? Energy regulator says gas crisis not its fault ""Do not switch in the meantime. You can rely on your energy supply as normal. We will update you when we have chosen a new supplier, who will then get in touch about your tariff,"" said Neil Lawrence, director of retail at Ofgem. ""If you have credit on your account the funds you have paid in are protected and you will not lose the money that is owed to you."" Suppliers are under pressure from high wholesale gas prices, and also by their inability to pass on extra costs to customers protected by fixed tariffs, or the regulator's price cap. Wholesale gas prices in the UKsurged by 17% on Tuesdayafter the German energy regulator suspended the approval process for a new Russian pipeline. The pipeline which goes under the Baltic Sea is expected to double the amount of gas that Russia sells to Europe. Energy regulator says gas crisis not its fault How much are energy bills going up?

Premier League chair Hoffman to resign,"Gary Hoffman (left) was appointed Premier League chairman in April 2020 Gary Hoffman is set to step down as chairman of the Premier League following a backlash from clubs relating to Newcastle United's takeover by a Saudi Arabian-based consortium. Clubs complained to the Premier League in Octoberafter it cleared the deal, with frustration over how the buyers passed the owners' and directors' test. There are numeroushuman rights issues linked to Saudi Arabia. Amnesty International has since called for the ownership test to be changed. The 61-year-old, who has been the Premier League's chairman for 18 months, has taken the brunt of the blame from clubs over the green light being given to the takeover by the Public Investment Fund. Although Premier League officials felt there was no option other than to allow the deal to go through 18 months after it was first halted, clubs were unhappy at being told about it so late that they could not mobilise an attempt to stop it. Clubs have already started the process ofstopping commercial deals associated with the ownershipin an effort to reduce the amount of money Newcastle can spend, for fear it will distort the league. It is understood Hoffman is yet to take a final decision but an announcement of his departure is expected in the coming days. He took over as Premier League chairman in April 2020 after Claudia Arney served as acting chair following Richard Scudamore's departure in 2018. Soon after his appointment, Hoffman received criticism for his knowledge of talks about the failed European Super League project and the Newcastle situation has exacerbated concerns. His likely departure comes at a delicate time for the Premier League, with clubs waiting for the findings of MP Tracey Crouch's fan-led review, in addition to continuing negotiations over key overseas television rights deals,the United States one being poised to go to second bids this week.

"University staff to strike in DecemberStaff at 58 universities will go on strike, causing disruption for students in the run-up to Christmas.Family & Education","Staff at 74 universities held a 14-day strike over pensions, pay, and conditions last year. Staff at 58 UK universities will go on strike between 1 and 3 December, causing further disruption for students in the run-up to Christmas. They are walking out over pensions, pay and working conditions. The University and College Union (UCU) said more action was ""likely"" if demands were not met, and urged employers to ""get round the table"". Universities UK (UUK) said institutions would ""ensure that students can continue to learn"". The Universities and College Employers Association (UCEA) said strikes were an ""unrealistic attempt"" to reopen pay discussions. The announcement means further turmoil for students, many of whom experienced strikes shortly before months of disruption during the pandemic. University staff back more strikes over pay Academics at 37 universities back strike action At the start of the month,staff at 58 universities voted in favourof more strike action. Some of them are striking over pensions - a dispute which has been rumbling on for nearly a decade, and was reignited because of what the UCU described as a ""flawed valuation"" of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) pension fund. The UCU said it was ""carried out at the start of the pandemic when global markets were crashing"" and would lower members' guaranteed retirement income by 35%. Others are striking over pay and working conditions. The UCUhas demanded,externala Â£2,500 pay increase for members, an end to ""pay injustice"" and zero-hours contracts, and action to tackle ""unmanageable workloads"". Staff at 33 institutions are taking action over both. A further six institutions will not see strikes, but staff voted for action short of a strike over pay. The UCU said this would begin on 1 December, and could last for the five months that staff have a mandate for - and would ""include strictly working to contract and refusing any additional duties"". Jacob Mukherjee, a media, communications and cultural studies lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London, spent entire days in January responding to students' concerns about Covid. ""We feel at breaking point,"" he says. The pandemic caused a ""mass amount of work"". And many staff are on casual contracts that make them feel undervalued. Mr Mukherjee worked this way for seven years himself and has ""lost count"" of the contracts he had. ""The reward for that is a massive cut to our pension, not getting a pay rise and further increasing workloads,"" the 39-year-old UCU representative says. ""Sometimes when you've tried everything else and your back's against the wall, then striking or talking other forms of industrial action is the only option."" Mr Mukherjee acknowledges strikes will disrupt learning but says many students will support them and get a better deal if staff are treated better. ""I would love it if my students took away the message that these things can be fought andâ¦ you can win,"" he adds. The UCU, whichhas published a list,externalof affected institutions, said it had written to UUK and UCEA ""setting out how university bosses could avoid strike action before Christmas"". Its general secretary Jo Grady said she wanted employers to ""get round the table"" and take concerns ""seriously"". ""While we set out pragmatic solutions that could halt widespread disruption to UK campuses, university bosses refuse to revoke unnecessary, swingeing pension cuts or even to negotiate on issues like casualisation and the unbearably high workloads that blight higher education,"" she said. ""A resolution to this dispute is simple. But if employers remain intent on slashing pensions and exploiting staff who have kept this sector afloat during a pandemic then campuses will face strike action before Christmas, which will escalate into spring with re-ballots and further industrial action."" Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, said: ""Staff teaching conditions are student learning conditions. The onus for minimising disruption for students lies with university bosses. They must come back to the table to address the clear issues in how higher education is currently run."" After 18 months of online learning, Millie Innes is ""disheartened"" by the decision to strike. The 21-year-old has had only one ""normal"" semester in three years of English literature and theatre studies at the University of Glasgow, In her first year, strikes meant it was unclear whether classes would be cancelled. Then, the pandemic hit. ""Having to get used to university and in-person classes has been ridiculously challenging after Covid,"" she says. Even things such as meeting new people in lectures have felt ""alien"". ""A strike won't help this transition at all,"" Ms Innes says. And the run-up to Christmas is ""probably the worst time for students to experience a strike"" because many have exams and need extra support and revision classes. But Ms Innes, also an actor, understands the pandemic was also tough for staff, having heard of online classes ""filled with awkward silences and blank screens instead of faces"". ""I can only imagine how intimidating this must be for lecturers,"" she adds. Speaking about strikes over pay, Raj Jethwa, UCEA's chief executive, said industrial action was ""aimed at harming students"" and was an ""unrealistic attempt to try to force"" 146 employers to reopen  a concluded national pay round. On the issues of casual contracts and workload, he said: ""We have made repeated offers of joint work in these areas for two years but UCU has rejected them. UCEA genuinely wishes to engage on these matters as far as we can at a national level, noting that they are ultimately for local negotiations."" A spokesman for Universities UK, speaking about action over pensions, said fewer than 10% of eligible pension scheme members voted yes to strike action in the UCU ballots. ""Strike action will not address the urgent need for reform to keep the scheme affordable,"" he said, adding that UUK was ""fully committed to continuing talks"" about the future of the pension scheme. ""Universities will put in place measures to minimise the impact on students, other staff and the wider university community, and will ensure that students can continue to learn and receive support.""

Bomber was refused permission for asylum appeal,"Emad Al Swealmeen (on right in light grey jacket) during a service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, alongside the bishop Right Reverend Cyril Ashton The Liverpool bomb attacker was a failed asylum seeker who had been refused permission by judges to appeal to stay in the country. It had been reported - but unconfirmed - that Emad Al Swealmeen lost his asylum claim as long ago as 2014. The BBC has now confirmed he made a legal attempt to gain permission to stay in the UK, but it was rejected without being considered in court. It raises questions as to whether the Home Office then sought to remove him. The Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, a national court that deals with appeals, told the BBC that Al Swealmeen had sought to lodge an appeal after he had lost his case in a lower court that reviews Home Office decisions. But this attempted appeal to the court was refused without ever going to a full hearing - meaning that a judge concluded there were no grounds to overturn the decision. The tribunal has not confirmed when that decision was taken but it is believed to have been in early 2017. Malcolm Hitchcott, a Christian activist in Liverpool, told the BBC he and his wife offered Al Swealmeen a place to stay for eight months from April of that year after he had told them he had lost his case and was destitute. Typically, when someone loses an asylum claim and exhausts their rights to appeal, the Home Office withdraws their financial support and housing and warns them they will be removed from the UK. It is not clear if the Home Office ever told Al Swealmeen he would be removed from the country or whether it took any steps to do so. It is also not yet known where he was seeking asylum from. The Home Office has been contacted for comment. Suspect seemed genuine Christian - church worker Bomb hospital boss thanks 'brave, dedicated' staff Terror threat level 'severe' after Liverpool blast Liverpool explosion: What we know so far Earlier, Mr Hitchcott told BBC Radio Merseyside he and his wife, Elizabeth Hitchcott, had befriended Emad Al Swealmeen, who they also knew as Enzo Almeni when he was destitute. He had come into contact with them through Liverpool Cathedral. There, Christian volunteers worked with predominantly Iranian asylum seekers as they took part in a popular course introducing newcomers to the faith, known as Alpha. Mr Hitchcott said they had not seen Al Swealmeen in the four subsequent years after he left their home. ""He wanted to be a Christian. And he liked what he heard about salvation by faith. And that's what we taught him,"" said Mr Hitchcott. ""He was on the streets, basically... he arrived here on April 2017, he was with us then eight months. During that time we saw him really blossoming as regard to his Christian faith. Every night we used to pray, my wife and him and if there was anybody else in the house we prayed for half an hour or so and studied the scriptures and we had a great time together. ""And I was in no doubt by the time that he left us at the end of that eight months, that he was a Christian."" Malcolm Hitchcott, left, told BBC Merseyside that Al Swealmeen had had ""a real passion for Jesus Christ"" Mr Hitchcott said that he understood that Al Swealmeen had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act some time before his original asylum case was rejected. There have been reports this related to an incident where he had been wielding a knife in public. Ewan Roberts, who works at Asylum Link, a Liverpool-based organisation which supported Al Swealmeen during his application to remain in the UK, said: ""It's quite horrific. There's no place for hate in the world and there's no place for things like that. ""We support thousands of people each year. So when someone that you have helped does something like that it's really hard to deal with it and understand why - we have to try and understand."" This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames Earlier, it emerged that Al Swealmeen had converted to Christianity from Islam. The Diocese of Liverpool's communications director, Stuart Haynes, said he believed Al Swealmeen was baptised in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 - but the cathedral lost contact with him in 2018. The Right Reverend Cyril Ashton, the bishop who confirmed Al Swealmeen and who is pictured with him at the cathedral, said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the bombing. ""His confirmation was one of hundreds I have conducted as a bishop so I have no specific recollection of the individual. The church takes confirmation seriously and I know that he would have been thoroughly prepared with an understanding of the Christian faith. ""It seems that sadly, despite this grounding, the bomber chose a different path for his life.""

Workers call the shots as job vacancies boom,"Job vacancies hit a fresh record high in October as employers continued to struggle with worker shortages, official figures show. The redundancy rate was also largely unchanged despite the end of the furlough scheme in September, making it even harder to fill empty posts. Employers report having to improve pay and benefits to attract new recruits. Yet one analyst warned the trend was likely to continue amid a shortage of younger workers and those over 50. According to the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS), there were 1.17 million job openings in October - almost 400,000 higher than before the pandemic. Moreover, some 2.2 million people started a new job between July and September, it said. Daniel Browne, who runs Blossom & Browne's Sycamore, a laundry service for London hotels, says trying to hire new staff has been ""horrific"" this year. He says Covid and Brexit have reduced his headcount from 140 to about 80, making it impossible to meet client needs. He has had to put up wages amid a ""price war"" for temporary staff, and improve pay and conditions for existing staff in order to retain them. ""We're trying to create a happier workforce,"" he told the BBC. ""We're starting at 8am, rather than 7am because that was the staff feedback we had. We're trying to raise our wage rates as much as we can and pass that cost onto our clients."" Some had thought a rise in redundancies after the furlough scheme ended would make it easier to fill the high number of vacancies. An estimated 1.1 million people were still on the job support scheme in its final days. Yet while redundancies rose slightly in the three months to September, the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, close to its pre-pandemic level. Moreover, there were 160,000 more workers on payrolls in October than September. ""It might take a few months to see the full impact of furlough coming to an end, as people who lost their jobs at the end of September could still be receiving redundancy pay,"" said Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS. ""However, October's early estimate shows the number of people on the payroll rose strongly on the month and stands well above its pre-pandemic level. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? What are my rights if I am made redundant? ""There is also no sign of an upturn in redundancies and businesses tell us that only a very small proportion of their previously furloughed staff have been laid off."" Angela Burns is another employer struggling to recruit in the current climate. She runs a group of four hotels across the Midlands and Gloucestershire, and has at least 20 vacancies, with chefs and housekeeping staff among the most difficult positions to fill. ""There's a huge demand out there for people to come to our hotels. The phones have been so busy, but we're having to close areas of the hotel because we don't have the staff to cope,"" she told the BBC. Angela said the recruitment process had been frustrating, and that many candidates ""just don't turn up for interview"". She added that people were looking for more than a just pay rise these days. ""It's about flexible working, it's fitting things in with their family, it's training, it's future career prospects as well,"" she said. Gerwyn Davies, an analyst for the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said employees were ""taking advantage of the tight 'job-seeker friendly' labour market [and] re-thinking their career priorities after the pandemic"". In response, he said employers needed to improve how they developed and retained staff, going ""beyond simply a competitive salary"". ""[It could] include the quality of line management, the availability of different types of flexible working arrangements and opportunities to develop new skills and progress,"" he said. The Institute for Employment Studies (IES), a think tank, said there was a huge ""participation gap"" in the labour force caused by older people not going back to work after losing their jobs, and more young people staying in education. It added that it expects the trend to continue. ""All told, we've nearly a million workers now missing from the labour market, and their absence is now holding back our recovery and adding to inflation,"" said IES director Tony Wilson. ""We're still doing nowhere near enough to help get people back into work, particularly for older workers, disabled people and parents."" October's strong jobs data appears to increase the likelihood that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from their record lows before the end of the year, as it seeks to tame inflation. The cost of living has increased sharply since the economy has reopened and is expected to hit as much as 5%, according to the Bank's forecasts. Bank of England sorry for rising cost of living Many analysts had expected the Bank to raise rates at its meeting earlier this month, but it chose to keep them on hold. On Monday, Bank governor Andrew Bailey told MPs it had been waiting for official data on the impact of the end of furlough before it made a move. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""If the next labour market release on 14 December tells a similar story, we think that will be enough to prompt the Bank to raise interest rates from 0.10% to 0.25% at the meeting on 16 December."" But others noted that the Bank may wait given that theUK's economic recovery slowed between July and Septemberdue to global supply chain problems. ""Uncertainty is not over yet,"" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.â¯â¯""We expect the Bank will wait with the first hike until February next year, but... an earlier move in December cannot be ruled out."" The Bank of England said last week that one of the reasons it didn't want to raise interest rates yet was because of the uncertainties in the labour market, not least because at the end of September there were still 1.1 million people on furlough. The fear has always been that that would translate into a big jump in unemployment. Today's figures provide some measure of reassurance about that, showing the number of payrolled employees rose sharply in October. The Bank is also keeping a close eye on upward pressures on inflation. While average earnings have been growing much faster than inflation, they've more recently slowed down, rising by 4.9% excluding bonuses on the latest figures. That's still faster than inflation but when you strip out distortions relating to the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics reckons it's closer to 3.4%. Given the official forecasts that inflation will get up above 4% next year and possibly as high as 5%, the big risk now looks to be less that pay growth might drive inflation up - and more that pay doesn't keep up with prices, dragging living standards down.

Scottish vaccine passport extension could start next month,"People in Scotland can expect a ""normal Christmas"" with some Covid measures, the deputy first minister has said. John Swinney told the BBC that the extension of the vaccine passport scheme and other mitigations would help people live normally. Last winter Scotland was under the toughest level of lockdown restrictions from 26 December until March. Mr Swinney said he wanted to avoid further closure of businesses ""at all possible costs"". He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethe Scottish government was trying to manage Covid to a level that ""enables most of our economy and society to function as close to normality"" as possible. ""I'm very hopeful that this could be a normal Christmas,"" he added. ""It will be a normal Christmas with us all taking care, is what I would say. ""We may have to put in place some additional measures to make sure that is the case."" Live: Nicola Sturgeon's Covid-19 statement to MSPs How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Mr Swinney said such measures included the extension of the vaccine passport scheme, as well as ""intensifying"" the vaccine programme. Earlier, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that vaccine certification could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December. She said a final decision would not be taken until next Tuesday. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Changes to Scotland's coronavirus certification scheme under review The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. A decision had been widely expected to be made this week, with opposition leaders accusing the government of creating ""wholly avoidable uncertainty"" for businesses that could be affected. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs there had been a ""gradual increase"" in new cases of Covid-19 over the last two weeks, with pressure on the health service expected to increase in winter. The first minister said the vaccine passport scheme was making ""an important and proportionate contribution to stemming transmission"". She said the government was also considering whether a negative test result could be provided instead of proof of vaccination, as happens in most other countries that have introduced vaccine passports. She also said choosing not to be vaccinated without good reason was ""deeply irresponsible,"" and urged people to do their ""civic duty"" by getting jabbed. Covid cases in Scotland have started to rise again, having plateaued for several week The government has updated its ""strategic framework,external"" paper with plans for the winter period ahead, with warnings that the country ""risks moving potentially rapidly"" into a challenging situation should a new variant of the virus emerge. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said hospitality venues had been offered a ""stay of execution"", but warned that any expansion of the certification scheme would ""force many premises into closure"". Managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Businesses need time to plan for something major like this, and vague comments like those from Nicola Sturgeon today leave us in limbo for another week as we approach the vital Christmas trading period."" Ministers are watching the situation in Europe very carefully. Many countries there are having to reimpose restrictions because of soaring case numbers. Public health experts don't yet know if this is a new wave that could be coming Scotland's way, or if this is what we already faced back in September. The Scottish government is said to be at a fork in the road, but it can't choose which path to take until it knows the direction of travel of the virus. There is a degree of confidence that three key hurdles have been overcome: pupils are back in school, students have returned to universities and colleges and COP26 has passed without a massive spike in cases. But with Christmas fast approaching, the decision on whether or not to extend vaccine certification will have to be made soon. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said there ""continues to be a sense of anxiety"" among firms about an extension to the scheme, and that ""it would hit consumer confidence and increase costs for businesses"". And the Federation of Small Businesses said there were ""so many unanswered questions about the practicalities of a dramatically expanded scheme"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused the government of having ""a total lack for respect for Scottish businesses"". He said: ""The government has delayed again, creating wholly avoidable uncertainty. Businesses are once again being left in the dark and treated as an afterthought."" The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said ministers should commit to engaging with affected businesses and offer financial support if new measures are introduced. He also said Ms Sturgeon should accept that providing a negative test should have been an option in the system from the outset, saying: ""Testing should always have been at the heart of our Covid reduction strategy."" The first minister said allowing a negative test to be included was a ""finely balanced"" decision, saying it could be argued that the scheme had helped to drive vaccine uptake. However, she said Scotland may now be in a position to include this option due to high levels of uptake of the vaccine. Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government should use the COP26 conference as a model for using regular testing to control the virus rather than vaccine certificates. Data published by Public Health Scotland on Tuesday suggested that only four in every 1,000 delegates tested positive during the Glasgow event, compared with an infection rate of 12 in every 1,000 in Scotland as a whole.

Amazon will pay a $500,000 (Â£370,000) legal settlement in the US over claims it failed to adequately inform its warehouse workers or public health officials about Covid-19 cases in the workplace. The corporation did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing the settlement, which comes under California's ""right to know"" rules that require employers to keep staff informed of potential Covid exposures. The state's attorney general Rob Bonta said Amazon workers had been left ""terrified and powerless"" and local public health bodies were often left ""unable to effectively track the spread of the virus"". The ruling applies only to California - where the company employs around 150,000 people - and must still be approved by a judge.

Read more about the settlementhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Zhang Yujing A Chinese woman who was meant to be deported from
the US nearly two years ago has finally arrived back on home turf. Zhang Yujing was convicted of trespassing at
former President Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago Florida club in 2019. She had told the
court that she had âcome to meet the president and his family and make
friendsâ. She was sentenced to eight monthsâ imprisonment,
and completed her sentence in December 2019. Zhang was then transferred to
an immigration detention centre and was set to be deported. However, due to travel bans imposed during the
pandemic, she spent âthree times longer than her prison sentenceâ
in immigration custody. She finally left the US over the weekend, and
media in China are today calling her a âhaplessâ woman who experienced âa
prison disasterâ. State media were extremely critical when she was
originally sentenced. Global Times said in April 2019 that it was âshamefulâ
that she was treated like a âChinese spyâ. The Tesco advert shows Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass A Christmas advertisement for Tesco featuring Father Christmas with a Covid vaccine passport has prompted more than 3,000 complaints - making it the most complained about ad of the year so far. It shows the supermarket's customers determined to enjoy a proper Christmas celebration after last year's Covid-related restrictions. But in one scene a reporter tells viewers that Santa ""could be quarantined"" before cutting to Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass at border control, which proves he has been vaccinated so he can enter the country. An Advertising Standards Authority spokesman says: ""The large majority of complaints assert that the ad is coercive, and encourages medical discrimination based on vaccine status."" Tesco says it ""respects everyone's views"" adding it was a ""light-hearted"" campaign that had been ""well-received"". Belgium has seen almost 10,000 daily Covid cases in recent days (file pic) Staff in Belgium's health and social care sector have been told they will be fired if they fail to get Covid vaccinations by 1 April 2022. Anyone who has not yet had a jab by the new year will be moved away from frontline care and given three months to get vaccinated, under the proposed law. Like much of Europe, Belgium has seen a surge in cases and several areas are seeing record numbers of Covid hospital admissions. On Monday Austria imposed a lockdown on anyone who had not yet been vaccinated. Now Belgian ministers have reached agreement on compulsory jabs for thousands of care workers. ""It can't be right that there is still a small minority that haven't been vaccinated,"" said Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke. ""We're giving these people until 1 April next year to get themselves vaccinated."" US drug company Pfizer has penned a deal to allowits experimental Covid-19 treatment pillto be made and sold in 95 developing nations. The deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool not-for-profit could make the treatment available to 53% of the world's population. But it excludes several countries that have had large Covid-19 outbreaks, including Brazil. Pfizer says the pill lessens the risk of severe disease in vulnerable adults. The US company says the agreement will allow local medicine manufacturers to produce the pill ""with the goal of facilitating greater access to the global population"". You can read morehere. The UK has recorded a further 37,243 coronavirus cases in the latest 24-hour period, official government figures show. A further 214 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded. That takes the total deaths by that measure to 142,945 since the start of the pandemic. Since October, adults in Scotland must demonstrate - if asked - they have had both doses of a Covid vaccine before they can get into certain venues and events. These include nightclubs, indoor events of 500 or more people and outdoor events of more than 4,000. It works through the use of the NHS Scotland Covid Status App, which generates a QR code on people's phones that can be scanned by venues, or through requesting a ""secure, uneditable"" paper record. For nightclubs and smaller events, everyone entering should be checked, but at larger events a ""reasonable number"" of spot-checks being carried out - in many cases around one in five people - is acceptable. You can read more about Scotland's vaccine passports schemehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been 11 local cases of Covid-19 reported in
China in the last 24 hours. Cases of the virus are subsiding since an outbreak began a
month ago; today, official media are only recording single-digit cases in the
countryâs provinces. Over the last month, the outbreak caused more than 1,000 cases of Covid-19, reaching two thirds of the countryâs
provincial-level regions. The majority of cases have been in the countryâs
north, where the temperature is currently below zero Celsius. More than 75% of Chinaâs population is fully vaccinated,
and booster jabs are under way in most major cities. However, as China has a
zero-Covid policy, strict measures remain in place to ensure that the virus
doesnât spread. It is routine for communities to lock down the moment a fresh
case of the virus is identified, and city-wide testing drives are
orchestrated. Currently, there are
enhanced Covid-19 measures at the countryâs land ports, and flights are being
limited into the capital city, Beijing. Plans are currently under way at many
universities to stagger the winter holidays of students, to prevent this
demographic travelling collectively at peak times. We have some reaction now to the announcement from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon that the requirement for vaccine passports could be extended to other settings. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accuses the government of having ""a total lack for respect for Scottish businesses"". He says: ""The government has delayed again, creating wholly avoidable uncertainty. Businesses are once again being left in the dark and treated as an afterthought. ""They might have less than two weeks to adapt to changes to the vaccine passport scheme at one of the busiest times of the year for the hospitality industry."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says ministers should commit to engaging with affected businesses and offer them financial support if new measures are introduced. Meanwhile in Wales, a government minister says there are ""no immediate plans"" to extend the nation's vaccine passport scheme to pubs and restaurants. However, Welsh finance minister Rebecca Evans did explain there is an ""ongoing discussion"" with the hospitality sector about what can be done to ""ensure that people are safe in those environments"". Currently, they are needed for anyone over 18 to get into nightclubs, large events, cinemas, theatres and concerts in Wales, after therules were extended yesterday. Covid passes are used to demonstrate if someone is fully vaccinated or has tested negative in the past 48 hours. Recent figures show Wales' case rate are up again after falling from a peak in October. It stands at 489 per 100,000 people over the seven days to 11 November, up from a low point of 476 on 7 November - but still lower than a week ago when it was 526. There has been a substantial rise in the number of obese children in England during the pandemic, data from NHS Digitalsuggests. In 2019-20, 10% of children were obese at the start of primary school, but in 2020-21 the figure was more than 14%. In the last year of primary school, it rose from 21% to over 25%. Rates were twice as high in the poorest areas. Experts say poverty, lockdowns and a rise in mental health problems will all have played a role. Once the proportion who are overweight is taken into account, 28% of those in reception were carrying excess weight, and 41% in year six. Scotland's vaccine passport scheme could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December, Scotland's first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says a final decision will not be taken until next Tuesday. But she tells Holyrood that the rules may need to be tightened to get through winter without further restrictions. The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. But she says it could be expanded to other venues - possibly indoor cinemas, theatres and other indoors hospitality premises. She adds there will be exemptions, for weddings for example. It will be a ""challenging winter"", Sturgeon says, and she wants businesses to stay ""fully open"" over winter and Christmas. ""If an expansion of Covid certification can help us to do that, it would be irresponsible of us not to consider it."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is delivering an update on Covid measures. She says the cabinet has agreed to keep the current regulations in place, with no immediate changes to restrictions. However, she says continuing high Covid case numbers ""illustrate the need for continued precautions"". She adds that the Scottish government will implement the new advice that booster jabs should be offered to those aged 40 and over. Before we find out what rising case numbers might mean for day-to-day living in Scotland, a look at the latest coronavirus statistics gives a clear picture of where we are regarding case numbers, vaccination progress and hospitalisations. This graph shows a steady rise since the start of November. The vaccination programme is a central part of the Scottish government's coronavirus response. The current focus is on booster jabs and their rollout is running alongside the flu jab programme. This latest graph shows progress across all three doses of the vaccine. The full rundown of the latest statistics can be found here every day: Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Qatar has added the UK to its international travel red list, meaning even fully vaccinated travellers must stay in hotel quarantine for two days on arrival. Unvaccinated people arriving from the UK will be required to spend seven days quarantining in a hotel. The decision is likely to affect thousands of people planning to visit the popular winter sun destination. Along with the UK, another 20 countries were added to Qatar's red list, including Russia, Singapore, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. It comes after Morocco banned direct flights from the UK, Germany and the Netherlands on 20 October, amid high levels of Covid infections in all three countries. If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the main headlines: Munich has become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market - an attraction that normally draws three million visitors a year. The city's mayor, Dieter Reiter, said the decision was a ""bitter blow"" but it would be irresponsible to go ahead. ""The dramatic
situation in our hospitals and the exponentially increasing infection figures
leave me no other choice,"" he said. Germany's Christmas markets are a much-loved tradition, with about 2,500 across the country drawing millions of visitors, who shop for seasonal trinkets among wooden chalets while sipping mulled wine. Like Munich some smaller markets have also been cancelled for the second year running, but other major cities are proposing requiring proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or natural immunity in order to attend. Infection rates in Germany are at their highest point yet during the pandemic, and there are concerns that too many people remain unvaccinated. Bavaria, the southern region where Munich is located, has among the highest rates of Covid, with over 540 infections per 100,000 people, compared to over 310 nationwide. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin says the country's Covid-19 infection rate ""will get worse before it gets better"" People in the Irish Republic who can work from home will be advised to do so from Friday, due to the country's rise in Covid-19 cases. The Irish government agreed that move as well as an earlier closing time of midnight for bars, restaurants and nightclubs at a meeting earlier today. Workers began to return to offices in September whenrestrictions were eased. But, amid a rise in cases, government health advisers have now suggested a return to home working. The earlier closing time for the hospitality sector will come into effect from Thursday at midnight. That reverses the return to normal opening hours on 22 October, which had brought an end to an 23:30 curfew. Another4,570 cases of coronavirus were reported in the Irish Republic on Monday, up from 3,805 on Sunday - and senior government figures fear further restrictions may be needed.

Vaccine maker Moderna has signed a deal that enables EU and EEA countries to donate 70 million vaccine doses to the international Covax scheme, the Reuters news agency is reporting. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, together with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is trying to ensure everyone in the world has access to a Covid vaccine. Covax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year, but it has now downgraded its supply forecast by 25% to 1.4 billion - the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.

He says: ""The government has delayed again, creating wholly avoidable uncertainty. Businesses are once again being left in the dark and treated as an afterthought. ""They might have less than two weeks to adapt to changes to the vaccine passport scheme at one of the busiest times of the year for the hospitality industry."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says ministers should commit to engaging with affected businesses and offer them financial support if new measures are introduced. Meanwhile in Wales, a government minister says there are ""no immediate plans"" to extend the nation's vaccine passport scheme to pubs and restaurants. However, Welsh finance minister Rebecca Evans did explain there is an ""ongoing discussion"" with the hospitality sector about what can be done to ""ensure that people are safe in those environments"". Currently, they are needed for anyone over 18 to get into nightclubs, large events, cinemas, theatres and concerts in Wales, after therules were extended yesterday. Covid passes are used to demonstrate if someone is fully vaccinated or has tested negative in the past 48 hours. Recent figures show Wales' case rate are up again after falling from a peak in October. It stands at 489 per 100,000 people over the seven days to 11 November, up from a low point of 476 on 7 November - but still lower than a week ago when it was 526. There has been a substantial rise in the number of obese children in England during the pandemic, data from NHS Digitalsuggests. In 2019-20, 10% of children were obese at the start of primary school, but in 2020-21 the figure was more than 14%. In the last year of primary school, it rose from 21% to over 25%. Rates were twice as high in the poorest areas. Experts say poverty, lockdowns and a rise in mental health problems will all have played a role. Once the proportion who are overweight is taken into account, 28% of those in reception were carrying excess weight, and 41% in year six. Scotland's vaccine passport scheme could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December, Scotland's first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says a final decision will not be taken until next Tuesday. But she tells Holyrood that the rules may need to be tightened to get through winter without further restrictions. The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. But she says it could be expanded to other venues - possibly indoor cinemas, theatres and other indoors hospitality premises. She adds there will be exemptions, for weddings for example. It will be a ""challenging winter"", Sturgeon says, and she wants businesses to stay ""fully open"" over winter and Christmas. ""If an expansion of Covid certification can help us to do that, it would be irresponsible of us not to consider it."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is delivering an update on Covid measures. She says the cabinet has agreed to keep the current regulations in place, with no immediate changes to restrictions. However, she says continuing high Covid case numbers ""illustrate the need for continued precautions"". She adds that the Scottish government will implement the new advice that booster jabs should be offered to those aged 40 and over. Before we find out what rising case numbers might mean for day-to-day living in Scotland, a look at the latest coronavirus statistics gives a clear picture of where we are regarding case numbers, vaccination progress and hospitalisations. This graph shows a steady rise since the start of November. The vaccination programme is a central part of the Scottish government's coronavirus response. The current focus is on booster jabs and their rollout is running alongside the flu jab programme. This latest graph shows progress across all three doses of the vaccine. The full rundown of the latest statistics can be found here every day: Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Qatar has added the UK to its international travel red list, meaning even fully vaccinated travellers must stay in hotel quarantine for two days on arrival. Unvaccinated people arriving from the UK will be required to spend seven days quarantining in a hotel. The decision is likely to affect thousands of people planning to visit the popular winter sun destination. Along with the UK, another 20 countries were added to Qatar's red list, including Russia, Singapore, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. It comes after Morocco banned direct flights from the UK, Germany and the Netherlands on 20 October, amid high levels of Covid infections in all three countries. If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the main headlines: Munich has become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market - an attraction that normally draws three million visitors a year. The city's mayor, Dieter Reiter, said the decision was a ""bitter blow"" but it would be irresponsible to go ahead. ""The dramatic
situation in our hospitals and the exponentially increasing infection figures
leave me no other choice,"" he said. Germany's Christmas markets are a much-loved tradition, with about 2,500 across the country drawing millions of visitors, who shop for seasonal trinkets among wooden chalets while sipping mulled wine. Like Munich some smaller markets have also been cancelled for the second year running, but other major cities are proposing requiring proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or natural immunity in order to attend. Infection rates in Germany are at their highest point yet during the pandemic, and there are concerns that too many people remain unvaccinated. Bavaria, the southern region where Munich is located, has among the highest rates of Covid, with over 540 infections per 100,000 people, compared to over 310 nationwide. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin says the country's Covid-19 infection rate ""will get worse before it gets better"" People in the Irish Republic who can work from home will be advised to do so from Friday, due to the country's rise in Covid-19 cases. The Irish government agreed that move as well as an earlier closing time of midnight for bars, restaurants and nightclubs at a meeting earlier today. Workers began to return to offices in September whenrestrictions were eased. But, amid a rise in cases, government health advisers have now suggested a return to home working. The earlier closing time for the hospitality sector will come into effect from Thursday at midnight. That reverses the return to normal opening hours on 22 October, which had brought an end to an 23:30 curfew. Another4,570 cases of coronavirus were reported in the Irish Republic on Monday, up from 3,805 on Sunday - and senior government figures fear further restrictions may be needed.

Before we go, here's a reminder of the day's main headlines: Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Today's editor was Paul Gribben. The writers were Emma Harrison, Hamish Mackay, Adam Durbin and Joseph Lee. Amazon will pay a $500,000 (Â£370,000) legal settlement in the US over claims it failed to adequately inform its warehouse workers or public health officials about Covid-19 cases in the workplace. The corporation did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing the settlement, which comes under California's ""right to know"" rules that require employers to keep staff informed of potential Covid exposures. The state's attorney general Rob Bonta said Amazon workers had been left ""terrified and powerless"" and local public health bodies were often left ""unable to effectively track the spread of the virus"". The ruling applies only to California - where the company employs around 150,000 people - and must still be approved by a judge. Amazon said there was no change needed to how it notified workers if they are a close contact of a case, adding the issue was around the structure of bulk employee Covid-related notifications. Read more about the settlementhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Zhang Yujing A Chinese woman who was meant to be deported from
the US nearly two years ago has finally arrived back on home turf. Zhang Yujing was convicted of trespassing at
former President Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago Florida club in 2019. She had told the
court that she had âcome to meet the president and his family and make
friendsâ. She was sentenced to eight monthsâ imprisonment,
and completed her sentence in December 2019. Zhang was then transferred to
an immigration detention centre and was set to be deported. However, due to travel bans imposed during the
pandemic, she spent âthree times longer than her prison sentenceâ
in immigration custody. She finally left the US over the weekend, and
media in China are today calling her a âhaplessâ woman who experienced âa
prison disasterâ. State media were extremely critical when she was
originally sentenced. Global Times said in April 2019 that it was âshamefulâ
that she was treated like a âChinese spyâ. The Tesco advert shows Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass A Christmas advertisement for Tesco featuring Father Christmas with a Covid vaccine passport has prompted more than 3,000 complaints - making it the most complained about ad of the year so far. It shows the supermarket's customers determined to enjoy a proper Christmas celebration after last year's Covid-related restrictions. But in one scene a reporter tells viewers that Santa ""could be quarantined"" before cutting to Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass at border control, which proves he has been vaccinated so he can enter the country. An Advertising Standards Authority spokesman says: ""The large majority of complaints assert that the ad is coercive, and encourages medical discrimination based on vaccine status."" Tesco says it ""respects everyone's views"" adding it was a ""light-hearted"" campaign that had been ""well-received"". Belgium has seen almost 10,000 daily Covid cases in recent days (file pic) Staff in Belgium's health and social care sector have been told they will be fired if they fail to get Covid vaccinations by 1 April 2022. Anyone who has not yet had a jab by the new year will be moved away from frontline care and given three months to get vaccinated, under the proposed law. Like much of Europe, Belgium has seen a surge in cases and several areas are seeing record numbers of Covid hospital admissions. On Monday Austria imposed a lockdown on anyone who had not yet been vaccinated. Now Belgian ministers have reached agreement on compulsory jabs for thousands of care workers. ""It can't be right that there is still a small minority that haven't been vaccinated,"" said Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke. ""We're giving these people until 1 April next year to get themselves vaccinated."" US drug company Pfizer has penned a deal to allowits experimental Covid-19 treatment pillto be made and sold in 95 developing nations. The deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool not-for-profit could make the treatment available to 53% of the world's population. But it excludes several countries that have had large Covid-19 outbreaks, including Brazil. Pfizer says the pill lessens the risk of severe disease in vulnerable adults. The US company says the agreement will allow local medicine manufacturers to produce the pill ""with the goal of facilitating greater access to the global population"". You can read morehere. The UK has recorded a further 37,243 coronavirus cases in the latest 24-hour period, official government figures show. A further 214 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded. That takes the total deaths by that measure to 142,945 since the start of the pandemic. Since October, adults in Scotland must demonstrate - if asked - they have had both doses of a Covid vaccine before they can get into certain venues and events. These include nightclubs, indoor events of 500 or more people and outdoor events of more than 4,000. It works through the use of the NHS Scotland Covid Status App, which generates a QR code on people's phones that can be scanned by venues, or through requesting a ""secure, uneditable"" paper record. For nightclubs and smaller events, everyone entering should be checked, but at larger events a ""reasonable number"" of spot-checks being carried out - in many cases around one in five people - is acceptable. You can read more about Scotland's vaccine passports schemehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been 11 local cases of Covid-19 reported in
China in the last 24 hours. Cases of the virus are subsiding since an outbreak began a
month ago; today, official media are only recording single-digit cases in the
countryâs provinces. Over the last month, the outbreak caused more than 1,000 cases of Covid-19, reaching two thirds of the countryâs
provincial-level regions. The majority of cases have been in the countryâs
north, where the temperature is currently below zero Celsius. More than 75% of Chinaâs population is fully vaccinated,
and booster jabs are under way in most major cities. However, as China has a
zero-Covid policy, strict measures remain in place to ensure that the virus
doesnât spread. It is routine for communities to lock down the moment a fresh
case of the virus is identified, and city-wide testing drives are
orchestrated. Currently, there are
enhanced Covid-19 measures at the countryâs land ports, and flights are being
limited into the capital city, Beijing. Plans are currently under way at many
universities to stagger the winter holidays of students, to prevent this
demographic travelling collectively at peak times.

Major search begins for woman missing since 2012,"Claire Holland disappeared after visiting a pub in Bristol city centre Police have started a major search for a woman missing since 2012. Claire Holland, 32, from Lawrence Weston in Bristol, was last seen on the evening of 6 June, the day after the Queen's Diamond Jubilee weekend. Avon and Somerset Police said they now had reason to believe her disappearance was ""linked to a crime"". Ms Holland's mother Jackie Vaughan said the family was ""desperate"" to find out what happened to her as they said they were ""in limbo"" and needed closure. ""We thought maybe she wasn't well, so we tried to get in touch with her and she wasn't answering her phone. As the week went by other people became concerned as well,"" Mrs Vaughan said. ""I felt sick. It was horrible because you just don't know. ""She had so much going on in her life that she was looking forward to, and she was really proud that she was doing all these things. ""She had just moved into her new flat, she was painting and decorating. She was changing her life around."" The fact her bank account had not been used for a few days also sent alarm bells ringing for the family. Ms Holland's mother said she was ""desperate"" to find out what had happened to her Avon and Somerset Police said it now needed the public's help with the investigation and had released new CCTV footage of Ms Holland as it began searches around the city. It added that it was not linking the search for Ms Holland to the remainsfound in the Stockwood area of the cityearlier this week, although they have yet to be identified. Senior investigating officer Det Insp Darren Hannant asked the public to ""cast their minds back"" to the weekend of 2-5 June in 2012. There was an extended bank holiday in honour of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Police are searching Castle Park in Bristol ""CCTV shows Claire walking along Baldwin Street heading towards the Seamus O'Donnell's pub at around 21.30 BST on Wednesday, 6 June, but we don't have any footage showing where she went afterwards,"" he said. ""Staff have confirmed she did leave the pub later that evening just after closing time, around 23.15."" Det Insp Hannant said it was possible Ms Holland had headed towards the city's harbourside, but despite officers reviewing more than 1,000 hours of CCTV footage, they had not been able to spot her. He said her disappearance was first treated as suspicious in 2019, when a 37-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of her murder. Claire Holland was seen on CCTV entering a pub in the city centre but there was no footage of her leaving The man, now 39, remains released under investigation. ""Claire had no known reason to go missing of her own accord and had made plans for the week following her disappearance,"" said Det Insp Hannant. A specialist dive team will join the new searches starting in the city centre and will move to other areas of Bristol throughout the week. Mrs Vaughan said she was ""desperate"" to know what had happened to her daughter. ""I want to know, her sisters want to know. We're in limbo. We need closure. ""If I'm out and I see somebody that looks like Claire, I'll speed up to see if it's her. ""It never goes away. ""Somebody must know where she is, or what's happened. "" Detectives wish to hear from anyone who was in Seamus O'Donnell's on the night Ms Holland went missing People who were her Facebook friends in 2012 will also be sent messages by police. Detectives from Avon and Somerset Police want to speak to anyone who was in Seamus O'Donnell's on the night Ms Holland was last seen, who might be able to identify who she spoke to that night in the pub. The force is also interested in talking to anyone who might have seen her walking in the city after 23:00. Officers want to hear from any friends of Ms Holland who might not have shared information in 2012, or might have heard something suspicious or unusual about her disappearance. She is described as white, about 5ft (1.5m), of slim build, with shoulder-length brown hair, sometimes tied back in a ponytail. Anyone with information about the case is urged to contact police.

Vaccine passport extension could start next month,"People in Scotland can expect a ""normal Christmas"" with some Covid measures, the deputy first minister has said. John Swinney told the BBC that the extension of the vaccine passport scheme and other mitigations would help people live normally. Last winter Scotland was under the toughest level of lockdown restrictions from 26 December until March. Mr Swinney said he wanted to avoid further closure of businesses ""at all possible costs"". He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethe Scottish government was trying to manage Covid to a level that ""enables most of our economy and society to function as close to normality"" as possible. ""I'm very hopeful that this could be a normal Christmas,"" he added. ""It will be a normal Christmas with us all taking care, is what I would say. ""We may have to put in place some additional measures to make sure that is the case."" Live: Nicola Sturgeon's Covid-19 statement to MSPs How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Mr Swinney said such measures included the extension of the vaccine passport scheme, as well as ""intensifying"" the vaccine programme. Earlier, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that vaccine certification could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December. She said a final decision would not be taken until next Tuesday. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Changes to Scotland's coronavirus certification scheme under review The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. A decision had been widely expected to be made this week, with opposition leaders accusing the government of creating ""wholly avoidable uncertainty"" for businesses that could be affected. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs there had been a ""gradual increase"" in new cases of Covid-19 over the last two weeks, with pressure on the health service expected to increase in winter. The first minister said the vaccine passport scheme was making ""an important and proportionate contribution to stemming transmission"". She said the government was also considering whether a negative test result could be provided instead of proof of vaccination, as happens in most other countries that have introduced vaccine passports. She also said choosing not to be vaccinated without good reason was ""deeply irresponsible,"" and urged people to do their ""civic duty"" by getting jabbed. Covid cases in Scotland have started to rise again, having plateaued for several week The government has updated its ""strategic framework,external"" paper with plans for the winter period ahead, with warnings that the country ""risks moving potentially rapidly"" into a challenging situation should a new variant of the virus emerge. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said hospitality venues had been offered a ""stay of execution"", but warned that any expansion of the certification scheme would ""force many premises into closure"". Managing director Colin Wilkinson said: ""Businesses need time to plan for something major like this, and vague comments like those from Nicola Sturgeon today leave us in limbo for another week as we approach the vital Christmas trading period."" Ministers are watching the situation in Europe very carefully. Many countries there are having to reimpose restrictions because of soaring case numbers. Public health experts don't yet know if this is a new wave that could be coming Scotland's way, or if this is what we already faced back in September. The Scottish government is said to be at a fork in the road, but it can't choose which path to take until it knows the direction of travel of the virus. There is a degree of confidence that three key hurdles have been overcome: pupils are back in school, students have returned to universities and colleges and COP26 has passed without a massive spike in cases. But with Christmas fast approaching, the decision on whether or not to extend vaccine certification will have to be made soon. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said there ""continues to be a sense of anxiety"" among firms about an extension to the scheme, and that ""it would hit consumer confidence and increase costs for businesses"". And the Federation of Small Businesses said there were ""so many unanswered questions about the practicalities of a dramatically expanded scheme"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accused the government of having ""a total lack for respect for Scottish businesses"". He said: ""The government has delayed again, creating wholly avoidable uncertainty. Businesses are once again being left in the dark and treated as an afterthought."" The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said ministers should commit to engaging with affected businesses and offer financial support if new measures are introduced. He also said Ms Sturgeon should accept that providing a negative test should have been an option in the system from the outset, saying: ""Testing should always have been at the heart of our Covid reduction strategy."" The first minister said allowing a negative test to be included was a ""finely balanced"" decision, saying it could be argued that the scheme had helped to drive vaccine uptake. However, she said Scotland may now be in a position to include this option due to high levels of uptake of the vaccine. Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government should use the COP26 conference as a model for using regular testing to control the virus rather than vaccine certificates. Data published by Public Health Scotland on Tuesday suggested that only four in every 1,000 delegates tested positive during the Glasgow event, compared with an infection rate of 12 in every 1,000 in Scotland as a whole.

What next for Scotland's vaccine passport scheme?,"The first minister is to reveal later whether Covid restrictions, including the vaccine passport scheme, will be extended. It follows awarning,externalfrom Scotland's chief medical officer last week that case numbers are rising again. Nicola Sturgeon will update MSPs after her cabinet reviews the latest advice and data. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce has said further restrictions could put thousands of firms and jobs at risk. Deputy First Minister John Swinney confirmed last week that extending the vaccination certification scheme to a wider range of settings was one of the measures being considered. While Covid case numbers remain much lower than during the recent peak in August and infection rates are lower than in other parts of the UK,  they remain at a relatively high level and there has been a steady increase in recent weeks. Health officials are concerned that the situation remains fragile, and that a winter surge in cases could put yet more pressure on NHS services. A sharp rise in Covid cases in Europe has led to some countries such as Austria and the Netherlands reintroducing Covid restrictions. Last week John Swinney told MSPsthe Scottish government was considering expanding its scheme to cover more hospitality and leisure venues. He did not give specific examples but it could include pubs, gyms, cafes, cinemas and theatres. Mr Swinney later said individuals may be able to show a negative lateral flow test result in place of a vaccine passport. At the weekend government adviser Prof Linda Bauld told theSunday Post,externalpeople could be advised to work from home and, if that is not possible, wear a mask all day at their workplace. On Monday Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said Scotland was at a ""really fragile point"". She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that she expected a tightening of restrictions governing indoor settings. Prof Sridhar said: ""This could be, again looking at other countries, things like vaccination passes, making sure people are doubly vaccinated, asking for a negative PCR test."" She added: ""The virus is finding people who are unvaccinated and then it is transmitting at such a high level and it is also finding people who are doubly vaccinated but are much more frail,"" she said. Prof Sridhar said her advice would be to widen the use of vaccine passports in a bid to prevent the harsher lockdown measures  being seen in Europe. Under the current regulations individuals need to showproof they have been fully vaccinated,externalto enter nightclubs, adult entertainment venues and many large events in Scotland. These include indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people. People who live in Scotland can prove they're fully vaccinated by using theNHS Scotland Covid Status App,externalto generate a QR code. A paper version is also available. Those coming from elsewhere in the UK can show their vaccination status with the NHS App (if from England or Wales) or theCovidcert NI app (if from Northern Ireland),external- or via paper letters of certification. Some people are exempt, including under-18s, people taking part in vaccine trials and those unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons. So far the NHS Scotland Covid status app has been downloaded more than 1.4m times, while nearly 450,000 paper vaccine status certificates have been requested. The number of individual users may be smaller, as some may have downloaded the app to multiple devices. How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? A Scottish Chambers of Commerce survey found almost two thirds (65%) of businesses were against vaccine passports being used more in the hospitality and leisure sectors, together with increased home working and greater use of face coverings. The poll, which almost 700 firms took part in, also found nearly a quarter (24%) of businesses face ""severe financial consequences"" if vaccine passports and home-working measures are widened. SCC chief executive Dr Liz Cameron warned: ""Any reintroduction of restrictions will act as a painful economic deterrent for businesses across Scotland. ""We urge ministers not to take a massive step backwards in our economic recovery from the pandemic which would place thousands of firms and jobs at risk. ""Going backwards at this stage will put our recovery at risk, create further uncertainty and undermine consumer confidence."" Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said he was ""sceptical of the value"" of Covid passports in stores, coffee shops and restaurants, saying there would be ""practical and operational challenges"". He also said a push for more working from home would impact on shopper footfall for city centre stores, saying this was still significantly below pre-pandemic levels. Stephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said he expects the government to work constructively with the industry if vaccine passports are extended. He added: ""We would hope that this would include discussion of appropriate government support for additional staffing and costs, with many businesses in the hospitality sector currently struggling to cope with the financial burden of the pandemic as well as an acute recruitment crisis."" In Wales people now will need to show theirNHS Covid Pass,externalto gain entry to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. It is already needed for entry to nightclubs and comparable venues, unseated indoor live events for more than 500 people, unseated outdoor live events for more than 4,000 people and any event for more than 10,000 people Anyone aged over 16 who has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England can use the pass to prove their status, but it's only compulsory for over-18s. It is also available for people who've had a negative lateral flow test in the previous 48 hours. In September Englandscrapped similar plansfor vaccine passports but said they could still be introducedunder the government's winter ""Plan B"",external, if cases surge. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has launched a new app which people can use to demonstrate their vaccine status on a voluntary basis. Anti-vaxxers out in force in the city of Leipzig, in Saxony which has the lowest vaccine take-up rate in Germany Last week the World Health Organization (WHO) warned Europe is once again""at the epicentre""of the Covid pandemic. Soaring case numbers are being blamed on insufficient vaccine take up and a relaxation of public health measures. InAustriaabout two million people who have not been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 have been placed in lockdown as the country faces a surge in cases. Meanwhile inFranceover-65s will soon only be allowed to travel or visit restaurants and museums if they have a Covid booster jab In parts ofGermany, which is currently experiencing an aggressive fourth wave, entrance to public places is limited if a person cannot provide verification of vaccination, recent recovery from Covid or a negative test. In SeptemberItalymade it compulsory for all workers to have a Covid ""green pass"" - proof of vaccination, a negative test or recovery from the virus. And inSwitzerlandCovid passes are obligatory and the rules are strictly applied. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What are the current rules?

"Scottish vaccine passport extension could start next monthNicola Sturgeon says the scheme could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December.","People in Scotland can expect a ""normal Christmas"" with some Covid measures, the deputy first minister has said. John Swinney told the BBC that the extension of the vaccine passport scheme and other mitigations would help people live normally. Last winter Scotland was under the toughest level of lockdown restrictions from 26 December until March. Mr Swinney said he wanted to avoid further closure of businesses ""at all possible costs"". He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimethe Scottish government was trying to manage Covid to a level that ""enables most of our economy and society to function as close to normality"" as possible. ""I'm very hopeful that this could be a normal Christmas,"" he added. ""It will be a normal Christmas with us all taking care, is what I would say. ""We may have to put in place some additional measures to make sure that is the case."" Live: Nicola Sturgeon's Covid-19 statement to MSPs How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Mr Swinney said such measures included the extension of the vaccine passport scheme, as well as ""intensifying"" the vaccine programme. Earlier, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that vaccine certification could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December. She said a final decision would not be taken until next Tuesday. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Changes to Scotland's coronavirus certification scheme under review The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. A decision had been widely expected to be made this week, with opposition leaders accusing the government of creating ""wholly avoidable uncertainty"" for businesses that could be affected. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs there had been a ""gradual increase"" in new cases of Covid-19 over the last two weeks, with pressure on the health service expected to increase in winter. The first minister said the vaccine passport scheme was making ""an important and proportionate contribution to stemming transmission"". She said the government was also considering whether a negative test result could be provided instead of proof of vaccination, as happens in most other countries that have introduced vaccine passports.

Why the NHS is struggling like never before,"Lives are being put at risk with record long waits in A&E units and 999 calls taking hours to be reached. The causes of this go beyond Covid - and with winter coming it looks set to get worse. Natalie Quinn's parents were active and enjoying life when the pandemic hit. Although her father, Jimmy, had been diagnosed with dementia, he was still driving, playing golf and attending groups organised by the Alzheimer's Society. But lockdown hit them hard. ""All my dad's activities stopped and he went downhill quickly,"" Ms Quinn, 54, says. ""My mum was looking after him, but it took its toll. She had to go into hospital and he went into a care home. ""It was meant to be temporary - but, of course, we couldn't see him. He deteriorated and never came out."" By February, Jimmy, 75, was dead. Natalie's mother's health worsened too. For years, she had been living with a rare blood marrow disorder. Now 77, she has spent the past six months in and out of hospital in Yeovil, their home town. ""I really believe if they could have remained active and living the life they had, it could be so different,"" Ms Quinn says. Natalie's family's story is being repeated across the country. When the pandemic hit, about a quarter of adults in the UK were living with chronic illnesses. With support and care disrupted and Covid making people more isolated and less active, their health has suffered. According to those working in the NHS, they are now turning up to hospital in ever greater numbers. And it is this as much as Covid that is driving the rise in demand on the NHS. At Newcastle's Royal Victoria Hospital, which allowed BBC News in to film this month, doctors and nurses are struggling. Alongside Covid cases, they are seeing more frail elderly people being admitted as well as significant numbers of people with alcohol and mental health-related problems. Like at nearly all hospitals, A&E waiting times have worsened and quality of care is suffering, with patients spending hours on trolleys because there are no beds available. ""It really breaks my heart to see - they are really vulnerable,"" senior sister Juliet Amos says. The concern is being felt at the very top of the organisation too. ""We are in such a tight spot, there is no room for manoeuvre,"" Dame Jackie Daniel says. ""It can't go on."" But this is not just about demand. It is also down to capacity - what the NHS can cope with. The service was struggling before the pandemic hit, with targets routinely missed in all parts of the UK. The NHS was being run ""at its limit"", Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, says. Feedback from his members now shows unprecedented levels of concern about the coming months. The health service, he believes,  is heading for the ""most difficult winter in its history"". This is not just about the past couple of years though - the situation has been a decade in the making. Between 2010 and 2019 the annual rises in spending on health were well below those traditionally given since the birth of the NHS. During that period, the Tories have been in power - albeit with the Lib Dems for the first five years. Although it is worth noting, in its 2010 and 2015 election manifestos, Labour was not proposing any tangibly higher increases in spending either. This parliament has seen a change - annual rises are now close to 4% - but the result of the squeeze in the 2010s is fewer doctors and nurses per head of population than our Western European neighbours. It meant the UK entered the pandemic in a ""vulnerable position"" when you combine both funding and population health, says Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, with less resilience to absorb a shock like a pandemic. And so the NHS has struggled like never before. The waiting times in A&E are now at their worst levels since records began, nearly 20 years ago. The deterioration is even more alarming in the ambulance service,as BBC News reported last week. Response times for emergency callouts for things such as heart attacks and strokes are taking three times longer than they should, with some patients waiting up to nine hours for help to arrive. A big part of the problem is the system is grinding to a halt. Ambulances are becoming stuck outside A&E for hours on end because there are no hospital staff available to hand their patients over to. That's because of bottlenecks inside the hospital. Wards are full and struggling to discharge patients even when they are medically fit to leave - because of a lack of available care in the community. So even when A&E patients are admitted, 30% wait longer than four hours for a bed. And that, in turn, leads to further overcrowding in A&Es, where a quarter of all patients wait longer than four hours to be seen. In one of the worst cases, a backlog of more than 20 ambulances was reported at one hospital. This can have dire consequences. An investigation is under way after a patient died following a cardiac arrest. They had spent five hours in the back of an ambulance outside Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Another death is being investigated in the East of England, after a call classed as immediately life threatening took an hour to reach. Such calls should be answered in seven minutes on average. The patient was found dead. The ambulance service said crews had been stuck in queues at local hospitals. ""Hospitals are full and running pretty much on one in and one out,"" a consultant in West Yorkshire, former Society for Acute Medicine president Dr Nick Scriven, says. And it seems little can be done to prevent the situation deteriorating as winter hits. The government is putting extra money in - but it will have limited effect without extra staff and they are simply unavailable, Dr Scriven says. ""We need to be frank with the public,"" he says. ""Some really difficult decisions will have to be made."" Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

Before we go, here's a reminder of the day's main headlines: Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Today's editor was Paul Gribben. The writers were Emma Harrison, Hamish Mackay, Adam Durbin and Joseph Lee. Amazon will pay a $500,000 (Â£370,000) legal settlement in the US over claims it failed to adequately inform its warehouse workers or public health officials about Covid-19 cases in the workplace. The corporation did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing the settlement, which comes under California's ""right to know"" rules that require employers to keep staff informed of potential Covid exposures. The state's attorney general Rob Bonta said Amazon workers had been left ""terrified and powerless"" and local public health bodies were often left ""unable to effectively track the spread of the virus"". The ruling applies only to California - where the company employs around 150,000 people - and must still be approved by a judge. Amazon said there was no change needed to how it notified workers if they are a close contact of a case, adding the issue was around the structure of bulk employee Covid-related notifications.

the US nearly two years ago has finally arrived back on home turf. Zhang Yujing was convicted of trespassing at
former President Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago Florida club in 2019. She had told the
court that she had âcome to meet the president and his family and make
friendsâ. She was sentenced to eight monthsâ imprisonment,
and completed her sentence in December 2019. Zhang was then transferred to
an immigration detention centre and was set to be deported. However, due to travel bans imposed during the
pandemic, she spent âthree times longer than her prison sentenceâ
in immigration custody. She finally left the US over the weekend, and
media in China are today calling her a âhaplessâ woman who experienced âa
prison disasterâ. State media were extremely critical when she was
originally sentenced. Global Times said in April 2019 that it was âshamefulâ
that she was treated like a âChinese spyâ. The Tesco advert shows Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass A Christmas advertisement for Tesco featuring Father Christmas with a Covid vaccine passport has prompted more than 3,000 complaints - making it the most complained about ad of the year so far. It shows the supermarket's customers determined to enjoy a proper Christmas celebration after last year's Covid-related restrictions. But in one scene a reporter tells viewers that Santa ""could be quarantined"" before cutting to Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass at border control, which proves he has been vaccinated so he can enter the country. An Advertising Standards Authority spokesman says: ""The large majority of complaints assert that the ad is coercive, and encourages medical discrimination based on vaccine status."" Tesco says it ""respects everyone's views"" adding it was a ""light-hearted"" campaign that had been ""well-received"". Belgium has seen almost 10,000 daily Covid cases in recent days (file pic) Staff in Belgium's health and social care sector have been told they will be fired if they fail to get Covid vaccinations by 1 April 2022. Anyone who has not yet had a jab by the new year will be moved away from frontline care and given three months to get vaccinated, under the proposed law. Like much of Europe, Belgium has seen a surge in cases and several areas are seeing record numbers of Covid hospital admissions. On Monday Austria imposed a lockdown on anyone who had not yet been vaccinated. Now Belgian ministers have reached agreement on compulsory jabs for thousands of care workers. ""It can't be right that there is still a small minority that haven't been vaccinated,"" said Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke. ""We're giving these people until 1 April next year to get themselves vaccinated."" US drug company Pfizer has penned a deal to allowits experimental Covid-19 treatment pillto be made and sold in 95 developing nations. The deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool not-for-profit could make the treatment available to 53% of the world's population. But it excludes several countries that have had large Covid-19 outbreaks, including Brazil. Pfizer says the pill lessens the risk of severe disease in vulnerable adults. The US company says the agreement will allow local medicine manufacturers to produce the pill ""with the goal of facilitating greater access to the global population"". You can read morehere. The UK has recorded a further 37,243 coronavirus cases in the latest 24-hour period, official government figures show. A further 214 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded. That takes the total deaths by that measure to 142,945 since the start of the pandemic. Since October, adults in Scotland must demonstrate - if asked - they have had both doses of a Covid vaccine before they can get into certain venues and events. These include nightclubs, indoor events of 500 or more people and outdoor events of more than 4,000. It works through the use of the NHS Scotland Covid Status App, which generates a QR code on people's phones that can be scanned by venues, or through requesting a ""secure, uneditable"" paper record. For nightclubs and smaller events, everyone entering should be checked, but at larger events a ""reasonable number"" of spot-checks being carried out - in many cases around one in five people - is acceptable.

China in the last 24 hours. Cases of the virus are subsiding since an outbreak began a
month ago; today, official media are only recording single-digit cases in the
countryâs provinces. Over the last month, the outbreak caused more than 1,000 cases of Covid-19, reaching two thirds of the countryâs
provincial-level regions. The majority of cases have been in the countryâs
north, where the temperature is currently below zero Celsius. More than 75% of Chinaâs population is fully vaccinated,
and booster jabs are under way in most major cities. However, as China has a
zero-Covid policy, strict measures remain in place to ensure that the virus
doesnât spread. It is routine for communities to lock down the moment a fresh
case of the virus is identified, and city-wide testing drives are
orchestrated. Currently, there are
enhanced Covid-19 measures at the countryâs land ports, and flights are being
limited into the capital city, Beijing. Plans are currently under way at many
universities to stagger the winter holidays of students, to prevent this
demographic travelling collectively at peak times. We have some reaction now to the announcement from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon that the requirement for vaccine passports could be extended to other settings. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accuses the government of having ""a total lack for respect for Scottish businesses"". He says: ""The government has delayed again, creating wholly avoidable uncertainty. Businesses are once again being left in the dark and treated as an afterthought. ""They might have less than two weeks to adapt to changes to the vaccine passport scheme at one of the busiest times of the year for the hospitality industry."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says ministers should commit to engaging with affected businesses and offer them financial support if new measures are introduced. Meanwhile in Wales, a government minister says there are ""no immediate plans"" to extend the nation's vaccine passport scheme to pubs and restaurants. However, Welsh finance minister Rebecca Evans did explain there is an ""ongoing discussion"" with the hospitality sector about what can be done to ""ensure that people are safe in those environments"". Currently, they are needed for anyone over 18 to get into nightclubs, large events, cinemas, theatres and concerts in Wales, after therules were extended yesterday. Covid passes are used to demonstrate if someone is fully vaccinated or has tested negative in the past 48 hours. Recent figures show Wales' case rate are up again after falling from a peak in October. It stands at 489 per 100,000 people over the seven days to 11 November, up from a low point of 476 on 7 November - but still lower than a week ago when it was 526. There has been a substantial rise in the number of obese children in England during the pandemic, data from NHS Digitalsuggests. In 2019-20, 10% of children were obese at the start of primary school, but in 2020-21 the figure was more than 14%. In the last year of primary school, it rose from 21% to over 25%. Rates were twice as high in the poorest areas. Experts say poverty, lockdowns and a rise in mental health problems will all have played a role. Once the proportion who are overweight is taken into account, 28% of those in reception were carrying excess weight, and 41% in year six. Scotland's vaccine passport scheme could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December, Scotland's first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says a final decision will not be taken until next Tuesday. But she tells Holyrood that the rules may need to be tightened to get through winter without further restrictions. The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. But she says it could be expanded to other venues - possibly indoor cinemas, theatres and other indoors hospitality premises. She adds there will be exemptions, for weddings for example. It will be a ""challenging winter"", Sturgeon says, and she wants businesses to stay ""fully open"" over winter and Christmas. ""If an expansion of Covid certification can help us to do that, it would be irresponsible of us not to consider it."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is delivering an update on Covid measures. She says the cabinet has agreed to keep the current regulations in place, with no immediate changes to restrictions. However, she says continuing high Covid case numbers ""illustrate the need for continued precautions"". She adds that the Scottish government will implement the new advice that booster jabs should be offered to those aged 40 and over. Before we find out what rising case numbers might mean for day-to-day living in Scotland, a look at the latest coronavirus statistics gives a clear picture of where we are regarding case numbers, vaccination progress and hospitalisations. This graph shows a steady rise since the start of November. The vaccination programme is a central part of the Scottish government's coronavirus response. The current focus is on booster jabs and their rollout is running alongside the flu jab programme. This latest graph shows progress across all three doses of the vaccine. The full rundown of the latest statistics can be found here every day: Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Qatar has added the UK to its international travel red list, meaning even fully vaccinated travellers must stay in hotel quarantine for two days on arrival. Unvaccinated people arriving from the UK will be required to spend seven days quarantining in a hotel. The decision is likely to affect thousands of people planning to visit the popular winter sun destination. Along with the UK, another 20 countries were added to Qatar's red list, including Russia, Singapore, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. It comes after Morocco banned direct flights from the UK, Germany and the Netherlands on 20 October, amid high levels of Covid infections in all three countries. If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the main headlines: Munich has become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market - an attraction that normally draws three million visitors a year. The city's mayor, Dieter Reiter, said the decision was a ""bitter blow"" but it would be irresponsible to go ahead. ""The dramatic
situation in our hospitals and the exponentially increasing infection figures
leave me no other choice,"" he said. Germany's Christmas markets are a much-loved tradition, with about 2,500 across the country drawing millions of visitors, who shop for seasonal trinkets among wooden chalets while sipping mulled wine. Like Munich some smaller markets have also been cancelled for the second year running, but other major cities are proposing requiring proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or natural immunity in order to attend. Infection rates in Germany are at their highest point yet during the pandemic, and there are concerns that too many people remain unvaccinated. Bavaria, the southern region where Munich is located, has among the highest rates of Covid, with over 540 infections per 100,000 people, compared to over 310 nationwide. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin says the country's Covid-19 infection rate ""will get worse before it gets better"" People in the Irish Republic who can work from home will be advised to do so from Friday, due to the country's rise in Covid-19 cases. The Irish government agreed that move as well as an earlier closing time of midnight for bars, restaurants and nightclubs at a meeting earlier today. Workers began to return to offices in September whenrestrictions were eased. But, amid a rise in cases, government health advisers have now suggested a return to home working. The earlier closing time for the hospitality sector will come into effect from Thursday at midnight. That reverses the return to normal opening hours on 22 October, which had brought an end to an 23:30 curfew. Another4,570 cases of coronavirus were reported in the Irish Republic on Monday, up from 3,805 on Sunday - and senior government figures fear further restrictions may be needed.

Covax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year, but it has now downgraded its supply forecast by 25% to 1.4 billion - the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.

Before we go, here's a reminder of the day's main headlines: Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Today's editor was Paul Gribben. The writers were Emma Harrison, Hamish Mackay, Adam Durbin and Joseph Lee. Amazon will pay a $500,000 (Â£370,000) legal settlement in the US over claims it failed to adequately inform its warehouse workers or public health officials about Covid-19 cases in the workplace. The corporation did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing the settlement, which comes under California's ""right to know"" rules that require employers to keep staff informed of potential Covid exposures. The state's attorney general Rob Bonta said Amazon workers had been left ""terrified and powerless"" and local public health bodies were often left ""unable to effectively track the spread of the virus"". The ruling applies only to California - where the company employs around 150,000 people - and must still be approved by a judge. Amazon said there was no change needed to how it notified workers if they are a close contact of a case, adding the issue was around the structure of bulk employee Covid-related notifications.

the US nearly two years ago has finally arrived back on home turf. Zhang Yujing was convicted of trespassing at
former President Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago Florida club in 2019. She had told the
court that she had âcome to meet the president and his family and make
friendsâ. She was sentenced to eight monthsâ imprisonment,
and completed her sentence in December 2019. Zhang was then transferred to
an immigration detention centre and was set to be deported. However, due to travel bans imposed during the
pandemic, she spent âthree times longer than her prison sentenceâ
in immigration custody. She finally left the US over the weekend, and
media in China are today calling her a âhaplessâ woman who experienced âa
prison disasterâ. State media were extremely critical when she was
originally sentenced. Global Times said in April 2019 that it was âshamefulâ
that she was treated like a âChinese spyâ. The Tesco advert shows Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass A Christmas advertisement for Tesco featuring Father Christmas with a Covid vaccine passport has prompted more than 3,000 complaints - making it the most complained about ad of the year so far. It shows the supermarket's customers determined to enjoy a proper Christmas celebration after last year's Covid-related restrictions. But in one scene a reporter tells viewers that Santa ""could be quarantined"" before cutting to Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass at border control, which proves he has been vaccinated so he can enter the country. An Advertising Standards Authority spokesman says: ""The large majority of complaints assert that the ad is coercive, and encourages medical discrimination based on vaccine status."" Tesco says it ""respects everyone's views"" adding it was a ""light-hearted"" campaign that had been ""well-received"". Belgium has seen almost 10,000 daily Covid cases in recent days (file pic) Staff in Belgium's health and social care sector have been told they will be fired if they fail to get Covid vaccinations by 1 April 2022. Anyone who has not yet had a jab by the new year will be moved away from frontline care and given three months to get vaccinated, under the proposed law. Like much of Europe, Belgium has seen a surge in cases and several areas are seeing record numbers of Covid hospital admissions. On Monday Austria imposed a lockdown on anyone who had not yet been vaccinated. Now Belgian ministers have reached agreement on compulsory jabs for thousands of care workers. ""It can't be right that there is still a small minority that haven't been vaccinated,"" said Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke. ""We're giving these people until 1 April next year to get themselves vaccinated."" US drug company Pfizer has penned a deal to allowits experimental Covid-19 treatment pillto be made and sold in 95 developing nations. The deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool not-for-profit could make the treatment available to 53% of the world's population. But it excludes several countries that have had large Covid-19 outbreaks, including Brazil. Pfizer says the pill lessens the risk of severe disease in vulnerable adults. The US company says the agreement will allow local medicine manufacturers to produce the pill ""with the goal of facilitating greater access to the global population"". You can read morehere. The UK has recorded a further 37,243 coronavirus cases in the latest 24-hour period, official government figures show. A further 214 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded. That takes the total deaths by that measure to 142,945 since the start of the pandemic. Since October, adults in Scotland must demonstrate - if asked - they have had both doses of a Covid vaccine before they can get into certain venues and events. These include nightclubs, indoor events of 500 or more people and outdoor events of more than 4,000. It works through the use of the NHS Scotland Covid Status App, which generates a QR code on people's phones that can be scanned by venues, or through requesting a ""secure, uneditable"" paper record. For nightclubs and smaller events, everyone entering should be checked, but at larger events a ""reasonable number"" of spot-checks being carried out - in many cases around one in five people - is acceptable.

China in the last 24 hours. Cases of the virus are subsiding since an outbreak began a
month ago; today, official media are only recording single-digit cases in the
countryâs provinces. Over the last month, the outbreak caused more than 1,000 cases of Covid-19, reaching two thirds of the countryâs
provincial-level regions. The majority of cases have been in the countryâs

It will be a ""challenging winter"", Sturgeon says, and she wants businesses to stay ""fully open"" over winter and Christmas. ""If an expansion of Covid certification can help us to do that, it would be irresponsible of us not to consider it."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is delivering an update on Covid measures. She says the cabinet has agreed to keep the current regulations in place, with no immediate changes to restrictions. However, she says continuing high Covid case numbers ""illustrate the need for continued precautions"". She adds that the Scottish government will implement the new advice that booster jabs should be offered to those aged 40 and over. Before we find out what rising case numbers might mean for day-to-day living in Scotland, a look at the latest coronavirus statistics gives a clear picture of where we are regarding case numbers, vaccination progress and hospitalisations. This graph shows a steady rise since the start of November. The vaccination programme is a central part of the Scottish government's coronavirus response. The current focus is on booster jabs and their rollout is running alongside the flu jab programme. This latest graph shows progress across all three doses of the vaccine. The full rundown of the latest statistics can be found here every day: Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Qatar has added the UK to its international travel red list, meaning even fully vaccinated travellers must stay in hotel quarantine for two days on arrival. Unvaccinated people arriving from the UK will be required to spend seven days quarantining in a hotel. The decision is likely to affect thousands of people planning to visit the popular winter sun destination. Along with the UK, another 20 countries were added to Qatar's red list, including Russia, Singapore, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. It comes after Morocco banned direct flights from the UK, Germany and the Netherlands on 20 October, amid high levels of Covid infections in all three countries. If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the main headlines: Munich has become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market - an attraction that normally draws three million visitors a year. The city's mayor, Dieter Reiter, said the decision was a ""bitter blow"" but it would be irresponsible to go ahead. ""The dramatic
situation in our hospitals and the exponentially increasing infection figures
leave me no other choice,"" he said. Germany's Christmas markets are a much-loved tradition, with about 2,500 across the country drawing millions of visitors, who shop for seasonal trinkets among wooden chalets while sipping mulled wine. Like Munich some smaller markets have also been cancelled for the second year running, but other major cities are proposing requiring proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or natural immunity in order to attend. Infection rates in Germany are at their highest point yet during the pandemic, and there are concerns that too many people remain unvaccinated. Bavaria, the southern region where Munich is located, has among the highest rates of Covid, with over 540 infections per 100,000 people, compared to over 310 nationwide. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin says the country's Covid-19 infection rate ""will get worse before it gets better"" People in the Irish Republic who can work from home will be advised to do so from Friday, due to the country's rise in Covid-19 cases. The Irish government agreed that move as well as an earlier closing time of midnight for bars, restaurants and nightclubs at a meeting earlier today. Workers began to return to offices in September whenrestrictions were eased. But, amid a rise in cases, government health advisers have now suggested a return to home working. The earlier closing time for the hospitality sector will come into effect from Thursday at midnight. That reverses the return to normal opening hours on 22 October, which had brought an end to an 23:30 curfew. Another4,570 cases of coronavirus were reported in the Irish Republic on Monday, up from 3,805 on Sunday - and senior government figures fear further restrictions may be needed.

Vaccine maker Moderna has signed a deal that enables EU and EEA countries to donate 70 million vaccine doses to the international Covax scheme, the Reuters news agency is reporting.

Covax had planned to deliver about two billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year, but it has now downgraded its supply forecast by 25% to 1.4 billion - the result of global export bans, production challenges and slow regulatory approval processes.

China warns US about 'playing with fire' on TaiwanXi Jinping and Joe Biden hold substantial talks but exchange sharp words on Taiwan.China,"This video can not be played These were the most substantial discussions both leaders have had since Mr Biden took office Chinese President Xi Jinping has used a virtual summit with US counterpart Joe Biden to warn that encouraging Taiwanese independence would be ""playing with fire"". The talks are the most substantial since Mr Biden took office in January. Both sides emphasised the two men's personal relationship and the summit was an attempt to ease tensions. But they could not escape one of the most sensitive topics: the self-ruled island of Taiwan. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. The US recognises and has formal ties with China. But it has also pledged to help Taiwan defend itself in the event of an attack. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? China's state-run Global Times said Mr Xi blamed recent tensions on ""repeated attempts by the Taiwan authorities to look for US support for their independence agenda as well as the intention of some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China"". ""Such moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt,"" it said. The White House said Mr Biden ""strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"". The leaders spoke to each other virtually Despite the strong words on Taiwan, the meeting began with both leaders greeting each other warmly, with Mr Xi saying he was happy to see his ""old friend"" Mr Biden. Mr Biden said the two had ""always communicated with one another very honestly and candidly,"" adding ""we never walk away wondering what the other man is thinking"". Mr Xi said the two countries needed to improve ""communication"" and face challenges ""together"". ""Humanity lives in a global village, and we face multiple challenges together. China and the US need to increase communication and co-operation."" said Mr Xi. The world's two most powerful nations do not see eye-to-eye on a number of issues, and Mr Biden raised US concerns about human rights abuses in Hong Kong and against Uyghurs in the north-west region of Xinjiang. China accuses the US of meddling in its domestic affairs. On trade, Mr Biden highlighted the ""need to protect American workers and industries from the PRC's [People's Republic of China's] unfair trade and economic practices"". Mr Xi also appeared to have made a strong comment on the issue, with Reuters reporting that he had told Mr Biden that the US needed to stop ""abusing the concept of national security to oppress Chinese companies"". Climate change was also discussed. Last week the two sprung a surprise by issuing a joint declaration to address climate change, at talks in Glasgow, Scotland. This was the third time the two leaders have spoken since Mr Biden's inauguration in January. The talks lasted three-and-a-half hours, longer than expected. Mr Xi has not left China in nearly two years, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The China-US relationship is crucial to both parties and the wider world, with Beijing having called repeatedly on the new administration in Washington to improve relations which deteriorated under Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump. Both men are facing domestic concerns, with Mr Biden's poll numbers slumping in the face of inflation, the threat of coronavirus and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr Xi is tackling energy shortages and a property crisis. That this meeting has happened at all between the world's two most powerful leaders tells you that both sides believe that the previous open hostility between Beijing and Washington wasn't working for either of them and was potentially dangerous. Their relationship had become so toxic and so dysfunctional that these video discussions have been, in part, an attempt to ensure that competition between China and the US didn't drift into armed conflict due to a misunderstanding at a global hotspot. On the one hand, we should probably be pretty happy they they're steering away from war before it can happen but, on the other, it is quite something that they have felt the need to do so. In fact, if you see the optics at this conference this is the warmest things have appeared for a long time with Chinese and US leaders. These efforts to make the discussions cordial with waving, talk of ""the global village"" and ""humanity's challenges"" was a far cry from the meltdown in Alaska this March when senior representatives from both administrations ended up sledging one another in public. This does appear to be a genuine attempt at a reset and we should actually expect this to alter global geopolitical relations in a concrete way.

English cricket 'institutionally' racist - Rafiq,"This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire English cricket is ""institutionally"" racist, says former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq. Rafiq, 30, told a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee that racist language was ""constantly"" used during his time at Yorkshire. In an emotional testimony, he also said the club gave him ""inhuman"" treatment after his son was still-born in 2017. He added the issues he faced at Yorkshire are ""without a shadow of a doubt"" widespread in domestic cricket. Reaction & all the evidence: Rafiq appears before MPs Rafiq said he had lost his career to racism, which is a ""horrible feeling"" but that ""hopefully"" by speaking out there will be ""massive change in five years' time"". ""All I wanted was an acceptance, an apology, an understanding, and let's try and work together to ensure it never happens again,"" he continued. ""I was not going to let this go, no matter how much damage it causes me - I was determined to become a voice for the voiceless."" In wide-ranging testimony, Rafiq also said: All he ever wanted to do was realise his ""dream"" of playing for England Racist language, including terms aimed at his and others' Pakistani heritage, was used ""constantly"" and ""never stamped out"" during his time at Yorkshire The use of such terms was racist and not ""banter"" as the report had concluded It left him feeling ""isolated"" and ""humiliated"", with racist comments made by others in front of team-mates and coaching staff but not challenged The use of such language was so common it ""became the norm"" and people at the club ""didn't think it was wrong"" He ""didn't realise"" and was ""in denial"" about the scale of the problem during most of his first spell at Yorkshire, up until 2014 He thought ""things had changed"" when he returned for his second spell in 2016 But the atmosphere became ""toxic"" after Gary Ballance took over as captain later that year, shortly after former batter Andrew Gale replaced Jason Gillespie as head coach Aged 15 and a practising Muslim, he was pinned down by a senior player at his local cricket club and red wine was poured into his mouth He said he did not drink alcohol again until ""around 2012"" when he felt he had to ""to fit in"" at Yorkshire Asked about claims he had been a ""heavy drinker"", he said he ""wasn't perfect"" and was ""not proud"" of some of the things he did during this time, but that these had ""no relation"" to the racism he was subjected to The report into his allegations was ""shoddy at best"" and the panel failed to speak to key witnesses Rafiq was giving evidence to MPs after a report found he was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the club said they would not discipline anyone. Yorkshire's former chairman Roger Hutton subsequently addressed the committee, followed by representatives from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), including chief executive Tom Harrison. Hutton, who offered his ""profound apologies"" to Rafiq, said Yorkshire's director of cricket Martyn Moxon and former chief executive Mark Arthur ""failed to accept the gravity of the situation"". ""They have not wanted to apologise or take the recommendations of the panel going forward,"" he added. When asked by Damian Green MP if he thought cricket was institutionally racist, Rafiq replied: ""Yes, I do."" In response to a question by Julian Knight MP, chair of the DCMS select committee, on whether the issues he faced were ""replicated"" at other counties, Rafiq said: ""It's a problem up and down the country."" Former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave alleged they received racist abuse while at the club. Essex are facing racism allegations and encouraging those that have experienced discrimination to come forward. Last weekEssex chairman John Faragher resignedfollowing an allegation he used racist language in a 2017 board meeting, which he denies. Former Essex playersZoheb SharifandMaurice Chambershave both alleged they suffered racist abuse at the club. Rafiq said the scale of the problem is ""scary"" and there have been ""denials, briefings, cover-ups, smearing"". He claimed that British Asian representation in professional cricket since 2010 had dropped nearly 40% and that England have missed out on ""a hell of a lot of talent"" because Asian and black cricketers have been subjected to racism. Rafiq also called on the ECB ""to make tangible change"". Anti-racism and anti-fascism campaign group Hope not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles said Rafiq's testimony was ""heartbreaking"" to watch. ""What is most troubling is that what Azeem Rafiq has experienced is not an isolated incident, in cricket or across sport more generally,"" he added. ""Azeem Rafiq's bravery in speaking out against those who abused him needs to be a turning point - this is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with Azeem and run racism out of sport, once and for all."" Yorkshire chairman Lord Patel said it was an ""incredibly difficult day"" for all at the club and that Rafiq's testimony was ""harrowing and upsetting"". He added: ""There is no quick fix to the clear problems which have been identified, and the issues are complex, not least the charge of institutional racism which must be addressed head on."" This video can not be played 'It sounds like the Wild West' - MP Julie Elliott on ECB regulatory process Rafiq said he was subjected to ""inhuman"" treatment after the death of his son, because the club were ""blinded"" to how they should treat him after he raised a complaint about former England player Tim Bresnan in 2017. Rafiq said that the day after his son died, Moxon ""ripped shreds"" off him in a manner he had never seen Moxon use when addressing anyone else at the club. He said he was part of a group of ""six or seven"" players who complained about Bresnan, who now plays for Warwickshire, after which he said the club saw him as a ""trouble-maker"". He added he was the only player of colour in that group and was ""the only one to get repercussions"". Rafiq added that head coach Gale's attitude towards the death of Rafiq's son was that Rafiq was ""making it more than what it is"", and that ""hardly anyone"" asked after his and his wife's wellbeing. At the end of his session, Rafiq said his wife ""has struggled and still continues"" to and that his two young children ""have not had a dad, really, because all I have been worried about is Yorkshire going out to discredit me and how I am going to deal with it"". He added: ""It has been challenging, but I hope today provides some sort of closure and I can treat her for what she deserves."" Warwickshire said the report includes allegations of bullying against Rafiq by Bresnan regarding comments Bresnan made about Rafiq's weight. They said: ""We have spoken to Tim about this and he admits making such a comment. We understand there was no substantiated suggestion of racism against Tim, but he is devastated to learn of the impact of his comments."" Bresnan responded in a statement, stating: ""I have been made aware of the bullying claims made against me and have listened to Azeem Rafiq's account of his time at Yorkshire CCC today with great distress, as I'm sure everyone will have done. ""For any part I played in contributing to Azeem Rafiq's experience of feeling bullied at Yorkshire, I apologise unreservedly."" Gale is currently suspendedas part of an investigation into a tweet he sent in 2010. Moxon is currently absent from work because of a ""stress-related illness"" and Yorkshire said he ""will be given the necessary support"". BBC Sport is approaching Gale for comment. Yorkshire batter Ballance, who played 23 Tests for England, said earlier this month he ""regrets"" using racist language towards Rafiq, who he regarded as his ""best mate in cricket"". Rafiq said he became friends with Zimbabwe-born Ballance when he joined Yorkshire from Derbyshire in 2008 because he felt he was an ""outsider"" as well and that others called Ballance ""things that were out of order"". But he added their relationship ""started to deteriorate"" around 2013 because of Ballance's ""conduct"" and that his ""behaviour was so disgusting"" Rafiq raised it with an agent they shared. Rafiq said they remained ""amicable"" but not close afterwards and that Ballance found the captaincy a ""real struggle"" in 2017, resulting in a ""toxic"" dressing room. He added that Ballance used the name 'Kevin' as a ""derogatory"" term to refer to any player of colour and this was an ""open secret"", including within the England dressing room. Rafiq said that England batter Alex Hales named his dog Kevin ""because it's black"". ""It's disgusting how much of a joke it was,"" said Rafiq. He added that India batter Cheteshwar Pujara was called 'Steve' by coaches, players and the Yorkshire website after bowler Jack Brooks, who now plays for Somerset, started calling Pujara that because he could not pronounce his first name. Pujara said he did not like being called Steve and wouldprefer his team-mates to call him Cheteshwar.,external BBC Sport is approaching Hales and Brooks for comment. Somerset said they ""take a zero-tolerance approach to any form of behaviour which is anything other than inclusive for all, regardless of gender, race, sexuality or any other characteristic"". They added: ""Any case reported will be thoroughly investigated as it is important that we learn lessons from the past and we welcome any information on incidents that may have occurred to help us do so."" More on Ballance's previous response to this story Rafiq alleges former England captain and BBC cricket pundit Michael Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other Asian players in 2009 while they were all at Yorkshire. England bowler Adil Rashid and former Pakistan bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan have corroborated the allegation, whichVaughan ""completely and categorically denies"". ""It's important on Michael that we don't make it all about Michael,"" said Rafiq. ""It was a long time ago. He might not remember it because it doesn't mean anything to him."" England Test captain Joe Root said the Yorkshire racism scandal has ""fractured our game and torn lives apart"" but thathe could not recall any instance of racismduring his time at the club. Rafiq said Root has never used racist language but he found his statement ""hurtful"" because Root was Ballance's housemate and was on nights out when racist language directed at his Pakistan heritage was used. ""Joe might not remember it but that shows just how normal it was - even a good man like him can't see it for what it is,"" he said. ""The environment and institution is the problem."" Rafiq said that following an interview on Sky, former England bowler and Yorkshire team-mate Matthew Hoggard called him and said ""I am sorry if some of the comments made you feel how you described it"". Rafiq said he thanked Hoggard for his apology and really appreciated it. BBC Sport is approaching Hoggard for comment. Rafiq also said that Sky Sports commentator David Lloyd, a former Lancashire captain and England player and later coach, had made disparaging comments about Asian cricketers after Rafiq spoke about his experiences on television. He said there were ""high-profile"" media people ""messaging other members of the media who have supported me, saying stuff like: 'Well, a clubhouse is the lifeblood of a club, and Asian players don't go in there.'"" Rafiq subsequently identified that person as Lloyd. In response, Lloyd said he had ""made some comments about the Asian cricket community"" and that he ""deeply regrets"" his actions. ""I apologise most sincerely to Azeem and to the Asian community for doing this, and for any offence caused,"" he added. Sky said in a statement it was ""investigating the comments"" attributed to Lloyd and that it was ""committed to actively championing inclusion in cricket - and in all sports - and opposing all forms of discrimination"". Rafiq first spoke out last year, claiming ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire left him close to taking his own life. Seven of the 43 allegations were upheld by an independent panel last month and the report found he had been a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" at the club. However, Yorkshire said they will not take disciplinary action against any player, employee or executive. Hutton and Arthur have subsequently resigned, with Hutton's replacement as chairman, Lord Patel, apologising ""unreservedly"" and settling the employment tribunal with Rafiq. Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting international matches by the ECB. Kit supplier Nike, plus several of Yorkshire's sponsors, including Emerald Publishing, Yorkshire Tea, Tetley's beer and leisure club operators David Lloyd, either ended partnerships or said they would not continue deals. BBC Sport is approaching Yorkshire for further comment in response to today's evidence.

Chambers makes Essex racism claims,"Maurice Chambers played his last first-class match in 2015 for Northants Warning: Contains content that is offensive Former bowler Maurice Chambers says he suffered racist abuse over a 10-year period at Essex, just days after another former player Zoheb Sharifalleged racism at the club. Chambers, 34, who was born in Jamaica, alleges he was repeatedly racially abused by two team-mates and a senior coach at the county. He says he was frequently subjected to racist jokes, including banana taunts. Chambers, who played for Essex from 2005-2013, told The Cricketer he ""would go home at the end of the day and cry"". On Saturday, Sharif made allegations relating to his time at the club between 2001 and 2004. Both men have spoken out after a racism scandal at fellow County Championship side Yorkshire. Chambers says he first experienced ""anything that made me uncomfortable"" was when he was playing for the age group teams aged 15. The incidents he alleged happened during his time at Essex include: Â·Being told by a player to climb up the stairs for a banana after a team night out A coach making a racist remark during fielding practice and the same coach reading out racist jokes in the dressing room A senior player offering him a banana in a mocking manner ""on several occasions"" ""It was humiliating. It was isolating. I never told anyone, but I would go home at the end of the day and cry. It made me very unhappy,"" Chambers said. He said other than one occasion, when his mother reported an incident on his behalf, he ""never reported anything"" as he was ""always worried about being seen as a troublemaker"". Essex chief executive John Stephenson said he was ""extremely disappointed to hear of further historic racial allegations"" which made ""distressing reading"". He said none of the individuals were now involved with the club, and that Essex had referred the matter to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). ""After learning of the allegations last night, I instantly contacted the former player to offer the club's full support,"" Stephenson said.

The Sports Desk podcast: Yorkshire racism scandal and cricket's 'uncomfortable truths' In a statement, the ECB said it was appalled by the behaviour Chambers described, which ""no person should ever have to endure"". ""There is absolutely no room for racism in cricket,"" an ECB spokesperson said. ""We are sorry that Maurice has only been able to feel comfortable to speak out after his playing career had ended and as a game we must ensure that cannot prevail. ""We will be investigating this alongside the other allegations at Essex and applaud Maurice for his bravery in coming forward."" On Friday, Essex chairman John Faragher resigned following anallegation he used racist languagein a 2017 board meeting, which he denies. Chambers has also made a racism allegation against a team-mate during his time at Northamptonshire, where he played between 2013 and 2015. The player in question is no longer with the club. ""Racism is the antithesis of what Northamptonshire County Cricket Club stands for,"" said a club statement. ""The club is disappointed to hear of Maurice's experience and this clearly goes against the expectation we hold for all Northamptonshire players and staff."" These latest allegations come in the wake of a racism scandal at Yorkshire that has engulfed cricket. A report found former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the county said it would not discipline anyone, drawing widespread condemnation. Chief executive Mark Arthur and chairman Roger Hutton have both resigned since. ""That's why it feels so important to speak now,"" Chambers said. ""I've been inspired by the example of Azeem Rafiq and I want other players to have the courage to speak up and share their experiences.

""They have not wanted to apologise or take the recommendations of the panel going forward,"" he added. When asked by Damian Green MP if he thought cricket was institutionally racist, Rafiq replied: ""Yes, I do."" In response to a question by Julian Knight MP, chair of the DCMS select committee, on whether the issues he faced were ""replicated"" at other counties, Rafiq said: ""It's a problem up and down the country."" Former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave alleged they received racist abuse while at the club. Essex are facing racism allegations and encouraging those that have experienced discrimination to come forward. Last weekEssex chairman John Faragher resignedfollowing an allegation he used racist language in a 2017 board meeting, which he denies. Former Essex playersZoheb SharifandMaurice Chambershave both alleged they suffered racist abuse at the club. Rafiq said the scale of the problem is ""scary"" and there have been ""denials, briefings, cover-ups, smearing"". He claimed that British Asian representation in professional cricket since 2010 had dropped nearly 40% and that England have missed out on ""a hell of a lot of talent"" because Asian and black cricketers have been subjected to racism. Rafiq also called on the ECB ""to make tangible change"". Anti-racism and anti-fascism campaign group Hope not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles said Rafiq's testimony was ""heartbreaking"" to watch. ""What is most troubling is that what Azeem Rafiq has experienced is not an isolated incident, in cricket or across sport more generally,"" he added. ""Azeem Rafiq's bravery in speaking out against those who abused him needs to be a turning point - this is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with Azeem and run racism out of sport, once and for all."" Yorkshire chairman Lord Patel said it was an ""incredibly difficult day"" for all at the club and that Rafiq's testimony was ""harrowing and upsetting"". He added: ""There is no quick fix to the clear problems which have been identified, and the issues are complex, not least the charge of institutional racism which must be addressed head on."" This video can not be played 'It sounds like the Wild West' - MP Julie Elliott on ECB regulatory process Rafiq said he was subjected to ""inhuman"" treatment after the death of his son, because the club were ""blinded"" to how they should treat him after he raised a complaint about former England player Tim Bresnan in 2017. Rafiq said that the day after his son died, Moxon ""ripped shreds"" off him in a manner he had never seen Moxon use when addressing anyone else at the club. He said he was part of a group of ""six or seven"" players who complained about Bresnan, who now plays for Warwickshire, after which he said the club saw him as a ""trouble-maker"". He added he was the only player of colour in that group and was ""the only one to get repercussions"". Rafiq added that head coach Gale's attitude towards the death of Rafiq's son was that Rafiq was ""making it more than what it is"", and that ""hardly anyone"" asked after his and his wife's wellbeing. At the end of his session, Rafiq said his wife ""has struggled and still continues"" to and that his two young children ""have not had a dad, really, because all I have been worried about is Yorkshire going out to discredit me and how I am going to deal with it"". He added: ""It has been challenging, but I hope today provides some sort of closure and I can treat her for what she deserves."" Warwickshire said the report includes allegations of bullying against Rafiq by Bresnan regarding comments Bresnan made about Rafiq's weight. They said: ""We have spoken to Tim about this and he admits making such a comment. We understand there was no substantiated suggestion of racism against Tim, but he is devastated to learn of the impact of his comments."" Bresnan responded in a statement, stating: ""I have been made aware of the bullying claims made against me and have listened to Azeem Rafiq's account of his time at Yorkshire CCC today with great distress, as I'm sure everyone will have done. ""For any part I played in contributing to Azeem Rafiq's experience of feeling bullied at Yorkshire, I apologise unreservedly."" Gale is currently suspendedas part of an investigation into a tweet he sent in 2010. Moxon is currently absent from work because of a ""stress-related illness"" and Yorkshire said he ""will be given the necessary support"". BBC Sport is approaching Gale for comment. Yorkshire batter Ballance, who played 23 Tests for England, said earlier this month he ""regrets"" using racist language towards Rafiq, who he regarded as his ""best mate in cricket"". Rafiq said he became friends with Zimbabwe-born Ballance when he joined Yorkshire from Derbyshire in 2008 because he felt he was an ""outsider"" as well and that others called Ballance ""things that were out of order"". But he added their relationship ""started to deteriorate"" around 2013 because of Ballance's ""conduct"" and that his ""behaviour was so disgusting"" Rafiq raised it with an agent they shared. Rafiq said they remained ""amicable"" but not close afterwards and that Ballance found the captaincy a ""real struggle"" in 2017, resulting in a ""toxic"" dressing room. He added that Ballance used the name 'Kevin' as a ""derogatory"" term to refer to any player of colour and this was an ""open secret"", including within the England dressing room. Rafiq said that England batter Alex Hales named his dog Kevin ""because it's black"". ""It's disgusting how much of a joke it was,"" said Rafiq. He added that India batter Cheteshwar Pujara was called 'Steve' by coaches, players and the Yorkshire website after bowler Jack Brooks, who now plays for Somerset, started calling Pujara that because he could not pronounce his first name. Pujara said he did not like being called Steve and wouldprefer his team-mates to call him Cheteshwar.,external BBC Sport is approaching Hales and Brooks for comment. Somerset said they ""take a zero-tolerance approach to any form of behaviour which is anything other than inclusive for all, regardless of gender, race, sexuality or any other characteristic"". They added: ""Any case reported will be thoroughly investigated as it is important that we learn lessons from the past and we welcome any information on incidents that may have occurred to help us do so."" More on Ballance's previous response to this story Rafiq alleges former England captain and BBC cricket pundit Michael Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other Asian players in 2009 while they were all at Yorkshire. England bowler Adil Rashid and former Pakistan bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan have corroborated the allegation, whichVaughan ""completely and categorically denies"". ""It's important on Michael that we don't make it all about Michael,"" said Rafiq. ""It was a long time ago. He might not remember it because it doesn't mean anything to him."" England Test captain Joe Root said the Yorkshire racism scandal has ""fractured our game and torn lives apart"" but thathe could not recall any instance of racismduring his time at the club. Rafiq said Root has never used racist language but he found his statement ""hurtful"" because Root was Ballance's housemate and was on nights out when racist language directed at his Pakistan heritage was used. ""Joe might not remember it but that shows just how normal it was - even a good man like him can't see it for what it is,"" he said. ""The environment and institution is the problem."" Rafiq said that following an interview on Sky, former England bowler and Yorkshire team-mate Matthew Hoggard called him and said ""I am sorry if some of the comments made you feel how you described it"". Rafiq said he thanked Hoggard for his apology and really appreciated it. BBC Sport is approaching Hoggard for comment. Rafiq also said that Sky Sports commentator David Lloyd, a former Lancashire captain and England player and later coach, had made disparaging comments about Asian cricketers after Rafiq spoke about his experiences on television. He said there were ""high-profile"" media people ""messaging other members of the media who have supported me, saying stuff like: 'Well, a clubhouse is the lifeblood of a club, and Asian players don't go in there.'"" Rafiq subsequently identified that person as Lloyd. In response, Lloyd said he had ""made some comments about the Asian cricket community"" and that he ""deeply regrets"" his actions. ""I apologise most sincerely to Azeem and to the Asian community for doing this, and for any offence caused,"" he added. Sky said in a statement it was ""investigating the comments"" attributed to Lloyd and that it was ""committed to actively championing inclusion in cricket - and in all sports - and opposing all forms of discrimination"". Rafiq first spoke out last year, claiming ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire left him close to taking his own life. Seven of the 43 allegations were upheld by an independent panel last month and the report found he had been a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" at the club. However, Yorkshire said they will not take disciplinary action against any player, employee or executive. Hutton and Arthur have subsequently resigned, with Hutton's replacement as chairman, Lord Patel, apologising ""unreservedly"" and settling the employment tribunal with Rafiq. Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting international matches by the ECB. Kit supplier Nike, plus several of Yorkshire's sponsors, including Emerald Publishing, Yorkshire Tea, Tetley's beer and leisure club operators David Lloyd, either ended partnerships or said they would not continue deals. BBC Sport is approaching Yorkshire for further comment in response to today's evidence.

Why the NHS is struggling like never beforeThe causes of the unprecedented pressures on the NHS go beyond Covid - and fixing them is not easy.,"Lives are being put at risk with record long waits in A&E units and 999 calls taking hours to be reached. The causes of this go beyond Covid - and with winter coming it looks set to get worse. Natalie Quinn's parents were active and enjoying life when the pandemic hit. Although her father, Jimmy, had been diagnosed with dementia, he was still driving, playing golf and attending groups organised by the Alzheimer's Society. But lockdown hit them hard. ""All my dad's activities stopped and he went downhill quickly,"" Ms Quinn, 54, says. ""My mum was looking after him, but it took its toll. She had to go into hospital and he went into a care home. ""It was meant to be temporary - but, of course, we couldn't see him. He deteriorated and never came out."" By February, Jimmy, 75, was dead. Natalie's mother's health worsened too. For years, she had been living with a rare blood marrow disorder. Now 77, she has spent the past six months in and out of hospital in Yeovil, their home town. ""I really believe if they could have remained active and living the life they had, it could be so different,"" Ms Quinn says. Natalie's family's story is being repeated across the country. When the pandemic hit, about a quarter of adults in the UK were living with chronic illnesses. With support and care disrupted and Covid making people more isolated and less active, their health has suffered. According to those working in the NHS, they are now turning up to hospital in ever greater numbers. And it is this as much as Covid that is driving the rise in demand on the NHS. At Newcastle's Royal Victoria Hospital, which allowed BBC News in to film this month, doctors and nurses are struggling. Alongside Covid cases, they are seeing more frail elderly people being admitted as well as significant numbers of people with alcohol and mental health-related problems. Like at nearly all hospitals, A&E waiting times have worsened and quality of care is suffering, with patients spending hours on trolleys because there are no beds available. ""It really breaks my heart to see - they are really vulnerable,"" senior sister Juliet Amos says. The concern is being felt at the very top of the organisation too. ""We are in such a tight spot, there is no room for manoeuvre,"" Dame Jackie Daniel says. ""It can't go on."" But this is not just about demand. It is also down to capacity - what the NHS can cope with. The service was struggling before the pandemic hit, with targets routinely missed in all parts of the UK. The NHS was being run ""at its limit"", Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, says. Feedback from his members now shows unprecedented levels of concern about the coming months. The health service, he believes,  is heading for the ""most difficult winter in its history"". This is not just about the past couple of years though - the situation has been a decade in the making. Between 2010 and 2019 the annual rises in spending on health were well below those traditionally given since the birth of the NHS. During that period, the Tories have been in power - albeit with the Lib Dems for the first five years. Although it is worth noting, in its 2010 and 2015 election manifestos, Labour was not proposing any tangibly higher increases in spending either. This parliament has seen a change - annual rises are now close to 4% - but the result of the squeeze in the 2010s is fewer doctors and nurses per head of population than our Western European neighbours. It meant the UK entered the pandemic in a ""vulnerable position"" when you combine both funding and population health, says Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, with less resilience to absorb a shock like a pandemic. And so the NHS has struggled like never before. The waiting times in A&E are now at their worst levels since records began, nearly 20 years ago. The deterioration is even more alarming in the ambulance service,as BBC News reported last week. Response times for emergency callouts for things such as heart attacks and strokes are taking three times longer than they should, with some patients waiting up to nine hours for help to arrive. A big part of the problem is the system is grinding to a halt. Ambulances are becoming stuck outside A&E for hours on end because there are no hospital staff available to hand their patients over to. That's because of bottlenecks inside the hospital. Wards are full and struggling to discharge patients even when they are medically fit to leave - because of a lack of available care in the community. So even when A&E patients are admitted, 30% wait longer than four hours for a bed. And that, in turn, leads to further overcrowding in A&Es, where a quarter of all patients wait longer than four hours to be seen. In one of the worst cases, a backlog of more than 20 ambulances was reported at one hospital. This can have dire consequences. An investigation is under way after a patient died following a cardiac arrest. They had spent five hours in the back of an ambulance outside Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Another death is being investigated in the East of England, after a call classed as immediately life threatening took an hour to reach. Such calls should be answered in seven minutes on average. The patient was found dead. The ambulance service said crews had been stuck in queues at local hospitals. ""Hospitals are full and running pretty much on one in and one out,"" a consultant in West Yorkshire, former Society for Acute Medicine president Dr Nick Scriven, says. And it seems little can be done to prevent the situation deteriorating as winter hits. The government is putting extra money in - but it will have limited effect without extra staff and they are simply unavailable, Dr Scriven says. ""We need to be frank with the public,"" he says. ""Some really difficult decisions will have to be made."" Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

Man City's Mendy charged with two further rapes,"Benjamin Mendy is accused of six counts of rape and one count of sexual assault Manchester City defender Benjamin Mendy has been charged with two further counts of rape. Mr Mendy, of Prestbury, has been summonsed to appear at Stockport Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. The 27-year-old footballer, who remains in custody, is now facing six counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. The charges relate to four complainants over the age of 16 and are alleged to have taken place between October 2020 and August 2021. The France international has played for last season's Premier League champions Manchester City since 2017, when he joined from Monaco for a reported Â£52m. He was suspended by the club after being charged by police, pending an investigation. Louis Saha Matturie was also previously charged with four counts of rape in relation to the alleged attacks between March 2021 and August 2021.Â The 40-year-old from Eccles has also been charged with two additional counts of rape and one of sexual assault and summonsed to appear at the court.

China warns US about 'playing with fire' on Taiwan,"This video can not be played These were the most substantial discussions both leaders have had since Mr Biden took office Chinese President Xi Jinping has used a virtual summit with US counterpart Joe Biden to warn that encouraging Taiwanese independence would be ""playing with fire"". The talks are the most substantial since Mr Biden took office in January. Both sides emphasised the two men's personal relationship and the summit was an attempt to ease tensions. But they could not escape one of the most sensitive topics: the self-ruled island of Taiwan. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. The US recognises and has formal ties with China. But it has also pledged to help Taiwan defend itself in the event of an attack. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? China's state-run Global Times said Mr Xi blamed recent tensions on ""repeated attempts by the Taiwan authorities to look for US support for their independence agenda as well as the intention of some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China"". ""Such moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt,"" it said. The White House said Mr Biden ""strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"". The leaders spoke to each other virtually Despite the strong words on Taiwan, the meeting began with both leaders greeting each other warmly, with Mr Xi saying he was happy to see his ""old friend"" Mr Biden. Mr Biden said the two had ""always communicated with one another very honestly and candidly,"" adding ""we never walk away wondering what the other man is thinking"". Mr Xi said the two countries needed to improve ""communication"" and face challenges ""together"". ""Humanity lives in a global village, and we face multiple challenges together. China and the US need to increase communication and co-operation."" said Mr Xi. The world's two most powerful nations do not see eye-to-eye on a number of issues, and Mr Biden raised US concerns about human rights abuses in Hong Kong and against Uyghurs in the north-west region of Xinjiang. China accuses the US of meddling in its domestic affairs. On trade, Mr Biden highlighted the ""need to protect American workers and industries from the PRC's [People's Republic of China's] unfair trade and economic practices"". Mr Xi also appeared to have made a strong comment on the issue, with Reuters reporting that he had told Mr Biden that the US needed to stop ""abusing the concept of national security to oppress Chinese companies"". Climate change was also discussed. Last week the two sprung a surprise by issuing a joint declaration to address climate change, at talks in Glasgow, Scotland. This was the third time the two leaders have spoken since Mr Biden's inauguration in January. The talks lasted three-and-a-half hours, longer than expected. Mr Xi has not left China in nearly two years, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The China-US relationship is crucial to both parties and the wider world, with Beijing having called repeatedly on the new administration in Washington to improve relations which deteriorated under Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump. Both men are facing domestic concerns, with Mr Biden's poll numbers slumping in the face of inflation, the threat of coronavirus and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr Xi is tackling energy shortages and a property crisis. That this meeting has happened at all between the world's two most powerful leaders tells you that both sides believe that the previous open hostility between Beijing and Washington wasn't working for either of them and was potentially dangerous. Their relationship had become so toxic and so dysfunctional that these video discussions have been, in part, an attempt to ensure that competition between China and the US didn't drift into armed conflict due to a misunderstanding at a global hotspot. On the one hand, we should probably be pretty happy they they're steering away from war before it can happen but, on the other, it is quite something that they have felt the need to do so. In fact, if you see the optics at this conference this is the warmest things have appeared for a long time with Chinese and US leaders. These efforts to make the discussions cordial with waving, talk of ""the global village"" and ""humanity's challenges"" was a far cry from the meltdown in Alaska this March when senior representatives from both administrations ended up sledging one another in public. This does appear to be a genuine attempt at a reset and we should actually expect this to alter global geopolitical relations in a concrete way.

Thousands of police staff not properly vetted,"More than 2,500 police officers and staff are working without the appropriate level of vetting, a BBC investigation has found. Figures show more than a quarter of UK forces have not checked all personnel to meet national guidelines introduced in 2006. The murder of Sarah Everard has shone a spotlight on police vetting procedures. The National Police Chiefs Council said it was the responsibility of each force to ensure checks were up to date. Vetting involves a series of background checks on people wanting to join the police - looking at everything from past convictions, behaviour of family and friends, or financial problems that may leave an applicant open to corruption. The College of Policing introduced the national guidelines to ensure all forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were checking new recruits in the same way. Then in 2019 the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate for Constabulary, Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS), gave all forces a deadline of July 2020 to retrospectively vet all their officers and staff to these 2006 guidelines, no matter how long they have been serving. But figures obtained by the BBC's File on 4 programme - through a series of Freedom of Information requests - show more than a quarter of police forces have still not met this deadline. File on 4 has also investigated a number of cases where ""red flags"" have failed to be acted on by police forces. Nicola Brookes, who waived her right to anonymity, was groomed for sex by a former inspector at Sussex Police, Tony Lumb. He targeted Ms Brookes, a vulnerable stalking victim, in 2015, under the pretence of helping her with her case. Ms Brookes said he visited her regularly while he was on duty and they once had sex. ""He was literally grooming me to be dependent on him. All the way through he'd been telling me that it was OK for him to behave like this with me, because I wasn't his crime victim so it was OK,"" she said. Eventually she realised what he had been doing was wrong, and reported him to the police. He was sacked for gross misconduct in 2020, following an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), in which it emerged he had had sex with three other women while on duty. The IPCC report revealed Lumb had been previously reported to Sussex Police in 2012 but the allegation wasn't investigated properly by the force's professional standards department. ""It was shocking,"" Ms Brookes said. ""He could have been stopped in 2012 and he would never have been able to get to me."" During his 27 years as an officer, under current rules, Lumb may only have been vetted twice. Sussex Police refused to provide File on 4 with any details of his checks, but said in a statement that as a force they fully comply with the vetting code of practice. They said they could not tell the BBC why the 2012 allegation was not fully investigated. Of the 47 forces, 41 responded to the FoI request revealing that 2,515 officers and staff were still not up to date with vetting checks - about 1.5% of all personnel. The figures do not include the Metropolitan Police, which said it could not provide the data in time. However, a similar FoI request by File on 4 in May this year found more than 650 Met Police officers and staff had not been revetted to the 2006 guidelines. Police Scotland is not bound by College of Policing guidance. HMICFRS says it is ""reviewing whether previous recommendations on vetting have been implemented"". But the former Inspector of Constabulary, Zoe Billingham, called the figures ""deeply disappointing"". She told File on 4: ""We know that policing attracts predators, a very tiny number, so of all of the professions and all public services, policing really does have to have the state of the art tightest vetting processes and procedures in place. ""It [retrospective vetting] needs to be completely nailed down now so that all officers, all staff, and volunteers working in policing have the right checks and safeguards in place."" Chief Constable Debra Tedds, who leads on vetting for the National Police Chiefs Council said: ""It is the responsibility of each force to ensure that they have got the required levels as per the guidance. And I do know that there are a small number of forces that do still have outstanding action plans that they need to work through."" She added: ""The majority of officers do join the service to do the right thing and support members of the public. My general view is vetting is robust.""

More Stormont ministers back Covid passport checks,"Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson has said he hopes his party will try to stop the introduction of mandatory Covid-19 vaccine certificates in Northern Ireland. He described it as a ""bad policy"" and said it would be an infringement on people's freedoms. The Stormont executive will discuss the proposal by Health Minister Robin Swann's at a meeting on Wednesday. Three other ministers have already declared their support for the plan. Any ministers opposing to the idea ""need to set out very clearly what their alternative is"", said Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon, the SDLP deputy leader. Alliance Party leader and Justice Minister Naomi Long said the system should have been put in place when social distancing was scrapped in bars, cafes and restaurants andnightclubs reopened in Northern Ireland on 31 October. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president, tweeted that she would support Mr Swann's proposal. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he had made a commitment to Mr Swann to ""work with him to find solutions"", but they ""have to be solutions that genuinely ease the pressures that our hospitals are under"".

Northern Ireland's health department has updated its COVIDCert NI app, which was introduced to allow people travelling abroad to show proof of vaccination, to include a certificate for ""domestic use"". But use of the domestic certificate is not mandatory - that will be up for discussion by the executive on Wednesday. Mr Swann has said thatministers will consider which sectors may require people to show certificatesto gain entry. The DUP's Mr Wilson said ministers from his party would ""make a proper assessment of the policy... and then make [their] decision"". He told BBC News NI: ""If you're going to have a policy which will save lives then at least make sure that it's workable. The Republic of Ireland has been using the EU's Digital Covid Certificate since July ""Make sure that it doesn't do other damage to the economy and to people's individual freedoms which can't be undone in the future. ""We have always said that any response to Covid should be a proportionate response and should take into consideration the impact that it has on people's lives and on businesses."" It was put to him that some hospitals in Northern Ireland were close to breaking point. He responded: ""There should have been much better planning to ensure that hospitals did have the capability - we are two years nearly into this (pandemic) now."" Mrs Long told BBC News NI: ""I felt that the time to [introduce mandatory vaccine certificates] was at the point when we were making additional relaxations. ""Those who are vaccinated are less likely to become seriously ill, and if they're less likely to be seriously ill they're less likely to put pressure on the health service."" Naomi Long says a mandatory vaccine passport system should have been introduced last month But she said it was important to maintain other measures for dealing with Covid-19. ""[Vaccine passports are] not going to be the one thing which sets us out and deals with the fact we have rising Covid levels in the community,"" she said. ""The thing that's most likely to do that is people taking personal responsibility."" Mrs Long said she did not support the introduction of Covid-19 passes ""when it comes to access to public services"". ""I think that would be discriminatory but I think when you're talking about areas of life which are optional it is reasonable, particularly where there is no social distancing possible,"" she added. If Covid passports are to be introduced in Northern Ireland it will not be a magic solution - they are just another piece of the jigsaw of measures designed to offer an additional ring of protection. The hard evidence is that vaccines work so more proof of individuals being vaccinated will help control an environment that's full of the virus. Think about it - if you reduce the chance of infectious people entering high-risk settings such as bars and nightclubs you reduce the risk of transmission. But it would be wrong to expect Covid certificates to solve all of our problems. It worked in the Republic of Ireland to an extent but now that the effectiveness of the vaccine is waning and more people are indoors certs there aren't just as powerful. Like social distancing, hand-washing, vaccines and boosters, Covid certificates are just another part of the armoury. With infection figures rising, the Department of Health needs all the ammunition it can get its hands on as it continues to battle the virus. Ms Mallon said the introduction of Covid-19 vaccine passports was ""long overdue"". ""It really is the right and responsible thing and I hope that all of the executive can examine the evidence and we can agree this and we can get moving on it extremely quickly,"" she told BBC News NI. ""No-one wants to be taking these decisions but we're in a public health emergency and so we have to take difficult unpopular decisions. Nichola Mallon says a vaccine certificate system is the ""right and responsible thing"" ""We need to do a last push, if you like, to maximise vaccine uptake and we know when you look at other places that when you incentivise it more people come forward."" Since July, people in the Republic of Ireland have had to show proof of their jabs for indoor hospitality. The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster said the majority of businesses could not support a vaccine passport. Colin Neill said that ""once again"" the industry was being singled out. ""Many are worried that this will be imposed on the sector, just because it might feel like this is the right thing to do,"" he said. He said there were many unanswered questions about what a phased approach was, what premises would be included, unvaccinated staff and the effect on jobs. ""The executive has the power to impose Covid passports but it will be the hospitality sector who will be left to carry the financial and operational burden,"" he said. ""It would appear that little or no consideration has been given to the business owners and staff who will be left to enforce the scheme."" The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, a trade body representing the sector, said Stormont must ""outline exactly what"" was required before such a policy came into effect. ""The real thing is the clarity,"" said its chief executive Janice Gault. ""The public need to know why this is being done, what is expected of them, just as businesses need to know what they are looking for and how it will be enforced.""

"English cricket 'institutionally' racist - RafiqEnglish cricket is ""institutionally"" racist, says former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq.BBC Sport","This video can not be played Emotional Rafiq tells MPs about racism at Yorkshire English cricket is ""institutionally"" racist, says former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq. Rafiq, 30, told a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee that racist language was ""constantly"" used during his time at Yorkshire. In an emotional testimony, he also said the club gave him ""inhuman"" treatment after his son was still-born in 2017. He added the issues he faced at Yorkshire are ""without a shadow of a doubt"" widespread in domestic cricket. Reaction & all the evidence: Rafiq appears before MPs Rafiq said he had lost his career to racism, which is a ""horrible feeling"" but that ""hopefully"" by speaking out there will be ""massive change in five years' time"". ""All I wanted was an acceptance, an apology, an understanding, and let's try and work together to ensure it never happens again,"" he continued. ""I was not going to let this go, no matter how much damage it causes me - I was determined to become a voice for the voiceless."" In wide-ranging testimony, Rafiq also said: All he ever wanted to do was realise his ""dream"" of playing for England Racist language, including terms aimed at his and others' Pakistani heritage, was used ""constantly"" and ""never stamped out"" during his time at Yorkshire The use of such terms was racist and not ""banter"" as the report had concluded It left him feeling ""isolated"" and ""humiliated"", with racist comments made by others in front of team-mates and coaching staff but not challenged The use of such language was so common it ""became the norm"" and people at the club ""didn't think it was wrong"" He ""didn't realise"" and was ""in denial"" about the scale of the problem during most of his first spell at Yorkshire, up until 2014 He thought ""things had changed"" when he returned for his second spell in 2016 But the atmosphere became ""toxic"" after Gary Ballance took over as captain later that year, shortly after former batter Andrew Gale replaced Jason Gillespie as head coach Aged 15 and a practising Muslim, he was pinned down by a senior player at his local cricket club and red wine was poured into his mouth He said he did not drink alcohol again until ""around 2012"" when he felt he had to ""to fit in"" at Yorkshire Asked about claims he had been a ""heavy drinker"", he said he ""wasn't perfect"" and was ""not proud"" of some of the things he did during this time, but that these had ""no relation"" to the racism he was subjected to The report into his allegations was ""shoddy at best"" and the panel failed to speak to key witnesses Rafiq was giving evidence to MPs after a report found he was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the club said they would not discipline anyone. Yorkshire's former chairman Roger Hutton subsequently addressed the committee, followed by representatives from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), including chief executive Tom Harrison. Hutton, who offered his ""profound apologies"" to Rafiq, said Yorkshire's director of cricket Martyn Moxon and former chief executive Mark Arthur ""failed to accept the gravity of the situation"". ""They have not wanted to apologise or take the recommendations of the panel going forward,"" he added. When asked by Damian Green MP if he thought cricket was institutionally racist, Rafiq replied: ""Yes, I do."" In response to a question by Julian Knight MP, chair of the DCMS select committee, on whether the issues he faced were ""replicated"" at other counties, Rafiq said: ""It's a problem up and down the country."" Former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave alleged they received racist abuse while at the club. Essex are facing racism allegations and encouraging those that have experienced discrimination to come forward. Last weekEssex chairman John Faragher resignedfollowing an allegation he used racist language in a 2017 board meeting, which he denies. Former Essex playersZoheb SharifandMaurice Chambershave both alleged they suffered racist abuse at the club. Rafiq said the scale of the problem is ""scary"" and there have been ""denials, briefings, cover-ups, smearing"". He claimed that British Asian representation in professional cricket since 2010 had dropped nearly 40% and that England have missed out on ""a hell of a lot of talent"" because Asian and black cricketers have been subjected to racism. Rafiq also called on the ECB ""to make tangible change"". Anti-racism and anti-fascism campaign group Hope not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles said Rafiq's testimony was ""heartbreaking"" to watch. ""What is most troubling is that what Azeem Rafiq has experienced is not an isolated incident, in cricket or across sport more generally,"" he added. ""Azeem Rafiq's bravery in speaking out against those who abused him needs to be a turning point - this is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with Azeem and run racism out of sport, once and for all."" Yorkshire chairman Lord Patel said it was an ""incredibly difficult day"" for all at the club and that Rafiq's testimony was ""harrowing and upsetting"". He added: ""There is no quick fix to the clear problems which have been identified, and the issues are complex, not least the charge of institutional racism which must be addressed head on."" This video can not be played 'It sounds like the Wild West' - MP Julie Elliott on ECB regulatory process Rafiq said he was subjected to ""inhuman"" treatment after the death of his son, because the club were ""blinded"" to how they should treat him after he raised a complaint about former England player Tim Bresnan in 2017. Rafiq said that the day after his son died, Moxon ""ripped shreds"" off him in a manner he had never seen Moxon use when addressing anyone else at the club. He said he was part of a group of ""six or seven"" players who complained about Bresnan, who now plays for Warwickshire, after which he said the club saw him as a ""trouble-maker"". He added he was the only player of colour in that group and was ""the only one to get repercussions"". Rafiq added that head coach Gale's attitude towards the death of Rafiq's son was that Rafiq was ""making it more than what it is"", and that ""hardly anyone"" asked after his and his wife's wellbeing. At the end of his session, Rafiq said his wife ""has struggled and still continues"" to and that his two young children ""have not had a dad, really, because all I have been worried about is Yorkshire going out to discredit me and how I am going to deal with it"". He added: ""It has been challenging, but I hope today provides some sort of closure and I can treat her for what she deserves."" Warwickshire said the report includes allegations of bullying against Rafiq by Bresnan regarding comments Bresnan made about Rafiq's weight. They said: ""We have spoken to Tim about this and he admits making such a comment. We understand there was no substantiated suggestion of racism against Tim, but he is devastated to learn of the impact of his comments."" Bresnan responded in a statement, stating: ""I have been made aware of the bullying claims made against me and have listened to Azeem Rafiq's account of his time at Yorkshire CCC today with great distress, as I'm sure everyone will have done. ""For any part I played in contributing to Azeem Rafiq's experience of feeling bullied at Yorkshire, I apologise unreservedly."" Gale is currently suspendedas part of an investigation into a tweet he sent in 2010. Moxon is currently absent from work because of a ""stress-related illness"" and Yorkshire said he ""will be given the necessary support"". BBC Sport is approaching Gale for comment. Yorkshire batter Ballance, who played 23 Tests for England, said earlier this month he ""regrets"" using racist language towards Rafiq, who he regarded as his ""best mate in cricket"". Rafiq said he became friends with Zimbabwe-born Ballance when he joined Yorkshire from Derbyshire in 2008 because he felt he was an ""outsider"" as well and that others called Ballance ""things that were out of order"". But he added their relationship ""started to deteriorate"" around 2013 because of Ballance's ""conduct"" and that his ""behaviour was so disgusting"" Rafiq raised it with an agent they shared. Rafiq said they remained ""amicable"" but not close afterwards and that Ballance found the captaincy a ""real struggle"" in 2017, resulting in a ""toxic"" dressing room. He added that Ballance used the name 'Kevin' as a ""derogatory"" term to refer to any player of colour and this was an ""open secret"", including within the England dressing room. Rafiq said that England batter Alex Hales named his dog Kevin ""because it's black"". ""It's disgusting how much of a joke it was,"" said Rafiq. He added that India batter Cheteshwar Pujara was called 'Steve' by coaches, players and the Yorkshire website after bowler Jack Brooks, who now plays for Somerset, started calling Pujara that because he could not pronounce his first name. Pujara said he did not like being called Steve and wouldprefer his team-mates to call him Cheteshwar.,external BBC Sport is approaching Hales and Brooks for comment. Somerset said they ""take a zero-tolerance approach to any form of behaviour which is anything other than inclusive for all, regardless of gender, race, sexuality or any other characteristic"". They added: ""Any case reported will be thoroughly investigated as it is important that we learn lessons from the past and we welcome any information on incidents that may have occurred to help us do so."" More on Ballance's previous response to this story Rafiq alleges former England captain and BBC cricket pundit Michael Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other Asian players in 2009 while they were all at Yorkshire. England bowler Adil Rashid and former Pakistan bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan have corroborated the allegation, whichVaughan ""completely and categorically denies"". ""It's important on Michael that we don't make it all about Michael,"" said Rafiq. ""It was a long time ago. He might not remember it because it doesn't mean anything to him."" England Test captain Joe Root said the Yorkshire racism scandal has ""fractured our game and torn lives apart"" but thathe could not recall any instance of racismduring his time at the club. Rafiq said Root has never used racist language but he found his statement ""hurtful"" because Root was Ballance's housemate and was on nights out when racist language directed at his Pakistan heritage was used. ""Joe might not remember it but that shows just how normal it was - even a good man like him can't see it for what it is,"" he said. ""The environment and institution is the problem."" Rafiq said that following an interview on Sky, former England bowler and Yorkshire team-mate Matthew Hoggard called him and said ""I am sorry if some of the comments made you feel how you described it"". Rafiq said he thanked Hoggard for his apology and really appreciated it. BBC Sport is approaching Hoggard for comment. Rafiq also said that Sky Sports commentator David Lloyd, a former Lancashire captain and England player and later coach, had made disparaging comments about Asian cricketers after Rafiq spoke about his experiences on television. He said there were ""high-profile"" media people ""messaging other members of the media who have supported me, saying stuff like: 'Well, a clubhouse is the lifeblood of a club, and Asian players don't go in there.'"" Rafiq subsequently identified that person as Lloyd. In response, Lloyd said he had ""made some comments about the Asian cricket community"" and that he ""deeply regrets"" his actions. ""I apologise most sincerely to Azeem and to the Asian community for doing this, and for any offence caused,"" he added. Sky said in a statement it was ""investigating the comments"" attributed to Lloyd and that it was ""committed to actively championing inclusion in cricket - and in all sports - and opposing all forms of discrimination"". Rafiq first spoke out last year, claiming ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire left him close to taking his own life. Seven of the 43 allegations were upheld by an independent panel last month and the report found he had been a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" at the club. However, Yorkshire said they will not take disciplinary action against any player, employee or executive. Hutton and Arthur have subsequently resigned, with Hutton's replacement as chairman, Lord Patel, apologising ""unreservedly"" and settling the employment tribunal with Rafiq. Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting international matches by the ECB. Kit supplier Nike, plus several of Yorkshire's sponsors, including Emerald Publishing, Yorkshire Tea, Tetley's beer and leisure club operators David Lloyd, either ended partnerships or said they would not continue deals. BBC Sport is approaching Yorkshire for further comment in response to today's evidence.

"Rents rising at fastest pace in 13 years - ZooplaRents are rising at the fastest pace since 2008 as strong demand outstrips supply, says one online platform.","Rents are rising at the fastest pace since 2008 as people rush back to city centres, according to property website Zoopla. Private sector rents in the UK were 4.6% higher in September than a year before at Â£968 per month on average - the strongest growth seen in 13 years. Outside of London, rents were up by 6%, marking a 14-year high, it said. Zoopla said it was partly down to higher demand for city living amid limited supply. Rents are up most in the South West (9%) year-on-year, followed by Wales (7.7%) and the East Midlands (6.9%). As lockdown restrictions have eased and businesses have reopened in city centres, there has been a marked return to more built-up areas, it suggested. 'Eviction risk' for universal credit renters Rents price us out of city, says van-living woman Cornwall home renters say action is still needed Rents in London are now starting to increase as people return to the office. In its latest report, Zoopla said the English capital saw prices increase by 1.6% annually, compared with falls of nearly 10% around the start of the year. Although rents in local areas can fluctuate significantly from month to month, cities such as Bristol and Nottingham also saw the average tenants' bill go up by more than 8% in the year to September. Zoopla said demand for rented properties is still outstripping supply, putting upward pressure on prices. Grainne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla, said that the popularity of homes in higher price bands was also contributing. ""Households looking for the flexibility of rental accommodation, especially students and city workers, are back in the market after consecutive lockdowns affected demand levels in major cities. ""Meanwhile, just as in the sales market, there is still a cohort of renters looking for properties offering more space, or a more rural or coastal location."" There's tough competition for views like these - rents in Purbeck in Dorset were up by 16.2% annually. And with fewer people made unemployed during the pandemic than had been expected, rents are expected to rise further in 2022. By the end of next year, rents are forecast to rise by another 4.5%. Dan Wilson Craw, Deputy Director of campaign group Generation Rent, said the new report was ""terrible news"" for anyone trying to move right now. ""We have been hearing from renters who have lost bidding wars for homes, or failed affordability checks, so are being priced out of their areas,"" he said. He added that since the pandemic, private renters were more likely to be getting housing support through the welfare system. ""But the chancellor has frozen rates for another year, so these rises will make it even harder to find an affordable home. The government has to do much more to bring rents down - that means building more homes, including social housing,"" he said.

NHS grinding to halt and why it's getting worse,"Lives are being put at risk with record long waits in A&E units and 999 calls taking hours to be reached. The causes of this go beyond Covid - and with winter coming it looks set to get worse. Natalie Quinn's parents were active and enjoying life when the pandemic hit. Although her father, Jimmy, had been diagnosed with dementia, he was still driving, playing golf and attending groups organised by the Alzheimer's Society. But lockdown hit them hard. ""All my dad's activities stopped and he went downhill quickly,"" Ms Quinn, 54, says. ""My mum was looking after him, but it took its toll. She had to go into hospital and he went into a care home. ""It was meant to be temporary - but, of course, we couldn't see him. He deteriorated and never came out."" By February, Jimmy, 75, was dead. Natalie's mother's health worsened too. For years, she had been living with a rare blood marrow disorder. Now 77, she has spent the past six months in and out of hospital in Yeovil, their home town. ""I really believe if they could have remained active and living the life they had, it could be so different,"" Ms Quinn says. Natalie's family's story is being repeated across the country. When the pandemic hit, about a quarter of adults in the UK were living with chronic illnesses. With support and care disrupted and Covid making people more isolated and less active, their health has suffered. According to those working in the NHS, they are now turning up to hospital in ever greater numbers. And it is this as much as Covid that is driving the rise in demand on the NHS. At Newcastle's Royal Victoria Hospital, which allowed BBC News in to film this month, doctors and nurses are struggling. Alongside Covid cases, they are seeing more frail elderly people being admitted as well as significant numbers of people with alcohol and mental health-related problems. Like at nearly all hospitals, A&E waiting times have worsened and quality of care is suffering, with patients spending hours on trolleys because there are no beds available. ""It really breaks my heart to see - they are really vulnerable,"" senior sister Juliet Amos says. The concern is being felt at the very top of the organisation too. ""We are in such a tight spot, there is no room for manoeuvre,"" Dame Jackie Daniel says. ""It can't go on."" But this is not just about demand. It is also down to capacity - what the NHS can cope with. The service was struggling before the pandemic hit, with targets routinely missed in all parts of the UK. The NHS was being run ""at its limit"", Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, says. Feedback from his members now shows unprecedented levels of concern about the coming months. The health service, he believes,  is heading for the ""most difficult winter in its history"". This is not just about the past couple of years though - the situation has been a decade in the making. Between 2010 and 2019 the annual rises in spending on health were well below those traditionally given since the birth of the NHS. During that period, the Tories have been in power - albeit with the Lib Dems for the first five years. Although it is worth noting, in its 2010 and 2015 election manifestos, Labour was not proposing any tangibly higher increases in spending either. This parliament has seen a change - annual rises are now close to 4% - but the result of the squeeze in the 2010s is fewer doctors and nurses per head of population than our Western European neighbours. It meant the UK entered the pandemic in a ""vulnerable position"" when you combine both funding and population health, says Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, with less resilience to absorb a shock like a pandemic. And so the NHS has struggled like never before. The waiting times in A&E are now at their worst levels since records began, nearly 20 years ago. The deterioration is even more alarming in the ambulance service,as BBC News reported last week. Response times for emergency callouts for things such as heart attacks and strokes are taking three times longer than they should, with some patients waiting up to nine hours for help to arrive. A big part of the problem is the system is grinding to a halt. Ambulances are becoming stuck outside A&E for hours on end because there are no hospital staff available to hand their patients over to. That's because of bottlenecks inside the hospital. Wards are full and struggling to discharge patients even when they are medically fit to leave - because of a lack of available care in the community. So even when A&E patients are admitted, 30% wait longer than four hours for a bed. And that, in turn, leads to further overcrowding in A&Es, where a quarter of all patients wait longer than four hours to be seen. In one of the worst cases, a backlog of more than 20 ambulances was reported at one hospital. This can have dire consequences. An investigation is under way after a patient died following a cardiac arrest. They had spent five hours in the back of an ambulance outside Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Another death is being investigated in the East of England, after a call classed as immediately life threatening took an hour to reach. Such calls should be answered in seven minutes on average. The patient was found dead. The ambulance service said crews had been stuck in queues at local hospitals. ""Hospitals are full and running pretty much on one in and one out,"" a consultant in West Yorkshire, former Society for Acute Medicine president Dr Nick Scriven, says. And it seems little can be done to prevent the situation deteriorating as winter hits. The government is putting extra money in - but it will have limited effect without extra staff and they are simply unavailable, Dr Scriven says. ""We need to be frank with the public,"" he says. ""Some really difficult decisions will have to be made."" Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

Rents rising at fastest pace in 13 years - Zoopla,"Rents are rising at the fastest pace since 2008 as people rush back to city centres, according to property website Zoopla. Private sector rents in the UK were 4.6% higher in September than a year before at Â£968 per month on average - the strongest growth seen in 13 years. Outside of London, rents were up by 6%, marking a 14-year high, it said. Zoopla said it was partly down to higher demand for city living amid limited supply. Rents are up most in the South West (9%) year-on-year, followed by Wales (7.7%) and the East Midlands (6.9%). As lockdown restrictions have eased and businesses have reopened in city centres, there has been a marked return to more built-up areas, it suggested. 'Eviction risk' for universal credit renters Rents price us out of city, says van-living woman Cornwall home renters say action is still needed Rents in London are now starting to increase as people return to the office. In its latest report, Zoopla said the English capital saw prices increase by 1.6% annually, compared with falls of nearly 10% around the start of the year. Although rents in local areas can fluctuate significantly from month to month, cities such as Bristol and Nottingham also saw the average tenants' bill go up by more than 8% in the year to September. Zoopla said demand for rented properties is still outstripping supply, putting upward pressure on prices. Grainne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla, said that the popularity of homes in higher price bands was also contributing. ""Households looking for the flexibility of rental accommodation, especially students and city workers, are back in the market after consecutive lockdowns affected demand levels in major cities. ""Meanwhile, just as in the sales market, there is still a cohort of renters looking for properties offering more space, or a more rural or coastal location."" There's tough competition for views like these - rents in Purbeck in Dorset were up by 16.2% annually. And with fewer people made unemployed during the pandemic than had been expected, rents are expected to rise further in 2022. By the end of next year, rents are forecast to rise by another 4.5%. Dan Wilson Craw, Deputy Director of campaign group Generation Rent, said the new report was ""terrible news"" for anyone trying to move right now. ""We have been hearing from renters who have lost bidding wars for homes, or failed affordability checks, so are being priced out of their areas,"" he said. He added that since the pandemic, private renters were more likely to be getting housing support through the welfare system. ""But the chancellor has frozen rates for another year, so these rises will make it even harder to find an affordable home. The government has to do much more to bring rents down - that means building more homes, including social housing,"" he said. At last month's Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced almost Â£2bn would be invested by the government into building new homes on derelict or unused land in England.

"Rashid supports Rafiq racism allegation, which Vaughan again denies","Adil Rashid has been at Yorkshire since 2006 England bowler Adil Rashid says he heard Michael Vaughan make a racist comment to a group of Asian cricketers, becoming the third player to do so. Rashid's former Yorkshire team-mate Azeem Rafiq alleges Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other players. The allegation, which Vaughan ""completely and categorically denies"", was corroborated by former Pakistan bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan, who said ""systematic taunting"" occurred at the club. In astatement to The Cricketer,,externalRashid said he could confirm what Rafiq had said. On Monday, Vaughan reiterated his denial and said the comment ""simply never happened"". The fourth player in the group - bowler Ajmal Shahzad - previously toldthe Daily Mail,externalhe had no recollection of the event and ""the senior guys were really good to me"". Vaughan previously said, in a column for the Daily Telegraph, the comments he is alleged to have made were said in 2009 while he was still a Yorkshire player. In a new statement to the Press Association on Monday, the former England captain said: ""I categorically deny saying the words attributed to me by Azeem Rafiq and want to re-state this publicly because the 'you lot' comment simply never happened. ""Anyone who has viewed the Sky footage of Yorkshire's pre-match huddle at the game in question in June 2009, and the interaction between the players, would find it hard to reconcile those scenes with the version of events that has been presented."" Vaughan says he remembers the match as it was the first time Yorkshire had selected four players of Asian heritage in the same team, adding that it was ""an important milestone for the county and it was also a moment of pride for me personally"". He says it was a ""a sign of the progress"" made during his 16 years at the club and he ""made a point of shaking all four players' hands that day because I recognised it was a significant moment"". Weeks after the match, Vaughan says he wrote ""enthusiastically"" about it in his biography, saying it would ""be the shape of things to come for Yorkshire"". He says it is therefore ""inconceivable I would have made the derogatory comment attributed to me"". ""It is extremely upsetting that this completely false accusation has been made against me by a former team-mate, apparently supported by two other players,"" he added in his statement on Monday. ""I have been in contact with the six other players from that team and not one of them has any recollection of the remark being made. ""I fully accept that perspectives differ, and I have great sympathy for what Azeem Rafiq has gone through, but I hope everyone understands why I cannot allow this to go unchallenged or my reputation to be trashed unfairly."" Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Yorkshire whistleblowing hotline to open on Monday Listen: The Sports Desk - Yorkshire racism scandal and cricket's 'uncomfortable truths' Rafiq should be 'praised' for bravery, says Yorkshire chair Patel No-one at Yorkshire 'racist' but culture 'locked in the past' - Hutton Rashid, who has been at Yorkshire since 2006, released a statement after the T20 World Cup, where the leg-spinner helped England reach the semi-finals. ""Racism is a cancer in all walks of life and unfortunately in professional sports too, and is something which of course has to be stamped out,"" he wrote. ""I wanted to concentrate as much as possible on my cricket and to avoid distractions to the detriment of the team but I can confirm Azeem Rafiq's recollection of Michael Vaughan's comments to a group of us Asian players. ""I'm encouraged by the fact a parliamentary committee seems to be trying to improve the situation, whether that's holding people accountable or getting changes made at an institutional level. ""These can only be positive developments. I will of course be more than happy to support any official efforts when the time is right. For now, though, these matters are of an intensely personal nature and I will not be commenting on them further."" New chair of Yorkshire Lord Patel said he ""welcomes"" Rashid's courage in ""speaking up at what is a difficult and distressing time for all those who love this club and the sport of cricket"". Patel contacted Rashid on Monday in order that they can ""talk through the issues as soon as he is ready and able"". Rafiq and former Yorkshire chairman Roger Hutton will give evidence at a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing on Tuesday. Writing in his Daily Telegraph column earlier this month, Vaughan, who wasstood down from his BBC Radio 5 Live show, said:""This hit me very hard. It was like being struck over the head with a brick. ""I have been involved in cricket for 30 years and never once been accused of any remotely similar incident or disciplinary offence as a player or commentator. ""I have nothing to hide. The 'you lot' comment never happened. Anyone trying to recollect words said 10 years ago will be fallible but I am adamant those words were not used. ""If Rafiq believes something was said at the time to upset him then that is what he believes. It is difficult to comment on that except to say it hurts me hugely to think I potentially affected someone. ""I take it as the most serious allegation ever put in front of me and I will fight to the end to prove I am not that person."" Rafiq, who was born in Pakistan and moved to England aged 10, played the majority of his career at Yorkshire, between 2008 and 2018, and captained the club in 2012. In September 2020,following an initial interview with Wisden,,externalRafiqtold ESPN Cricinfo,external""institutional racism"" encountered while at the club left him close to taking his own life. He told BBC Sporthe dreaded ""every second"" of his career and that a team-mate used a racially offensive term linked to his Pakistani heritage. Yorkshire launched a formal investigation into Rafiq's allegations in September 2020 and Hutton said the club would be carrying out a ""wider review"" of their ""policies and culture"". In August 2021, three days after Yorkshire received the findings of the independent report carried out by law firm Squire Patton Boggs, theyadmittedRafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" - something Rafiq said wasdownplaying racism- and offered him their ""profound apologies"". The report summary said Rafiq was the ""victim of racial harassment and bullying"", with seven of the 43 allegations upheld, although the club said they could not release the full report for legal reasons. They said there had been insufficient evidence to conclude the club was institutionally racist. Rafiq questionedwhat punishments had been handed out to former players and a coach who had been found guilty of using racist language. He also questioned the validity of the investigation. Former Yorkshire academy playersIrfan AmjadandTabassum Bhattihave since also shared their experiences of suffering racism while at the club. Yorkshire's independent whistleblowing hotline became operational on Monday, with Mohinderpal Sethi QC of Littleton Chambers appointed to lead the independent investigation process, which will consider any allegations that are lodged through the hotline.

Liverpool blast: What we know,"This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames A man who was killed outside Liverpool Women's Hospital on Remembrance Sunday when his homemade bomb went off has been identified as 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen. He was an asylum seeker born in Iraq who is understood to have converted to Christianity in 2017. Al Swealmeen was the passenger of the taxi destroyed in the blast. The driver, David Perry, did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Four men were arrested under the Terrorism Act, but have since been released from police custody without charge. Merseyside Police were called at 10:59 GMT on 14 November to reports of a car explosion at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The taxi carrying Al Swealmeen had pulled up to the hospital and exploded shortly afterwards. Al Swealmeen, who had been picked up from the Rutland Avenue area and asked to be taken to the hospital about 10 minutes away, died at the scene. This video can not be played Watch: Police say passenger brought explosive device into taxi On Monday Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said the passenger appeared to have made an improvised device that caused the explosion. He said officers investigating the incident could not ""at this time draw any connection"" with Remembrance Sunday events taking place near the hospital but he confirmed this was ""a line of inquiry"". Taxi driver David Perry has been discharged from hospital and his wife Rachel said it had been ""an utter miracle"" that he had escaped from the vehicle. Mr Jackson said he could not confirm reports Mr Perry had locked the doors of the taxi before the explosion. He said it appeared to have been an ""unremarkable journey"" to the hospital. Taxi driver David Perry has been discharged from hospital Pictures of a burning car outside the hospital have been widely shared on social media About two hours after the blast, properties on Rutland Avenue near Sefton Park, in the south-east of the city, and in the Kensington area, east of the city centre, were raided by armed officers. Three arrests took place in Sutcliffe Street, in Kensington, where witnesses reported seeing armed officers approach a terraced house. The second raid around Sutcliffe Street and the adjacent Boaler Street - about a mile from the hospital -  took place an hour later, at about 14:00 GMT. There was a heavy police presence, including police negotiators, outside the house on Rutland Avenue overnight. Police confirmed a controlled explosion had been carried out as a precaution in the Sefton Park area at about 16:00 GMT as part of the investigation but there was no wider risk to the public. Mr Jackson said officers had made ""significant progress"" and had a ""much greater understanding of the component parts of the device, how they were obtained and how the parts are likely to have been assembled"". He said following interviews with the arrested men, police were ""satisfied with the accounts they have provided"" and they were released from custody. Specialist officers were seen on Rutland Avenue The wreckage of the taxi was removed on Wednesday and specialist officers were expected to continue searches at the hospital into Thursday, said Mr Jackson. A post mortem on Al Swealmeen found the cause of death to be ""injuries sustained from the fire and explosion"", he said. Police have traced his next of kin who told them he was born in Iraq. ""Our inquiries have found that Al Swealmeen has had episodes of mental illness, this will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand,"" said Mr Jackson. He said they had not found any link to others in the Merseyside area but could not yet rule it out. Nick Aldworth, a former counter terror co-ordinator, said investigators would be focused on what happened inside the vehicle. ""I have to say from what I've seen there is very little blast damage - a lot of fire damage but very little blast damage. So whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn't work properly or was possibly an incendiary."" Emad Al Swealmeen during a service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, alongside Bishop Cyril Ashton Al Swealmeenbegan making purchases for his attack in April, counter-terror police said. Mr Jackson said the bomber had lived at a property in Sutcliffe Street for some time. And he began renting a property in Rutland Avenue in April. Police recovered ""significant items"" from his latest address, where searches have been taking place since Sunday. Al Swealmeen is not believed to have been known to MI5, according to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera. One of the members of his tribe in Jordan told the BBC that Al Swealmeen was Jordanian, but born in Iraq. His family settled in the United Arab Emirates in 1996. Al Swealmeen left for Syria 12 years ago, then headed to Turkey, eventually applying for asylum by claiming he was Syrian. The tribe member - who knows Al Swealmeen's father - said the attacker had a history of mental illness. Immigration records seen by the BBC show Al Swealmeen was first refused asylum in the UK in 2014. He challenged the decision, but in April 2015 a judge ruled the Home Office had been correct. In June 2015 he launched an attempt to overturn that decision, but that application was refused in August 2015 by the Upper Tier Tribunal - the court dedicated to immigration appeals. At that stage the case appears to have been closed - and by 2017 friends of Al Swealmeen in Liverpool understood his legal avenues had been exhausted. Whether the Home Office ordered him to leave the UK is not clear. During this period he turned to Christianity and became known locally as Enzo Almeni, a name he adopted as part of his conversion. Court records show that he then renewed his immigration appeal - under this alternative name - in January this year. His submissions were under review at the time of his death. A Christian couple,Elizabeth and Malcolm Hitchcott told ITV News that Al Swealmeen briefly lived with them,externalat their Liverpool home after his conversion to Christianity. Mr Hitchcott described him as a ""very quiet fellow"" who formally converted from Islam at a ceremony in Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral. Al Swealmeen is believed to have been baptised in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 - before the cathedral lost contact with him in 2018, according to the Diocese of Liverpool's communication's director, Stuart Haynes. The Reverend Mike Hindley said Al Swealmeen was involved in the Emmanuel Church in the Fazakerley area of Liverpool from 2017 to 2019, when they lost touch with him. A spokesman for the City of Liverpool College said Al Swealmeen was an adult cake decorating student at the college during the 2018-2019 academic year. In the years before the attack, Al Swealmeen was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for about six months because of his behaviour with a knife, Mr Hitchcott said. Al Swealmeen was described as a ""lovely guy"" by Mrs Hitchcott, who told the BBC ""we just loved him"", adding she was saddened and ""very shocked"" by Sunday's incident.

Jobs recovery continues despite end of furlough,"Job vacancies hit a fresh record high in October as employers continued to struggle with worker shortages, official figures show. The redundancy rate was also largely unchanged despite the end of the furlough scheme in September, making it even harder to fill empty posts. Employers report having to improve pay and benefits to attract new recruits. Yet one analyst warned the trend was likely to continue amid a shortage of younger workers and those over 50. According to the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS), there were 1.17 million job openings in October - almost 400,000 higher than before the pandemic. Moreover, some 2.2 million people started a new job between July and September, it said. Daniel Browne, who runs Blossom & Browne's Sycamore, a laundry service for London hotels, says trying to hire new staff has been ""horrific"" this year. He says Covid and Brexit have reduced his headcount from 140 to about 80, making it impossible to meet client needs. He has had to put up wages amid a ""price war"" for temporary staff, and improve pay and conditions for existing staff in order to retain them. ""We're trying to create a happier workforce,"" he told the BBC. ""We're starting at 8am, rather than 7am because that was the staff feedback we had. We're trying to raise our wage rates as much as we can and pass that cost onto our clients."" Some had thought a rise in redundancies after the furlough scheme ended would make it easier to fill the high number of vacancies. An estimated 1.1 million people were still on the job support scheme in its final days. Yet while redundancies rose slightly in the three months to September, the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, close to its pre-pandemic level. Moreover, there were 160,000 more workers on payrolls in October than September. ""It might take a few months to see the full impact of furlough coming to an end, as people who lost their jobs at the end of September could still be receiving redundancy pay,"" said Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS. ""However, October's early estimate shows the number of people on the payroll rose strongly on the month and stands well above its pre-pandemic level. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? What are my rights if I am made redundant? ""There is also no sign of an upturn in redundancies and businesses tell us that only a very small proportion of their previously furloughed staff have been laid off."" Angela Burns is another employer struggling to recruit in the current climate. She runs a group of four hotels across the Midlands and Gloucestershire, and has at least 20 vacancies, with chefs and housekeeping staff among the most difficult positions to fill. ""There's a huge demand out there for people to come to our hotels. The phones have been so busy, but we're having to close areas of the hotel because we don't have the staff to cope,"" she told the BBC. Angela said the recruitment process had been frustrating, and that many candidates ""just don't turn up for interview"". She added that people were looking for more than a just pay rise these days. ""It's about flexible working, it's fitting things in with their family, it's training, it's future career prospects as well,"" she said. Gerwyn Davies, an analyst for the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said employees were ""taking advantage of the tight 'job-seeker friendly' labour market [and] re-thinking their career priorities after the pandemic"". In response, he said employers needed to improve how they developed and retained staff, going ""beyond simply a competitive salary"". ""[It could] include the quality of line management, the availability of different types of flexible working arrangements and opportunities to develop new skills and progress,"" he said. The Institute for Employment Studies (IES), a think tank, said there was a huge ""participation gap"" in the labour force caused by older people not going back to work after losing their jobs, and more young people staying in education. It added that it expects the trend to continue. ""All told, we've nearly a million workers now missing from the labour market, and their absence is now holding back our recovery and adding to inflation,"" said IES director Tony Wilson. ""We're still doing nowhere near enough to help get people back into work, particularly for older workers, disabled people and parents."" October's strong jobs data appears to increase the likelihood that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from their record lows before the end of the year, as it seeks to tame inflation. The cost of living has increased sharply since the economy has reopened and is expected to hit as much as 5%, according to the Bank's forecasts. Bank of England sorry for rising cost of living Many analysts had expected the Bank to raise rates at its meeting earlier this month, but it chose to keep them on hold. On Monday, Bank governor Andrew Bailey told MPs it had been waiting for official data on the impact of the end of furlough before it made a move. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""If the next labour market release on 14 December tells a similar story, we think that will be enough to prompt the Bank to raise interest rates from 0.10% to 0.25% at the meeting on 16 December."" But others noted that the Bank may wait given that theUK's economic recovery slowed between July and Septemberdue to global supply chain problems. ""Uncertainty is not over yet,"" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.â¯â¯""We expect the Bank will wait with the first hike until February next year, but... an earlier move in December cannot be ruled out."" The Bank of England said last week that one of the reasons it didn't want to raise interest rates yet was because of the uncertainties in the labour market, not least because at the end of September there were still 1.1 million people on furlough. The fear has always been that that would translate into a big jump in unemployment. Today's figures provide some measure of reassurance about that, showing the number of payrolled employees rose sharply in October. The Bank is also keeping a close eye on upward pressures on inflation. While average earnings have been growing much faster than inflation, they've more recently slowed down, rising by 4.9% excluding bonuses on the latest figures. That's still faster than inflation but when you strip out distortions relating to the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics reckons it's closer to 3.4%. Given the official forecasts that inflation will get up above 4% next year and possibly as high as 5%, the big risk now looks to be less that pay growth might drive inflation up - and more that pay doesn't keep up with prices, dragging living standards down.

How the NHS is unravelling and why it won't stop,"Lives are being put at risk with record long waits in A&E units and 999 calls taking hours to be reached. The causes of this go beyond Covid - and with winter coming it looks set to get worse. Natalie Quinn's parents were active and enjoying life when the pandemic hit. Although her father, Jimmy, had been diagnosed with dementia, he was still driving, playing golf and attending groups organised by the Alzheimer's Society. But lockdown hit them hard. ""All my dad's activities stopped and he went downhill quickly,"" Ms Quinn, 54, says. ""My mum was looking after him, but it took its toll. She had to go into hospital and he went into a care home. ""It was meant to be temporary - but, of course, we couldn't see him. He deteriorated and never came out."" By February, Jimmy, 75, was dead. Natalie's mother's health worsened too. For years, she had been living with a rare blood marrow disorder. Now 77, she has spent the past six months in and out of hospital in Yeovil, their home town. ""I really believe if they could have remained active and living the life they had, it could be so different,"" Ms Quinn says. Natalie's family's story is being repeated across the country. When the pandemic hit, about a quarter of adults in the UK were living with chronic illnesses. With support and care disrupted and Covid making people more isolated and less active, their health has suffered. According to those working in the NHS, they are now turning up to hospital in ever greater numbers. And it is this as much as Covid that is driving the rise in demand on the NHS. At Newcastle's Royal Victoria Hospital, which allowed BBC News in to film this month, doctors and nurses are struggling. Alongside Covid cases, they are seeing more frail elderly people being admitted as well as significant numbers of people with alcohol and mental health-related problems. Like at nearly all hospitals, A&E waiting times have worsened and quality of care is suffering, with patients spending hours on trolleys because there are no beds available. ""It really breaks my heart to see - they are really vulnerable,"" senior sister Juliet Amos says. The concern is being felt at the very top of the organisation too. ""We are in such a tight spot, there is no room for manoeuvre,"" Dame Jackie Daniel says. ""It can't go on."" But this is not just about demand. It is also down to capacity - what the NHS can cope with. The service was struggling before the pandemic hit, with targets routinely missed in all parts of the UK. The NHS was being run ""at its limit"", Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, says. Feedback from his members now shows unprecedented levels of concern about the coming months. The health service, he believes,  is heading for the ""most difficult winter in its history"". This is not just about the past couple of years though - the situation has been a decade in the making. Between 2010 and 2019 the annual rises in spending on health were well below those traditionally given since the birth of the NHS. During that period, the Tories have been in power - albeit with the Lib Dems for the first five years. Although it is worth noting, in its 2010 and 2015 election manifestos, Labour was not proposing any tangibly higher increases in spending either. This parliament has seen a change - annual rises are now close to 4% - but the result of the squeeze in the 2010s is fewer doctors and nurses per head of population than our Western European neighbours. It meant the UK entered the pandemic in a ""vulnerable position"" when you combine both funding and population health, says Dr Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation, with less resilience to absorb a shock like a pandemic. And so the NHS has struggled like never before. The waiting times in A&E are now at their worst levels since records began, nearly 20 years ago. The deterioration is even more alarming in the ambulance service,as BBC News reported last week. Response times for emergency callouts for things such as heart attacks and strokes are taking three times longer than they should, with some patients waiting up to nine hours for help to arrive. A big part of the problem is the system is grinding to a halt. Ambulances are becoming stuck outside A&E for hours on end because there are no hospital staff available to hand their patients over to. That's because of bottlenecks inside the hospital. Wards are full and struggling to discharge patients even when they are medically fit to leave - because of a lack of available care in the community. So even when A&E patients are admitted, 30% wait longer than four hours for a bed. And that, in turn, leads to further overcrowding in A&Es, where a quarter of all patients wait longer than four hours to be seen. In one of the worst cases, a backlog of more than 20 ambulances was reported at one hospital. This can have dire consequences. An investigation is under way after a patient died following a cardiac arrest. They had spent five hours in the back of an ambulance outside Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Another death is being investigated in the East of England, after a call classed as immediately life threatening took an hour to reach. Such calls should be answered in seven minutes on average. The patient was found dead. The ambulance service said crews had been stuck in queues at local hospitals. ""Hospitals are full and running pretty much on one in and one out,"" a consultant in West Yorkshire, former Society for Acute Medicine president Dr Nick Scriven, says. And it seems little can be done to prevent the situation deteriorating as winter hits. The government is putting extra money in - but it will have limited effect without extra staff and they are simply unavailable, Dr Scriven says. ""We need to be frank with the public,"" he says. ""Some really difficult decisions will have to be made."" Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick Have you been affected by issues covered in this story?

Before we go, here's a reminder of the day's main headlines: Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Today's editor was Paul Gribben. The writers were Emma Harrison, Hamish Mackay, Adam Durbin and Joseph Lee. Amazon will pay a $500,000 (Â£370,000) legal settlement in the US over claims it failed to adequately inform its warehouse workers or public health officials about Covid-19 cases in the workplace. The corporation did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing the settlement, which comes under California's ""right to know"" rules that require employers to keep staff informed of potential Covid exposures. The state's attorney general Rob Bonta said Amazon workers had been left ""terrified and powerless"" and local public health bodies were often left ""unable to effectively track the spread of the virus"". The ruling applies only to California - where the company employs around 150,000 people - and must still be approved by a judge. Amazon said there was no change needed to how it notified workers if they are a close contact of a case, adding the issue was around the structure of bulk employee Covid-related notifications. Read more about the settlementhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Zhang Yujing A Chinese woman who was meant to be deported from
the US nearly two years ago has finally arrived back on home turf. Zhang Yujing was convicted of trespassing at
former President Trumpâs Mar-a-Lago Florida club in 2019. She had told the
court that she had âcome to meet the president and his family and make
friendsâ. She was sentenced to eight monthsâ imprisonment,
and completed her sentence in December 2019. Zhang was then transferred to
an immigration detention centre and was set to be deported. However, due to travel bans imposed during the
pandemic, she spent âthree times longer than her prison sentenceâ
in immigration custody. She finally left the US over the weekend, and
media in China are today calling her a âhaplessâ woman who experienced âa
prison disasterâ. State media were extremely critical when she was
originally sentenced. Global Times said in April 2019 that it was âshamefulâ
that she was treated like a âChinese spyâ. The Tesco advert shows Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass A Christmas advertisement for Tesco featuring Father Christmas with a Covid vaccine passport has prompted more than 3,000 complaints - making it the most complained about ad of the year so far. It shows the supermarket's customers determined to enjoy a proper Christmas celebration after last year's Covid-related restrictions. But in one scene a reporter tells viewers that Santa ""could be quarantined"" before cutting to Father Christmas presenting his Covid pass at border control, which proves he has been vaccinated so he can enter the country. An Advertising Standards Authority spokesman says: ""The large majority of complaints assert that the ad is coercive, and encourages medical discrimination based on vaccine status."" Tesco says it ""respects everyone's views"" adding it was a ""light-hearted"" campaign that had been ""well-received"". Belgium has seen almost 10,000 daily Covid cases in recent days (file pic) Staff in Belgium's health and social care sector have been told they will be fired if they fail to get Covid vaccinations by 1 April 2022. Anyone who has not yet had a jab by the new year will be moved away from frontline care and given three months to get vaccinated, under the proposed law. Like much of Europe, Belgium has seen a surge in cases and several areas are seeing record numbers of Covid hospital admissions. On Monday Austria imposed a lockdown on anyone who had not yet been vaccinated. Now Belgian ministers have reached agreement on compulsory jabs for thousands of care workers. ""It can't be right that there is still a small minority that haven't been vaccinated,"" said Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke. ""We're giving these people until 1 April next year to get themselves vaccinated."" US drug company Pfizer has penned a deal to allowits experimental Covid-19 treatment pillto be made and sold in 95 developing nations. The deal with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool not-for-profit could make the treatment available to 53% of the world's population. But it excludes several countries that have had large Covid-19 outbreaks, including Brazil. Pfizer says the pill lessens the risk of severe disease in vulnerable adults. The US company says the agreement will allow local medicine manufacturers to produce the pill ""with the goal of facilitating greater access to the global population"". You can read morehere. The UK has recorded a further 37,243 coronavirus cases in the latest 24-hour period, official government figures show. A further 214 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been recorded. That takes the total deaths by that measure to 142,945 since the start of the pandemic. Since October, adults in Scotland must demonstrate - if asked - they have had both doses of a Covid vaccine before they can get into certain venues and events. These include nightclubs, indoor events of 500 or more people and outdoor events of more than 4,000. It works through the use of the NHS Scotland Covid Status App, which generates a QR code on people's phones that can be scanned by venues, or through requesting a ""secure, uneditable"" paper record. For nightclubs and smaller events, everyone entering should be checked, but at larger events a ""reasonable number"" of spot-checks being carried out - in many cases around one in five people - is acceptable. You can read more about Scotland's vaccine passports schemehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been 11 local cases of Covid-19 reported in
China in the last 24 hours. Cases of the virus are subsiding since an outbreak began a
month ago; today, official media are only recording single-digit cases in the
countryâs provinces. Over the last month, the outbreak caused more than 1,000 cases of Covid-19, reaching two thirds of the countryâs
provincial-level regions. The majority of cases have been in the countryâs
north, where the temperature is currently below zero Celsius. More than 75% of Chinaâs population is fully vaccinated,
and booster jabs are under way in most major cities. However, as China has a
zero-Covid policy, strict measures remain in place to ensure that the virus
doesnât spread. It is routine for communities to lock down the moment a fresh
case of the virus is identified, and city-wide testing drives are
orchestrated. Currently, there are
enhanced Covid-19 measures at the countryâs land ports, and flights are being
limited into the capital city, Beijing. Plans are currently under way at many
universities to stagger the winter holidays of students, to prevent this
demographic travelling collectively at peak times. We have some reaction now to the announcement from Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon that the requirement for vaccine passports could be extended to other settings. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross accuses the government of having ""a total lack for respect for Scottish businesses"". He says: ""The government has delayed again, creating wholly avoidable uncertainty. Businesses are once again being left in the dark and treated as an afterthought. ""They might have less than two weeks to adapt to changes to the vaccine passport scheme at one of the busiest times of the year for the hospitality industry."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says ministers should commit to engaging with affected businesses and offer them financial support if new measures are introduced. Meanwhile in Wales, a government minister says there are ""no immediate plans"" to extend the nation's vaccine passport scheme to pubs and restaurants. However, Welsh finance minister Rebecca Evans did explain there is an ""ongoing discussion"" with the hospitality sector about what can be done to ""ensure that people are safe in those environments"". Currently, they are needed for anyone over 18 to get into nightclubs, large events, cinemas, theatres and concerts in Wales, after therules were extended yesterday. Covid passes are used to demonstrate if someone is fully vaccinated or has tested negative in the past 48 hours. Recent figures show Wales' case rate are up again after falling from a peak in October. It stands at 489 per 100,000 people over the seven days to 11 November, up from a low point of 476 on 7 November - but still lower than a week ago when it was 526. There has been a substantial rise in the number of obese children in England during the pandemic, data from NHS Digitalsuggests. In 2019-20, 10% of children were obese at the start of primary school, but in 2020-21 the figure was more than 14%. In the last year of primary school, it rose from 21% to over 25%. Rates were twice as high in the poorest areas. Experts say poverty, lockdowns and a rise in mental health problems will all have played a role. Once the proportion who are overweight is taken into account, 28% of those in reception were carrying excess weight, and 41% in year six. Scotland's vaccine passport scheme could be rolled out to cinemas, theatres and more hospitality venues from 6 December, Scotland's first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says a final decision will not be taken until next Tuesday. But she tells Holyrood that the rules may need to be tightened to get through winter without further restrictions. The passport scheme currently only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. But she says it could be expanded to other venues - possibly indoor cinemas, theatres and other indoors hospitality premises. She adds there will be exemptions, for weddings for example. It will be a ""challenging winter"", Sturgeon says, and she wants businesses to stay ""fully open"" over winter and Christmas. ""If an expansion of Covid certification can help us to do that, it would be irresponsible of us not to consider it."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is delivering an update on Covid measures. She says the cabinet has agreed to keep the current regulations in place, with no immediate changes to restrictions. However, she says continuing high Covid case numbers ""illustrate the need for continued precautions"". She adds that the Scottish government will implement the new advice that booster jabs should be offered to those aged 40 and over. Before we find out what rising case numbers might mean for day-to-day living in Scotland, a look at the latest coronavirus statistics gives a clear picture of where we are regarding case numbers, vaccination progress and hospitalisations. This graph shows a steady rise since the start of November. The vaccination programme is a central part of the Scottish government's coronavirus response. The current focus is on booster jabs and their rollout is running alongside the flu jab programme. This latest graph shows progress across all three doses of the vaccine. The full rundown of the latest statistics can be found here every day: Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Qatar has added the UK to its international travel red list, meaning even fully vaccinated travellers must stay in hotel quarantine for two days on arrival. Unvaccinated people arriving from the UK will be required to spend seven days quarantining in a hotel. The decision is likely to affect thousands of people planning to visit the popular winter sun destination. Along with the UK, another 20 countries were added to Qatar's red list, including Russia, Singapore, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. It comes after Morocco banned direct flights from the UK, Germany and the Netherlands on 20 October, amid high levels of Covid infections in all three countries. If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the main headlines: Munich has become the first major German city to cancel its Christmas market - an attraction that normally draws three million visitors a year. The city's mayor, Dieter Reiter, said the decision was a ""bitter blow"" but it would be irresponsible to go ahead. ""The dramatic
situation in our hospitals and the exponentially increasing infection figures
leave me no other choice,"" he said. Germany's Christmas markets are a much-loved tradition, with about 2,500 across the country drawing millions of visitors, who shop for seasonal trinkets among wooden chalets while sipping mulled wine. Like Munich some smaller markets have also been cancelled for the second year running, but other major cities are proposing requiring proof of vaccination, a recent negative test or natural immunity in order to attend. Infection rates in Germany are at their highest point yet during the pandemic, and there are concerns that too many people remain unvaccinated. Bavaria, the southern region where Munich is located, has among the highest rates of Covid, with over 540 infections per 100,000 people, compared to over 310 nationwide. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin says the country's Covid-19 infection rate ""will get worse before it gets better"" People in the Irish Republic who can work from home will be advised to do so from Friday, due to the country's rise in Covid-19 cases. The Irish government agreed that move as well as an earlier closing time of midnight for bars, restaurants and nightclubs at a meeting earlier today. Workers began to return to offices in September whenrestrictions were eased. But, amid a rise in cases, government health advisers have now suggested a return to home working. The earlier closing time for the hospitality sector will come into effect from Thursday at midnight. That reverses the return to normal opening hours on 22 October, which had brought an end to an 23:30 curfew. Another4,570 cases of coronavirus were reported in the Irish Republic on Monday, up from 3,805 on Sunday - and senior government figures fear further restrictions may be needed.

Jobs recovery continues despite end of furloughThe number of workers on payrolls rose in October despite the end of the job support scheme.,"Job vacancies hit a fresh record high in October as employers continued to struggle with worker shortages, official figures show. The redundancy rate was also largely unchanged despite the end of the furlough scheme in September, making it even harder to fill empty posts. Employers report having to improve pay and benefits to attract new recruits. Yet one analyst warned the trend was likely to continue amid a shortage of younger workers and those over 50. According to the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS), there were 1.17 million job openings in October - almost 400,000 higher than before the pandemic. Moreover, some 2.2 million people started a new job between July and September, it said. Daniel Browne, who runs Blossom & Browne's Sycamore, a laundry service for London hotels, says trying to hire new staff has been ""horrific"" this year. He says Covid and Brexit have reduced his headcount from 140 to about 80, making it impossible to meet client needs. He has had to put up wages amid a ""price war"" for temporary staff, and improve pay and conditions for existing staff in order to retain them. ""We're trying to create a happier workforce,"" he told the BBC. ""We're starting at 8am, rather than 7am because that was the staff feedback we had. We're trying to raise our wage rates as much as we can and pass that cost onto our clients."" Some had thought a rise in redundancies after the furlough scheme ended would make it easier to fill the high number of vacancies. An estimated 1.1 million people were still on the job support scheme in its final days. Yet while redundancies rose slightly in the three months to September, the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, close to its pre-pandemic level. Moreover, there were 160,000 more workers on payrolls in October than September. ""It might take a few months to see the full impact of furlough coming to an end, as people who lost their jobs at the end of September could still be receiving redundancy pay,"" said Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS. ""However, October's early estimate shows the number of people on the payroll rose strongly on the month and stands well above its pre-pandemic level. How do I find a new job and who is hiring? What are my rights if I am made redundant? ""There is also no sign of an upturn in redundancies and businesses tell us that only a very small proportion of their previously furloughed staff have been laid off."" Angela Burns is another employer struggling to recruit in the current climate. She runs a group of four hotels across the Midlands and Gloucestershire, and has at least 20 vacancies, with chefs and housekeeping staff among the most difficult positions to fill. ""There's a huge demand out there for people to come to our hotels. The phones have been so busy, but we're having to close areas of the hotel because we don't have the staff to cope,"" she told the BBC. Angela said the recruitment process had been frustrating, and that many candidates ""just don't turn up for interview"". She added that people were looking for more than a just pay rise these days. ""It's about flexible working, it's fitting things in with their family, it's training, it's future career prospects as well,"" she said. Gerwyn Davies, an analyst for the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said employees were ""taking advantage of the tight 'job-seeker friendly' labour market [and] re-thinking their career priorities after the pandemic"". In response, he said employers needed to improve how they developed and retained staff, going ""beyond simply a competitive salary"". ""[It could] include the quality of line management, the availability of different types of flexible working arrangements and opportunities to develop new skills and progress,"" he said. The Institute for Employment Studies (IES), a think tank, said there was a huge ""participation gap"" in the labour force caused by older people not going back to work after losing their jobs, and more young people staying in education. It added that it expects the trend to continue. ""All told, we've nearly a million workers now missing from the labour market, and their absence is now holding back our recovery and adding to inflation,"" said IES director Tony Wilson. ""We're still doing nowhere near enough to help get people back into work, particularly for older workers, disabled people and parents."" October's strong jobs data appears to increase the likelihood that the Bank of England will raise interest rates from their record lows before the end of the year, as it seeks to tame inflation. The cost of living has increased sharply since the economy has reopened and is expected to hit as much as 5%, according to the Bank's forecasts. Bank of England sorry for rising cost of living Many analysts had expected the Bank to raise rates at its meeting earlier this month, but it chose to keep them on hold. On Monday, Bank governor Andrew Bailey told MPs it had been waiting for official data on the impact of the end of furlough before it made a move. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""If the next labour market release on 14 December tells a similar story, we think that will be enough to prompt the Bank to raise interest rates from 0.10% to 0.25% at the meeting on 16 December."" But others noted that the Bank may wait given that theUK's economic recovery slowed between July and Septemberdue to global supply chain problems. ""Uncertainty is not over yet,"" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.â¯â¯""We expect the Bank will wait with the first hike until February next year, but... an earlier move in December cannot be ruled out."" The Bank of England said last week that one of the reasons it didn't want to raise interest rates yet was because of the uncertainties in the labour market, not least because at the end of September there were still 1.1 million people on furlough. The fear has always been that that would translate into a big jump in unemployment. Today's figures provide some measure of reassurance about that, showing the number of payrolled employees rose sharply in October. The Bank is also keeping a close eye on upward pressures on inflation. While average earnings have been growing much faster than inflation, they've more recently slowed down, rising by 4.9% excluding bonuses on the latest figures. That's still faster than inflation but when you strip out distortions relating to the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics reckons it's closer to 3.4%. Given the official forecasts that inflation will get up above 4% next year and possibly as high as 5%, the big risk now looks to be less that pay growth might drive inflation up - and more that pay doesn't keep up with prices, dragging living standards down.

Biden signs $1tn infrastructure bill into law,"US President Joe Biden has signed into law a $1.2tn (Â£894bn) spending bill, marking a legislative achievement for his administration. ""Today, we are finally getting this done,"" the Democrat told lawmakers from both major parties in a bill signing ceremony at the White House on Monday. The bill caused a rift in Mr Biden's party that was partly blamed for a Democratic election loss this month. Another massive social spending bill is currently being considered in Congress. ""My message to the American people is America is moving again. And your life is going to change for the better,"" Mr Biden said in a speech before signing the law. Billed as a ""once-in-a-generation"" infrastructure measure, the legislation pledges $550bn in new federal expenditure over the next eight years to upgrade highways, roads and bridges, and to modernise city transit systems and passenger rail networks. It also sets aside funding for clean drinking water, high speed internet, and a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging points. It is the largest federal investment in the country's infrastructure for decades. The law will be financed in several ways, including unspent emergency relief funds from the Covid pandemic, new taxes on cryptocurrency and other smaller sources. An infrastructure bill to fix more than US bridges Biden sees rebuilt roads as route to rout racism Five huge challenges for Joe Biden The other bill, known as the Build Back Better Act, still faces an uncertain future in Congress. Progressive Democrats had hoped to pass that bill alongside the infrastructure package, but faced resistance from moderates who asked that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) first release a forecast of how much it will add to the national debt. Earlier this month, Mr Biden denied that the Democrats' shock loss in the gubernatorial race in Virginia was a verdict on his presidency, butacknowledged that it would have been helpfulfor Congress to have passed the infrastructure and spending bills ahead of the vote. His explanation came amid rising discontent among voters over the party's struggle to pass major legislation, despite controlling both chambers of Congress, albeit narrowly.

Which MSPs have second jobs?,"The most prominent example of MSP ""double jobbing"" right now is Conservative leader Douglas Ross With Westminster in turmoil over the question of whether MPs should be allowed to hold second jobs, what is the situation at Holyrood? How many MSPs have reported income on top of their salary, and where is it coming from? Scandals about second jobs have been relatively few and far between at Holyrood. In 2019, even the suggestion that former Conservative leader Ruth Davidson might take up a paid post with a lobbying firm was enough to spark such an outcry thatshe changed her mind and turned the job down. Labour's Neil Findlay actually lodgeda members bill,externalseeking to ban MSPs from certain external jobs, but found relatively few supporters for it across the chamber - despite some sympathy from SNP and Green backbenchers. It may depend on what is categorised as a ""second job"", but at present fully one-third of MSPs - 45 of the 129 - have reported some kind of income above and beyond their Holyrood salary, including members of every party. In the vast majority of cases, the sums of money involved are not huge, and there are many caveats in terms of things like charitable donations and rental arrangements which actually make a loss. However, despite the fact that everything from gifts and funded overseas trips to heritable property and shares must be declared, it can sometimes be difficult to work out exactly how much money some members are making. As at Westminster, registers of interests are not neatly standardised. For example, most MSPs who own companies declare their commercial income as a gross figure, subject to unquantified costs and losses. Some spell out exactly how much they expect to withdraw for themselves, while others offer an estimate of how the pandemic has hit revenues. The same is true of those who rent out property. And adding another layer of complexity, some own a ""part-share"" in a house or firm, and then declare its gross income without detailing precisely what their cut of that might be. And while many MSPs have declared nothing at all, others have been so diligent that they have formally noted their party membership as a potential interest. SNP Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson is managing director of two firms The most prominent example of ""double jobbing"" right now isDouglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader who also serves as MP for Moray. This kind of dual mandate is not particularly unusual. Holyrood has specific rules for just such an occurrence, which mean Mr Ross's MSP salary is reduced, and he donates it to charity - even if he did apparentlyforget to register it with the Westminster authorities. There are also 17 other MSPs who currently hold another elected position - alllocal councillors, and members who were elected to Holyrood for the first time in May. This includes11 SNP members, four Conservatives and two from Labour. Most of these new MSPs have indicated they will be stepping down from their council jobs when local elections roll around in 2022 - presumably to avoid forcing a round of costly by-elections this close to the end of term, although a few former councillors did quit after becoming MSPs in May. And many - although not all - say they will be donating their Â£18,000 salary to charity now that they are receiving a larger salary from parliament. A number of MSPs havecompany directorships- although in many cases with the firms they ran themselves before entering politics. In many cases, these firms are essentially dormant; for example the SNP's Constitution SecretaryAngus Robertsonis managing director of two firms, focused on opinion polling and management consultancy, but says he ""will not undertake any work"" for them having now become an MSP. Among active directorships, the biggest earners are Conservative MSPs - like Aberdeenshire West representativeAlexander Burnett, who owns an estate and is listed as the beneficiary of a pair of trusts which add up to more than Â£30m in value. He has a number of company directorships, the most lucrative being of his own AJA Burnett Estate, which encompasses various agricultural, residential and commercial lettings as well as forestry and sporting interests, and generates a gross annual income of up to Â£580,000. Mr Burnett stated that he expected to withdraw up to Â£180,000 from the firm in 2021-22 - a reasonably rare example of the register being clear about exactly how much money an MSP expects to take home from their business. Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie lets out a flat in Portugal Another Tory MSP,Donald Cameron, owns the Achnacarry Estate in the Highlands - the ancestral seat of Clan Cameron. The estate had income of between Â£830,000 and Â£840,000 last year, with a range of interests from residential, holiday and crofting lets to renewable energy, telecoms and deerstalking. However, Mr Cameron noted this gross figure does not take account of costs and losses to the business, leaving it unclear what the overall level of profit - if any - might have been. In previous years' register entries he has stated that he was not in receipt of any taxable income from the estate, but there is no mention of this on the current register. Mr Cameron is also a non-executive director of the Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust, which pays him between Â£25,000 and Â£30,000 to attend five half-day board meetings per year. He had a similar role with another investment firm, the Murray Income Trust, with the same recorded pay and hours, before retiring on 2 November 2021. Beyond those with large estates, there are a lot of landlords at Holyrood. A total of 24 different MSPs have declaredproperty holdings, from flats to commercial premises to farmland. These properties are scattered across Scotland and beyond - Labour's deputy leaderJackie Baillielets out a flat in Portugal - and range in scale fromRhoda Grant'sone-sixth share of a house in Lewis toEdward Mountain'scollection of cottages in Moray. Letting out a flat may not be a ""second job"" in the traditional sense of requiring regular working hours. But it does mean there is a sizable bloc of MSPs who have an interest to declare when the parliament is considering live issues like rent controls or regulating short-term lets. In terms of the rents being charged, none of the sums involved is particularly staggering. Indeed, a handful of members say their properties yield so little money that they don't turn a profit. Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton sub-lets part of his home on Airbnb. For example, Net Zero SecretaryMichael Mathesonsays he owns a house in the Highlands that generates an income of between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000 a year, but that ""it does not make a profit due to running costs"". It doesn't even need to be a whole property - Lib Dem leaderAlex Cole-Hamiltonbrings in between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000 a year sub-letting part of his home on Airbnb. At the other end of the hospitality scale, two MSPs ownhotelswith their partners. Both ToryRachael Hamiltonand the SNP'sEmma Harperhost guests in the south of Scotland - although Ms Hamilton paid her Â£2,000 of dividends straight back into the company last year, while Ms Harper only takes Â£3,000 in remuneration from her guest house. Ms Harper also volunteers as a nurse, and is not the only MSP working in the health service - Conservative health spokesmanSandesh Gulhaneworks one day a week as aGP. These are of course the kind of ""second jobs"" that politicians routinely point to in defence when the issue comes up - worthy endeavours which contribute both to society and to parliament's collective understanding of a crucial field like primary care. Meanwhile three MSPs also receiveroyalties from booksthey wrote prior to being elected, including Green MSPAriane Burgessand SNP ministers Angus Robertson andJenny Gilruth- who wrote a school textbook in her previous life as a teacher.

Rents rising at fastest pace in 13 years - report,"Rents are rising at the fastest pace since 2008 as people rush back to city centres, according to property website Zoopla. Private sector rents in the UK were 4.6% higher in September than a year before at Â£968 per month on average - the strongest growth seen in 13 years. Outside of London, rents were up by 6%, marking a 14-year high, it said. Zoopla said it was partly down to higher demand for city living amid limited supply. Rents are up most in the South West (9%) year-on-year, followed by Wales (7.7%) and the East Midlands (6.9%). As lockdown restrictions have eased and businesses have reopened in city centres, there has been a marked return to more built-up areas, it suggested. 'Eviction risk' for universal credit renters Rents price us out of city, says van-living woman Cornwall home renters say action is still needed Rents in London are now starting to increase as people return to the office. In its latest report, Zoopla said the English capital saw prices increase by 1.6% annually, compared with falls of nearly 10% around the start of the year. Although rents in local areas can fluctuate significantly from month to month, cities such as Bristol and Nottingham also saw the average tenants' bill go up by more than 8% in the year to September. Zoopla said demand for rented properties is still outstripping supply, putting upward pressure on prices. Grainne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla, said that the popularity of homes in higher price bands was also contributing. ""Households looking for the flexibility of rental accommodation, especially students and city workers, are back in the market after consecutive lockdowns affected demand levels in major cities. ""Meanwhile, just as in the sales market, there is still a cohort of renters looking for properties offering more space, or a more rural or coastal location."" There's tough competition for views like these - rents in Purbeck in Dorset were up by 16.2% annually. And with fewer people made unemployed during the pandemic than had been expected, rents are expected to rise further in 2022. By the end of next year, rents are forecast to rise by another 4.5%. Dan Wilson Craw, Deputy Director of campaign group Generation Rent, said the new report was ""terrible news"" for anyone trying to move right now. ""We have been hearing from renters who have lost bidding wars for homes, or failed affordability checks, so are being priced out of their areas,"" he said. He added that since the pandemic, private renters were more likely to be getting housing support through the welfare system. ""But the chancellor has frozen rates for another year, so these rises will make it even harder to find an affordable home. The government has to do much more to bring rents down - that means building more homes, including social housing,"" he said. At last month's Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced almost Â£2bn would be invested by the government into building new homes on derelict or unused land in England.

The moment taxi explodes,"David Perry has been discharged from hospital The wife of a taxi driver who survived an explosion inside his cab has said he is ""lucky to be alive"". David Perry was injured when a homemade bomb exploded shortly after he pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital on Sunday morning. The passenger, who is believed to have brought the device into the taxi, died at the scene. Mr Perry's wife Rachel said it had been ""an utter miracle"" that he had escaped from the vehicle. Posting on Facebook, she said she felt ""some guardian angels"" had been looking over him. Ms Perry also thanked the ""amazing staff, doctors and nurses"" at the hospital and the police officers and detectives ""who have been looking after us"". The explosion has since beendeclared as a terrorist incident. This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames Mr Perry picked up a fare in the Rutland Avenue area of Liverpool and was asked to be taken to the hospital, about 10 minutes away, police said. As the taxi arrived at the hospital's drop-off area just before 11:00 GMT, it exploded and Mr Perry escaped the car seconds before it was engulfed in flames. ""He is without a doubt lucky to be alive,"" Ms Perry said. ""The explosion happened whilst he was in the car and how he managed to escape is an utter miracle."" Man killed in Liverpool hospital blast named Liverpool explosion: What we know so far Hospital open for patients amid tightened security Russ Jackson, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said he had spoken to Mr Perry who was still ""shaken and injured"" but had yet to receive his full account of what happened.

Biden and Xi Jinping hold virtual meeting,"This video can not be played These were the most substantial discussions both leaders have had since Mr Biden took office Chinese President Xi Jinping has used a virtual summit with US counterpart Joe Biden to warn that encouraging Taiwanese independence would be ""playing with fire"". The talks are the most substantial since Mr Biden took office in January. Both sides emphasised the two men's personal relationship and the summit was an attempt to ease tensions. But they could not escape one of the most sensitive topics: the self-ruled island of Taiwan. China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland one day. The US recognises and has formal ties with China. But it has also pledged to help Taiwan defend itself in the event of an attack. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? China's state-run Global Times said Mr Xi blamed recent tensions on ""repeated attempts by the Taiwan authorities to look for US support for their independence agenda as well as the intention of some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China"". ""Such moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt,"" it said. The White House said Mr Biden ""strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait"". The leaders spoke to each other virtually Despite the strong words on Taiwan, the meeting began with both leaders greeting each other warmly, with Mr Xi saying he was happy to see his ""old friend"" Mr Biden. Mr Biden said the two had ""always communicated with one another very honestly and candidly,"" adding ""we never walk away wondering what the other man is thinking"". Mr Xi said the two countries needed to improve ""communication"" and face challenges ""together"". ""Humanity lives in a global village, and we face multiple challenges together. China and the US need to increase communication and co-operation."" said Mr Xi. The world's two most powerful nations do not see eye-to-eye on a number of issues, and Mr Biden raised US concerns about human rights abuses in Hong Kong and against Uyghurs in the north-west region of Xinjiang. China accuses the US of meddling in its domestic affairs. On trade, Mr Biden highlighted the ""need to protect American workers and industries from the PRC's [People's Republic of China's] unfair trade and economic practices"". Mr Xi also appeared to have made a strong comment on the issue, with Reuters reporting that he had told Mr Biden that the US needed to stop ""abusing the concept of national security to oppress Chinese companies"". Climate change was also discussed. Last week the two sprung a surprise by issuing a joint declaration to address climate change, at talks in Glasgow, Scotland. This was the third time the two leaders have spoken since Mr Biden's inauguration in January. The talks lasted three-and-a-half hours, longer than expected. Mr Xi has not left China in nearly two years, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The China-US relationship is crucial to both parties and the wider world, with Beijing having called repeatedly on the new administration in Washington to improve relations which deteriorated under Mr Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump. Both men are facing domestic concerns, with Mr Biden's poll numbers slumping in the face of inflation, the threat of coronavirus and the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr Xi is tackling energy shortages and a property crisis. That this meeting has happened at all between the world's two most powerful leaders tells you that both sides believe that the previous open hostility between Beijing and Washington wasn't working for either of them and was potentially dangerous. Their relationship had become so toxic and so dysfunctional that these video discussions have been, in part, an attempt to ensure that competition between China and the US didn't drift into armed conflict due to a misunderstanding at a global hotspot. On the one hand, we should probably be pretty happy they they're steering away from war before it can happen but, on the other, it is quite something that they have felt the need to do so. In fact, if you see the optics at this conference this is the warmest things have appeared for a long time with Chinese and US leaders. These efforts to make the discussions cordial with waving, talk of ""the global village"" and ""humanity's challenges"" was a far cry from the meltdown in Alaska this March when senior representatives from both administrations ended up sledging one another in public. This does appear to be a genuine attempt at a reset and we should actually expect this to alter global geopolitical relations in a concrete way.
