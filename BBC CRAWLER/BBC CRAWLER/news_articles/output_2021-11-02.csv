Shipping boss: Christmas 'safe' from shortages,"Maersk's CEO says a shortage of labour is the biggest reason for supply chains problems Christmas trading will be safe from supply chain problems, the boss of shipping firm Maersk has told the BBC - adding, ""at least that's what I'm hearing from our customers"". The company handles almost 20% of the world's shipping containers. Chief executive Soren Skou, said the firm is chartering more ships, keeping ports open longer and has opened more warehouses to help. The firm is doing ""everything"" it can to alleviate the problems, he said. There have beenrecent warnings in the UK and the USthat logjams at ports will lead to shortages at Christmas. Mr Skou said that a shortage of workers in the ports to unload ships and a lack of truckers was behind the problems. A Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. That number includes thousands of drivers from European Union (EU) member states who were previously living and working in the UK. There are also shortages across Europe and the US. Mr Skou estimated that approximately 300 large container ships around the world are sitting waiting outside ports. Almost 80 of these, he added, were in Los Angeles, with a ""few"" outside Felixstowe and others stuck by Chinese ports including Shanghai and Ningbo. Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays LA port to open round the clock to tackle queues Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Maersk CEO Soren Skou says the world's biggest shipping firm is doing everything it can to ease supply chain problem This widespread congestion was triggered by a collapse in demand during the early stages of the pandemic. That was followed by a period of frantic activity, as people who were forced to stay at home rather than travel or socialise, ordered large quantities of consumer goods. Mr Skou, who runs the world's biggest shipping firm, said this shows no sign of easing: ""The reality is that consumer demand is strong and at the same time our customers inventories are low."" ""They both need to serve the consumer here and now, but also rebuild inventories and that's why we have an unprecedented demand situation"". The demand has meant Maersk and other shipping companies have been able to charge record prices. The Danish company's pre-tax profits rose fivefold to $5.9bn for the July to September period. Last week Japanese cargo line Ocean Network Express reported a more than eight fold jump in profits for the same period, to $4.2bn. One of UK's biggest toy retailers, The Entertainer,recently warned delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas. In the US, the port of Los Angeles hasstarted operating 24 hours a dayto clear a backlog of cargo ships which has led to shortages. White House officials warned that there ""will be things that people can't get"" during the holiday season, despite President Biden appointing a bottlenecks Czar. Simon Heaney of the maritime research firm Drewry, said Maersk's mitigations might not be enough. Mr Heaney explained that ""port congestion is worsening while the number of ships waiting outside major ports around the world is increasing"". The brief closure of some big container terminals due to China's coronavirus restrictions, extreme weather events and a rise in the Delta variant of coronavirus, are each playing a part Mr Heaney said. Mr Heaney added that opening ports for longer won't help if there aren't enough staff to run them. Ports including Los Angeles have many cargo ships waiting to unload 90% of global trade is moved by sea and with demand having shown no sign of easing, the shipping industry is looking to tackle its impact on climate change. It's responsible for about 2% of carbon emissions, meaning that if the industry was a country it would be the sixth biggest polluter, above Germany. The UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is aiming for a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. As world leaders meet to tackle climate change in Glasgow Mr Skou was critical of the targets set by the UN body that oversees his industry: ""The ambition level at the IMO so far has been quite limited"". ""We as Maersk certainly are pushing hard for that to be reducing by 100% in 2050 and we believe it can be done"". Shipping industry calls for new global carbon tax Summit aims for clean-up of shipping industry $5bn fund unveiled for climate-friendly shipping Shipping is responsible for about 2% of global emissions and is under pressure to cut them On Monday at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: ""We urge the IMO to take action to set ambitious targets to achieve zero emission shipping by 2050"". ""Carbon-neutral shipping is vital to reaching our climate goals,"" he added. Shipping was not included in the Paris climate agreement. The International Chamber of Shipping has backed a $5bn fund to develop carbon free shipping and overcome a lack of investment in the technology required. Maersk plans to launch the world's first carbon neutral cargo ship in 2023. However, Mr Skou said the slow progress doesn't mean we need to move fewer goods around the world to tackle climate change. ""I think we just have to get to the point that we can use different fuels,"" he added. Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays Why are so many ships queuing to get to the US?

Netflix launches first games for subscribers,"Netflix is launching its first games worldwide as it seeks to break into the game subscription market. Starting Tuesday, the company will roll out updates to its Netflix app on Android smartphones, showing what games are available for download. To begin with, five mobile games are included for Netflix subscribers. The company is promising more to come - with no adverts in the game and no in-app purchases like those common in other mobile games. Of the five games launching with the service, two are linked to the streaming giant's popular Stranger Things series: Stranger Things: 1984 Stranger Things 3: The Game Card Blast Teeter Up Shooting Hoops ""While this is just the beginning of a long journey, we're excited to provide a gaming experience that is differentiated from what is available today -  exclusive mobile games with no ads, no in-app payments, included with your Netflix membership,"" the company said. While the initial games have relatively simple graphics and casual gameplay, Netflix says it is in very early stages, but plans to eventually create games ""for every kind of player"". Games will appear inside the Netflix app on supported devices ""Whether you're craving a casual game you can start from scratch, or an immersive experience that lets you dig deeper into your favourite stories, we want to begin to build a library of games that offers something for everyone,"" wrote Mike Verdu, the company's head of game development. Mr Verdu was a major hire for Netflix, having worked at games giant EA and later at Facebook, where he worked on augmented and virtual reality. This week's release is only for Android phones and tablets. Netflix said that games would come to iOS devices ""in the coming months"". Apple has previously resisted attempts by other companies to put ""stores inside stores"" - particularly around gaming. Squid Game helps Netflix subscriptions pick up Netflix: Four things which have driven its success When Microsoft initially launched its Game Pass streaming service in 2020, Apple blocked the app from appearing in the iPhone App Store, arguing that the roughly 100 games included should all be listed in its store individually. Microsoft eventually resorted to streaming through Apple's mobile Safari browser instead. Netflix did not say it was facing any similar issues with Netflix Games, saying that Android arriving first was down to the launch being ""still in its early stages"". Despite the delay in reaching Apple customers, Microsoft has become the dominant figure in the game subscription market to date. Its Xbox Game Pass service includes most of Microsoft's own game studio releases on the day they go on sale, many of which can be played on an Xbox, a gaming computer, or streamed over the internet to phones and tablets. It is estimated to have tens of millions of subscribers paying between Â£7.99 and Â£10.99 a month, depending on the features they need.

UK firms forced to plan for low-carbon future,"Most big UK firms and financial institutions will be forced to show how they intend to hit climate change targets, under proposed Treasury rules. By 2023, they will have to set out detailed public plans for how they will move to a low-carbon future - in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero target. An expert panel will set the standards the plans need to meet to ensure they are not just spin. Any commitments will not be mandatory. Green groups say this is not enough. Net zero is when a business or a country achieves an overall balance between the amount of carbon it is emitting and the carbon that it's removing from the atmosphere. Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit Firms and their shareholders will be left to decide how their businesses adapt to this transition, including how they intend to decarbonise. And although the plans will need to be published, the government said ""the aim is to increase transparency and accountability"" and the UK was not ""making firm-level net-zero commitments mandatory"". The market will decide whether firms' plans are credible, the Treasury said. Speaking at the COP26 climate summit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak claimed the UK was leading the world in becoming the ""first-ever net zero aligned global financial centre"". He said the changes would mean: ""Better and more consistent climate data; sovereign green bonds; mandatory sustainability disclosures; proper climate risk surveillance; and proper global reporting standards."" In total, 450 firms controlling 40% of global financial assets - equivalent to $130tn (Â£95tn) - have agreed to commit to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. What does net zero mean? Green investing: How your savings can fight climate change However, campaign group Global Witness said that without regulation the pledges were ""doomed to fail"". ""Banks and financiers are the lifeblood of the fossil fuel companies and destructive agribusinesses fuelling the climate crisis - so it's right that focus should be on them at COP26. ""However, today's announcement by banks risks amounting to more greenwashing if it's not legally binding,"" said Veronica Oakeshott, head of forests policy and advocacy at Global Witness. David Barmes, senior economist at the campaign group Positive Money, said the intention was positive, but that financial firms were still ""pouring billions into environmentally harmful projects."" Mark Campanale, founder and executive chair of Carbon Tracker Initiative, praised the ambition of the plans, but said details of how it would work were still unclear. ""None of the financial assets announced are currently aligned with net-zero and no group of companies can say they are meeting the Paris target by continuing to invest in fossil fuels, so that needs to change considerably before London can be lauded as the world's first net-zero financial centre and a model for the world,"" he said. Shaun Spiers, executive director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said that more UK public sector funding was needed. ""Private sector investment is vital, but it will be much easier to achieve on the back of serious investment by the chancellor,"" he said. However, a coalition of finance groups led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney said there was enough finance committed to keep global warming to 1.5C. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) said more than $130trn (Â£95trn) of private capital ""is now committed to transforming the economy for net zero"". In practice, this means that bank loans which would go to an oil field, or a coal mine, are diverted to renewable energy or to a mortgage product that subsidises highly efficient homes. Bank bosses will also be expected to have tough conversations with their customers who want to build coal power stations, pulling funding in advanced nations now, and developing countries beyond the next decade. Can COP26 really save the planet? What's the climate impact of private jets at COP26? Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate figures? Under the proposed Treasury rules, financial institutions and companies with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange must come up with net-zero transition plans, which will be published from 2023. The strategies will need to include targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and steps which firms intend to take to get there. A taskforce made up of industry leaders, academics, regulators and civil society groups will set a science-based ""gold standard"" for the plans in order to guard against so-called ""greenwashing"" - where environmental initiatives are more about marketing than substance. However, the government said there was ""not yet a commonly agreed standard for what a good quality transition plan looks like,external"". Meanwhile, Mr Sunak also pledged that a target for developed countries to send $100bn (Â£720m) a year to those that are less developed - to help support their transition to net zero - will be achieved by 2023. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change Alison Rose, chief executive of Natwest, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the bank had started measuring the emissions on its balance sheet to help it track progress, saying ""transparency was critical"". She said the bank was working with the oil and gas industry ""to develop credible transition plans so we can track progress and work with our customers"". But Ms Rose said its main focus was helping small firms where there were ""real business opportunities"" in ""adopting sustainable supply chain [and] sustainable business practices"". Kay Swinburne, vice-chairman of financial services at KPMG UK, said the announcement on UK firms would provide the financial services industry with a ""valuable set of unified metrics to measure progress towards decarbonisation"". ""It is brave to put a gold standard in place for all companies raising funding,"" she added. And Dr Ben Caldecott, director of the UK Centre for Greening Finance and Investment, said the plans would ""spur demand for green finance and accelerate decarbonisation, not just in the UK but wherever UK firms do business"". Follow the money to net zero. That is the plan unveiled today, with two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130tn, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5C. This means that the giant laser beam of global finance will be fired towards technologies that lower and eradicate carbon emissions, and away from ""brown holdings"" of investments in coal, oil and gas. But can such fundamental ecological, economic and social change really be achieved more through financial carrot than by regulatory stick? This position suits politicians who don't necessarily want to tell their voting public to consume or travel less than they are used to. By changing the financial system, their hope is that the trajectory of every economic sector, from energy to transport, food to clothing, how we live, work and what we consume will decarbonise of their own accord.

Two dead after fall at Abba tribute concert,"The tragic incident happened shortly before an Abba tribute concert in Sweden Two people have died and another has been injured after a man fell seven floors at a concert hall in Sweden. Around 1,000 people had gathered at the Uppsala Konsert & Kongress hall near the capital, Stockholm, for an Abba tribute concert on Tuesday evening. But 30 minutes before the show was due to begin, the man fell and landed in the open foyer on the ground floor. He landed on two people, police said. He died and one of the people he hit was fatally injured. The third person was left with non-life threatening injuries and was taken to hospital. None of the victims have been named by police but the man who fell was said by police to be in his 80s and the other man in his 60s. ""We received a call about someone having either jumped or fallen from a high altitude,"" police spokesman Magnus Jansson Klarin told the AFP news agency. He said officers were working to establish what exactly had happened, adding that it was too early to say whether a crime had occurred. The concert hall was initially closed by police so witnesses at the scene could be questioned. MTLive, the events company that organised the show, wrote on their Facebook page that ""everyone is in shock"". ""Unfortunately, we have to announce that a terrible event has happened. What we know is that someone jumped [or] fell high in the arena and hit other people,"" the company said. ""Right now we don't know much more, everyone is in shock,"" it added. The tragic incident comes just days before Abba are due to release their first new album in more than 40 years on Friday.

Peers demand changes to pension triple lock freeze,"The government has been defeated in the House of Lords over its one-year suspension of the ""triple lock"" formula to increase the state pension. Ministers plan to temporarily break the link between pensions and the rise in earnings, breaching a manifesto pledge. It followed concern that a post-pandemic rise in average wages would have meant pensions increasing by 8%. Peers voted to restore a link with earnings. But MPs could still go on to reject their amendment. The House of Lords backed an amendment by former Tory pensions minister Baroness Altmann to the law required to suspend the triple lock, by 220 votes to 178. It will set up a vote in the House of Commons, where the government will have to decide whether to order its MPs to oppose her plan. Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year What's the pension triple lock and why's it being suspended? State pension age hits 66 and set to rise further Under the triple lock, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5%, whichever is the greater. However, the government announced plans to suspend this for one year from April 2022, before restoring it. Instead, the rise will be the consumer inflation rate or 2.5%, whichever is higher. It came after the exceptional circumstances of the Covid pandemic meant earnings between May and July were set to rise by more than 8%. Announcing the move in September, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said it would ensure pensioners did not ""unfairly"" benefit from a ""statistical anomaly"". She argued that ""would not be fair"" during a period when the government had taken ""difficult decisions"" such as freezing public sector pay. Under Lady Altmann's amendment, the government would have to continue to link pensions to an adjusted version of the official earnings figure. She has said this would be around 5%. Ahead of the vote on her plan, she said the government's plan to suspend the triple lock would set a ""seriously dangerous precedent"". ""Pensioners are not a cash machine for chancellors to take money from when wanting to fund other projects or tax cuts elsewhere, especially not in the eye of a cost-of-living storm,"" she said. ""Yes, this is for one year only, but what a year to choose to do this, while older people are facing a cost of living crisis and the protection they rely on is being removed."" In response, Work and Pensions minister Baroness Stedman-Scott said the suspension was for one year only, and the commitment to restore the triple lock after that ""remains in place"". MPs endorsed the government's suspension of the triple lock, when they voted on the bill to enforce it in September. Labour and SNP MPs put forward amendments requiring the government to review its impact on pensioner policy, but these were defeated. MPs could reject the Lords' amendment on the grounds of financial privilege, which gives the Commons primacy on issues relating to tax and spending.

Facebook to end use of facial recognition software,"Facebook has announced it will no longer use facial recognition software to identify faces in photographs and videos. There have been growing concerns about the ethics of facial recognition technology, with questions raised over privacy, racial bias, and accuracy. Regulators had not yet provided a clear set of rules over how it should be used, the company said. It has faced a barrage of criticism over its impact on its users. Until now, users of the social media app could choose to opt in to the feature which would scan their face in pictures and notify them if someone else on the platform had posted a picture of them. In a blog post, Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at the firm said: ""Amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate."" TikTok pays out in lawsuit over facial recognition Watchdog voices live facial recognition concerns Facebook is making hate worse, whistleblower says In 2019, a US government study suggested facial recognition algorithms were far less accurate at identifying African-American and Asian faces compared to Caucasian faces. African-American women were even more likely to be misidentified, according to the study conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Last year, Facebook also settled a long-running legal dispute about the way it scans and tags photos. The case has been ongoing since 2015, and it was agreed the firm would pay $550m (Â£421m) to a group of users in Illinois who argued its facial recognition tool was in violation of the state's privacy laws. Other tech firms such as Amazon and Microsoft have both suspended facial recognition product sales to police as the uses for the technology have become more controversial. Facebook, which as well as running the world's largest social media network also owns Instagram and the messaging service Whatsapp, has come under growing pressure from regulators and politicians. It is facing increased scrutiny from regulators including the US the Federal Trade Commission, which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices. And last month, a former employee accused the company of unethical behaviour. Frances Haugen released a cache of internal documents which she said showed Facebook had put profit before user safety. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerburg said Ms Haugen's claims were part of a co-ordinated effort to ""paint a false picture"" of the company. The firm recently announced a new name, Meta, for the broader parent company following a series of negative stories about Facebook. Mr Zuckerberg said the existing brand could not ""possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future"" and needed to change.

Tributes to three paddleboarders who died in river,"Nicola Wheatley, Paul O'Dwyer and Morgan Rogers are named as the three people who died Tributes have been paid to three people who died while paddleboarding in a Welsh river at the weekend. They have now been named as Morgan Rogers, 24, from Merthyr Tydfil, Nicola Wheatley, 40, from Pontarddulais, Swansea, and Paul O'Dwyer, 42, from Sandfields, Neath Port Talbot. A woman also remains in a critical condition in hospital, police said. They had been part of a group of nine on an excursion exploring the River Cleddau in Haverfordwest on Saturday. A further five people were pulled out of the river by emergency services, but had no injuries. Police officer one of paddleboarders in fatal incident Tribute to paddleboarder after three die in river The family of Miss Rogers, a deputy store manager at a supermarket, said: ""Morgan was a beautiful, kind and loving soul, beloved by all who have been touched by her warm smile and her caring personality. ""Morgan was never happier than when she was in the outdoors doing what she loved and spending time with her family. ""She will be greatly missed by her family and friends and all those she has known along the way. Morgan will always be in our hearts and our memories. We will miss her dearly."" Morgan was a deputy store manager at a supermarket Morgan was described as ""the best that she could be"". Her family added she would be missed by her mother, father, Rhys, Harry, Holly and Katy"". The family of Nicola Wheatley, a mother, said they were ""devastated by our loss"", adding: ""Nicola was a beautiful, caring, considerate and funny person. She was amazing in every way. ""She has left a void in our lives that will never be filled."" She worked for the Cardiff and Vale health board as a specialist in poisons information, providing advice to healthcare professionals managing poisoned patients. Nicola was a loving mother, daughter, daughter-in-law and wife, her family say A statement from colleagues described her as a ""gifted and dedicated scientist"" who made significant contributions to the field of toxicology and presented her work at an international level. ""She will be remembered for her calm, friendly and totally professional manner - even when faced with the most difficult of cases,"" they said. ""Through her lovely personality, Nikki made many friends during her time in public service and will be sorely missed by her friends and colleagues."" One of those on the trip, Vickie Mckinven from Milford Haven, said Mr O'Dwyer died attempting to rescue two fellow paddleboarders who had got into difficulty near the weir. The family of Mr O'Dwyer said he ""gave his life to save others"", describing him as a ""devoted husband, father, son and brother"". Paul O'Dwyer completed the London Marathon and Ironman Wales, among many other achievements ""He devoted his life to contributing to society in his many adventures in raising money for different causes,"" his family said. ""Paul was a water baby. His passion for the water started with Aberavon lifeguards from an early age. ""His sporting prowess extended to many different sports. He was an Army surfing champion, British Army seven-a-side rugby team member, Aberavon Green Stars rugby player, ski instructor and completed multiple times in British and Welsh Three Peaks events."" The group were from the South Wales Paddle Boarders and Salty Dog Co, an organisation based in Port Talbot. The River Cleddau remained swollen in Haverfordwest on Sunday morning Ms Mckinven said she had pulled out of the morning paddle because she was concerned about the weather conditions. In a statement read outside Haverfordwest Police Station, Det Ch Insp Jonathan Rees, of Dyfed-Powys Police, revealed the nine people got into difficulties after reaching the weir near Quay Street.

Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions,"The COP26 climate summit is under way in Glasgow - one of the biggest ever world meetings on how to tackle global warming. BBC News Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris answers some of your questions. You can send a question using the form at the bottom of this page. How is the average family going to find the extra Â£20,000 needed to buy an electric vehicle?  Nicola Hippisley, London You don't necessarily need an extra Â£20,000 to buy an electric vehicle. Overall, electric cars have been more expensive than petrol or diesel ones for some time, but the difference has been narrowing. The average cost of an electric car in the UK is about Â£44,000, but you can buy a basic one for less than Â£20,000. That's partly because the price of the batteries which electric cars use has fallen sharply in recent years. At the moment, the price of raw materials is threatening to push battery prices up again, but the industry expects that as electric car sales increase, economies of scale will kick in. Experts predict that new electric and petrol/diesel cars will cost the same within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market as well, where vehicles are much cheaper. The UK government currently offersa grant of up to Â£2,500 as a discount on the price of certain brand new low-emission vehicles,externalincluding some electric models. You can also claima grant of up to Â£350 to help meet the cost of installing a chargepoint,externalat your house if you have dedicated off-street parking. This is available whether you lease your car or own it outright. Separately, the Scottish government offers interest-free loans to help people buybrand new,externalorused,externalelectric vehicles. Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think Video: Should I buy an electric car? How will the decisions made at COP26 change our day-to-day lives? I want to know what I can do to help move these policies forward. Matthew Hadley, Harpenden The decisions made at COP26 are part of the wider ambition to decarbonise our economies - and that will certainly have an impact on daily life. The cars we drive and the way we heat our homes are going to change. Buying an electric vehicle, or getting a heat pump installed at home, is going to become more and more common. The hope - and for many the expectation - is that as these technologies become more established, the costs will come down. There are also personal choices to be made about what we eat (the Climate Change Committee which advises the government recommends a 20% reduction per person by 2050 in the amount of beef, lamb and dairy we consume), and how often we fly. Then there are practical issues like recycling and cutting down on waste as much as possible. Why are we still referring to 2050 as some sort of end goal, since very little has changed in the last two decades? Wouldn't 2040 or perhaps even 2030 put a little more urgency into every little step humanity takes? Jake Kettmann, Bega, NSW, Australia The year 2050 is the target date set by many countries for reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases. But you're not alone in thinking that 2050 is much too far in the future to force some politicians or companies to take action now. That's why there are also plenty of interim targets, and the 2020s have been identified as a critical decade for climate action - it can't all be delayed until the 10 years leading up to 2050. Many of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases have now set targets for 2030, and the UN says overall emissions need to fall by 45% [by that date]compared to 2010 levels, if the aim of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is to remain realistic. At the moment, though, the world is nowhere near achieving that, even with the new pledges made at COP26. If scientists have already considered a 1.5C reduction goal will not be achieved, why don't we set up a new goal, which we may able to achieve? Ana, Vietnam Quite a few scientists think it may already be too late to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but they'd rather have an ambitious target to aim for. The Paris Agreement in 2015 set the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C. So ""well below 2C"" is already written into law as a secondary target. There's also a growing awareness of the need to take action which will make a difference in the next five to 10 years. That's why many of the agreements made at COP26 - to reverse deforestation, for example, or to cut global methane emissions by 30% - set 2030 as their target date. The challenge now of course is to turn those promises into practice, and to deliver urgent change. How can we be sure the claims made about greenhouse gas emissions can be verified? What independent observer is measuring different countries' attempts to reduce their fossil fuel usage? Lee Gary, Spain Checking claims made about greenhouse gas emissions is one of the biggest issues for negotiators at COP26. At the moment, countries only have to review and update their pledges for cutting emissions every five years. Many people argue that's not often enough, and some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change want to turn it into an annual process to keep the pressure on. The role of independent observer is supposed to be filled by UN scientists. Buta recent investigation by The Washington Post,externalfound multiple examples of flawed or inaccurate data submitted to the UN by individual countries. It is another example of climate promises falling short of what is required, as a process which relies so heavily on data needs to ensure that the data is accurate. Last month,a UN-backed body launched a scheme,externalto verify net zero claims made by big companies, to ensure that corporate pledges can be easily compared and properly scrutinised. Is there a way to force countries in the UN, especially China and India, to cut back to net zero by 2050? Can sanctions or similar trade restrictions be used against them? Diana Butungi, Kampala Only a few countries have made their net zero pledges legally binding. Many of the national pledges are non-binding targets, but there is a hope that as momentum towards net zero begins to accelerate it will provide an incentive for others to follow. It would be possible in theory to impose trade or other sanctions on countries that are moving more slowly, but that could be counter-productive. The focus of meetings like COP26 is to try to encourage international cooperation. It's also unfair to put all the blame on countries like India and China for the majority of carbon emissions, even though China is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world today and India is the third largest. China and India have huge populations, and much lower emissions per person than more developed countries. In any case, it's important to consider the historical role played by European countries and the United States which are responsible for far more cumulative emissions than China or India. The damaging effects of emitting CO2 into the atmosphere linger for hundreds of years, and the rich world has acknowledged that it has the primary responsibility for tackling climate change. What does net zero mean? Are there plans for governments and countries to invest in carbon-capture technologies on a very large scale? If not, why? Bernath Bence, Netherlands The trouble with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is that the technology that does exist, won't be rolled out fast enough to make any significant difference this decade, when greenhouse gas emissions need to fall significantly. In 2020, for example, the UK allocated Â£1bn to a CCS infrastructure fund, with the ambition of capturing the equivalent of 10m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030. That target has already been increased to capturing 20-30m metric tonnes by 2030. But, to put that in perspective, the UK is estimated to have produced the net equivalent of more than 450m metric tonnes of CO2 in 2019. Government investment varies hugely around the world. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Australia are relying very heavily on CCS to allow them to continue producing fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, but that means scaling up the technology in a way which has not yet been proven to work effectively. How do agricultural products like rice and sugar contribute to the increase of CO2? What can we do to help reduce emissions? Ng Wee Meng, Singapore Most forms of agriculture produce CO2 emissions in one way or another. Beef is widely agreed to be the most carbon-intensive food to produce globally, but there are emissions from sugar and rice - these are connected with factors such as deforestation, animal feed, energy used in processing and transport, and packaging. One study estimates that rice, for example,produces the equivalent of 4kg of CO2 emissions for every 1kg of rice produced,external. Given that 755 million tonnes of rice are produced every year around the world, that is a lot of CO2. On the other hand, rice is an essential staple food feeding billions around the world. The best way to help reduce emissions is to try to ensure you eat food which is produced as sustainably as possible - although many people may not have the luxury of that choice. Would enforcing quotas for meat consumption and flight travels be efficient and feasible? Anonymous, Geneva Meat eating (especially beef) and travelling by air both have a sizeable environmental impact. Eating one or two hamburgers a week for a yearcreates the same amount of greenhouse gasesas heating a UK home for 95 days. And a return economy flight from London to New Yorkemits about 0.67 tonnes of CO2.That's 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK. In theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption or flying would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. The UK Climate Change Committee - which advises the government - has recommended that people should consume 20% less meat and dairy by 2030, and 35% less by 2050. People are also being urged to think about flying less. Using taxation to make certain things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Will I still be able to fly in a net zero world? Why can't we have an international fund to help poorer countries attain zero carbon emissions? Robert Patterson, Darlington That is partly what the current debate on climate finance is all about. In 2009, rich countries said they would provide $100bn (Â£73bn) every year to the developing world by 2020. But they have been unable to live up to their promise, and they are now suggesting they will only meet that target in 2023. Poorer countries need this money to help tackle the effects of climate change that they are already facing. But they also need it to make sure their economies become greener as they develop, on a path to net zero carbon emissions. What does net zero mean? If it is people causing climate change, what is being done to stop over-population ? Gaye Schmidt, Perth, Australia Overpopulation isn't the root cause of climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. And the richest one per cent of the world's population is responsible for more carbon emissions than the poorest fifty per cent. It is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population. Can your sex life be eco-friendly? The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. A really simple guide to climate change Why the COP26 climate summit is important What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change Is the global capitalist model not at odds with climate change and the need for a greener way of life? Andrew, Exeter Matt McGrath writes: According to some experts, such as the economist Lord Stern, climate change can be seen as the great failure of the market. This is because businesses have not generally had to pay for the damage they have caused to the environment. Global efforts to tackle climate change over the past two decades have focused more on harnessing capitalism to limit warming - for instance, putting a price on carbon and making the polluter pay, to ensure that emissions are ultimately restricted. Meanwhile, it's also the case that if there's consumer demand for greener products and services, capitalism will try to meet that demand. But there's evidently still a lot of work to be done to make these approaches work. Does COP26 really need 25,000 people there? They will generate a lot of CO2, so why can't many elements be online? David, Birmingham Matt McGrath writes: The pandemic might be seen as the perfect moment for the UN to use technology for negotiations, and it was attempted during a preparatory meeting for COP in June, which ran for three weeks. Unfortunately, it didn't go well - time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources, progress was limited and decisions were put off. As a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far easier for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection. They also bring a lived experience of climate change that it is critical for rich countries to hear first-hand. There's some evidence that this works. In 2015, the presence of island states and vulnerable nations was key to securing the commitment to limit temperature changes to 1.5C in the Paris Agreement.

Welsh villagers and Namibian lobbyist in COP26 plea,"Anna Munro, Jane Lansfield and Peter Weldon have brought a letter from Cardigan Town Council Welsh pensioner Jane Lansfield has come to COP26 in Glasgow for her grandchildren. The softly-spoken, almost whispering, grandmother is perhaps not what you would imagine a typical Extinction Rebellion protester to look like. But Jane entered activism after watching her community suffer a battering from floods and changing weather patterns. For her, COP26 is about fighting for her grandchildren's futures. While Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Greta Thunberg are making the headlines, tens of thousands of delegates and visitors are all trying to achieve their own outcomes from the summit. For some it's making their voices heard, for others it's about making contacts that could help their countries secure help as they adapt to climate change. The Welsh trio have brought a letter to deliver to Alok Sharma Peter Weldon has cycled through wind and rain, all the way from Wales, to bring a letter to Alok Sharma. The letter, from the mayor and town council of Cardigan, will be passed on and on until it gets into the hands of the COP president. He told the BBC: ""It says 'please make the decisions necessary to limit global heating to 1.5'. Get your finger out, basically."" He added: ""The people running our country have got to be brave and make the correct decisions to make a difference, stop greenwashing and cling onto their authority."" Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Anna Munro is also here to make the case for communities like Cardigan. ""We have had some serious flooding,"" she said. ""It has badly, badly affected a lot of people in Cardigan and in the local Welsh area and also we have lots of farmers who are already worried about crop failures. Everybody is already starting to see the signs of climate catastrophe."" Peter and Anna have joined Jane in the ranks of XR to try to convince leaders that profit should no longer come before people and planet. Jane said: ""Profit is a mirage if you can't live in the future and give your children and grandchildren what they deserve - a world which is habitable, which can produce reliable crops for them to eat, for them to breathe clean air. Anything else is a nonsense. ""I just feel this really matters and it has to be now and that's why I am here to help them to witness that, "" said Jane. ""Because I don't want to look my grandchildren in the eye and say I haven't tried."" Alfeus Vatilifa Shekunyenge says Namibia wants financial backing from COP26 The stakes are high for delegates attending from developing countries. Many are expected to return from COP26 with tangible results. Alfeus Vatilifa Shekunyenge is in Scotland on behalf of the Namibian government. He is hoping to return with some real money. He feels the pressure. ""We are hoping to meet with different climate financing institutions hoping to secure some funds to go back home and implement our climate related activities,"" he says. ""Climate change is affecting us very badly - Namibia is already a dry country. We have unpredictable climate variability and the majority of people depend on climate sensitive sectors for their livelihood. We have experienced a lot of droughts and flooding and outbreaks of diseases so climate change is already very real for us. ""I hope that we get solutions here, that the developed countries pledge more money towards climate financing and we get financial and technical assistance to implement the activities we need to mitigate climate change."" Kenyan Brian Mounde Ondieki wants leaders of developed countries to keep their promises to fund less wealthy nations affected by climate change. Brian Mounde Ondieki feels the weight of his country on his shoulders as COP26 begins in earnest. He is a climate change officer in the ministry of environment and forestry in Nairobi, Kenya. He says he feels under pressure to bring home a good result from Glasgow for his country. He says: ""Yes, I feel like everyone back in my country is looking upon us to make sure we get a good outcome out of this COP26. I cannot think about failing. I am putting my hopes high."" Mr Ondieke is here to follow the mitigation agenda. He tells the BBC: ""I'm hoping that we will get a good outcome - the goal towards net zero and a good conclusion in going to achieving 1.5C ""The challenges we face in Kenya are that the developed countries have not yet achieved what they promised. It is very frustrating. ""If I could meet President Biden today I would urge him to ensure that the promise that was made to achieve the goal of $100bn by 2020, that this is achieved, so that developing countries can have the funding to make adaptations."" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

Mother of murdered sisters calls for Met overhaul,"Bibaa Henry (left) and Nicole Smallman were found in bushes at Fryent Country Park in Wembley The mother of two murdered sisters whose bodies were photographed by police officers called on Dame Cressida Dick to ""get the rot out"" of the Met. Two Met Police officers admitted taking and sharing photographs of the murder scene of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman in a park in Wembley. PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 33, also admitted distributing the images over WhatsApp. Dame Cressida apologised to Ms Henry and Ms Smallman's mother Mina Smallman. Jaffer and Lewis were assigned to protect the site of the murder overnight in Fryent Country Park, Wembley, north-west London on 8 June. An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation found they instead breached the cordon to take ""inappropriate"" and ""unauthorised"" photographs of the bodies. PC Jamie Lewis (left) and PC Deniz Jaffer have been warned to expect custodial sentences Jaffer took four photographs and Lewis superimposed his own face onto a picture with the victims in the background. The IOPC found Lewis ""used degrading and sexist language to describe the victims at the crime scene he was protecting"". Both officers admitted misconduct in a public office. Speaking after the Old Bailey hearing, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said: ""You need to drill down and get the rot out once and for all. ""You are not above the law, you are not going to be protected."" She criticised the Met chief for her ""shoddy"" response to her officers' actions, saying: ""It's now time for them to take the can for it. ""You know you go to London to start to prepare the funeral of your dead children and then you're forced to have a meeting with the IOPC and the then commander, to tell you that police officers that should have been protecting the area had actually taken selfies and sent them out to a dentist and a doctor and a WhatsApp group. ""There's details of this whole incident that we cannot share with you, but they will come out in time,"" she added. This video can not be played Mina Smallman: ""Police officers that should've been protecting the area had actually taken selfies"" Ms Smallman who has previously condemned the officers as ""Despicable 1 and Despicable 2"", was at the Old Bailey for the hearing, where Judge Mark Lucraft QC granted Jaffer and Lewis conditional bail. She thanked the IOPC and one of its staff in particular, who had been ""horrified and almost in tears"" about what had happened. Judge Lucraft, who will be sentencing them next month, warned the constables: ""These matters are extremely serious and you should be under no illusions when you return for sentence it is extremely likely you will receive custodial sentences, custodial sentences of some length, for your conduct."" The constables were suspended from duty following their arrests on 22 June last year. Jaffer has since left the force. YouTube removes occultist who influenced murderer Police apologise to family of murdered sisters Bibaa and Nicole: The life after death of two sisters Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick called the actions of her officers ""utterly unprofessional, disrespectful and deeply insensitive"". She said: ""Our thoughts today are with the family and friends of Bibaa and Nicole. ""I deeply regret that at a time when they were grieving the loss of their loved ones who were taken in such awful circumstances, they faced additional distress caused by the actions of two police officers. ""I apologised to Bibaa and Nicole's family in June last year and, on behalf of the Met, I apologise again today."" Dame Cressida said the two officers would face ""an accelerated misconduct process"" to decide if they can keep their jobs. Ms Henry and Ms Smallman had been celebrating the older sister's birthday before they were killed Last week, Danyal Hussein, 19, wasjailed for life with a minimum term of 35 yearsfor murdering Ms Henry and 27-year-old Ms Smallman. The sisters had been celebrating Ms Henry's 46th birthday when they were repeatedly stabbed by Hussein, from Blackheath in south-east London. A search of his bedroom revealed he had made an apparent blood pact with a demon to ""sacrifice"" six women in six months in order to win the lottery. This video can not be played 'My daughters' deaths not as urgent because of race' Paul Goddard, from the CPS, said: ""PC Jamie Lewis and PC Deniz Jaffer's senseless conduct fell way below that to be expected from police officers. ""These officers were tasked with protecting a tragic crime scene, but instead they violated it for their own purposes, with no regard to the dignity of the victims, or the harm they might do to a murder investigation. ""Their thoughtless and insensitive actions have no doubt caused immeasurable further distress and pain to the heartbroken family and friends of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry who were already left reeling from the loss of their loved ones.""

More than 100 nations vow to slash methane levels,"This video can not be played Joe Biden says COP26 methane reduction pledge will make ""huge difference"" The US and the EU have announced a global partnership to cut emissions of the greenhouse gas methane by 2030. EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden made the announcement at the COP26 summit on Tuesday. The Global Methane Pledge aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels. It is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and responsible for a third of current warming from human activities. More than 100 countries have signed up to the initiative,first proposed by the US and the EU in September,external. The main focus of efforts to curb global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is emitted as a result of human activities such as generating power and clearing forests. But there has been a growing focus on methane as a way of buying extra time to tackle climate change. Although there's more CO2 in the atmosphere and it sticks around for longer, individual methane molecules have a more powerful warming effect on the atmosphere than single CO2 molecules. And while one of the key goals of COP26 is to get countries to commit to achieving net zero by 2050 - meaning not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - both leaders stressed that they needed to act now. ""We cannot wait for 2050,"" EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the summit. ""We have to cut emissions fast."" She said cutting methane was ""one of the most effective things we can do to reduce near-term global warming"", calling it ""the lowest hanging fruit"". US President Joe Biden echoed her words, calling methane ""one of the most potent greenhouse gases there is"". The pledge covers countries which emit nearly half of all methane, and make up 70% of global GDP, the US president said. The speed with which the world has moved to tackle methane emissions gives real hope that the world is finally waking up to the massive threat posed by warming gases. Just last August the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that methane was responsible for a significant proportion of the 1C of warming the world has already experienced. In September, the EU and the US brought the global pledge into being, and have persuaded some significant emitters to join the club. The thrust is to cut emissions by 30% by 2030. The main focus in the short-term will be the fossil fuel industry. Most of the curbs can be achieved at little or no cost. The potential benefits are huge - scientists believe it could help the world avoid 0.3C of warming by 2040. At a time where every fraction of a degree matters, that is a major saving that could help keep the 1.5C threshold in play. But there are some significant clouds on the horizon. Major emitters like Russia, China and India are not part of the pledge. All the commitments are voluntary - there is no big stick. Despite this, most observers see the pledge as a good step for the world and a boost for the conference. Around 40% of CH4 comes from natural sources such as wetlands but the bigger share now comes from a range of human activities, ranging from agriculture such as cattle and rice production to rubbish dumps. One of the biggest sources is from the production, transport and use of natural gas and since 2008 there has been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to the boom in fracking for gas in parts of the US. In 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era. What worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2. Over a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide. However, there is much more CO2 than methane in the atmosphere and individual molecules of it can remain there for hundreds of years. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel.

'Very difficult' to hit goals - UN chief,"This video can not be played UN chief hopes Glasgow can solve 'serious problems' UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said it will be ""very difficult"" for COP26 to secure deals to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C. Mr Guterres told BBC Scotland it was possible to keep the target alive, but said he is very worried that political divisions could prevent progress. World leaders have gathered in Glasgow for the annual UN climate conference. But Mr Guterres said there was a ""serious problem of trust"" between developed and developing countries. He urged wealthy countries to make good theircommitments to provide $100bn per year in fundingfor climate change mitigation and adaption in the developing world. Live: Latest updates from COP26 in Glasgow What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all The main aim of the Glasgow talks is to try to hit the target set inthe Paris Agreementin 2015, of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial times. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030, but Mr Guterres told BBC Scotland that a lack of trust between nations was the ""most serious problem"" the negotiations face. He said: ""I still think it is possible to take decisions to keep 1.5 alive, but I am very worried with the geopolitical divides, with the issues of cooperation namely between developed countries and emerging economies. There is still a long way to go to come to a reasonable compromise. ""I hope that in Glasgow we can solve several serious problems, for instance over theestablishment of carbon markets. But the central question is to come to a set of national contributions which guarantees 1.5, it will be very difficult to reach it in Glasgow, which means the next day we must start again. ""I don't think we can wait five years for the next set set of national contributions - from now on it must be a permanent exercise, we must have every year a commitment to improve."" The UN Secretary General said he did not think the potential for a new coal mine in Cumbria or new oil and gas developments elsewhere in the UK ""undermine entirely"" the UK's leadership on climate change. He said that while it was not for him to decide the future of the proposed Cambo oil field to the west of Shetland, ""we don't need more oil and gas"". On Monday, he told delegates at the conference that ""addiction to fossil fuels is pushing humanity to the brink"", saying: ""We face a stark choice - either we stop it, or it stops us. We are digging our own graves."" Mr Guterres also expressed ""enormous gratitude"" to Glasgow and the Scottish people for ""wonderful hospitality"". The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

LiveLiveBiden: Mistake for China and Russia leaders to miss COPLess than a minute ago,"The US president hails progress at COP26 before he and other leaders leave Glasgow But he says it was a big mistake for China and Russia's leaders not to show up at the summit Despite their leaders not attending, both countries have sent delegations to the event Earlier UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about COP26 at the end of the two-day leaders' meeting More than 100 countries have signed up to a global methane pledge, agreeing to cut emissions by 30% by the end of the decade The US and EU leaders say tackling the potent greenhouse gas is crucial to keeping warming limited to 1.5C by 2100 Earlier, a plan was announced to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 but many activists are sceptical COP26 is seen as a crucial moment if we are to tackle climate change and avoid the worst impacts of global warming Edited by Gary Kitchener We're leaving our live coverage of COP 26 here for today. We'll be back tomorrow morning, but in the meantime, you can find all the latest conference newshere. Today's live page was brought to you by Claudia Allen, Emma Harrison, Holly Honderich, Gary Kitchener, Marie Jackson, Dulcie Lee, Max Matza, Paul McLaren, Kevin Ponniah and Tiffany Wertheimer. Thanks for joining us. It's the end of day two of the COP26 leaders' talks. There's been a lot to take in, but it's worth it. Tonight, world leaders are already leaving Glasgow (most likely on a private jet - andweâve dug into their climate impact here). They'll pass on the baton to their negotiating teams - and itâs from now that the real work begins. Boris Johnsonsays heâs feeling cautiously optimistic- but said it was easy to get caught up in âexaggerated enthusiasmâ and warned against âfalse hopeâ. Letâs take a look at what happened today: Over the next two weeks, negotiators have the tough job of convincing the UNâs 197 countries to commit to sweeping climate pledges. Find out more about these key dealmakershere. Tomorrow theyâll discuss how the world can fund these huge projects. Join us then, here, on the live page. Kathy JetnÌil-Kijiner is a poet and activist from the Marshall Islands Kathy JetnÌil-Kijiner is a climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, which are under immediate threat from rising sea levels. She describes her frantic life at COP26 here. ""It's quite hard to really convey exactly what it looks like on the ground - the magnitude of the work and the exhausting running from meeting to meeting. ""I think when you know why you're here, what your ultimate goal is, and what you're fighting for, it helps you maintain your momentum and balance as you deal with these complicated issues which are so physically taxing. ""Some discussions are emotionally draining too - for example, when you have to negotiate with countries that you know aren't taking your survival into account."" Read more: 'What it's like to fight for my country's survival' In his speech before leaving Scotland, US President Joe Biden hit out at the leaders of Russia and China for not attending the COP26 conference. So why aren't they there? When a Kremlin spokesman last month said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would skip the climate conference, he did not give any reason why. Dmitry Peskov did insist climate change was ""one of our foreign policy's most important priorities"". Chinese officials had left open the possibility that President Xi Jinping might attend, even after they informed Boris Johnson it was unlikely. Covid has been floated as a non-attendance reason for both leaders. It is thought that Xi has not left his country since the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020. Russia has gone through a bad wave recently. Whether the possible lack of a definitive success to hail at the end of the summit had something to do with it will remain unconfirmed. New finance has been agreed to support South Africa closing its
coal mines and switching to renewable energy sources. The country is Africaâs biggest user of coal - a very polluting
energy source. President Cyril Ramaphosa says the money will help it reach
goals to reduce emissions by 2030. The partnership amounts to wealthier countries paying an emerging
economy not to use fossil fuels. Instead South Africa will be given financial assistance to develop
a renewable electricity system and electric vehicles, as well as create jobs in
green energy. The UK, US, France and Germany, as well as the European Union have
signed up and will contribute $8.5 billion in loans and grants. Read more here. Pope Francis has weighed in on the ongoing summit, issuing a message to delegates comparing the damage of the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change to that wrought by a global conflict. In the message, read in Glasgow by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Francis called for the global response to climate change to be collegial and farsighted ""as in the aftermath of the Second World War"". ""Now is the time to act, urgently, courageously and responsibly,"" he said. Francis added that rich countries had an outstanding ""ecological debt"" to poorer countries because of the disproportionate use of natural resources by developed nations. Countries with greater means must take the lead, he said. Why can't this conference be over Zoom? Will leaders institute meat quotas? What about overpopulation? BBC readers have many questions about COP26, and our experts have answered some of them. Would enforcing quotas for meat consumption be efficient and feasible? Meat eating (especially beef) has a sizeable environmental impact. In theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. Using taxes to make some things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. Since people cause climate change, what is being done to stop overpopulation? Overpopulation isn't causing climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. It is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population. Does COP26 really need 25,000 people there? Why isn't it all online? A prep meeting for this summit was tested online in June. It did not go well. Time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources - progress was restricted and decisions were put off. As a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far too easy for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection. Read more: Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions Joe Biden has wrapped up his briefing and will soon head back to the US. Trying to be upbeat, the president says the vast majority of world leaders view this conference as an opportunity to ""press the restart button"". ""They know that growth rests in dealing with the economy in a way that affects the whole notion of what we're going to do about climate change,"" he continues. ""And it a gigantic opportunity."" Biden is asked again about China's role in climate change negotiations, summing it up simply: ""Not showing up? Come on."" ""It's a gigantic issue and they walked away. How could they do that and claim to have any leadership mantle?"" he adds. ""Same thing with Russia and Putin,"" he continues, adding that the Russian wilderness is burning and Putin ""stays mum"" about it. Biden is asked about why he is attending a climate summit while at the same time calling on Opec nations to produce more oil in order to keep prices low for American consumers. He plays coy, saying that high fuel prices are caused by ""the refusals of Russia or the Opec nations to pump more oil"". ""We'll see what happens on that score sooner than later."" Asked about the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, the busiest US travel day of the year, he pledges that petrol prices will be lower than last year. Biden is asked about the role that China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have played in the two days of talks so far. He's asked if he condemns their lack of involvement. ""We showed up... and by showing up we've had a profound impact on how the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role"", he said. The president added that the absence of the Chinese leader at the summit is a ""big mistake"". Biden hails ""the passion and the power of the young people and the activists"" who he says are in Glasgow ""reminding us of our obligation to future generations"". He goes on to say that addressing climate change will lead to the creation of new jobs, a familiar theme of his so-called Build Back Better plan which is currently working its way through Congress. ""It's about jobs. It's about competitiveness versus complacency,"" he says. ""This decade we have to make significant progress,"" continues Biden. He goes on to hail the methane deal reached today, saying that it will cut ""half of the world's methane emissions, affecting half of the world's GDP."" But Russia, China and India - some of the top methane emitters - are not part of the US and EU-led plan. US President Joe Biden is speaking now. ""We're preparing to wrap up another busy day in Scotland,"" he begins. ""I think we got a lot done. We had a lot of substantive meetings."" He adds that it has been ""critically important for the United States to be here"". The president says that he met several world leaders today, and told them that ""the US is going to be their partner as we meet this climate crisis"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter in Glasgow Last night, a group of senior Biden administration officials gave a preview to reporters of what they hailed as breakthrough deals on forest preservation and methane emissions that were formally announced at COP26 on Tuesday. All the reporters wanted to talk about, however, was the tenuous situation facing Joe Bidenâs trillion-dollar spending package and the hundreds of billions of dollars in climate investment it contains. This has been Bidenâs conundrum throughout his foreign trip. Heâs tried to broker deals, tout successes and promote his presidency on the world stage, but domestic troubles keep crowding their way in. Even his much-touted methane-emissions actions wonât escape the domestic meat-grinder. His proposed regulations on oil and gas drilling and pipelines are sure to face lawsuits once theyâre implemented. Given the current conservative disposition of the US judicial system, including the US Supreme Court, their prospects are uncertain. This overseas trip has tested Bidenâs endurance, and strains have occasionally shown through â whether it was his choking up while speaking about his late son during Sundayâs unusually short press conferenceor appearing to nod offduring the opening sessions of COP26 on Monday. There will be no time to rest when he returns to Washington later tonight, however. If he wants to rescue his domestic legislative agenda â and its historic investments in environmental programmes â he has a daunting task ahead. This video can not be played COP26: President Biden's motorcade leaves hotel near Edinburgh Next up is... or should be, Joe Biden. The US president is scheduled to give a press briefing fairly soon and we'll cover it here. Earlier, onlookers in Scotland were transfixed by his 21-strong motorcade. The huge convoy, including Biden's armoured car nicknamed ""The Beast"", was spotted leaving a hotel in Edinburgh on its way to the summit in Glasgow. A fleet of police and Secret Service vehicles accompanied the president as he travelled along side streets and on to the M8 motorway. Readour pieceto find out more about how the president gets about and who he takes with him.  Humpback whales migrate along the Latin American coast in the Pacific each year The president of Costa Rica has told the BBC that a meeting of four of Latin America's Pacific countries has agreed a regional plan to create a conservation area in the ocean. Carlos Alvarado Quesada told BBC reporters in Glasgow that the regional pledge by Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador was precisely the kind of concrete deal that needed to come out of the summit. However, the president added that the initiative - which he said would help protect biodiversity and combat climate change - would also need financial support from developed nations to be sustainable. Quesada also welcomed the COP26 commitment to reforestation, highlighting Costa Rica's success at having achieved 50% forest cover over the past decades. If youâre just
joining us - UK PM Boris Johnson has been speaking in Glasgow. Yes again. This one was to wrap up two days of leaders' talks, ahead of the hard slog for the negotiators left behind. After having a rather gloomy message in the lead up to
COP26, Johnson said he was now ""cautiously optimistic"" about progress
being made, but warned there was a ""very long way to go"". Here's a wash-up of his briefing: Funding for
vulnerable nations:Johnson
admitted that a key pledge to give $100bn in climate funding to poorer
and more vulnerable nations would still miss its original deadline, but said it would be there for
2023, adding that âfurther action from countries around
the world"" was needed. Talking footy:Ahead of COP the PM said
the world was 5-1 down against climate change. Today he said ""We have
pulled back a goal or two and we may be able to pull this back at extra time.â Sticking with the football analogy, Sky's
Beth Rigby asked whether the ""sad reality
is, if China is not on the pitch, Team World is not going to be able to
equalise. That is the elephant in the room, isn't it?"" Johnson said President Xi
(and President Putin) had decided not to attend the Glasgow summit on pandemic
grounds, adding ""you've got to respect that"". But he added  the Chinese
team was ""very high level"" with a
""fantastic power to make changes"" and President Xi's absence ""doesn't mean
the Chinese are not engagingâ, citing its pledge to meetthe net zero
target by 2060 or earlier. Fossil fuels:Johnson said ""one thing that gives me
optimism - for the countries who find it most difficult to transition from
fossil fuels - we're starting to form those coalitions to help them"". Doomsday
clock:Mr Johnson ended
by saying the UK would be watching COP to make sure there were ""no U-turns
or sliding back"". ""The clock
on the doomsday device is still ticking but we have a bomb disposal team on
site - they are starting to cut wires."" He said he hoped they were the right ones. Tick Tock. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor The UN Secretary General could barely have been more hard-hitting when he told delegates on Monday that ""we are digging our own graves"" with more gas and oil explorations. Now Antonio Guterres says it
will be âvery difficultâ for COP26 to secure the commitments needed to limit
global temperature increases to 1.5C. He warns there is a âserious problem of trustâ
between developed and developing countries and that this relationship is the biggest problem the negotiations face. However, Guterres says he does not think the
potential for a new coal mine in Cumbria or new oil and gas developments
elsewhere in the UK âundermines entirelyâ the UKâs leadership on climate
change. He said that, while it was not for him to decide onthe proposed Cambo oil field to the west of the Shetland Isles, it was the case that âwe donât need more oil
and gasâ.

Met PCs admit sharing photos of murdered sisters,"Bibaa Henry (left) and Nicole Smallman were found in bushes at Fryent Country Park in Wembley The mother of two murdered sisters whose bodies were photographed by police officers called on Dame Cressida Dick to ""get the rot out"" of the Met. Two Met Police officers admitted taking and sharing photographs of the murder scene of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman in a park in Wembley. PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 33, also admitted distributing the images over WhatsApp. Dame Cressida apologised to Ms Henry and Ms Smallman's mother Mina Smallman. Jaffer and Lewis were assigned to protect the site of the murder overnight in Fryent Country Park, Wembley, north-west London on 8 June. An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation found they instead breached the cordon to take ""inappropriate"" and ""unauthorised"" photographs of the bodies. PC Jamie Lewis (left) and PC Deniz Jaffer have been warned to expect custodial sentences Jaffer took four photographs and Lewis superimposed his own face onto a picture with the victims in the background. The IOPC found Lewis ""used degrading and sexist language to describe the victims at the crime scene he was protecting"". Both officers admitted misconduct in a public office. Speaking after the Old Bailey hearing, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said: ""You need to drill down and get the rot out once and for all. ""You are not above the law, you are not going to be protected."" She criticised the Met chief for her ""shoddy"" response to her officers' actions, saying: ""It's now time for them to take the can for it. ""You know you go to London to start to prepare the funeral of your dead children and then you're forced to have a meeting with the IOPC and the then commander, to tell you that police officers that should have been protecting the area had actually taken selfies and sent them out to a dentist and a doctor and a WhatsApp group.

She thanked the IOPC and one of its staff in particular, who had been ""horrified and almost in tears"" about what had happened. Judge Lucraft, who will be sentencing them next month, warned the constables: ""These matters are extremely serious and you should be under no illusions when you return for sentence it is extremely likely you will receive custodial sentences, custodial sentences of some length, for your conduct."" The constables were suspended from duty following their arrests on 22 June last year. Jaffer has since left the force.

Police block climate protesters from accessing M8,"Police accompanied protesters away from the Charing Cross area of Glasgow towards a location near the conference venue Police blocked off a bridge over the M8 motorway during a second day of climate protests in Glasgow. About 300 Extinction Rebellion activists gathered outside investment bankers JP Morgan on Waterloo Street before moving to Scottish Power. As some then tried to get closer to the summit venue officers closed St Vincent Street at Charing Cross. Extinction Rebellion said it was never their intention to access the motorway. A spokesperson said: ""We had no intention of blocking the M8. We were trying to cross the bridge to get to the SEC."" The protest took place just over a mile from where world leaders have gathered for the United Nation's climate summit, COP26. The group sat down on St Vincent Street in a peaceful protest but after negotiations about 100 were then accompanied by police towards the Clyde Arc bridge. About 300 protesters blocked the road outside JP Morgan's offices in Glasgow The Extinction Rebellion activists then held a protest outside Scottish Power The road closure meant some traffic was blocked from accessing the motorway. A spokeswoman from Scottish Power said: ""We're aware of the peaceful protest in Glasgow city centre, which was paused outside our HQ while the a route for the protestors to the COP venue was identified. ""The protest was not directed at Scottish Power."" Later a  group of young climate activists from around the world gathered just across the river from the summit venue and held up illuminated letters saying ""end climate betrayal"" . The event was organised by the Avaaz campaign organisation which has drafted an open letter calling for climate action with more than one million signatures. Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior has now left the River Clyde after mooring overnight at King George V docks, downriver from the summit venue. The Erskine Bridgewas closed just after 16:00,externalas the Rainbow Warrior passed underneath, reopening after 10 minutes. It is the second time in two days the bridge has been closed for ""public safety"" to allow the ship through. Rainbow Warrior sailed back down the Clyde on Tuesday afternoon The second full day of the conference saw a number of demonstrations in both Glasgow and Edinburgh. Extinction Rebellion initially protested outside JP Morgan as they want the company to stop funding fossil fuel projects. JP Morgan declined to comment on the protest. An earlier demo took place outside the financier's Edinburgh centre. The group unfurled banners and staff were handed leaflets as they arrived for work. Thunberg tells protest politicians are pretending World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030 In pictures: Scotland's young climate activists One group of activists called on world leaders gathered in Glasgow to make strong commitments that fulfil pledges laid out in theParis Climate Accord. A protest themed on the Netflix show ""Squid Game"" took place at the Clyde Arc, near the conference venue. Another group of Ocean Rebellion protesters gathered at the gates of the Ineos petrochemical site at Grangemouth on the Firth of Forth, near Falkirk. Many different groups from across the globe are using the opportunity to make their voices heard as the world's attention falls on Glasgow during the pandemic-delayed summit. A group called Ocean Rebellion protested outside the Grangemouth petrochemical site Monday, the first full day of the COP26 conference, saw dozens of demos as world leaders arrived in Glasgow. Prominent climate activist Greta Thunberg told young protesters that politicians attending COP26 are ""pretending to take our future seriously"". She said change would not come from politicians at the summit but from individuals showing leadership. This video can not be played Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg says politicians at COP26 are ""pretending to take our future seriously"" World leaders at the UN climate summit have meanwhile agreed their first major deals -a pledge to halt and reverse deforestationby the end of the decade and an agreement by more than 100 countries to cut methane releases.

"World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030More than 100 nations - including Brazil, Russia and Indonesia - sign COP26's first major deal.Science & EnvironmentComments","Trees are often cut down to create grazing land to feed the world's hunger for meat More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, in the COP26 climate summit's first major deal. Brazil - where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down - was among the signatories on Tuesday. The pledge includes almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. Experts welcomed the move, but warned a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"" and commitments needed to be delivered on. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the global meeting in Glasgow, said ""more leaders than ever before"" - a total of 110 - had made the ""landmark"" commitment. ""We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests,"" he said - and ""end the role of humanity as nature's conqueror, and instead become nature's custodian"". The two-week summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions 'We need water and there is water, but the wrong sort' Success or failure: Five people who get to decide The countries who have signed the pledge - including Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the US and the UK(the full list is here),external- cover around 85% of the world's forests. Some of the funding will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities. Governments of 28 countries also committed to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa. These industries drive forest loss by cutting down trees to make space for animals to graze or crops to grow. More than 30 of the world's biggest financial companies - including Aviva, Schroders and Axa - have also promised to end investment in activities linked to deforestation. And a Â£1.1bn fund will be established to protect the world's second largest tropical rainforest - in the Congo Basin. This video can not be played A logger, an environmental policeman, a cattle rancher and an environmentalist share their views on Amazon's future Prof Simon Lewis, an expert on climate and forests at University College London, said: ""It is good news to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and significant funding to move forward on that journey."" But he told the BBC the world ""has been here before"" with a declaration in 2014 in New York ""which failed to slow deforestation at all"". There are reasons to be cheerful about the proposed plan to limit deforestation, specifically the scale of the funding, and the key countries that are supporting the pledge. It is also very positive that it will try to reinforce the role of indigenous people in protecting their trees. Studies have shown that protecting the rights of native communities is one of the best ways of saving forested lands. But there are significant challenges. Many previous plans haven't achieved their goals. In fact, deforestation has increased since a similar pledge was launched in 2014. There are often disputes between donors and recipients - Norway suspended funding for an Amazon fund in 2019 in an argument with Brazil's president. There are also major questions over how a major financial pledge could be effectively policed. How can funders verify that forests are actually being protected without spying from satellites or challenging national sovereignty in some way? And question marks also hang over a key plank of the new plan, which is to try to remove the link to deforestation from consumer goods sold in developed countries. One aspect is eating meat from animals, raised on imported soy grown on cleared lands. Will governments push companies and consumers to eat less meat to save the world's most important forests? Ecologist Dr Nigel Sizer called the agreement ""a big deal"" - but that some will find the target of 2030 disappointing. ""We're facing a climate emergency so giving ourselves another 10 years to address this problem doesn't quite seem consistent with that,"" said Dr Sizer, a former president of the Rainforest Alliance. ""But maybe this is realistic and the best that they can achieve."" The New York Declaration on Forests was a voluntary and legally non-binding agreement on deforestation in 2014 It aimed to half deforestation by 2020, and halt it by 2030 - and40 governments eventually signed up.,externalBut some key countries like Brazil and Russia weren't among them But the agreement failed,a report in 2019 found, saying deforestation was still continuing at an alarming rate The deal's signatories include a number of key countries. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil, a product found in everything from shampoo to biscuits. Production is driving tree destruction and territory loss for indigenous people. Meanwhile, Russia's huge natural forests, with more than one fifth of the planet's trees,capture more than 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon annually.,external In the planet's biggest rainforest, the Amazon,deforestation accelerated to a 12-year high in 2020under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Asked whether leaders like Brazil's Mr Bolsonaro could be trusted to abide by the pledge, the UK's Environment Secretary George Eustice said ""we should be really positive when countries engage"". ""Last time there was an attempt at getting such a commitment on forests [in 2014], Brazil didn't take part, neither did Russia, neither did China. ""Brazil, they've really engaged with us on this agenda. It's a big step for them."" But pressed on whether the agreement will be enforceable, Mr Eustice said: ""It doesn't go as far into talking about enforcement mechanisms and so forth, that's not the nature of these agreements."" He said what was different about this pledge in particular is that there is ""the finance to back [it] up"". US President Joe Biden said he was ""confident"" the global pledge could be met, telling world leaders: ""All we need to do is summon the will and do what we know is right. We can do this."" He said the US would lead by example, and announced it would spend $9bn (Â£6.6bn) to conserve and restore forests. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Ana Yang, executive director at Chatham House Sustainability Accelerator, who co-wrotethe report Rethinking the Brazilian Amazon,external, said: ""This deal involves more countries, more players and more money. But the devil is in the detail which we still need to see."" But many people living in the Amazon, including in its urban areas, depend on the forest for their livelihoods and they need support in finding new incomes, she added. Prince Charles told COP26 delegates that nations had to ""honour"" the rights of indigenous people as they were ""experienced custodians"" of their habitats. And speaking to members of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities - representing 24 countries with tropical rainforests - he said: ""We've got to work harder to save your forests, for all our sakes."" Tuntiak Katan, from the Coordination of Indigenous Communities of the Amazon Basin, welcomed the deal, saying that funds should be invested in supporting indigenous communities who are able to manage and protect forests. Mr Katan, an indigenous Shuar from Ecuador, told the BBC indigenous communities globally protected 80% of the world's biodiversity but faced threats and violence. ""For years we have protected our way of life and that has protected ecosystems and forests. Without us, no money or policy can stop climate change,"" he said. Tap or click to go through the gallery  One of the biggest causes of forest loss in Brazil is to grow soy beans, much of which goes to China and Europe for animal feed for pigs and chickens, said Dr Sizer. ""We all end up consuming that, unless we're strict vegetarians and we don't eat soy. It's a very serious problem that we're all connected with."" Trees are one of our major defences in a warming world. They suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, acting as so-called carbon sinks. They absorb around one third of global CO2 emitted each year. Under present targets, the world is on track for warming of 2.7C by 2100 - which the UN says would result in climate catastrophe. Currently an area of forest the size of 27 football pitches is lost every minute. How is the Amazon forest cleared? Depleted forests can also start to release CO2. If too many trees are cut down, scientists are worried that the planet will reach a tipping point that will set off abrupt and unpredictable climatic change. Also on the second day of the two-week climate summit: The UK and Indialaunched a fund to help small island states,externalto prepare themselves against climate change disasters. Mr Johnson said the difference between a 2C and 1.5 temperature rise would mean ""the difference between life and death"" for many people living there The US and EUare launching an initiative that aims to driveglobal efforts to cut emissions of methane Mr Johnson apologised to an Israeli ministerwho said she could not attend the summiton Monday because it was not wheelchair accessible The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

Bezos pledges $2bn for restoring nature,"Jeff Bezos in Glasgow Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has said his Bezos Earth Fund will spend $2bn (Â£1.5bn) restoring landscapes and transforming food systems. He told the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow that he had grasped nature's fragility when he travelled into space. Entrepreneurs including Mr Bezos have been criticised for spending money on trips into space instead of solving problems on Earth. Amazon has also been criticised by its workers over environmental practices. Speaking to the COP26 conference, Mr Bezos said: ""In too many parts of the world, nature is already flipping from a carbon sink to a carbon source."" The Bezos Earth Fund plans to spend $10bn fighting climate change overall. 'We need water and there is water, but the wrong sort' Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions In Glasgow the founder of the world's biggest online retailer described the experience of travelling on his rocket ship, New Shepard, in July as a revelation of Earth's vulnerability. ""I was told that seeing the Earth from space changes the lens from which you view the world but I was not prepared for just how much that would be true,"" he said. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises.

Read more about the COP26 summit here Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change ""Looking back at Earth from up there, the atmosphere seems so thin, the world so finite and so fragile. Now, in this critical year and what we all know is the decisive decade, we must all stand together to protect our world."" In September, the Bezos Earth Fund pledged $1bn towards conserving nature and indigenous peoples and cultures. Announcing the follow-up $2bn pledge on Tuesday, Mr Bezos said that two-thirds of Africa's productive land was degraded but this could be reversed. ""Restoration can improve soil fertility, raise yields and improve food security, make water more reliable, create jobs and boost economic growth, while also sequestering carbon,"" he told COP26. As well as Mr Bezos, Sir Richard Branson and Elon Musk are building up space businesses. Last month, Prince William suggested entrepreneurs should focus on saving Earth rather than engaging in space tourism. Amazon has also been criticised in the past by its workers over its record on climate change. Last year, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice called on the online retail giant to achieve zero emissions by 2030, limit its work with fossil fuel companies, and stop funding for politicians and lobbyists who deny the existence of climate change. In April this year, US labour officialsfound that Amazon retaliated illegallywhen it fired two employees who were part of the group.

Morrisons sorry for 'non-EU salt and pepper' label,"Morrisons has backed down after customers complained about its labelling of a chicken meat product as containing ""non-EU salt and pepper"". The supermarket chain's salt-and-pepper chicken crown features the Union Flag on its label, which says that it is ""made from British chicken"". The label provoked an angry reaction on Twitter, including one accusation of stoking ""anti-EU hatred"". In response, the firm said the wording was ""an error for which we apologise"". ""We are changing the packaging immediately,""its tweet added,external. A spokesman for Morrisons said: ""It is adhering to packaging regulations rather than making any political point."" The supermarket said it would change the packaging and de-emphasise the mention of non-EU salt and pepper, but said it would still have to be included somewhere on the wrapping because of packaging laws. According togovernment guidance on food labelling,external, the term ""non-EU"" must be used on meat packaging when full country information is unavailable. From October next year, following post-Brexit rule changes, this will be replaced by ""non-UK"". Among the reactions from customers, some pointed out the irony of a soon-to-be US-owned supermarket displaying its British credentials. Last month, Morrisons shareholders approveda multi-billion pound takeover offerfrom US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). Others poked fun at the wording in other ways, with one person tweeting: ""I've just had a look at my salt and pepper and it has no country of origin on it. It's from Aldi... ""Does that mean it's non-EU or not? Is it safe to put it on an English chicken? Asking for Morrisons..."" One customer raised the issue of food miles, saying: ""In other words, they get their S&P from somewhere further away, creating more impact on the climate."" Another queried how useful such information was for shoppers, tweeting: ""Aside from anything else, I'd have thought most normal people want to know where foodstuff IS from, not where it isn't."" The move comes in the midst of a debate in the food retailing industry about firms' increasing tendency to use patriotic imagery on packaging, withtrade publication The Grocer,externalidentifying it as part of a post-Brexit ""culture war"". However, those who support the trend see the ""made in the UK"" tag as a sign of quality rather than a political statement.

Tributes to second paddleboarder who died in river,"Nicola Wheatley, Paul O'Dwyer and Morgan Rogers are named as the three people who died Tributes have been paid to three people who died while paddleboarding in a Welsh river at the weekend. They have now been named as Morgan Rogers, 24, from Merthyr Tydfil, Nicola Wheatley, 40, from Pontarddulais, Swansea, and Paul O'Dwyer, 42, from Sandfields, Neath Port Talbot. A woman also remains in a critical condition in hospital, police said. They had been part of a group of nine on an excursion exploring the River Cleddau in Haverfordwest on Saturday. A further five people were pulled out of the river by emergency services, but had no injuries. Police officer one of paddleboarders in fatal incident Tribute to paddleboarder after three die in river The family of Miss Rogers, a deputy store manager at a supermarket, said: ""Morgan was a beautiful, kind and loving soul, beloved by all who have been touched by her warm smile and her caring personality. ""Morgan was never happier than when she was in the outdoors doing what she loved and spending time with her family. ""She will be greatly missed by her family and friends and all those she has known along the way. Morgan will always be in our hearts and our memories. We will miss her dearly."" Morgan was a deputy store manager at a supermarket Morgan was described as ""the best that she could be"". Her family added she would be missed by her mother, father, Rhys, Harry, Holly and Katy"". The family of Nicola Wheatley, a mother, said they were ""devastated by our loss"", adding: ""Nicola was a beautiful, caring, considerate and funny person. She was amazing in every way. ""She has left a void in our lives that will never be filled."" She worked for the Cardiff and Vale health board as a specialist in poisons information, providing advice to healthcare professionals managing poisoned patients. Nicola was a loving mother, daughter, daughter-in-law and wife, her family say A statement from colleagues described her as a ""gifted and dedicated scientist"" who made significant contributions to the field of toxicology and presented her work at an international level. ""She will be remembered for her calm, friendly and totally professional manner - even when faced with the most difficult of cases,"" they said. ""Through her lovely personality, Nikki made many friends during her time in public service and will be sorely missed by her friends and colleagues."" One of those on the trip, Vickie Mckinven from Milford Haven, said Mr O'Dwyer died attempting to rescue two fellow paddleboarders who had got into difficulty near the weir. The family of Mr O'Dwyer said he ""gave his life to save others"", describing him as a ""devoted husband, father, son and brother"". Paul O'Dwyer completed the London Marathon and Ironman Wales, among many other achievements ""He devoted his life to contributing to society in his many adventures in raising money for different causes,"" his family said. ""Paul was a water baby. His passion for the water started with Aberavon lifeguards from an early age. ""His sporting prowess extended to many different sports. He was an Army surfing champion, British Army seven-a-side rugby team member, Aberavon Green Stars rugby player, ski instructor and completed multiple times in British and Welsh Three Peaks events."" The group were from the South Wales Paddle Boarders and Salty Dog Co, an organisation based in Port Talbot. The River Cleddau remained swollen in Haverfordwest on Sunday morning Ms Mckinven said she had pulled out of the morning paddle because she was concerned about the weather conditions. In a statement read outside Haverfordwest Police Station, Det Ch Insp Jonathan Rees, of Dyfed-Powys Police, revealed the nine people got into difficulties after reaching the weir near Quay Street. He said the force first received reports of people in difficulty at about 09:00 BST on Saturday, and a significant rescue operation followed. Floral tributes have been laid at the weir where the paddleboarders got into difficulty He added the exact circumstances are now being ""thoroughly investigated"". Det Ch Insp Rees said his thoughts are with the families of those who lost loved ones, and of the injured person, adding: ""Paddleboarding is a growing leisure pursuit and we would encourage those engaging in the activity to ensure they understand the weather conditions and water conditions at a particular location where they may be enjoying that sport.""

Parents fear for teen without cannabis treatment,"This video can not be played Bailey's parents make a desperate plea for financial help The life of a teenager who can have hundreds of epileptic seizures a day ""hangs in the balance"" without cannabis treatment, his parents say. Bailey Williams' parents say getting the Â£1,200 needed each month has become harder during the pandemic. Without the drug they fear the 19-year-old's body may need to be ""shut down"" in hospital to control his condition. The Welsh government said doctors must take account of evidence and guidelines before prescribing. Bailey's parents Craig Williams and Rachel Rankmore are part of a group presenting a petition to Downing Street later, which is calling for an emergency compassionate fund for patients like Bailey. They want both UK and Welsh governments to act. Epilepsy patients waiting to see a neurologist 'I've spent Â£34,000 to keep my epileptic daughter alive' Campaigners say they have gathered more than 600,000 signatures. The UK government changed the law in 2018 to make prescribing medical cannabis legal. But pressure group End Our Pain says only three such prescriptions have since been made on the NHS, with many families forced to go private. Cannabis-based medication has been ""life-changing"" for Bailey, pictured in the middle, his family say Mr Williams and Ms Rankmore, from Cardiff, said they had encountered reluctance to prescribe on the NHS and have had to use a doctor in London who is willing to do so privately. ""If Bailey had to come off his medication now because we could not afford it, the only other treatment available to him would be palliative care,"" said Ms Rankmore. ""They would take him into hospital and shut down his body to try and stop the seizures. ""He has tried every other drug."" Despite it being legal, some doctors have doubts about the effectiveness of the medicine Mr Williams explained the cannabis-based medicine had been life-changing and prevented his son from having hundreds of seizures a day. ""Bailey has been on this medicine now for five-and-a-half years, and in five-and-a-half years we have not had an ambulance visit,"" he said. ""In five-and-a-half years we have not had an overnight stay in hospital, and yet they seem to say, for whatever reason, that there is no proof that it is working."" Bailey uses the medicine to control his seizures Some doctors still have doubts about the effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based medicine, despite it now being legal. In March 2021,the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),externalclarified its guidance to say health professionals could consider the products ""where clinically appropriate in an individual case"". Cardiff and Vale health board passed on queries about its policies to the Welsh government. The Welsh government said cannabis-based Epidyolex was routinely available for ""some forms of severe refractory epilepsy"". A spokesman said: ""We expect healthcare professionals to take account of all evidence and recognised guidelines before prescribing. ""The decision to prescribe unlicensed cannabis-based medicinal products is for individual prescribers in consultation with the patient, their families, carers or guardian; the primary concern of doctors will always be to ensure the safety of their patients. ""Where an NHS healthcare professional wishes to prescribe these products arrangements are in place for the NHS to consider and where appropriate meet their cost.""

Race to find survivors in Nigeria building collapse,"It is still unclear how many people are trapped under the rubble Rescuers are searching for survivors in the wreckage of a 22-storey block that collapsed under construction in Nigeria's largest city, Lagos. Authorities say at least 15 people have died and dozens more are missing. Rescue workers at the site say they have heard more voices from under the rubble. Nine people have been pulled out alive so far. The partially built block of luxury apartments came down on Monday but what caused the collapse remains unclear. The cause of the collapse is not yet known Overnight, despite the heavy rain, people used floodlights to continue the search digging through debris and twisted metal. Ibrahim Farinloye of Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency told the Agence France-Presse news agency that rescue workers have been communicating with several survivors still trapped in the rubble. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari urged workers at the scene ""to step up"" rescue efforts in a statement on Monday night. Many relatives are now anxiously waiting near the site to hear whether their loved ones have survived. ""Our sister is inside,"" Fawas Sanni told AFP. His sister, Zainab, was working at the construction site as part of the National Youth Service Corps. ""I was the last one who to spoke to her before she went to work yesterday morning,"" Mr Sanni is quoted as saying. Mayeni Jones, BBC West Africa correspondent, Lagos Hundreds of onlookers stand by in the crushing heat, waiting for news of survivors. Gerrard Road, one of the area's main thoroughfares, has been blocked off to traffic. Rows of women sit in the middle of the road, praying in Yoruba for survivors to be found. The area directly around the site has been cordoned off to give rescue workers the space to get to those still missing. But there's simmering anger in the crowd, frustrated at the slow pace of the rescue. While it remains too early to say what caused the collapse, Lagos emergency management agency manager, Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, suggested that some building infractions may have been committed during construction. Local authorities have ordered an investigation into the collapse and pledged to make the final report public. Femi Adesina, a special adviser to President Buhari, said the president ""commiserates with families who have lost loved ones"". The building came down at around 14:45 local time (13:45 GMT) in the upmarket district of Ikoyi. It was part of a complex named 360 Degrees Towers, which was intended to house luxury apartments, town houses and penthouses, according to the development's website, which has since been taken offline. The housing scheme is being developed by Fourscore Homes Limited, which has a portfolio of projects in the UK, US, South Africa, and other areas of Nigeria. Construction worker Ade John told BBC Igbo that he was on the ground floor when the building started caving in. ""There were 40 bricklayers who came to work, including some engineers on the first floor,"" he said, fearing that they had not escaped. A witness who was working in an office building opposite told the BBC's Outside Source that he heard a sound, looked out of his window and ""saw the building literally going down floor by floor"". According to the AP news agency, visiting Lagos' deputy governor Femi Hamzat was met by crowds of angry people on Monday who accused authorities of not starting rescue efforts soon enough. Some reports say the building was several floors higher than originally intended. One witness told the BBC he saw the building collapse ""floor by floor"" Building collapses are common across Nigeria. Between 2005 and 2020, 152 buildings fell down in Lagos, according to research by planning expert Dr Okunola Olasunkanmi. More than three-quarters were residential properties, many multi-storey. One of the worst incidents, in 2014, saw a six-storey building collapse during a service by celebrity televangelist TB Joshua, killing 116 people. In many cases, unqualified or unskilled builders were used along with substandard building materials,Dr Olasunkanmi says in an article in the Conversation,external.

'Very difficult' to hit climate goals - UN chief,"This video can not be played UN chief hopes Glasgow can solve 'serious problems' UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said it will be ""very difficult"" for COP26 to secure deals to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C. Mr Guterres told BBC Scotland it was possible to keep the target alive, but said he is very worried that political divisions could prevent progress. World leaders have gathered in Glasgow for the annual UN climate conference. But Mr Guterres said there was a ""serious problem of trust"" between developed and developing countries. He urged wealthy countries to make good theircommitments to provide $100bn per year in fundingfor climate change mitigation and adaption in the developing world. Live: Latest updates from COP26 in Glasgow What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all The main aim of the Glasgow talks is to try to hit the target set inthe Paris Agreementin 2015, of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial times. Some 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030, but Mr Guterres told BBC Scotland that a lack of trust between nations was the ""most serious problem"" the negotiations face. He said: ""I still think it is possible to take decisions to keep 1.5 alive, but I am very worried with the geopolitical divides, with the issues of cooperation namely between developed countries and emerging economies. There is still a long way to go to come to a reasonable compromise. ""I hope that in Glasgow we can solve several serious problems, for instance over theestablishment of carbon markets. But the central question is to come to a set of national contributions which guarantees 1.5, it will be very difficult to reach it in Glasgow, which means the next day we must start again. ""I don't think we can wait five years for the next set set of national contributions - from now on it must be a permanent exercise, we must have every year a commitment to improve."" The UN Secretary General said he did not think the potential for a new coal mine in Cumbria or new oil and gas developments elsewhere in the UK ""undermine entirely"" the UK's leadership on climate change. He said that while it was not for him to decide the future of the proposed Cambo oil field to the west of Shetland, ""we don't need more oil and gas"". On Monday, he told delegates at the conference that ""addiction to fossil fuels is pushing humanity to the brink"", saying: ""We face a stark choice - either we stop it, or it stops us. We are digging our own graves."" Mr Guterres also expressed ""enormous gratitude"" to Glasgow and the Scottish people for ""wonderful hospitality"". The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

US to tackle methane leaks from oil and gas wells,"Flames from a flaring pit near a well in America's Bakken Oil Field The US is set to announce measures to prevent millions of tonnes of the greenhouse gas methane from entering the atmosphere. The measures will target methane leaking from oil and gas rigs across the US. It is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and responsible for a third of current warming from human activities. A global partnership to cut methane is to be announced at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow on Tuesday. Dozens of countries have joined the initiative led by the US and the EU to cut emissions of the gas by at least 30% by 2030, compared with 2020 levels. However, China, Russia and India - some of the world's top methane emitters - are not among them. 'We need water and there is water, but the wrong sort' Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions The main focus of efforts to curb global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is emitted as a result of human activities such as generating power and clearing forests. But there has been a growing focus on methane as a way of buying extra time to tackle climate change. Although there's more CO2 in the atmosphere and it sticks around for longer, individual methane molecules have a more powerful warming effect on the atmosphere than single CO2 molecules. Mr Biden will announce his plan at the conference in Glasgow, where countries are trying to hammer out plans to limit global warming in order to avoid a climate catastrophe by the end of this century. In the US, the oil and gas industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions, responsible for approximately 30% of total emissions of the gas, the White House says. Under theMethane Emissions Reduction Action Plan,external, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will propose new regulations that will broaden and strengthen methane emissions reduction for new oil and gas facilities. This video can not be played US President Joe Biden: ""None of us can explain the worst that's yet to come if we fail to seize this moment"" But it will also propose regulations to require states develop plans that will reduce methane emissions from existing sources across America, including some 300,000 oil and gas well sites. An ""aggressive"" programme would plug abandoned orphan oil and gas wells, including many that are still venting methane. There would be new safety regulations to tighten requirements over methane leaks from the country's 3m miles (4.8m km) of pipelines, and the burning of methane waste at drilling sites on public land would be curbed. One way to reduce methane emissions from agriculture would be through ""alternative manure management systems"", the White House says. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change ""The timing of this is critical,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan told Reuters news agency. ""As we speak, world leaders are gathering right now in Glasgow and they are looking to the United States for true leadership. This proposal is absolutely bold, aggressive and comprehensive."" According to Reuters, the new rules are most likely to take effect in 2023. President Biden's plan was welcomed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a US-based non-governmental organisation which advocates for the environment. ""This step is critical to meet President Biden's pledge to cut America's climate pollution in half by 2030,"" said senior strategic director David Doniger. ""This EPA action will also bolster the growing international efforts - led by the United States and the European Union - to significantly reduce methane pollution at the global climate talks in Glasgow."" The American Petroleum Institute (API), the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, has said it supports direct regulation of methane emissions from new and existing sources but opposes efforts in Congress to impose fees on methane leaks, calling them punitive and unnecessary. It argues that leaks of methane have decreased even as natural gas production has gone up as a result of the ongoing fracking boom, and says technological advancements in recent years have made finding and repairing natural gas leaks cheaper and easier,the Associated Press reports,external. ""Thanks to innovation and industry actions, U.S. methane emissions rates in the largest producing regions have declined 70 percent in the past decade, even as America produces more affordable, reliable and cleaner natural gas,""the API says,external. Around 40% of CH4 comes from natural sources such as wetlands but the bigger share now comes from a range of human activities, ranging from agriculture such as cattle and rice production to rubbish dumps. One of the biggest sources is from the production, transport and use of natural gas and since 2008 there has been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to the boom in fracking for gas in parts of the US. In 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era. What worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2. Over a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide. However, there is much more CO2 than methane in the atmosphere and individual molecules of it can remain there for hundreds of years.

Bezos pledges $2bn for restoring natureAmazon founder Jeff Bezos tells the COP26 climate meeting he was inspired by his recent space trip.,"Jeff Bezos in Glasgow Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has said his Bezos Earth Fund will spend $2bn (Â£1.5bn) restoring landscapes and transforming food systems. He told the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow that he had grasped nature's fragility when he travelled into space. Entrepreneurs including Mr Bezos have been criticised for spending money on trips into space instead of solving problems on Earth. Amazon has also been criticised by its workers over environmental practices. Speaking to the COP26 conference, Mr Bezos said: ""In too many parts of the world, nature is already flipping from a carbon sink to a carbon source."" The Bezos Earth Fund plans to spend $10bn fighting climate change overall. 'We need water and there is water, but the wrong sort' Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions In Glasgow the founder of the world's biggest online retailer described the experience of travelling on his rocket ship, New Shepard, in July as a revelation of Earth's vulnerability.

Bezos pledges $2bn for restoring natureAmazon founder Jeff Bezos tells the COP26 climate meeting he was inspired by his recent space trip.Business,"Jeff Bezos in Glasgow Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has said his Bezos Earth Fund will spend $2bn (Â£1.5bn) restoring landscapes and transforming food systems. He told the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow that he had grasped nature's fragility when he travelled into space. Entrepreneurs including Mr Bezos have been criticised for spending money on trips into space instead of solving problems on Earth. Amazon has also been criticised by its workers over environmental practices. Speaking to the COP26 conference, Mr Bezos said: ""In too many parts of the world, nature is already flipping from a carbon sink to a carbon source."" The Bezos Earth Fund plans to spend $10bn fighting climate change overall. 'We need water and there is water, but the wrong sort' Should there be limits on meat eating?

"Squid Game crypto token collapses in apparent scamInspired by the hugely popular Netflix series Squid Game, the tokens had rocketed in value.Business","A digital token inspired by the popular South Korean Netflix series Squid Game has lost almost all of its value as it was revealed to be an apparent scam. Squid, which marketed itself as a ""play-to-earn cryptocurrency"", had seen its price soar in recent days - surging by thousands of per cent. However, asthe BBC reported, it was criticised for not allowing people to resell their tokens. This kind of scam is commonly called a ""rug pull"" by crypto investors. This happens when the promoter of a digital token draws in buyers, stops trading activity and makes off with the money raised from sales. Squid's developers have made off with an estimated $3.38m (Â£2.48m), according to technology website Gizmodo. ""Play-to-earn"" cryptocurrency is where people buy tokens to use in online games and can earn more tokens which can later be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or national currencies. Squid Game cryptocurrency rockets in value Chinese viewers slam 'copycat' Squid Game show Last Tuesday, Squid was trading at just 1 cent. In less than a week its price had jumped to over $2,856. Its value has now plummeted by 99.99%, said cryptocurrency data website CoinMarketCap. Squid was billed as a token that could be used for a new online game inspired by the Netflix series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money. The game was due to go live this month. However, cryptocurrency experts had warned of several tell-tale signs that it was likely to be a scam. Most telling was that people who bought Squid tokens were unable to sell them. Critics also highlighted that its website contained many spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. The website is no longer online and social media accounts promoting the tokens have also vanished. ""It is one of many schemes by which naÃ¯ve retail investors are drawn in and exploited by malevolent crypto promoters,"" Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad told the BBC. Professor Prasad said buyers need to be aware when buying cryptocurrencies as there is almost no regulatory oversight. ""In fact, open pump and dump schemes are rampant in the crypto world, with investors often jumping in with eyes wide open, perhaps hoping that they can ride the wave and dump their holdings for a quick profit before prices collapse,"" he said. Squid was available for sale on decentralised crypto exchanges including PancakeSwap and DODO, which allows for buyers to connect directly to sellers, without a central authority. ""Nowadays new coins can be listed on decentralised exchanges on the first day they are created, without any regulation or due diligence,"" said Jinnan Ouyang from Singapore-based crypto company Openmining.

LiveLive'Work with us on forests' - Amazon communities13 minutes ago,"The US president hails progress at COP26 before he and other leaders leave Glasgow But he says it was a big mistake for China and Russia's leaders not to show up at the summit Despite their leaders not attending, both countries have sent delegations to the event Earlier UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about COP26 at the end of the two-day leaders' meeting More than 100 countries have signed up to a global methane pledge, agreeing to cut emissions by 30% by the end of the decade The US and EU leaders say tackling the potent greenhouse gas is crucial to keeping warming limited to 1.5C by 2100 Earlier, a plan was announced to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 but many activists are sceptical COP26 is seen as a crucial moment if we are to tackle climate change and avoid the worst impacts of global warming Edited by Gary Kitchener We're leaving our live coverage of COP 26 here for today. We'll be back tomorrow morning, but in the meantime, you can find all the latest conference newshere. Today's live page was brought to you by Claudia Allen, Emma Harrison, Holly Honderich, Gary Kitchener, Marie Jackson, Dulcie Lee, Max Matza, Paul McLaren, Kevin Ponniah and Tiffany Wertheimer. Thanks for joining us. It's the end of day two of the COP26 leaders' talks. There's been a lot to take in, but it's worth it. Tonight, world leaders are already leaving Glasgow (most likely on a private jet - andweâve dug into their climate impact here). They'll pass on the baton to their negotiating teams - and itâs from now that the real work begins. Boris Johnsonsays heâs feeling cautiously optimistic- but said it was easy to get caught up in âexaggerated enthusiasmâ and warned against âfalse hopeâ. Letâs take a look at what happened today: Over the next two weeks, negotiators have the tough job of convincing the UNâs 197 countries to commit to sweeping climate pledges. Find out more about these key dealmakershere. Tomorrow theyâll discuss how the world can fund these huge projects. Join us then, here, on the live page. Kathy JetnÌil-Kijiner is a poet and activist from the Marshall Islands Kathy JetnÌil-Kijiner is a climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, which are under immediate threat from rising sea levels. She describes her frantic life at COP26 here. ""It's quite hard to really convey exactly what it looks like on the ground - the magnitude of the work and the exhausting running from meeting to meeting. ""I think when you know why you're here, what your ultimate goal is, and what you're fighting for, it helps you maintain your momentum and balance as you deal with these complicated issues which are so physically taxing. ""Some discussions are emotionally draining too - for example, when you have to negotiate with countries that you know aren't taking your survival into account."" Read more: 'What it's like to fight for my country's survival' In his speech before leaving Scotland, US President Joe Biden hit out at the leaders of Russia and China for not attending the COP26 conference. So why aren't they there? When a Kremlin spokesman last month said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would skip the climate conference, he did not give any reason why. Dmitry Peskov did insist climate change was ""one of our foreign policy's most important priorities"". Chinese officials had left open the possibility that President Xi Jinping might attend, even after they informed Boris Johnson it was unlikely. Covid has been floated as a non-attendance reason for both leaders. It is thought that Xi has not left his country since the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020. Russia has gone through a bad wave recently. Whether the possible lack of a definitive success to hail at the end of the summit had something to do with it will remain unconfirmed. New finance has been agreed to support South Africa closing its
coal mines and switching to renewable energy sources. The country is Africaâs biggest user of coal - a very polluting
energy source. President Cyril Ramaphosa says the money will help it reach
goals to reduce emissions by 2030. The partnership amounts to wealthier countries paying an emerging
economy not to use fossil fuels. Instead South Africa will be given financial assistance to develop
a renewable electricity system and electric vehicles, as well as create jobs in
green energy. The UK, US, France and Germany, as well as the European Union have
signed up and will contribute $8.5 billion in loans and grants. Read more here. Pope Francis has weighed in on the ongoing summit, issuing a message to delegates comparing the damage of the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change to that wrought by a global conflict. In the message, read in Glasgow by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Francis called for the global response to climate change to be collegial and farsighted ""as in the aftermath of the Second World War"". ""Now is the time to act, urgently, courageously and responsibly,"" he said. Francis added that rich countries had an outstanding ""ecological debt"" to poorer countries because of the disproportionate use of natural resources by developed nations. Countries with greater means must take the lead, he said. Why can't this conference be over Zoom? Will leaders institute meat quotas? What about overpopulation? BBC readers have many questions about COP26, and our experts have answered some of them. Would enforcing quotas for meat consumption be efficient and feasible? Meat eating (especially beef) has a sizeable environmental impact. In theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. Using taxes to make some things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. Since people cause climate change, what is being done to stop overpopulation? Overpopulation isn't causing climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. It is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population. Does COP26 really need 25,000 people there? Why isn't it all online? A prep meeting for this summit was tested online in June. It did not go well. Time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources - progress was restricted and decisions were put off. As a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far too easy for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection. Read more: Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions Joe Biden has wrapped up his briefing and will soon head back to the US. Trying to be upbeat, the president says the vast majority of world leaders view this conference as an opportunity to ""press the restart button"". ""They know that growth rests in dealing with the economy in a way that affects the whole notion of what we're going to do about climate change,"" he continues. ""And it a gigantic opportunity."" Biden is asked again about China's role in climate change negotiations, summing it up simply: ""Not showing up? Come on."" ""It's a gigantic issue and they walked away. How could they do that and claim to have any leadership mantle?"" he adds. ""Same thing with Russia and Putin,"" he continues, adding that the Russian wilderness is burning and Putin ""stays mum"" about it. Biden is asked about why he is attending a climate summit while at the same time calling on Opec nations to produce more oil in order to keep prices low for American consumers. He plays coy, saying that high fuel prices are caused by ""the refusals of Russia or the Opec nations to pump more oil"". ""We'll see what happens on that score sooner than later."" Asked about the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, the busiest US travel day of the year, he pledges that petrol prices will be lower than last year. Biden is asked about the role that China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have played in the two days of talks so far. He's asked if he condemns their lack of involvement. ""We showed up... and by showing up we've had a profound impact on how the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role"", he said. The president added that the absence of the Chinese leader at the summit is a ""big mistake"". Biden hails ""the passion and the power of the young people and the activists"" who he says are in Glasgow ""reminding us of our obligation to future generations"". He goes on to say that addressing climate change will lead to the creation of new jobs, a familiar theme of his so-called Build Back Better plan which is currently working its way through Congress. ""It's about jobs. It's about competitiveness versus complacency,"" he says. ""This decade we have to make significant progress,"" continues Biden. He goes on to hail the methane deal reached today, saying that it will cut ""half of the world's methane emissions, affecting half of the world's GDP."" But Russia, China and India - some of the top methane emitters - are not part of the US and EU-led plan. US President Joe Biden is speaking now. ""We're preparing to wrap up another busy day in Scotland,"" he begins. ""I think we got a lot done. We had a lot of substantive meetings."" He adds that it has been ""critically important for the United States to be here"". The president says that he met several world leaders today, and told them that ""the US is going to be their partner as we meet this climate crisis"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter in Glasgow Last night, a group of senior Biden administration officials gave a preview to reporters of what they hailed as breakthrough deals on forest preservation and methane emissions that were formally announced at COP26 on Tuesday. All the reporters wanted to talk about, however, was the tenuous situation facing Joe Bidenâs trillion-dollar spending package and the hundreds of billions of dollars in climate investment it contains. This has been Bidenâs conundrum throughout his foreign trip. Heâs tried to broker deals, tout successes and promote his presidency on the world stage, but domestic troubles keep crowding their way in. Even his much-touted methane-emissions actions wonât escape the domestic meat-grinder. His proposed regulations on oil and gas drilling and pipelines are sure to face lawsuits once theyâre implemented. Given the current conservative disposition of the US judicial system, including the US Supreme Court, their prospects are uncertain. This overseas trip has tested Bidenâs endurance, and strains have occasionally shown through â whether it was his choking up while speaking about his late son during Sundayâs unusually short press conferenceor appearing to nod offduring the opening sessions of COP26 on Monday. There will be no time to rest when he returns to Washington later tonight, however. If he wants to rescue his domestic legislative agenda â and its historic investments in environmental programmes â he has a daunting task ahead. This video can not be played COP26: President Biden's motorcade leaves hotel near Edinburgh Next up is... or should be, Joe Biden. The US president is scheduled to give a press briefing fairly soon and we'll cover it here. Earlier, onlookers in Scotland were transfixed by his 21-strong motorcade. The huge convoy, including Biden's armoured car nicknamed ""The Beast"", was spotted leaving a hotel in Edinburgh on its way to the summit in Glasgow. A fleet of police and Secret Service vehicles accompanied the president as he travelled along side streets and on to the M8 motorway. Readour pieceto find out more about how the president gets about and who he takes with him.  Humpback whales migrate along the Latin American coast in the Pacific each year The president of Costa Rica has told the BBC that a meeting of four of Latin America's Pacific countries has agreed a regional plan to create a conservation area in the ocean. Carlos Alvarado Quesada told BBC reporters in Glasgow that the regional pledge by Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador was precisely the kind of concrete deal that needed to come out of the summit. However, the president added that the initiative - which he said would help protect biodiversity and combat climate change - would also need financial support from developed nations to be sustainable. Quesada also welcomed the COP26 commitment to reforestation, highlighting Costa Rica's success at having achieved 50% forest cover over the past decades. If youâre just
joining us - UK PM Boris Johnson has been speaking in Glasgow. Yes again. This one was to wrap up two days of leaders' talks, ahead of the hard slog for the negotiators left behind. After having a rather gloomy message in the lead up to
COP26, Johnson said he was now ""cautiously optimistic"" about progress
being made, but warned there was a ""very long way to go"". Here's a wash-up of his briefing: Funding for
vulnerable nations:Johnson
admitted that a key pledge to give $100bn in climate funding to poorer
and more vulnerable nations would still miss its original deadline, but said it would be there for
2023, adding that âfurther action from countries around
the world"" was needed. Talking footy:Ahead of COP the PM said
the world was 5-1 down against climate change. Today he said ""We have
pulled back a goal or two and we may be able to pull this back at extra time.â Sticking with the football analogy, Sky's
Beth Rigby asked whether the ""sad reality
is, if China is not on the pitch, Team World is not going to be able to
equalise. That is the elephant in the room, isn't it?"" Johnson said President Xi
(and President Putin) had decided not to attend the Glasgow summit on pandemic
grounds, adding ""you've got to respect that"". But he added  the Chinese
team was ""very high level"" with a
""fantastic power to make changes"" and President Xi's absence ""doesn't mean
the Chinese are not engagingâ, citing its pledge to meetthe net zero
target by 2060 or earlier. Fossil fuels:Johnson said ""one thing that gives me
optimism - for the countries who find it most difficult to transition from
fossil fuels - we're starting to form those coalitions to help them"". Doomsday
clock:Mr Johnson ended
by saying the UK would be watching COP to make sure there were ""no U-turns
or sliding back"". ""The clock
on the doomsday device is still ticking but we have a bomb disposal team on
site - they are starting to cut wires."" He said he hoped they were the right ones. Tick Tock. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor The UN Secretary General could barely have been more hard-hitting when he told delegates on Monday that ""we are digging our own graves"" with more gas and oil explorations. Now Antonio Guterres says it
will be âvery difficultâ for COP26 to secure the commitments needed to limit
global temperature increases to 1.5C. He warns there is a âserious problem of trustâ
between developed and developing countries and that this relationship is the biggest problem the negotiations face. However, Guterres says he does not think the
potential for a new coal mine in Cumbria or new oil and gas developments
elsewhere in the UK âundermines entirelyâ the UKâs leadership on climate
change. He said that, while it was not for him to decide onthe proposed Cambo oil field to the west of the Shetland Isles, it was the case that âwe donât need more oil
and gasâ.

"World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030More than 100 nations - including Brazil, Russia and Indonesia - sign COP26's first major deal.","Trees are often cut down to create grazing land to feed the world's hunger for meat More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, in the COP26 climate summit's first major deal. Brazil - where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down - was among the signatories on Tuesday. The pledge includes almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. Experts welcomed the move, but warned a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"" and commitments needed to be delivered on. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the global meeting in Glasgow, said ""more leaders than ever before"" - a total of 110 - had made the ""landmark"" commitment. ""We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests,"" he said - and ""end the role of humanity as nature's conqueror, and instead become nature's custodian"". The two-week summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions 'We need water and there is water, but the wrong sort' Success or failure: Five people who get to decide The countries who have signed the pledge - including Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the US and the UK(the full list is here),external- cover around 85% of the world's forests. Some of the funding will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities. Governments of 28 countries also committed to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa. These industries drive forest loss by cutting down trees to make space for animals to graze or crops to grow. More than 30 of the world's biggest financial companies - including Aviva, Schroders and Axa - have also promised to end investment in activities linked to deforestation. And a Â£1.1bn fund will be established to protect the world's second largest tropical rainforest - in the Congo Basin. This video can not be played A logger, an environmental policeman, a cattle rancher and an environmentalist share their views on Amazon's future Prof Simon Lewis, an expert on climate and forests at University College London, said: ""It is good news to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and significant funding to move forward on that journey."" But he told the BBC the world ""has been here before"" with a declaration in 2014 in New York ""which failed to slow deforestation at all"". There are reasons to be cheerful about the proposed plan to limit deforestation, specifically the scale of the funding, and the key countries that are supporting the pledge. It is also very positive that it will try to reinforce the role of indigenous people in protecting their trees. Studies have shown that protecting the rights of native communities is one of the best ways of saving forested lands. But there are significant challenges. Many previous plans haven't achieved their goals. In fact, deforestation has increased since a similar pledge was launched in 2014. There are often disputes between donors and recipients - Norway suspended funding for an Amazon fund in 2019 in an argument with Brazil's president. There are also major questions over how a major financial pledge could be effectively policed. How can funders verify that forests are actually being protected without spying from satellites or challenging national sovereignty in some way? And question marks also hang over a key plank of the new plan, which is to try to remove the link to deforestation from consumer goods sold in developed countries. One aspect is eating meat from animals, raised on imported soy grown on cleared lands. Will governments push companies and consumers to eat less meat to save the world's most important forests? Ecologist Dr Nigel Sizer called the agreement ""a big deal"" - but that some will find the target of 2030 disappointing. ""We're facing a climate emergency so giving ourselves another 10 years to address this problem doesn't quite seem consistent with that,"" said Dr Sizer, a former president of the Rainforest Alliance. ""But maybe this is realistic and the best that they can achieve."" The New York Declaration on Forests was a voluntary and legally non-binding agreement on deforestation in 2014 It aimed to half deforestation by 2020, and halt it by 2030 - and40 governments eventually signed up.,externalBut some key countries like Brazil and Russia weren't among them But the agreement failed,a report in 2019 found, saying deforestation was still continuing at an alarming rate The deal's signatories include a number of key countries. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil, a product found in everything from shampoo to biscuits. Production is driving tree destruction and territory loss for indigenous people. Meanwhile, Russia's huge natural forests, with more than one fifth of the planet's trees,capture more than 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon annually.,external In the planet's biggest rainforest, the Amazon,deforestation accelerated to a 12-year high in 2020under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Asked whether leaders like Brazil's Mr Bolsonaro could be trusted to abide by the pledge, the UK's Environment Secretary George Eustice said ""we should be really positive when countries engage"". ""Last time there was an attempt at getting such a commitment on forests [in 2014], Brazil didn't take part, neither did Russia, neither did China. ""Brazil, they've really engaged with us on this agenda. It's a big step for them."" But pressed on whether the agreement will be enforceable, Mr Eustice said: ""It doesn't go as far into talking about enforcement mechanisms and so forth, that's not the nature of these agreements."" He said what was different about this pledge in particular is that there is ""the finance to back [it] up"". US President Joe Biden said he was ""confident"" the global pledge could be met, telling world leaders: ""All we need to do is summon the will and do what we know is right. We can do this."" He said the US would lead by example, and announced it would spend $9bn (Â£6.6bn) to conserve and restore forests.

US to stop methane leaks from oil and gas wells,"Flames from a flaring pit near a well in America's Bakken Oil Field The US is set to announce measures to prevent millions of tonnes of the greenhouse gas methane from entering the atmosphere. The measures will target methane leaking from oil and gas rigs across the US. It is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and responsible for a third of current warming from human activities. A global partnership to cut methane is to be announced at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow on Tuesday. Dozens of countries have joined the initiative led by the US and the EU to cut emissions of the gas by at least 30% by 2030, compared with 2020 levels. However, China, Russia and India - some of the world's top methane emitters - are not among them. 'We need water and there is water, but the wrong sort' Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions The main focus of efforts to curb global warming is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is emitted as a result of human activities such as generating power and clearing forests. But there has been a growing focus on methane as a way of buying extra time to tackle climate change. Although there's more CO2 in the atmosphere and it sticks around for longer, individual methane molecules have a more powerful warming effect on the atmosphere than single CO2 molecules. Mr Biden will announce his plan at the conference in Glasgow, where countries are trying to hammer out plans to limit global warming in order to avoid a climate catastrophe by the end of this century. In the US, the oil and gas industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions, responsible for approximately 30% of total emissions of the gas, the White House says. Under theMethane Emissions Reduction Action Plan,external, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will propose new regulations that will broaden and strengthen methane emissions reduction for new oil and gas facilities. This video can not be played US President Joe Biden: ""None of us can explain the worst that's yet to come if we fail to seize this moment"" But it will also propose regulations to require states develop plans that will reduce methane emissions from existing sources across America, including some 300,000 oil and gas well sites. An ""aggressive"" programme would plug abandoned orphan oil and gas wells, including many that are still venting methane. There would be new safety regulations to tighten requirements over methane leaks from the country's 3m miles (4.8m km) of pipelines, and the burning of methane waste at drilling sites on public land would be curbed. One way to reduce methane emissions from agriculture would be through ""alternative manure management systems"", the White House says. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change ""The timing of this is critical,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan told Reuters news agency. ""As we speak, world leaders are gathering right now in Glasgow and they are looking to the United States for true leadership. This proposal is absolutely bold, aggressive and comprehensive."" According to Reuters, the new rules are most likely to take effect in 2023. President Biden's plan was welcomed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a US-based non-governmental organisation which advocates for the environment. ""This step is critical to meet President Biden's pledge to cut America's climate pollution in half by 2030,"" said senior strategic director David Doniger. ""This EPA action will also bolster the growing international efforts - led by the United States and the European Union - to significantly reduce methane pollution at the global climate talks in Glasgow."" The American Petroleum Institute (API), the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, has said it supports direct regulation of methane emissions from new and existing sources but opposes efforts in Congress to impose fees on methane leaks, calling them punitive and unnecessary. It argues that leaks of methane have decreased even as natural gas production has gone up as a result of the ongoing fracking boom, and says technological advancements in recent years have made finding and repairing natural gas leaks cheaper and easier,the Associated Press reports,external. ""Thanks to innovation and industry actions, U.S. methane emissions rates in the largest producing regions have declined 70 percent in the past decade, even as America produces more affordable, reliable and cleaner natural gas,""the API says,external. Around 40% of CH4 comes from natural sources such as wetlands but the bigger share now comes from a range of human activities, ranging from agriculture such as cattle and rice production to rubbish dumps. One of the biggest sources is from the production, transport and use of natural gas and since 2008 there has been a big spike in methane emissions, which researchers believe is linked to the boom in fracking for gas in parts of the US. In 2019, methane in the atmosphere reached record levels, around two-and-a-half times above what they were in the pre-industrial era. What worries scientists is that methane has real muscle when it comes to heating the planet. Over a 100-year period it is 28-34 times as warming as CO2. Over a 20-year period it is around 84 times as powerful per unit of mass as carbon dioxide. However, there is much more CO2 than methane in the atmosphere and individual molecules of it can remain there for hundreds of years.

"World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030More than 100 nations - including Brazil, Russia and Indonesia - sign COP26's first major deal.Science & EnvironmentCommentsParents fear for teen without cannabis treatmentThe life of Bailey Williams, 19, ""hangs in the balance"" without cannabis treatment, his family say.Wales","Trees are often cut down to create grazing land to feed the world's hunger for meat More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, in the COP26 climate summit's first major deal. Brazil - where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down - was among the signatories on Tuesday. The pledge includes almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. Experts welcomed the move, but warned a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"" and commitments needed to be delivered on. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the global meeting in Glasgow, said ""more leaders than ever before"" - a total of 110 - had made the ""landmark"" commitment. ""We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests,"" he said - and ""end the role of humanity as nature's conqueror, and instead become nature's custodian"".

"Parents fear for teen without cannabis treatmentThe life of Bailey Williams, 19, ""hangs in the balance"" without cannabis treatment, his family say.Wales","This video can not be played Bailey's parents make a desperate plea for financial help The life of a teenager who can have hundreds of epileptic seizures a day ""hangs in the balance"" without cannabis treatment, his parents say. Bailey Williams' parents say getting the Â£1,200 needed each month has become harder during the pandemic. Without the drug they fear the 19-year-old's body may need to be ""shut down"" in hospital to control his condition. The Welsh government said doctors must take account of evidence and guidelines before prescribing. Bailey's parents Craig Williams and Rachel Rankmore are part of a group presenting a petition to Downing Street later, which is calling for an emergency compassionate fund for patients like Bailey. They want both UK and Welsh governments to act. Epilepsy patients waiting to see a neurologist 'I've spent Â£34,000 to keep my epileptic daughter alive' Campaigners say they have gathered more than 600,000 signatures. The UK government changed the law in 2018 to make prescribing medical cannabis legal. But pressure group End Our Pain says only three such prescriptions have since been made on the NHS, with many families forced to go private. Cannabis-based medication has been ""life-changing"" for Bailey, pictured in the middle, his family say Mr Williams and Ms Rankmore, from Cardiff, said they had encountered reluctance to prescribe on the NHS and have had to use a doctor in London who is willing to do so privately. ""If Bailey had to come off his medication now because we could not afford it, the only other treatment available to him would be palliative care,"" said Ms Rankmore. ""They would take him into hospital and shut down his body to try and stop the seizures. ""He has tried every other drug."" Despite it being legal, some doctors have doubts about the effectiveness of the medicine Mr Williams explained the cannabis-based medicine had been life-changing and prevented his son from having hundreds of seizures a day. ""Bailey has been on this medicine now for five-and-a-half years, and in five-and-a-half years we have not had an ambulance visit,"" he said. ""In five-and-a-half years we have not had an overnight stay in hospital, and yet they seem to say, for whatever reason, that there is no proof that it is working."" Bailey uses the medicine to control his seizures Some doctors still have doubts about the effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based medicine, despite it now being legal. In March 2021,the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),externalclarified its guidance to say health professionals could consider the products ""where clinically appropriate in an individual case"". Cardiff and Vale health board passed on queries about its policies to the Welsh government. The Welsh government said cannabis-based Epidyolex was routinely available for ""some forms of severe refractory epilepsy"". A spokesman said: ""We expect healthcare professionals to take account of all evidence and recognised guidelines before prescribing. ""The decision to prescribe unlicensed cannabis-based medicinal products is for individual prescribers in consultation with the patient, their families, carers or guardian; the primary concern of doctors will always be to ensure the safety of their patients. ""Where an NHS healthcare professional wishes to prescribe these products arrangements are in place for the NHS to consider and where appropriate meet their cost.""

The Welsh government said doctors must take account of evidence and guidelines before prescribing. Bailey's parents Craig Williams and Rachel Rankmore are part of a group presenting a petition to Downing Street later, which is calling for an emergency compassionate fund for patients like Bailey. They want both UK and Welsh governments to act. Epilepsy patients waiting to see a neurologist 'I've spent Â£34,000 to keep my epileptic daughter alive' Campaigners say they have gathered more than 600,000 signatures. The UK government changed the law in 2018 to make prescribing medical cannabis legal. But pressure group End Our Pain says only three such prescriptions have since been made on the NHS, with many families forced to go private. Cannabis-based medication has been ""life-changing"" for Bailey, pictured in the middle, his family say Mr Williams and Ms Rankmore, from Cardiff, said they had encountered reluctance to prescribe on the NHS and have had to use a doctor in London who is willing to do so privately. ""If Bailey had to come off his medication now because we could not afford it, the only other treatment available to him would be palliative care,"" said Ms Rankmore. ""They would take him into hospital and shut down his body to try and stop the seizures. ""He has tried every other drug."" Despite it being legal, some doctors have doubts about the effectiveness of the medicine Mr Williams explained the cannabis-based medicine had been life-changing and prevented his son from having hundreds of seizures a day. ""Bailey has been on this medicine now for five-and-a-half years, and in five-and-a-half years we have not had an ambulance visit,"" he said. ""In five-and-a-half years we have not had an overnight stay in hospital, and yet they seem to say, for whatever reason, that there is no proof that it is working."" Bailey uses the medicine to control his seizures Some doctors still have doubts about the effectiveness and safety of cannabis-based medicine, despite it now being legal. In March 2021,the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),externalclarified its guidance to say health professionals could consider the products ""where clinically appropriate in an individual case"". Cardiff and Vale health board passed on queries about its policies to the Welsh government. The Welsh government said cannabis-based Epidyolex was routinely available for ""some forms of severe refractory epilepsy"". A spokesman said: ""We expect healthcare professionals to take account of all evidence and recognised guidelines before prescribing. ""The decision to prescribe unlicensed cannabis-based medicinal products is for individual prescribers in consultation with the patient, their families, carers or guardian; the primary concern of doctors will always be to ensure the safety of their patients. ""Where an NHS healthcare professional wishes to prescribe these products arrangements are in place for the NHS to consider and where appropriate meet their cost.""

Elon Musk says Tesla has not signed Hertz deal,"Elon Musk says no contract has been signed with Hertz after the rental car company announced a deal that led to Tesla's market value surpassing $1 trillion. Last week, shares in Tesla jumped 12.6% after Hertz said it had ordered 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2022. However, Mr Musktweeted,external: ""I'd like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet."" Yet Hertz told the BBC: ""Deliveries of the Teslas already have started."" A spokeswoman said: ""As we announced last week, Hertz has made an initial order of 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles and is investing in new EV (electric vehicle) charging infrastructure across the company's global operations."" Hertz refused to confirm if a contract had or had not been signed with Tesla in light of Mr Musk's tweet, adding it did not discuss details of its business relationships or discussions. Tesla has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The deal announced last week by Hertz with Tesla was the biggest-ever rental car order for electric vehicles. ""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" saidHertz interim boss Mark Fields.,external It was reported Hertz would pay $4.2bn for 100,000 Model 3s over the next 14 months, which amounts to about a fifth of its fleet. The rental firm would also build a network of charging stations. Hertz said that ""beginning in early November and expanding through year end"" customers would be able to rent a Tesla Model 3 at Hertz airport and neighbourhood locations at certain areas in the US and Europe.

But on Monday, Tesla boss Mr Musk tweeted: ""Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers. ""Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics."" Tesla became the fifth company to surpass a market value of $1 trillion on 25 October, behind Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet. In response to a tweet,externalabout the Hertz deal on 25 October, Mr Musk said it was ""strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem"". He later added: ""To be clear, cars sold to Hertz have no discount. Same price as to consumers."" Tesla shares have been trading down more than 4% in pre-market trading in the US. It is not the first time that Mr Musk's tweets regarding his company have made the news. In May 2020, he wiped $14bn (Â£11bn) off the carmaker's value aftertweeting its share price was too high. And two years earlier, a tweet about Tesla's future on the New York stock market led to regulators fining the company $20m and Mr Musk agreeing to have all further posts on the platform pre-screened by lawyers. Tesla announced on Tuesday it was launching a pilot of 10 ""supercharger"" stations in the Netherlands, which will be available to all electric vehicle models. As part of its charging network expansion plans, the company said opening up its charging sites to non-Telsa drivers was ""critical for large-scale EV adoption"". Tesla has also been forced to recall 11,704 vehicles over a software problem that could cause ""false forward-collision warnings and/or automatic emergency brake  events"". A US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration notice said it was ""not aware of any crashes or injuries"" because of this problem. Tesla is fixing the problem with a software update. Why is Elon Musk playing down talk of a deal with Hertz to sell 100,000 cars? After all, it sounds positive - and appeared to send the share price soaring. Firstly, such a deal might actually be better news for Hertz than Tesla. The car rental firm recently emerged from bankruptcy protection and wants to portray itself as a go-getting modern company. Running Teslas fits the bill. But Tesla doesn't really need Hertz. It's making cars as fast as it can, and insists there is no shortage of demand. Rental firms often buy surplus stock at a discount, but Mr Musk has made it clear if Hertz wants his cars it'll have to pay full price. Meanwhile, the Tesla boss has an uneasy relationship with market regulators. His public insistence that a deal with Hertz ""has zero effect on our economics"", and that no contract has yet been signed could be seen as a message that if Tesla's valuation is rocketing - increasing his personal wealth in the process - it isn't because of anything he has said.

Officers admit sharing images of murdered sistersThe two constables had been assigned to protect the murder scene after the death of two sisters.London,"Bibaa Henry (left) and Nicole Smallman were found in bushes at Fryent Country Park in Wembley The mother of two murdered sisters whose bodies were photographed by police officers called on Dame Cressida Dick to ""get the rot out"" of the Met. Two Met Police officers admitted taking and sharing photographs of the murder scene of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman in a park in Wembley. PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 33, also admitted distributing the images over WhatsApp. Dame Cressida apologised to Ms Henry and Ms Smallman's mother Mina Smallman. Jaffer and Lewis were assigned to protect the site of the murder overnight in Fryent Country Park, Wembley, north-west London on 8 June. An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation found they instead breached the cordon to take ""inappropriate"" and ""unauthorised"" photographs of the bodies. PC Jamie Lewis (left) and PC Deniz Jaffer have been warned to expect custodial sentences Jaffer took four photographs and Lewis superimposed his own face onto a picture with the victims in the background. The IOPC found Lewis ""used degrading and sexist language to describe the victims at the crime scene he was protecting"". Both officers admitted misconduct in a public office. Speaking after the Old Bailey hearing, the sisters' mother Mina Smallman said: ""You need to drill down and get the rot out once and for all. ""You are not above the law, you are not going to be protected."" She criticised the Met chief for her ""shoddy"" response to her officers' actions, saying: ""It's now time for them to take the can for it. ""You know you go to London to start to prepare the funeral of your dead children and then you're forced to have a meeting with the IOPC and the then commander, to tell you that police officers that should have been protecting the area had actually taken selfies and sent them out to a dentist and a doctor and a WhatsApp group. ""There's details of this whole incident that we cannot share with you, but they will come out in time,"" she added. This video can not be played Mina Smallman: ""Police officers that should've been protecting the area had actually taken selfies"" Ms Smallman who has previously condemned the officers as ""Despicable 1 and Despicable 2"", was at the Old Bailey for the hearing, where Judge Mark Lucraft QC granted Jaffer and Lewis conditional bail. She thanked the IOPC and one of its staff in particular, who had been ""horrified and almost in tears"" about what had happened. Judge Lucraft, who will be sentencing them next month, warned the constables: ""These matters are extremely serious and you should be under no illusions when you return for sentence it is extremely likely you will receive custodial sentences, custodial sentences of some length, for your conduct."" The constables were suspended from duty following their arrests on 22 June last year. Jaffer has since left the force. YouTube removes occultist who influenced murderer Police apologise to family of murdered sisters Bibaa and Nicole: The life after death of two sisters Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick called the actions of her officers ""utterly unprofessional, disrespectful and deeply insensitive"". She said: ""Our thoughts today are with the family and friends of Bibaa and Nicole. ""I deeply regret that at a time when they were grieving the loss of their loved ones who were taken in such awful circumstances, they faced additional distress caused by the actions of two police officers. ""I apologised to Bibaa and Nicole's family in June last year and, on behalf of the Met, I apologise again today."" Dame Cressida said the two officers would face ""an accelerated misconduct process"" to decide if they can keep their jobs. Ms Henry and Ms Smallman had been celebrating the older sister's birthday before they were killed Last week, Danyal Hussein, 19, wasjailed for life with a minimum term of 35 yearsfor murdering Ms Henry and 27-year-old Ms Smallman. The sisters had been celebrating Ms Henry's 46th birthday when they were repeatedly stabbed by Hussein, from Blackheath in south-east London. A search of his bedroom revealed he had made an apparent blood pact with a demon to ""sacrifice"" six women in six months in order to win the lottery. This video can not be played 'My daughters' deaths not as urgent because of race' Paul Goddard, from the CPS, said: ""PC Jamie Lewis and PC Deniz Jaffer's senseless conduct fell way below that to be expected from police officers. ""These officers were tasked with protecting a tragic crime scene, but instead they violated it for their own purposes, with no regard to the dignity of the victims, or the harm they might do to a murder investigation. ""Their thoughtless and insensitive actions have no doubt caused immeasurable further distress and pain to the heartbroken family and friends of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry who were already left reeling from the loss of their loved ones.""

"Race to find survivors in Nigeria building collapseRescuers have worked through the night in Lagos, with many people feared trapped under rubble.Africa","It is still unclear how many people are trapped under the rubble Rescuers are searching for survivors in the wreckage of a 22-storey block that collapsed under construction in Nigeria's largest city, Lagos. Authorities say at least 15 people have died and dozens more are missing. Rescue workers at the site say they have heard more voices from under the rubble. Nine people have been pulled out alive so far. The partially built block of luxury apartments came down on Monday but what caused the collapse remains unclear. The cause of the collapse is not yet known Overnight, despite the heavy rain, people used floodlights to continue the search digging through debris and twisted metal. Ibrahim Farinloye of Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency told the Agence France-Presse news agency that rescue workers have been communicating with several survivors still trapped in the rubble. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari urged workers at the scene ""to step up"" rescue efforts in a statement on Monday night. Many relatives are now anxiously waiting near the site to hear whether their loved ones have survived. ""Our sister is inside,"" Fawas Sanni told AFP. His sister, Zainab, was working at the construction site as part of the National Youth Service Corps. ""I was the last one who to spoke to her before she went to work yesterday morning,"" Mr Sanni is quoted as saying. Mayeni Jones, BBC West Africa correspondent, Lagos Hundreds of onlookers stand by in the crushing heat, waiting for news of survivors. Gerrard Road, one of the area's main thoroughfares, has been blocked off to traffic. Rows of women sit in the middle of the road, praying in Yoruba for survivors to be found. The area directly around the site has been cordoned off to give rescue workers the space to get to those still missing. But there's simmering anger in the crowd, frustrated at the slow pace of the rescue. While it remains too early to say what caused the collapse, Lagos emergency management agency manager, Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, suggested that some building infractions may have been committed during construction. Local authorities have ordered an investigation into the collapse and pledged to make the final report public. Femi Adesina, a special adviser to President Buhari, said the president ""commiserates with families who have lost loved ones"". The building came down at around 14:45 local time (13:45 GMT) in the upmarket district of Ikoyi. It was part of a complex named 360 Degrees Towers, which was intended to house luxury apartments, town houses and penthouses, according to the development's website, which has since been taken offline. The housing scheme is being developed by Fourscore Homes Limited, which has a portfolio of projects in the UK, US, South Africa, and other areas of Nigeria. Construction worker Ade John told BBC Igbo that he was on the ground floor when the building started caving in. ""There were 40 bricklayers who came to work, including some engineers on the first floor,"" he said, fearing that they had not escaped. A witness who was working in an office building opposite told the BBC's Outside Source that he heard a sound, looked out of his window and ""saw the building literally going down floor by floor"". According to the AP news agency, visiting Lagos' deputy governor Femi Hamzat was met by crowds of angry people on Monday who accused authorities of not starting rescue efforts soon enough. Some reports say the building was several floors higher than originally intended. One witness told the BBC he saw the building collapse ""floor by floor"" Building collapses are common across Nigeria. Between 2005 and 2020, 152 buildings fell down in Lagos, according to research by planning expert Dr Okunola Olasunkanmi. More than three-quarters were residential properties, many multi-storey. One of the worst incidents, in 2014, saw a six-storey building collapse during a service by celebrity televangelist TB Joshua, killing 116 people. In many cases, unqualified or unskilled builders were used along with substandard building materials,Dr Olasunkanmi says in an article in the Conversation,external.

We'll be back tomorrow morning, but in the meantime, you can find all the latest conference newshere. Today's live page was brought to you by Claudia Allen, Emma Harrison, Holly Honderich, Gary Kitchener, Marie Jackson, Dulcie Lee, Max Matza, Paul McLaren, Kevin Ponniah and Tiffany Wertheimer. Thanks for joining us. It's the end of day two of the COP26 leaders' talks. There's been a lot to take in, but it's worth it. Tonight, world leaders are already leaving Glasgow (most likely on a private jet - andweâve dug into their climate impact here). They'll pass on the baton to their negotiating teams - and itâs from now that the real work begins. Boris Johnsonsays heâs feeling cautiously optimistic- but said it was easy to get caught up in âexaggerated enthusiasmâ and warned against âfalse hopeâ. Letâs take a look at what happened today: Over the next two weeks, negotiators have the tough job of convincing the UNâs 197 countries to commit to sweeping climate pledges. Find out more about these key dealmakershere. Tomorrow theyâll discuss how the world can fund these huge projects. Join us then, here, on the live page. Kathy JetnÌil-Kijiner is a poet and activist from the Marshall Islands Kathy JetnÌil-Kijiner is a climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, which are under immediate threat from rising sea levels. She describes her frantic life at COP26 here. ""It's quite hard to really convey exactly what it looks like on the ground - the magnitude of the work and the exhausting running from meeting to meeting. ""I think when you know why you're here, what your ultimate goal is, and what you're fighting for, it helps you maintain your momentum and balance as you deal with these complicated issues which are so physically taxing. ""Some discussions are emotionally draining too - for example, when you have to negotiate with countries that you know aren't taking your survival into account."" Read more: 'What it's like to fight for my country's survival' In his speech before leaving Scotland, US President Joe Biden hit out at the leaders of Russia and China for not attending the COP26 conference. So why aren't they there? When a Kremlin spokesman last month said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would skip the climate conference, he did not give any reason why. Dmitry Peskov did insist climate change was ""one of our foreign policy's most important priorities"". Chinese officials had left open the possibility that President Xi Jinping might attend, even after they informed Boris Johnson it was unlikely. Covid has been floated as a non-attendance reason for both leaders. It is thought that Xi has not left his country since the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020. Russia has gone through a bad wave recently. Whether the possible lack of a definitive success to hail at the end of the summit had something to do with it will remain unconfirmed. New finance has been agreed to support South Africa closing its
coal mines and switching to renewable energy sources. The country is Africaâs biggest user of coal - a very polluting
energy source. President Cyril Ramaphosa says the money will help it reach
goals to reduce emissions by 2030. The partnership amounts to wealthier countries paying an emerging
economy not to use fossil fuels. Instead South Africa will be given financial assistance to develop
a renewable electricity system and electric vehicles, as well as create jobs in
green energy. The UK, US, France and Germany, as well as the European Union have
signed up and will contribute $8.5 billion in loans and grants. Read more here. Pope Francis has weighed in on the ongoing summit, issuing a message to delegates comparing the damage of the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change to that wrought by a global conflict. In the message, read in Glasgow by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Francis called for the global response to climate change to be collegial and farsighted ""as in the aftermath of the Second World War"". ""Now is the time to act, urgently, courageously and responsibly,"" he said. Francis added that rich countries had an outstanding ""ecological debt"" to poorer countries because of the disproportionate use of natural resources by developed nations. Countries with greater means must take the lead, he said. Why can't this conference be over Zoom? Will leaders institute meat quotas? What about overpopulation? BBC readers have many questions about COP26, and our experts have answered some of them. Would enforcing quotas for meat consumption be efficient and feasible? Meat eating (especially beef) has a sizeable environmental impact. In theory, enforced quotas for meat consumption would make a difference, but there's little political appetite or support for that to happen. Instead, the focus is on encouraging behavioural change. Using taxes to make some things more expensive would probably be a more realistic solution than trying to enforce quotas. Since people cause climate change, what is being done to stop overpopulation? Overpopulation isn't causing climate change. Rather, it's the excessive emission of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet up. It is true to say the population of the planet can't keep increasing indefinitely, because there is a finite number of resources available. But excessive consumption has played a larger role in climate change than a growing global population. Does COP26 really need 25,000 people there? Why isn't it all online? A prep meeting for this summit was tested online in June. It did not go well. Time-zone and technology challenges made it almost impossible for countries with limited resources - progress was restricted and decisions were put off. As a result, many developing nations have insisted on having an in-person COP. They feel that it is far too easy for their voices to be ignored on a dodgy Zoom connection. Read more: Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions Joe Biden has wrapped up his briefing and will soon head back to the US. Trying to be upbeat, the president says the vast majority of world leaders view this conference as an opportunity to ""press the restart button"". ""They know that growth rests in dealing with the economy in a way that affects the whole notion of what we're going to do about climate change,"" he continues. ""And it a gigantic opportunity."" Biden is asked again about China's role in climate change negotiations, summing it up simply: ""Not showing up? Come on."" ""It's a gigantic issue and they walked away. How could they do that and claim to have any leadership mantle?"" he adds. ""Same thing with Russia and Putin,"" he continues, adding that the Russian wilderness is burning and Putin ""stays mum"" about it. Biden is asked about why he is attending a climate summit while at the same time calling on Opec nations to produce more oil in order to keep prices low for American consumers. He plays coy, saying that high fuel prices are caused by ""the refusals of Russia or the Opec nations to pump more oil"". ""We'll see what happens on that score sooner than later."" Asked about the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, the busiest US travel day of the year, he pledges that petrol prices will be lower than last year. Biden is asked about the role that China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have played in the two days of talks so far. He's asked if he condemns their lack of involvement. ""We showed up... and by showing up we've had a profound impact on how the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role"", he said. The president added that the absence of the Chinese leader at the summit is a ""big mistake"". Biden hails ""the passion and the power of the young people and the activists"" who he says are in Glasgow ""reminding us of our obligation to future generations"". He goes on to say that addressing climate change will lead to the creation of new jobs, a familiar theme of his so-called Build Back Better plan which is currently working its way through Congress. ""It's about jobs. It's about competitiveness versus complacency,"" he says. ""This decade we have to make significant progress,"" continues Biden. He goes on to hail the methane deal reached today, saying that it will cut ""half of the world's methane emissions, affecting half of the world's GDP."" But Russia, China and India - some of the top methane emitters - are not part of the US and EU-led plan. US President Joe Biden is speaking now. ""We're preparing to wrap up another busy day in Scotland,"" he begins. ""I think we got a lot done. We had a lot of substantive meetings."" He adds that it has been ""critically important for the United States to be here"". The president says that he met several world leaders today, and told them that ""the US is going to be their partner as we meet this climate crisis"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter in Glasgow Last night, a group of senior Biden administration officials gave a preview to reporters of what they hailed as breakthrough deals on forest preservation and methane emissions that were formally announced at COP26 on Tuesday. All the reporters wanted to talk about, however, was the tenuous situation facing Joe Bidenâs trillion-dollar spending package and the hundreds of billions of dollars in climate investment it contains. This has been Bidenâs conundrum throughout his foreign trip. Heâs tried to broker deals, tout successes and promote his presidency on the world stage, but domestic troubles keep crowding their way in. Even his much-touted methane-emissions actions wonât escape the domestic meat-grinder. His proposed regulations on oil and gas drilling and pipelines are sure to face lawsuits once theyâre implemented. Given the current conservative disposition of the US judicial system, including the US Supreme Court, their prospects are uncertain. This overseas trip has tested Bidenâs endurance, and strains have occasionally shown through â whether it was his choking up while speaking about his late son during Sundayâs unusually short press conferenceor appearing to nod offduring the opening sessions of COP26 on Monday. There will be no time to rest when he returns to Washington later tonight, however. If he wants to rescue his domestic legislative agenda â and its historic investments in environmental programmes â he has a daunting task ahead. This video can not be played COP26: President Biden's motorcade leaves hotel near Edinburgh Next up is... or should be, Joe Biden. The US president is scheduled to give a press briefing fairly soon and we'll cover it here. Earlier, onlookers in Scotland were transfixed by his 21-strong motorcade. The huge convoy, including Biden's armoured car nicknamed ""The Beast"", was spotted leaving a hotel in Edinburgh on its way to the summit in Glasgow. A fleet of police and Secret Service vehicles accompanied the president as he travelled along side streets and on to the M8 motorway. Readour pieceto find out more about how the president gets about and who he takes with him.  Humpback whales migrate along the Latin American coast in the Pacific each year The president of Costa Rica has told the BBC that a meeting of four of Latin America's Pacific countries has agreed a regional plan to create a conservation area in the ocean. Carlos Alvarado Quesada told BBC reporters in Glasgow that the regional pledge by Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador was precisely the kind of concrete deal that needed to come out of the summit. However, the president added that the initiative - which he said would help protect biodiversity and combat climate change - would also need financial support from developed nations to be sustainable. Quesada also welcomed the COP26 commitment to reforestation, highlighting Costa Rica's success at having achieved 50% forest cover over the past decades. If youâre just
joining us - UK PM Boris Johnson has been speaking in Glasgow. Yes again. This one was to wrap up two days of leaders' talks, ahead of the hard slog for the negotiators left behind. After having a rather gloomy message in the lead up to
COP26, Johnson said he was now ""cautiously optimistic"" about progress
being made, but warned there was a ""very long way to go"". Here's a wash-up of his briefing: Funding for
vulnerable nations:Johnson
admitted that a key pledge to give $100bn in climate funding to poorer
and more vulnerable nations would still miss its original deadline, but said it would be there for
2023, adding that âfurther action from countries around
the world"" was needed. Talking footy:Ahead of COP the PM said
the world was 5-1 down against climate change. Today he said ""We have
pulled back a goal or two and we may be able to pull this back at extra time.â Sticking with the football analogy, Sky's
Beth Rigby asked whether the ""sad reality
is, if China is not on the pitch, Team World is not going to be able to
equalise. That is the elephant in the room, isn't it?"" Johnson said President Xi
(and President Putin) had decided not to attend the Glasgow summit on pandemic
grounds, adding ""you've got to respect that"". But he added  the Chinese
team was ""very high level"" with a
""fantastic power to make changes"" and President Xi's absence ""doesn't mean
the Chinese are not engagingâ, citing its pledge to meetthe net zero
target by 2060 or earlier. Fossil fuels:Johnson said ""one thing that gives me
optimism - for the countries who find it most difficult to transition from
fossil fuels - we're starting to form those coalitions to help them"". Doomsday
clock:Mr Johnson ended
by saying the UK would be watching COP to make sure there were ""no U-turns
or sliding back"". ""The clock
on the doomsday device is still ticking but we have a bomb disposal team on
site - they are starting to cut wires."" He said he hoped they were the right ones. Tick Tock. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor The UN Secretary General could barely have been more hard-hitting when he told delegates on Monday that ""we are digging our own graves"" with more gas and oil explorations. Now Antonio Guterres says it
will be âvery difficultâ for COP26 to secure the commitments needed to limit
global temperature increases to 1.5C. He warns there is a âserious problem of trustâ
between developed and developing countries and that this relationship is the biggest problem the negotiations face. However, Guterres says he does not think the
potential for a new coal mine in Cumbria or new oil and gas developments
elsewhere in the UK âundermines entirelyâ the UKâs leadership on climate
change. He said that, while it was not for him to decide onthe proposed Cambo oil field to the west of the Shetland Isles, it was the case that âwe donât need more oil
and gasâ.

What do people want from Glasgow?,"Anna Munro, Jane Lansfield and Peter Weldon have brought a letter from Cardigan Town Council Welsh pensioner Jane Lansfield has come to COP26 in Glasgow for her grandchildren. The softly-spoken, almost whispering, grandmother is perhaps not what you would imagine a typical Extinction Rebellion protester to look like. But Jane entered activism after watching her community suffer a battering from floods and changing weather patterns. For her, COP26 is about fighting for her grandchildren's futures. While Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Greta Thunberg are making the headlines, tens of thousands of delegates and visitors are all trying to achieve their own outcomes from the summit. For some it's making their voices heard, for others it's about making contacts that could help their countries secure help as they adapt to climate change. The Welsh trio have brought a letter to deliver to Alok Sharma Peter Weldon has cycled through wind and rain, all the way from Wales, to bring a letter to Alok Sharma. The letter, from the mayor and town council of Cardigan, will be passed on and on until it gets into the hands of the COP president. He told the BBC: ""It says 'please make the decisions necessary to limit global heating to 1.5'. Get your finger out, basically."" He added: ""The people running our country have got to be brave and make the correct decisions to make a difference, stop greenwashing and cling onto their authority."" Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Anna Munro is also here to make the case for communities like Cardigan. ""We have had some serious flooding,"" she said. ""It has badly, badly affected a lot of people in Cardigan and in the local Welsh area and also we have lots of farmers who are already worried about crop failures. Everybody is already starting to see the signs of climate catastrophe."" Peter and Anna have joined Jane in the ranks of XR to try to convince leaders that profit should no longer come before people and planet. Jane said: ""Profit is a mirage if you can't live in the future and give your children and grandchildren what they deserve - a world which is habitable, which can produce reliable crops for them to eat, for them to breathe clean air. Anything else is a nonsense. ""I just feel this really matters and it has to be now and that's why I am here to help them to witness that, "" said Jane. ""Because I don't want to look my grandchildren in the eye and say I haven't tried."" Alfeus Vatilifa Shekunyenge says Namibia wants financial backing from COP26 The stakes are high for delegates attending from developing countries. Many are expected to return from COP26 with tangible results. Alfeus Vatilifa Shekunyenge is in Scotland on behalf of the Namibian government. He is hoping to return with some real money. He feels the pressure. ""We are hoping to meet with different climate financing institutions hoping to secure some funds to go back home and implement our climate related activities,"" he says. ""Climate change is affecting us very badly - Namibia is already a dry country. We have unpredictable climate variability and the majority of people depend on climate sensitive sectors for their livelihood. We have experienced a lot of droughts and flooding and outbreaks of diseases so climate change is already very real for us. ""I hope that we get solutions here, that the developed countries pledge more money towards climate financing and we get financial and technical assistance to implement the activities we need to mitigate climate change."" Kenyan Brian Mounde Ondieki wants leaders of developed countries to keep their promises to fund less wealthy nations affected by climate change. Brian Mounde Ondieki feels the weight of his country on his shoulders as COP26 begins in earnest. He is a climate change officer in the ministry of environment and forestry in Nairobi, Kenya. He says he feels under pressure to bring home a good result from Glasgow for his country. He says: ""Yes, I feel like everyone back in my country is looking upon us to make sure we get a good outcome out of this COP26. I cannot think about failing. I am putting my hopes high."" Mr Ondieke is here to follow the mitigation agenda. He tells the BBC: ""I'm hoping that we will get a good outcome - the goal towards net zero and a good conclusion in going to achieving 1.5C ""The challenges we face in Kenya are that the developed countries have not yet achieved what they promised. It is very frustrating. ""If I could meet President Biden today I would urge him to ensure that the promise that was made to achieve the goal of $100bn by 2020, that this is achieved, so that developing countries can have the funding to make adaptations."" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Domestic Covid passport app launched in NIThe Cert Check NI app can be used for voluntary checks in hospitality and entertainment venues.Northern Ireland,"The new app was developed to help businesses to check their customers' vaccination status A new app which allows users to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination status within Northern Ireland has been launched by the health department. TheCovid Cert Check NI app,externalwill facilitate ""voluntary use"" of vaccine checks in hospitality and entertainment venues. The department has also updated its COVIDCert NI app which allows people travelling abroad to prove vaccination. It can now be updated to show the ""domestic use"" certificate. The apps are free to download and can be used on smartphones and tablet computers. Currently people in Northern Ireland are not required to prove their vaccination status in order to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues. However Stormont ministers recently published a contingency plan which referred to the ""potential"" deployment of Covid-19 status certification in ""higher risk settings"". It is one of a number of contingency measures which could be introduced over the winter if ministers feel such checks are necessary. ""Decisions on whether domestic certification would be introduced on a compulsory basis in Northern Ireland settings will rest with the Northern Ireland Executive,"" the department said in a statement. Vaccine passports a 'no brainer', says Mallon Unlocking options 'limited' by jab passport delay NI vaccine app 'built for overseas travel only' It added that the new Cert Check NI app would be ""more user-friendly and reliable than using the printed vaccination cards to prove you have had both jabs"". The earlierCOVIDCert NI app was launched in July, in response to changes in international travel rules. Since then, more than 228,500 vaccine certificates have been issued to its Northern Ireland users. The existing COVIDCert NI has now been updated to cater for domestic use as well as international travel Now, people who have already downloaded the existing COVIDCert NI app for international travel will be given an option to activate their ""domestic certificate"". To use this new feature, they will have to take a selfie photo with their phone or tablet computer which is then ""locked into the app"". The purpose of adding the selfie is to prevent abuse of the system and it also avoids users having to present separate photo ID when they use the COVIDCert NI app as proof of vaccination status. The department said users' selfie photos will stay on their device within the app but the image is ""not shared with or collected by anyone else"". ""Citizens are encouraged to download the app, and ensure that they have the necessary certificates downloaded, should they wish to present them,"" the statement said. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the app showed ""just how easy it would be to introduce mandatory vaccination certification across all our hospitality and entertainment businesses"". He said while many businesses may choose to use the app, the decision should have been made at Stormont to protect the health service. ""The SDLP will continue to push for vaccine certification,"" he added. While it is not mandatory, Northern Ireland now has a Covid-19 certificate which can be used in domestic and social settings. It looks a lot more professional than the current blue card that hardly resembles anything official. It is available and good to go, but only on a voluntary basis. However, it does pave the way for the Northern Ireland Executive to introduce compulsory checks at the flick of a switch if and when it is required, for instance post-Christmas when health officials might need to call for greater control over the hospitality industry. That might need to happen if the health service becomes overwhelmed, and by making vaccine certification checks mandatory it could mean avoiding another lockdown. The new app was developed to assist Northern Ireland-based organisations to check their customers' vaccination status and can be scanned by participating venues.

Queen shares hope for success at climate summit,"The Queen urges world leaders to ""achieve true statesmanship"" and create a ""safer, stabler future"" for the planet She says in a video message they should ""rise above the politics of the moment"" as they meet at COP26 in Glasgow The climate change conference's first major deal is struck as a group of world leaders promise to stop deforestation by 2030 Meanwhile, India pledges a net zero target for 2070 - 20 years later than the summit target set by Boris Johnson Separately, China also fails to make any new major commitments on climate change at the conference Naturalist David Attenborough says carbon emissions must be halved this decade to keep warming limited to 1.5C by the end of the century Under present targets we are on track for warming of 2.7C by 2100 - which the UN says would result in ""climate catastrophe"" Edited by George Bowden World Leaders pose for a group photo at an evening reception for COP26 We're pausing our live page after Day 2 of COP26. Before we go, here's a quick look back at the highlights:  We'll be back tomorrow at 08:00GMT for Day 3. There will be more speeches from world leaders as well as a special focus on deforestation. We'll be looking out for an announcement of a new deal on forests - crucial to keeping global heating to 1.5C. Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Paul McLaren, George Bowden, Emma Harrison, Doug Faulkner, Gary Kitchener, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Holly Honderich, George Wright, Robert Greenall and Kevin Ponniah. The BBC Climate Change Debate has ended. MÃºte Bourup Egede, prime minister of Greenland, finished the debate by saying he wanted to ""push all the countries - especially big countries with big economies - to collaborate with all of the countries in the world to invest in green energy"". ""This is for the future."" Reality Check Gina McCarthy, a climate adviser for the White House, said the US was âquadrupling its commitmentsâ on climate aid. In April, President Joe Biden said he would double funding to developing nations to tackle climate change. Then, in September at the UN General Assembly, he said he would âwork with the Congress to double that number againâ â quadrupling former President Obamaâs commitment. These figures are relative to Mr Obamaâs spending, not that of his immediate predecessor, because former President Donald Trump mostly withdrew from the USâs international commitments. But Mr Biden hasnât yet managed to pass his budget in Congress, which has the power to make laws. So that commitment is not set in stone yet. Read more about what the biggest polluters are doing to tackle climate change. Reality Check âOne of the things that government is trying to do is to incentivise through grants, the acquisition of these [electric] cars,â said Kwasi Kwarteng, UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The UK government offers a grant of Â£2,500 to those looking to buy an electric car. However, the government has reduced the grant size over the past few years. The maximum grant started off at Â£5,000 in 2011, dropped to Â£4,500 in 2016, then Â£3,500 in 2018 and Â£3,000 in 2020 before being reduced to its current level. As well as the new reduced amount, the Department for Transport has also narrowed the eligibility criteria - restricting the grant for cars costing below Â£35,000. The move was heavily criticised by industry groups and car manufacturers who called it ""disappointing"". Read more about the move to electric cars. Colombia's Minister for Mining & Energy, Diego Mesa, says that there are still about 500,000 families in Colombia without access to electricity. ""We have one billion people around the world with no access to electricity who need to use wood to cook which impacts on deforestation â we have to fix that as well."" Reality Check Colombiaâs Minister of Energy and Mining, Diego Mesa, said carbon capture could help on the path to net zero. âThe problem is not the source of energy, the problem is emissions,"" he said. This is the idea that instead of drastically reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we emit, we could at least partially rely on technology to remove carbon dioxide thatâs already been emitted and store it or use it for energy. Some of these technologies do already exist but they would have to be scaled up enormously to make a dent â at great expense. Some of these processes themselves use a lot of energy to separate the carbon dioxide. And there are scientists who fear the promise of carbon capture technology might act as a âblank chequeâ for people to keep polluting at the same rate, in the so-far untested belief the damage can be reversed at some point in the future. Asked about the new Cambo oilfield to the west of the Shetland Islands, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is booed as he says that the UK government will not rule out granting a licence for operations. He says he wonât shut the door on a quarter of a million jobs and that the climate change debate is about transition. ""It's a licence that was granted 20 years ago and it's a planning decision that we're going to examine. That's all I'm going to say about that,"" Kwarteng says, to loud boos. ""I can't simply say to the quarter of a million people who work in the sector in the UK that we're going to just close the door on the sector,"" he adds.  White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that weâre being asked by young people to stop destroying the planet. President Biden is investing $550bn to grow the economy ""not to sacrifice it,"" she says. ""These are investments not penalties, and as soon as China and Brazil figure out that they are on the losing end of the proposition â theyâll be running to catch up."" Gina McCarthy is asked about criticism of President Joe Biden's huge motorcade at COP26. Kirsty Wark points out that the US motorcade was more than 80 vehicles long during a recent Biden visit to the Vatican. âWe have to make change but itâs going to take more than looking at whether or not its a big motorcade,"" McCarthy responds. More now from the BBC's Big Global Climate Debate, under way on BBC One. White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that Russia and China should be at COP26. But she says that doesn't mean we should allow them to ""decide the fate of the world"". ""We should show them they are missing out if they do not join us and take action"" McCarthy says. ""I'm disappointed they are not here but they should not be allowed to dictate the lack of action. They canât dictate the lack of action. Science is telling us what to do and weâre here to get it done."" In the past half hour it's been confirmed that leaders from more than 100 countrieswill sign an agreement to end deforestation by 2030- providing funds to support and
restore forests. But what do experts think of the first major deal from COP26? Prof Simon Lewis at University College London, an expert in
climate and forests, says: âIt is good news
to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and
significant funding to move forward on that journey."" ""That indigenous peoples are finally being acknowledged as key protectors of forests is particularly welcome, alongside additional funding for rainforest nations and obligations on consumer countries and companies to clean up their supply chains. Prof Simon Lewis, University College London He adds: âThe real weakness is a failure to tackle growing demand for products grown on rainforest land. But that would mean tackling high levels of meat consumption in places like the UK and US, and Boris Johnson has no appetite for that, so canât convene world leaders around that critical aspect of stopping deforestation.â And Chatham House Executive Director Sustainability and author of Rethinking the Amazonian Jungle, Ana Jung, called the announcement an important building block for COP26 success but says details will be key. The BBC's Big Global Climate Debate is now under way for viewers in the UK on BBC One, the iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. We will be bringing you the biggest updates from the debate live here. Sitting on the panel are: A group of leaders at COP26 will sign the climate change conference's first major deal on Tuesday when they promise to stop deforestation by 2030. Signatories will include Brazil, where large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down, and Indonesia, the world's largest exporter of palm oil. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. More money is also being promised to protect and restore forests.
More than 100 countries say they will sign the deal, covering about 85% of the world's forests. And governments of 28 countries will commit to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa. To stop deforestation and break the link between tree loss and agriculture, almost Â£14 billion ($19.2 billion) of public and private funding is being pledged. Some of this will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfire and support indigenous communities. Read morehere. We'll be bringing you coverage of the BBC Global Climate Debate - which begins at 22:35 GMT. Viewers in the UK can watch the programme on BBC One, the BBC iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. A panel of leading international political figures has come together to take questions from young people in the studio in Glasgow - and around
the world - on the challenges presented by climate change. Presented by Kirsty Wark, the debate gives young people across the world the chance to hold their leaders to account
on action for climate change. Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, 24, is a climate change activist from Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Her activism was prompted by the impact of climate change on her family's lives, as she explains here: ""When I was still young I had a plantation with my family, but we lost it due to the effects of climate change. Heavy rains, floods, strong winds, unpredictable seasons, dry streams, all these things. ""In 2017 I joined a discussion at my school that was about climate change. I then understood that the effects my family were feeling was because of climate change. ""I started to speak up as a climate activist and as a campaigner. We travelled to schools and communities and in 2019 I started the Fridays For Future movement in Uganda. Now we have a network of 53,000. ""We were arrested a few times by the police because of the climate strikes - they alleged we might be a political party. ""I have very little hope in COP26 because I haven't seen any concrete actions being taken in the last 25 COPs. Many people are being under-represented, especially from the most affected countries, mostly from the global south. ""We are quickly losing our hope in the leaders because of their inaction. Our survival and the survival of the future generations depend on our actions today. ""Itâs either we come up with concrete actions or we fail all generations to come."" Reality Check Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long resisted setting a
date for his country to achieve net zero -  balancing out greenhouse gas emissions with measures to remove them from the
atmosphere. On Monday, he said India would now achieve this by 2070. This is a significantly longer timescale than the UK, EU and the US which have set targets of 2050 to reach this goal. It is also a decade later than Chinaâs 2060 target. Modi also said India would aim to supply 50% of all its
energy requirements from renewable sources by 2030 with a non-fossil fuel
generating capacity of 500 gigawatts (GW). India currently generates a
little over 100GW from non-fossil sources and is unlikely to hit an earlier target
of 175 gigawatts by 2022. Although India has expanded its
capacity to generate power from sources such as wind and solar, it still relies
heavily on coal. It currently powers about 70% of the countryâs electricity
grid. You can read morehereabout India's climate challenge. Prince Charles has been having a busy day at the COP26 summit and appeared to be in good spirits this evening as Boris Johnson praised his environmental efforts over the years. The Prince of Wales spoke to the assembled world leaders this afternoon before a visit to a distillery run by a former drug addict who had been helped by the Prince's Trust charity. Ryan Longmuir, who started Regis Banqueting 18 years ago after receiving a Â£5,000 loan from the charity, handed the prince a glass of whisky and said ""it's great meeting him"". Charles then joined other royals and some of the political leaders ata dinner reception at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum. The prince was again seen being handed a drink and this time, Reuters reports, he joked: ""I think I need it after today."" He may have been referring to a moment when he briefly lost his footing as he made his way to the stage to deliver this speech earlier in the day. But one man who apparently didn't think the prince had had a bad day was the UK prime minister. Our political editorLaura Kuenssberg has tweeted,externalthat Boris Johnson complimented the Prince of Wales at the reception, saying: âYou heard me earlier on say this was a job for James Bond. Well we have somebody who drives an electric Aston Martin who has a plan to defuse the ticking time bomb. ""l just want to say you're a prophet without honour and you've been right for a very long time."" Outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier that a comprehensive transformation in ways of working is needed to cut CO2 emissions - and not just action from governments. ""That's why I want to make a clear plea here for carbon pricing. This already exists within the EU and also in China, for example,"" she says. Carbon pricing - effectively a tax on CO2 emissions - has been called for in some industries,such as shipping, as a means of forcing polluting businesses to clean up their trade. Merkel said it would be a way to ensure industries and businesses had an incentive to develop technology that would be better for the global climate. That's a very clear expression of what we need to do in a decisive decade, she said. ""Then we will know how to best arrange CO2-free mobility, CO2-free industry and CO2-free processes of our life."" One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Many are already taking note of this. Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the past decade,a study has shown. To find out theclimate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculatorand pick how often you have it. As the day draws to a close in Glasgow, US President Joe Biden says on Twitter that he hopes those present at the summit ""meet the moment on climate, and kick off a decade of ambition, action, and innovation to preserve our shared future"". ""There's no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy,"" he writes. Biden is among 25,000 delegates from about 200 countries - and from every region in the world - in Glasgow this week, gathered to share plans for how they will cut emissions by 2030. The much-anticipated United Nations gathering is one of the biggest summits the UK has ever hosted. Over two weeks, we can expect a flurry of announcements from countries promising to curb emissions, like switches to electric cars or an expedited phase-out of coal. By the end of the conference, some form of declaration is expected, with every country required to sign on. Â© 2025 BBC.
