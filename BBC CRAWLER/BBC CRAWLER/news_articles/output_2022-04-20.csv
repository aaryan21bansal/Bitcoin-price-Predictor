Mariupol fighters' relatives tell of bitter pride,"Olena's cousin is fighting in Mariupol Olena Nikulina pauses, her eyes welling up. ""I was thinking what would happen if I would receive a message that Maks has died, what would I do?"", she says. ""And I just started crying in the middle of the street because I don't have any answer to that."" We are sitting in the office of her volunteer centre in Kyiv, where boxes of supplies - food, medical kits and armoured vests - are being gathered to be sent off to Ukrainian forces on the eastern front: the epicentre of the Russian offensive. Her sense of purpose is twofold: her nation and her family, with her 26-year-old cousin Maksim, or Maks for short, fighting in Mariupol. The boy she grew up with, whom she describes as a kind and respectful engineering student, is one of the last remaining Ukrainian defenders holed up in the Azovstal steel plant in the city, somehow withstanding the ferocious firepower of one of the world's biggest armies. Perhaps a couple of thousand soldiers and civilians are there, in the Cold War-era network of bunkers and tunnels, where food, water and time are running out. For more than a month she had no word from him but spoke to him briefly this week. ""He never told us about the real conditions, probably he didn't want to upset us"", she says. ""But they have very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers."" Growing up in Sumy, north-eastern Ukraine, Maks's mother - Olena's aunt - wanted him to join the army, calling it ""a school of life for men"". When he was called to fight in Mariupol, she was initially relieved, thinking the city, a little further along the coast from the occupied territories of the Donbas, would be spared the worst. But Russia is determined to establish a land corridor through eastern Ukraine to Crimea - and that would have to run through Mariupol. And so Russian forces have besieged it for some seven weeks. Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky said tens of thousands may have died in the city. This video can not be played Watch: Olena Nikulina says her cousin has become ""a true hero of Ukraine"" ""I feel terrible about him being there"", says Olena, struggling to hold back her tears. ""First of all, I feel very sorry about not speaking to him as much as I could while we still had a connection. It felt terrible when my aunt sent me a message at 06:00 to say that Maks' friend was probably dead and she's so worried about him."" I ask of the pride she must feel towards the boy who used to drive her in his car - and became a Ukrainian fighter who refused Russia's demands to surrender. ""I would have never imagined my cousin to become a true hero of Ukraine and of Mariupol"", she replies with a smile. ""It's obviously a very bitter sense of pride in the sense that he's in a life-threatening situation. I dream of the day he will return and I will be able to tell this to him."" On the shelves in the volunteer centre are spoils of war: Russian soldiers' equipment, downed missiles and fragments of a Russian fighter jet that the Ukrainians proudly exhibit as symbols of an invasion that has so far not gone Moscow's way. But the Kremlin will surely be determined that the eastern offensive does not repeat the mistakes of the west, from where Russian troops have now retreated. Russian President Vladimir Putin is thought likely to want a tangible gain by 9 May - the annual commemoration of Victory Day against Nazi Germany - and Mariupol could serve him that. That's a fear shared by another relative, Vladimir Vasilyuk, whose 23-year-old son Danilo is also fighting in the Azovstal plant. They're still in regular contact. ""The boys are lacking ammunition"", Vladimir says, ""but they don't want to leave because they're protecting the civilians - they don't want to abandon them."" Russian service equipment on show at the volunteer centre His composed, almost impassive look begins to break as he talks more of his only child, lowering his eyes with a sharp intake of breath. ""I don't sleep at night"", he admits. ""If I had a chance to go there, I would. I don't think the city is worth the loss of his life. But the boys made their choice. ""Maybe it's my fault that he joined the army, because I always took him to training and I prepared him for it"", he adds. ""His main goal was always to make our country better."" We stand beneath a monument in Kyiv covered up by sandbags spray painted in the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. The bells of the golden-domed St Michael's Church chime five. ""I am sure we will see each other again"", Vladimir says, ""it's a matter of time. But if I could pass a message to him now it would be that I love him and I'm waiting for him.""

Tesla profits soar as customers pay more,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tesla has been raising prices - but that hasn't seemed to dent demand for its electric cars. Despite the firm facing higher costs, profits at Elon Musk's electric car company soared to $3.3bn (Â£2.5bn) in the first three months of the year, as customers proved willing to pay more. The firm's deliveries were up 68% - and would have been higher if not for supply chain shortages, the firm said. Its Shanghai factory was also recently forced shut due to Covid restrictions. As the plant reopens this month, staff will be required to sleep at the factory in an effort to avoid further lockdowns, Bloomberg has reported. ""Although limited production has recently restarted, we continue to monitor the situation closely,"" Tesla said as it shared quarterly results with investors. Tesla has been pushing to expand, opening new factories in Texas and Germany in recent weeks. The firm delivered more than 310,000 cars in the first three months of the year and in a conference call, chief executive Elon Musk predicted the company would produce 60% more cars during the year as a whole compared to last year. Tesla doesn't advertise its products, but attracts frequent headlines, often related to controversial comments made by Mr Musk. But the firm said that it had also seen spikes in orders following increased marketing from rival electric car makers. What are Elon Musk's plans for Twitter? The man who sent his sports car into space Mr Musk said Tesla expects to mass produce a robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals by 2024. While Tesla shares rose more than 5% in after-hours trade, following the strong results, some investors worry Mr Musk may be distracted from his focus on the electric carmaker as it expands. Mr Musk, known for his sometimes erratic musings on Twitter, recently made an unsolicited offer to buy the social media platform for $43bn. The rise in Tesla's stock market value in recent years has made Mr Musk the world's richest man, with an estimated net worth of more than $260bn. That is nearly $100bn more than his closest rival, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

Germany rules out immediate ban on Russian oil,"Germany is moving ""as fast as possible"" to end its reliance on Russian energy, but it will take time, the country's finance minister has said. ""We have to be patient,"" Christian Lindner told the BBC. By contrast, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock had earlier said Germany would end oil imports by the end of the year, with gas following. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky hascriticised Germany for failing to curb Russian energy imports. He described energy payments as ""blood money"". Proceeds from the sale of Russian oil and gas amount to around $1bn (Â£770m) a day, undermining international efforts to put economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin to end the war. The US has already banned Russian oil imports and the UK plans to phase them out by the end of the year. But EU countries are more heavily dependent on Russian energy, with Germany currently buying around 25% of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia. Save energy and annoy Putin, Germans told Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Mr Lindner told the BBC that his country was working to implement an embargo on Russian energy but that he preferred using sanctions which ""hurt [Putin] more than us"". He said a sudden halt to Russian energy imports could see the physical shutdown of German producers such as manufacturers and carmakers. Earlier this week, German economic institutes warned that immediately halting Russian imports would spark a sharp recession in Europe's biggest economy by 2023. ""We are willing to stop all energy imports from Russia, it's just a matter of time,"" said Mr Lindner, who is leader of the liberal Free Democrats, one constituent of Germany's coalition government. He insisted that any calculation on Vladimir Putin's part that Germany would continue to rely on Russian energy was ""wrong"". ""In the end, we don't want to have any further business with Putin,"" he said. However his stance was at odds with statements made by Germany's foreign minister, Ms Baerbock, a prominent Green politician and former co-leader of the party. Ms Baerbock said Germany would halve Russian oil imports by the summer and eliminate them altogether by the end of the year, to be followed quickly by a reduction in Russian gas imports. Germany's finance minister was keen to sound tough on Russia and appears acutely aware of the criticism levelled at his country for dragging its feet over a full energy embargo on the Kremlin. His basic message was - it is coming, but not quite yet, because it is impossible to enact immediately and would probably lead to shutdowns of large swathes of the German economy. President Zelensky used a BBC interview last week to demand an immediate embargo on Russia's lucrative oil trade, accusing those sending euros and dollars to Kremlin-controlled oil giants of ""trading in blood"". He singled out Germany alongside Hungary for blocking EU action. Mr Lindner said Germany would move as fast as possible, but did not confirm that would be within a year. In Berlin this issue appears to be putting some stress on the three-party governing coalition. Mr Lindner leads the free market FDP, not the normal bedfellows for the Social Democrats and Greens. Meanwhile Green Party leader Annalena Baerbock, also the foreign minister, said dependence on Russian oil would definitely finish by the end of the year. The Chancellery under Olaf Scholz appears to be the most cautious on this issue. Germany has already called off the opening of Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to the war, a project pursued by previous governments of different political stripes. But Mr Lindner said he was concerned about the macroeconomic effects an overnight shut-off of Russian energy would cause. ""I don't fear [the] economic costs [of buying less Russian energy]. I fear the physical scenario, if you have to stop the supply, for a complete production line, this causes more than economic costs,"" Mr Lindner told the BBC. ""I think it's preferable to have sanctions, which we can stand for months, for years,"" he said. Mr Lindner said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the root cause of growing geopolitical and economic risks including inflation, food shortages and a debt crisis for low income countries. But he also criticised the approach of previous Berlin governments of relying on Russia for oil and gas. ""It was a strategic miscalculation from German governments, over the last two decades, and now we have to work on energy diversification,"" he said.

Russian oligarch lambasts country's 'massacre',"A Russian tycoon has lambasted the country's ""massacre"" in Ukraine and called for an end to the ""crazy war"". Oleg Tinkov wrote in a profanity-littered Instagram post that he did not see ""any beneficiary"" of the conflict. Mr Tinkov is one of Russia's most well-known entrepreneurs and founded the global online bank Tinkoff Bank and owned the cycling team Tinkoff-Saxo. He is also one of the most high profile Russians to publicly condemn President Vladimir Putin's actions. Two of the country's most prominent oligarchs Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have made separate calls for peace, but have stopped short of direct criticism. Mr Fridman, a billionaire banker,has said any personal remarks could be a risknot just to himself but also staff and colleagues. However, the businessman Boris Mints, who worked for the Russian government in the 1990s but was discharged of his political roles four days after Mr Putin took office, has joined Mr Tinkov in voicing direct criticism of the president. Mr Mints, who lives in the UK, is the subject of current legal action by the Kremlin. He told the BBC ""every right-thinking person has a duty to speak out against this appalling war and Vladimir Putin's growing authoritarianism"". ""All of us must do what we can to support Ukrainians suffering from this vicious onslaught, whether in Ukraine or as refugees beyond its borders,"" he added. Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? The UK government has sanctioned Mr Tinkov along with many other Russians identified as having close links to the Kremlim. Mr Mints has not been sanctioned. Warning: This story contains language some may find offensive. Mr Tinkov has previously denied having any close relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin. In his Instagram post, Mr Tinkov said 90% of Russians were against the war in Ukraine and added ""morons in any country are 10%"". ""I don't see a SINGLE beneficiary of this insane war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying,"" Mr Tinkov added. ""Waking up with a hangover, the generals realised that they have a shit army. ""And how will the army be good, if everything else in the country is shitty and mired in nepotism, sycophancy and servility?"" Before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Mr Tinkov's wealth had been estimated at more than $4.4bn (Â£3.4bn). But he has since lost his billionaire status as shares in his bank have plummeted, Forbes reported last month. Switching to English in his post, Mr Tinkov wrote: ""Dear 'collective West' please give Mr Putin a clear exit to save his face and stop this massacre. Please be more rational and humanitarian."" Oleg Tinkov used to own cycling team Tinkoff-Saxo In a statement, Tinkoff Bank said it would not comment on the ""private opinion"" of its founder, who stepped down as chairman in 2020, saying he no longer made decisions for the brand started in 2006. Mr Tinkov, who is not currently in Russia, owns about 35% of Cyprus-based TCS Group Holding, whose stable of companies under the Tinkoff brand span sectors from banking and insurance to mobile services. He has been described as a ""serial entrepreneur"" whose career has seen him go from bike racing, to importing electronics, flogging frozen food, brewing beer, issuing credit cards and then back to bike racing as owner of cycling's Tinkoff-Saxo team.

'This may be our last address' - Mariupol commander,"This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian commander calls for extraction from Mariupol, saying forces are facing their last hours A Ukrainian marine commander in Mariupol has made what he described as his troops' ""last address to the world"" as they try to resist overwhelming Russian forces in the city. They were outnumbered and running out of supplies, Major Serhiy Volyna said. A Russian deadline for the surrender of Ukrainian forces has passed with no sign that the troops have complied. The last holdouts are sheltering in the city's huge Azovstal steel plant, reportedly with 1,000 civilians. Kyiv said there was a tentative deal to rescue some civilians from the city. The city's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told national TV that Ukraine had hoped to send 90 buses to evacuate about 6,000 people on Wednesday. He said around 100,000 people are trapped in Mariupol. However, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko subsequently said that fewer buses than planned were able to reach trapped civilians and not many were evacuated. ""People of course gathered at the agreed meeting points, but few of them got onto the buses,"" he told Reuters news agency without giving specific figures. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but in a video message sent to the BBC, Maj Volyna, said around 500 injured troops were being cared for at the steel plant. Maj Volyna, who leads the 36th marine battalion, said his troops were running low on supplies and that the video marked ""our last address to the world. It may be our last one ever"". He said that Russian forces outnumbered his own by ""dozens of times,"" and that while Ukrainian morale remains high, Moscow's forces ""prevail in the air, in artillery, in ground troops, and in machines and tanks"". As Russian forces advanced slowly into the heart of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal complex became a home to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters from the Azov battalion - a controversial national guard unit with links to the far-right. The site is a mass of tunnels and workshops, and provides a natural advantage to defenders. Yan Gagin, an official with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state news network RIA Novosti over the weekend that there is ""basically another city"" beneath the plant. Russia has been bombarding the factory with artillery and air raids, and Moscow has issued two demands for the troops to surrender. An advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is targeting the defenders with bunker busters - colossal bombs designed to penetrate thick armour and kill targets underground. Smoke rises over the Azovstal plant after a Russian bombardment This is the second ultimatum Ukrainian troops at the plant have faced this week. Despite this, and the vicious nature of the Russian siege, Ukraine's defence ministry said not a single soldier surrendered when a similar ultimatum lapsed on Monday.

If it's safe: Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Deputy Mayor Orlov warned that basic supplies at the plant have almost run out. ""They have an absolute lack of everything. A lack of water, food, medicines, help, and Russia totally blocks everything, any humanitarian help or evacuation,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Olena Nikulina's cousin is fighting with Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. She saidher last contact with him had been on 8 Marchwhen he told her his unit had ""very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers"". Ukrainian officials say around 100,000 civilians remain in the city, which has been almost totally levelled by the Russian bombardment. Several previous attempts to organise humanitarian corridors from the city have failed, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of bad faith in negotiations and refusals to guarantee compliance with ceasefires. But Ms Vereshchuk said Moscow has agreed to allow 6,000 people to evacuate the city on Wednesday. Ukraine has previously alleged that Russia has been forcibly evacuating thousands of Ukrainian civilians from the city into Russia. US defence officials said on Tuesday that around 76 battalion tactical groups - combined Russian armour, infantry and air defence units - are operating inside Ukraine, with around 12 of these focused on the assault in Mariupol. If the city were to fall it would free up around 10,000 troops to take part in the refocused Russian assault on the Donbas region, and allow Moscow to link up its forces on the annexed Crimean Peninsula with separatist forces in the east. If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. The fall of Mariupol would also offer President Vladimir Putin a major propaganda opportunity. His forces have only captured one major Ukrainian city - Kherson - and seizing Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. Capturing the Azov battalion would also allow Mr Putin to play into his baseless narrative that the Ukrainian government has been overrun by ""Nazis"".

Netflix hints at password sharing crackdown,"A new series of Stranger Things will air in May Netflix has hinted it will crack down on households sharing passwords as it seeks to sign up new members following a sharp fall in subscribers. The number of households using the streaming service fell by 200,000 in the first three months of the year as it faced stiff competition from rivals. It was also hit after it raised prices in some countries and left Russia. Netflix warned shareholders another two million subscribers were likely to leave in the three months to July. ""Our revenue growth has slowed considerably,"" the firm told shareholders on Tuesday after publishing its first quarter results. ""Our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts - combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds."" The streaming giant estimates more than 100 million households watch the service for free using shared passwords. Boss Reed Hastings previously described the practice as ""something you have to learn to live with"", adding that much of it is ""legitimate"" between family members. The firm also said account sharing had probably fuelled its growth by getting more people using Netflix. Households cancel streaming services to cut costs Bridgerton gets third and fourth series on Netflix But on Tuesday, Mr Hastings said it was making it hard to attract new subscribers in some countries. ""When we were growing fast, it wasn't a high priority to work on [account sharing]. And now we're working super hard on it,"" he told shareholders. The firm said payment plans it is testing to curb password sharing in Latin America could be rolled out to other countries. Since last month, account holders in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru must pay to add user profiles for people outside their household (the company currently allows people who live together to share their Netflix account). Users can add up to two extra profiles for $2-$3 (Â£1.53-Â£2.30) a month each, on top of their regular fee. Netflix - which did not say how it would enforce the rule - said it was seeking a ""customer centric"" solution. ""The principle way we have is asking our members to pay a bit more to share the service outside their homes,"" said Greg Peters, Netflix's chief product officer. Dominic Sunnebo, an analyst at research firm Kantar, warned the plan could backfire at a time when consumers were looking for ways to save money. ""If the schemes to counter password sharing move too fast and too aggressively, it also risks alienating a potential future audience - many who password-share beyond the household are not actually aware they're breaking the terms of their subscription."" Netflix said that pulling out of Russia in March in response to the Ukraine war had cost it 700,000 subscribers. And another 600,000 people stopped using its service in the US and Canada after it put up prices in January. The firm raised prices across all of its US plans, with a basic plan increasing from $9 to $10 per month, and a standard from $14 to $15.50. In the UK, basic and standard plans have both increased by Â£1 a month to Â£6.99 and Â£10.99 respectively. Netflix said the price rises would yield more money for the firm, despite the cancellations. But analysts say the rising cost of streaming services is wearing on households as the cost of living rises. In the UK,households cancelled more than 1.5 million streaming subscriptions in the first three months of the year, with 38% saying they wanted to save money. One of Netflix most popular series, Bridgerton, launched its second series last month Seeming to acknowledge this, Mr Hastings said Netflix was looking at launching a free ad-supported service like its rivals Disney and HBO. Analysts say it could open a significant new revenue stream for the company, which has so far shunned advertising. ""Those who have followed Netflix know that I've been against the complexity of advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,"" he said. ""But, as much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice."" Netflix's biggest threat is intense competition from firms such as Amazon, Apple and Disney, which are pouring money into their online streaming services, according to experts. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said Netflix's subscriber loss was a ""reality check"", as it tries to balance retaining subscribers with raising its revenue.

North America especially is ""now awash with too many services chasing too few dollars"", he added. Shares in the streaming giant plunged in early trade in New York on Wednesday, dropping more than 30% off the back of the update. The firm - which remains the world's leading streaming service with more than 220 million subscribers - had enjoyed uninterrupted quarterly growth in subscribers since October 2011. However, it said a surge in sign-ups during the pandemic had ""obscured"" the real picture around its growth. It made revenue of $7.8bn (Â£6bn) in the first three months of the year, up 9.8% compared with the same period last year.

Wimbledon bans Russian and Belarusian players,"Daniil Medvedev replaced Novak Djokovic at the top of the world rankings for three weeks in 2022 Russian and Belarusian players will not be allowed to compete at Wimbledon this year because of the invasion of Ukraine. Men's world number two Daniil Medvedev of Russia and women's world number four Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus are the highest-ranked players to be affected. The players are also banned from any of the UK grass-court tournaments. The governing bodies of men's and women's professional tennis said the move was ""unfair"". Serbia's Novak Djokovic, a six-time men's singles champion at Wimbledon, said he did not support the ""crazy"" decision by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC). The men's body, the ATP, said it could ""set a damaging precedent for the game"", while the women's body, the WTA, said it was ""very disappointed"". In a statement, the ATP said: ""Discrimination based on nationality also constitutes a violation of our agreement with Wimbledon that states that player entry is based solely on ATP rankings. ""Any course of action in response to this decision will now be assessed in consultation with our board and member councils."" The WTA said it ""will be evaluating its next steps and what actions may be taken regarding these decisions"". Djokovic, the men's world number one, added: ""The players, the tennis players, the athletes have nothing to do with war. When politics interferes with sport, the result is not good."" Martina Navratilova, who won a record nine Wimbledon singles titles, said excluding Russian and Belarusian players was ""not the way to go"". ""I think it's the wrong decision. Tennis is such a democratic sport. It is difficult when you see politics destroy it,"" said the Czech-born American. Wimbledon runs from 27 June to 10 July. Explaining its decision, the AELTC said it had a responsibility to ""limit Russia's global influence through the strongest means possible"". ""In the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players,"" a statement from the AELTC read. ""It is therefore our intention, with deep regret, to decline entries from Russian and Belarusian players to Wimbledon."" Sabalenka reached the semi-finals of last year's tournament, while Medvedev, who has beenannounced as one of the star draws,externalat the grass-court warm-up event at 's-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands today, reached the fourth round. Russian world number 15 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova - whocalled for the war to stop,externalearlier this year - and 18th-ranked Victoria Azarenka of Belarus will also miss out. Russia's Andrey Rublev is eighth in the men's standings, with compatriot Karen Khachanov 26th. Only players are banned, which means coaches, umpires and physiotherapists can be involved in the tournament. While the Lawn Tennis Association has banned Russian or Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer, they will all still be able to play at the French Open, which begins in May. Players from both countries have been allowed to compete on the tennis tour but not under their national flags. Which sports have banned Russian athletes? The ATP said Russian and Belarusian players would still be allowed to compete at its events under a neutral flag. ""Our sport is proud to operate on the fundamental principles of merit and fairness, where players compete as individuals to earn their place in tournaments based on the ATP rankings,"" it said. ""We believe that today's unilateral decision by Wimbledon and the LTA to exclude players from Russia and Belarus from this year's British grass-court swing is unfair and has the potential to set a damaging precedent for the game."" The WTA said: ""Individual athletes should not be penalized or prevented from competing due to where they are from, or the decisions made by the governments of their countries. ""Discrimination, and the decision to focus such discrimination against athletes competing on their own as individuals, is neither fair nor justified. The WTA will continue to apply its rules to reject discrimination and ensure that all athletes are able to compete at our Tour events should they qualify to do so, a position that until today's announcement has been shared across professional tennis."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov criticised the ban. ""Given that Russia is a strong tennis country and our athletes are among those at the top of the world rankings, the tournament itself would suffer because of this ban,"" he said. ""It is unacceptable to make the athletes once again hostages of certain political prejudice, intrigues and hostile actions towards our country."" The AELTC, which organises Wimbledon,consulted the governmentin April about whether to allow players to compete. ""We recognise that this is hard on the individuals affected, and it is with sadness that they will suffer for the actions of the leaders of the Russian regime,"" AELTC chairman Ian Hewitt said. ""Given the importance of not allowing sport to be used to promote the Russian regime and our broader concerns for public and player (including family) safety, we do not believe it is viable to proceed on any other basis at The Championships."" The AELTC is also working to withdraw TV rights from companies broadcasting in Russia and Belarus. Although the AELTC statement says the decision could be overturned if ""circumstances change materially between now and June"", that is considered very unlikely. A statement from the LTA said it is ""important to do all it can to support Ukraine at this time"". ""The LTA believes that tennis must join many other areas of sport and public life in sending a clear signal to the Russian and Belarusian states that their actions are the subject of international condemnation,"" a statement read. ""The continuing participation of Russian and Belarusian nationals at events risks providing a boost to these regimes when there is an unprecedented international effort to isolate them and sanction their actions."" UK sports minister Nigel Huddleston welcomed the ""decisive action"" by the AELTC and LTA. ""The UK has taken a leading role internationally to make clear President Putin must not be able to use sport to legitimise Russia's barbaric invasion of Ukraine. Whilst the withdrawal of individual athletes is a complex issue that will divide opinion, there is a bigger cause at stake."" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries added: ""This decision means Putin won't use the most iconic Grand Slam in tennis to try to legitimise the horrors he is inflicting on the Ukrainian people. The right move."" Russia was previously banned from defending its Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup team titles afterthe country's invasion of Ukraine- a military operation supported by Belarus. The ATP and the WTA have suspended their combined event scheduled to take place in Moscow in October. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has also cancelled its events in the country. Ukrainian world number 25 Elina Svitolina released a lengthy statement on Wednesday, calling on tennis' governing bodies to take a harsher stance against Russian and Belarusian athletes. Svitolina has taken a break from the sport to deal with a back problem and the emotional impact the invasion has had on her. She posted on social media urging the ATP, WTA and ITF to ask Russian and Belarusian players if they supported the war, the military activities in Ukraine or the regimes of Russian and Belarusian presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko. ""If applicable, we demand to exclude and ban any Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in any events,"" she wrote. ""In times of crisis, silence means agreeing with what is happening. ""There comes a time when silence is betrayal, and that time is now."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Olga Savchuk, who captained Ukraine in last week's Billie Jean King Cup tie against the USA, said Russian players should be banned from competing. ""It cannot just be a sanction against 90% of the Russian people and 10% not,"" Savchuktold the New York Times.,external ""It has to be even and I think it is collective guilt."" Ukrainian former world number 13 Alexandr Dolgopolov thanked Wimbledon for ""stepping up and showing the world an example"". ""I believe Russia should be isolated in all possible ways, and the people of Russia have to solve this problem,"" he told BBC Sport. This is a decision which makes the All England Club and the LTA stand out from the crowd. Not in the sporting sphere, in general, as athletics, badminton, canoeing and rowing have all banned individual athletes from Russia and Belarus. But in tennis, the initial French Open entry lists have been published with these players present, and neither the WTA nor the ATP Tour feel it is fair to prevent these individuals continuing their careers. There may possibly be some movement from Roland Garros after Sunday's second round of the French presidential election, but the approach in tennis thus far has been to ban Russian teams but let individuals play on - albeit it with their nationalities removed from scoreboards and ranking lists. A large majority of players have been happy with this stance up until now, but given the scale of what has been happening in Ukraine, and taking into account British public sentiment, the AELTC felt it had no alternative. And this with the possibility of legal repercussions in mind. The LTA, for example, has contracts in place with the ATP and the WTA for the grass-court events they stage at venues such as Queen's and Eastbourne in June.

Depp to face questioning in case against ex-wife,"Johnny Depp has sought to paint ex-wife Amber Heard as a volatile spouse who abused and demeaned him. The actor, 58, has sued Ms Heard over an article she wrote saying she was a victim of domestic violence. Mr Depp has denied any abuse. Ms Heard, 35, has sued him in return, with a $100m (Â£76m) counterclaim. In his testimony, Mr Depp said he felt ""pure hatred"" from Ms Heard. Cross-examination from her lawyers began on Wednesday after two days of testimony. His testimony is set to resume into a third day on Thursday. After the romance of their first year together soured, the pair argued regularly, he said, with Ms Heard frequently issuing a ""sarcastic, demeaning, aggressive, violent, toxic spew"", and occasionally resorting to violence. ""It could begin with a slap,"" Mr Depp said. ""It could begin with throwing a TV remote at my head. It could be throwing a glass of wine in my face."" ""She has a need for conflict. She has a need for violence,"" he said. And in recordings of the former couple played to the jury on Wednesday, Ms Heard can be heard admitting she ""did start a physical fight"" with Mr Depp. Mr Depp also recalled a now-infamous incident between him and his former wife, in which he found ""human fecal matter"" on his side of the bed in the flat he shared with Ms Heard. ""It was so bizarre and so grotesque, that I could only laugh,"" he said. Ms Heard has denied that she or any of her friends left human excrement on the bed, testifying in Mr Depp's 2018 defamation trial in the UK that the idea was ""absolutely disgusting"". Jurors in the closely watched civil trial, which is taking place in Virginia, have heard two wildly different accounts of Mr Depp and Ms Heard's relationship. Lawyers for Ms Heard have so far worked to portray Mr Depp as a physically and sexually abusive partner prone to drug and alcohol binges. Mr Depp addressed his drug and alcohol use on Wednesday, saying he had become addicted to prescription opioids after receiving Roxycodone for a back injury. The actor testified that while detoxing from the drugs, Ms Heard withheld medication from him that would have relieved symptoms of withdrawal because she said it was not time for the next dose. The actor said he rolled on the floor, in tears, and begged. ""I hate saying this, having to admit this, but that was about the lowest point in my life."" As Johnny Depp settled down for day two on the witness stand there was only the briefest glance across the court towards where his ex-wife Amber Heard was sitting. Throughout it all she sat watching intently, occasionally writing a few notes as Mr Depp began to describe his views about their relationship - a relationship she says was violent and abusive. On day one of his testimony, his answers at the beginning had been marked by hesitations and long searches for the right words. The Johnny Depp of day two was immediately rather more fluent as he described how their marriage disintegrated and how he felt her behaviour had become controlling and belittling. It was, he said, an ""endless parade of insults and looking at me like I was a fool"". ""I was not allowed a voice."" The reason for the long description on the previous day of his problematic relationship with his mother now began to make sense. The criticisms from Ms Heard and his responses to it made him realise he was in a relationship with his ""mother"". There was a little smile as he reflected on what he had said. He also talked about celebrity and the impossibility of dealing with everything that was written about him. ""Your arms are too short to box with God,"" he said. His drinking was, he said, a means of dealing with the pain of the relationship. It was Ms Heard who would strike him, he claimed. He would retreat, booking extra rooms when they were travelling so he had a place to escape. As they rose for recess, he looked straight ahead. Ms Heard watched, her face giving nothing away. Her side of the story is yet to be told. Under cross-examination, Ms Heard's lawyer Ben Rottenborn had Mr Depp confirm that his name is not mentioned in the 2018 op-ed in question. ""I think that it's very easy to write a piece and put the finger on someone without saying their name,"" Mr Depp replied. ""There are sneaky ways of writing things."" The lawyer also asked why Mr Depp did not sue after Ms Heard accused him of assault in a restraining order two years earlier, in May 2016. ""I was advised by my attorney not to fight,"" Mr Depp said. Mr Rottenborn additionally introduced into evidence a divorce document the couple signed in August 2016 that stated: ""Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain."" The defamation trial is now into its second week. Earlier, the jury heard evidence presented by the celebrity ex-couple's former therapist, who described how Mr Depp and Ms Heard engaged in ""mutual abuse"", as well as from medical workers who treated Mr Depp as he was detoxing himself from opiates. Several high profile witnesses, including the entrepreneur Elon Musk and the actors James Franco and Paul Bettany, are to appear later in the trial, which is expected to last at least another month.

Oligarch who said sanctions won't help is frozen out,"This video can not be played Mikhail Fridman said the conflict in Ukraine should be stopped One of Russia's richest men who said imposing sanctions on oligarchs would have no impact on the war in Ukraine has been frozen out of a company. Investment firm LetterOne confirmed Mikhail Fridman's shareholdings had been ""frozen indefinitely"", along with those of long-time partner Pyotr Aven. Neither man can receive dividends or any other financial benefit. LetterOne said it was ""taking all action necessary"" to protect the 120,000 jobs its investments support. It added its board had decided to make a donation of $150m (Â£114m) to support people affected by the war in Ukraine. Mr Fridman and Mr Aven set up LetterOne, an international investment business based in Luxembourg, in 2013. The billionaire bankers both stepped down from the company last week after being sanctioned by the EU over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Mr Fridman said the war was a tragedy for both sides, but stopped short of direct criticism, adding personal remarks could be a risk not just to himself but also staff and colleagues. Russian oligarch warns sanctions will not stop war Who is not on the UK sanctions list? Mr Fridman, who is the founder Russia's biggest investment bank, Alfa, said the sanctions, which freeze some assets and impose a travel ban, were unjustified and he would fight them. However, the oligarch, who has extensive interests in oil and retailing, added the sanctions would not have the desired effect of helping to rein in the Kremlin. Born in Ukraine before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Mr Fridman has been described by the European Union as an enabler of Putin's inner circle. The EU also says Pyotr Aven, who created Alfa-Bank with Mr Fridman, is one of President Vladimir Putin's closest oligarchs. Mervyn Davies, chairman of LetterOne, said everyone involved in the firm ""would want us to take these steps given their love and passion for and heritage in Ukraine"". Mr Davies, a former UK Labour government minister, is himself facing pressure to cut ties with LetterOne. The company said three other Russian board members, German Khan, Alexey Kuzmichev and Andrei Kosogov, had resigned from their positions as they believed it was ""the right thing to do"". Lord Barker was a former government energy minister Separately, Conservative peer Lord Barker has stepped down as chairman of EN+, the London-listed owner of Russian aluminium giant Rusal. Rusal was founded by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an industrialist with close ties to President Putin. Lord Barker, who quit after he faced pressure to cut ties following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, earned $4m (Â£3m) in 2020 from EN+ and $7.8m in 2019. Although he has resigned,the Sunday Times reported,externalit is understood that he plans to take over large parts of the business in a restructuring aimed at distancing the company from Russia. In a statement, EN+ said it was considering ""carving out"" Rusal's international business. It has not announced if Lord Barker is part of its plans. Who is not on the UK sanctions list? Mr Deripaska is one of the richest men linked to President Putin - having made billions from his stake in Russia's aluminium industries, including EN+, which he owns 45% of. He first became widely known in the UK in 2008, when it emerged he had been involved in talks over a donation to the Conservative Party via George Osborne. The donation was never made but the story triggered a row at the time about links between British politicians and Russia's elites. He has been subject toUS sanctions since 2018,externalbut is not under any sanctions in the UK. In a tweet,externalon Monday, Mr Deripaska said: ""We need peace as soon as possible, as we have already passed the point of no return. ""The entire world will be different, Russia will be different as well."" Mr Deripaska (left) pictured with President Putin in 2014 Politicians with links to Russian oligarchs have been criticised since the start of the war in Ukraine, with the Institute of Directors (IoD) saying it is ""no longer tenable for British directors to be involved in governance roles in the Russian economy"". In a poll of its members, the IoD said 86% supported the view that all British people should now resign their Russian board mandates. Senior politicians also called on Lord Barker to sever ties to Mr Deripaska, rather than continuing to work for companies linked to the billionaire. Lord Barker was appointed as independent chairman of EN+ after the company was listed on stock markets in London and Moscow in 2017, before being appointed executive chairman in 2019. He was previously a member of the House of Commons from 2001 to 2015, before being made a life peer. He took a leave of absence from the House of Lords in 2019 aftertaking up his position with EN+.,external Elsewhere, Sandra Stash, an American non-executive director of Russian steel company Evraz stepped down from the firm, which is part-owned by Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, who has a 29% stake in the company. Ms Stash became the second member of the company's board to step down, with James Rutherford, a British member of the board, quitting last week. Meanwhile, Ian Cockerill, the British chairman of the London and Moscow-listed precious metals mining company Polymetal, stepped down from the company's board, along with five other members - Ollie Oliveira, Tracey Kerr, Italia Boninelli, Victor Flores and Andrea Abt. Polymetal was founded in Saint Petersburg and operates a number of gold and silver mines in Russia, Kazakhstan and Armenia.

Germany to ban Russian oil imports by end of year,"Germany is moving ""as fast as possible"" to end its reliance on Russian energy, but it will take time, the country's finance minister has said. ""We have to be patient,"" Christian Lindner told the BBC. By contrast, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock had earlier said Germany would end oil imports by the end of the year, with gas following. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky hascriticised Germany for failing to curb Russian energy imports. He described energy payments as ""blood money"". Proceeds from the sale of Russian oil and gas amount to around $1bn (Â£770m) a day, undermining international efforts to put economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin to end the war. The US has already banned Russian oil imports and the UK plans to phase them out by the end of the year. But EU countries are more heavily dependent on Russian energy, with Germany currently buying around 25% of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia. Save energy and annoy Putin, Germans told Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Mr Lindner told the BBC that his country was working to implement an embargo on Russian energy but that he preferred using sanctions which ""hurt [Putin] more than us"". He said a sudden halt to Russian energy imports could see the physical shutdown of German producers such as manufacturers and carmakers. Earlier this week, German economic institutes warned that immediately halting Russian imports would spark a sharp recession in Europe's biggest economy by 2023. ""We are willing to stop all energy imports from Russia, it's just a matter of time,"" said Mr Lindner, who is leader of the liberal Free Democrats, one constituent of Germany's coalition government. He insisted that any calculation on Vladimir Putin's part that Germany would continue to rely on Russian energy was ""wrong"". ""In the end, we don't want to have any further business with Putin,"" he said. However his stance was at odds with statements made by Germany's foreign minister, Ms Baerbock, a prominent Green politician and former co-leader of the party. Ms Baerbock said Germany would halve Russian oil imports by the summer and eliminate them altogether by the end of the year, to be followed quickly by a reduction in Russian gas imports. Germany's finance minister was keen to sound tough on Russia and appears acutely aware of the criticism levelled at his country for dragging its feet over a full energy embargo on the Kremlin. His basic message was - it is coming, but not quite yet, because it is impossible to enact immediately and would probably lead to shutdowns of large swathes of the German economy. President Zelensky used a BBC interview last week to demand an immediate embargo on Russia's lucrative oil trade, accusing those sending euros and dollars to Kremlin-controlled oil giants of ""trading in blood"". He singled out Germany alongside Hungary for blocking EU action. Mr Lindner said Germany would move as fast as possible, but did not confirm that would be within a year. In Berlin this issue appears to be putting some stress on the three-party governing coalition. Mr Lindner leads the free market FDP, not the normal bedfellows for the Social Democrats and Greens. Meanwhile Green Party leader Annalena Baerbock, also the foreign minister, said dependence on Russian oil would definitely finish by the end of the year. The Chancellery under Olaf Scholz appears to be the most cautious on this issue. Germany has already called off the opening of Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to the war, a project pursued by previous governments of different political stripes. But Mr Lindner said he was concerned about the macroeconomic effects an overnight shut-off of Russian energy would cause. ""I don't fear [the] economic costs [of buying less Russian energy]. I fear the physical scenario, if you have to stop the supply, for a complete production line, this causes more than economic costs,"" Mr Lindner told the BBC. ""I think it's preferable to have sanctions, which we can stand for months, for years,"" he said. Mr Lindner said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the root cause of growing geopolitical and economic risks including inflation, food shortages and a debt crisis for low income countries. But he also criticised the approach of previous Berlin governments of relying on Russia for oil and gas. ""It was a strategic miscalculation from German governments, over the last two decades, and now we have to work on energy diversification,"" he said.

French rivals for presidency clash in TV debate,"This video can not be played WATCH: Le Pen and Macron come to blows over headscarf policy The two candidates for the French presidency have gone head to head in their only televised debate, ahead of Sunday's second-round run-off vote. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has fallen behind centrist Emmanuel Macron in the opinion polls but millions of voters are still undecided. It did not take long for the two-hour-45-minute clash to burst into life. The candidates confronted each other on the cost of living, Russia, climate change and immigration. Around 15.6 million viewers watched the debate, in which Mr Macron accused his rival of being dependent on Russian power while Marine Le Pen called him a hypocrite on climate change. Spiralling prices have dominated the campaign and immediately took centre stage in the debate. Emmanuel Macron was widely seen as the winner of the pair's 2017 encounter, when his rival appeared flustered and underprepared. But this time, Marine Le Pen was ready from the start and far more composed. Throughout the debate, it was Mr Macron who went on the offensive, appearing more like a challenger than an incumbent, repeatedly interrupting his rival. Ms Le Pen said 70% of the French people believed their standard of living had fallen over the past five years and she would be the president of civil peace and national brotherhood. ""We need to give priority to the French in their own country,"" she said. Mr Macron said France had known unprecedented crisis, with Covid followed by war in Europe. He had steered France through those challenges and aimed to make France a stronger country: the vote was a ""referendum on Europe, on secularism, and a moment of clear choice"", he said. Despite a strong performance from Ms Le Pen, a snap Elabe poll of voters suggested 59% of viewers thought Mr Macron had come out the winner. This video can not be played WATCH: Voters react to the Macron and Le Pen TV debate The sitting president was seen as most presidential, by 53% to 29%, although half of viewers also said he had come across as arrogant. Ms Le Pen was narrowly deemed to be more in tune with normal people, although 50% found her ""worrying"". The president's difficulty was that unlike in 2017, he is now defending a record in office. It meant that when asked what he planned for a second mandate, he had to stick to the unexciting option of continuity. His opponent could make hay with attacks on the inevitable failures of five years in government. And yet, the president never gave the feeling he was not on solid ground. His attacks on Marine Le Pen over the Russian loan, over Europe and over the Islamic headscarf all hit home. On the economy, he argued forcefully that his already-enacted proposals for protecting the French from inflation - a cap on fuel prices and tax exemption for pay bonuses - were both fairer and more effective than Madame Le Pen's ideas. And in the main, he avoided the trap of coming over as too arrogant or technocratic. Often, he gave the impression of wanting to launch himself more strongly against his opponent but of holding himself back. Read Hugh's full analysis After a relatively civil start, it quickly turned combative when the two candidates addressed the biggest issue for voters. Cost of living:From the start Marine Le Pen said this was her priority: ""I will permanently cut VAT on energy. I will also cut taxes, no income tax for under-30s."" She accused Mr Macron on letting pension levels fall in real terms too. Mr Macron said his solution was to impose a cap on prices which was ""twice as effective as dropping sales tax"". They became animated as they disagreed on how to bring down energy prices. Mr Macron repeatedly challenged his opponent's proposals as unworkable. She snapped back: ""I want to give the French their money back."" Mr Macron frequently went on the offensive during the long debate Russia's war in Ukraine:Emmanuel Macron said Russia was ""going down a fatal path"" and the role of France and Europe was to provide Ukraine with military equipment and take in refugees. Ms Le Pen, criticised for her close ties to the Kremlin and for taking a Russian bank loan for her party, warned that giving Ukraine weapons could make France a ""co-belligerent"". However, she supported her opponent's policy of backing Ukraine and taking in refugees. At this point Mr Macron went on the offensive, pointing out she was one of the first political leaders in 2014 to recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""You're speaking to your banker when you speak to Russia,"" he said. Ms Le Pen said she had taken Russian money as no French bank would lend to her party. When she argued that she had had to borrow money like millions of French people, he countered that the French did not look to Russia for finance. At one point Marine Le Pen held up a printed tweet to prove her backing for a free Ukraine European Union:Marine Le Pen has changed her policy from leaving the EU to seeking change from within it. But Mr Macron argued that her idea of a ""Europe of nations"" would spell the end of the EU and that ""you are selling a lie"". In the current EU she said France was failing to defend its interests and she would stop negotiating trade deals that ""hurt French producers and farmers"". Retirement age:This is another of the big election issues: Emmanuel Macron has said France needs to raise the pension age from 62 to 65 over nine years, while Ms Le Pen wants to keep it at 62. Ms Le Pen said his proposal was ""absolutely intolerable"". He hit back saying she was promising to be more generous with pensioners but did not explain how she would pay for it. Climate change:Renewable energy is another issue where the two candidates are diametrically opposed and it became one of the most animated points of the debate. The only thing they agree on is building more nuclear power stations. ""You are a climate sceptic, that's pretty obvious,"" Mr Macron said to his rival. The only Green presidential candidate has urged his voters to back the incumbent president. Marine Le Pen retorted that he was a ""climate hypocrite"". Marine Le Pen argued importing goods from thousands of miles away was responsible for climate change and producing locally would help tackle global warming. There was nothing worse than wind turbines, she complained. He countered that her policy of relying on nuclear power to replace fossil fuels was ""untenable"" and renewables had to be part of the mix. ""Wind turbines create jobs,"" he added. Immigration and Islam:Marine Le Pen went on the offensive, promising a referendum on who should stay and who should leave France and condemning what she called ""anarchic and massive immigration"" that contributed to a sense of insecurity. She then spoke about another of her key policies, banning the wearing of the headscarf in public, arguing that women had to be liberated from ""Islamist pressure"". Mr Macron objected it was wrong to mix Islam with Islamism. Her policy, he said, would lead to ""civil war"" and was a betrayal of French values: ""You would have police running down the street after girls in headscarves and [Jewish] boys wearing the kippah."" It was intolerant and she was pushing millions of compatriots out of the public space on account of their religion, he said. Constitutional change:Another of Marine Le Pen's big policies is for citizens' referendums, which she said were rooted in the yellow-vest orgilets jaunesprotests that began early in the Macron presidency. ""The main problem after your five-year term is that you have divided the country. We need to rebuild France and bring people together."" One of the big attractions of such referendums for Ms Le Pen is that they would bypass parliament, where she has only a handful of MPs. Mr Macron said they would be unconstitutional. Televised confrontations between the top two candidates have been a highlight of French presidential elections for almost five decades and they have proved most decisive when the polls are close. In 1974, conservative ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing went on to beat Socialist FranÃ§ois Mitterrand after performing well in their debate. Mitterrand did better in the rematch in 1981 and won the run-off vote. This was the first time since then that the same candidates have squared off in two consecutive elections. The 2017 debate was a disaster for Ms Le Pen that led to a big election defeat. This time around the race is much closer and her strong performance could help win over undecided voters. The gap in the opinion polls has widened slightly since the first round vote in which the incumbent president won 27.85% and Ms Le Pen came second with 23.15%. But they are still fluctuating wildly, suggesting Mr Macron will secure between 53% and 57% of the vote. The choice for voters is far clearer than five years ago, when Emmanuel Macron won with very little experience as a politician. His strict Covid policies alienated many voters and he has been accused of acting as a ""president for the rich"". He is more popular in the big cities but has secured the support of other mainstream left and right parties for his pro-EU liberal and global outlook. Marine Le Pen has toned down her nationalist, anti-EU rhetoric during the campaign but as she made clear in the debate her aim remains to revise France's relationship with the European Union.

French rivals for presidency to clash in TV debate,"This video can not be played WATCH: Le Pen and Macron come to blows over headscarf policy The two candidates for the French presidency have gone head to head in their only televised debate, ahead of Sunday's second-round run-off vote. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has fallen behind centrist Emmanuel Macron in the opinion polls but millions of voters are still undecided. It did not take long for the two-hour-45-minute clash to burst into life. The candidates confronted each other on the cost of living, Russia, climate change and immigration. Around 15.6 million viewers watched the debate, in which Mr Macron accused his rival of being dependent on Russian power while Marine Le Pen called him a hypocrite on climate change. Spiralling prices have dominated the campaign and immediately took centre stage in the debate. Emmanuel Macron was widely seen as the winner of the pair's 2017 encounter, when his rival appeared flustered and underprepared. But this time, Marine Le Pen was ready from the start and far more composed. Throughout the debate, it was Mr Macron who went on the offensive, appearing more like a challenger than an incumbent, repeatedly interrupting his rival. Ms Le Pen said 70% of the French people believed their standard of living had fallen over the past five years and she would be the president of civil peace and national brotherhood. ""We need to give priority to the French in their own country,"" she said. Mr Macron said France had known unprecedented crisis, with Covid followed by war in Europe. He had steered France through those challenges and aimed to make France a stronger country: the vote was a ""referendum on Europe, on secularism, and a moment of clear choice"", he said. Despite a strong performance from Ms Le Pen, a snap Elabe poll of voters suggested 59% of viewers thought Mr Macron had come out the winner. This video can not be played WATCH: Voters react to the Macron and Le Pen TV debate The sitting president was seen as most presidential, by 53% to 29%, although half of viewers also said he had come across as arrogant. Ms Le Pen was narrowly deemed to be more in tune with normal people, although 50% found her ""worrying"". The president's difficulty was that unlike in 2017, he is now defending a record in office. It meant that when asked what he planned for a second mandate, he had to stick to the unexciting option of continuity. His opponent could make hay with attacks on the inevitable failures of five years in government. And yet, the president never gave the feeling he was not on solid ground. His attacks on Marine Le Pen over the Russian loan, over Europe and over the Islamic headscarf all hit home. On the economy, he argued forcefully that his already-enacted proposals for protecting the French from inflation - a cap on fuel prices and tax exemption for pay bonuses - were both fairer and more effective than Madame Le Pen's ideas. And in the main, he avoided the trap of coming over as too arrogant or technocratic. Often, he gave the impression of wanting to launch himself more strongly against his opponent but of holding himself back. Read Hugh's full analysis After a relatively civil start, it quickly turned combative when the two candidates addressed the biggest issue for voters. Cost of living:From the start Marine Le Pen said this was her priority: ""I will permanently cut VAT on energy. I will also cut taxes, no income tax for under-30s."" She accused Mr Macron on letting pension levels fall in real terms too. Mr Macron said his solution was to impose a cap on prices which was ""twice as effective as dropping sales tax"". They became animated as they disagreed on how to bring down energy prices. Mr Macron repeatedly challenged his opponent's proposals as unworkable. She snapped back: ""I want to give the French their money back.""

Emotional farewell at singer Tom Parker's funeral,"Mourners followed a horse-drawn hearse in south-east London Hundreds of fans have gathered outside the funeral of The Wanted singer Tom Parker, who died from brain cancer last month at the age of 33. They saw the star's widow, Kelsey, lead a hearse pulled by four black horses through Petts Wood, south-east London. On the side of the carriage, flowers spelled the words ""Tom"" and ""Daddy"". The title of the boy band's 2011 number one Glad You Came also formed a floral tribute outside St Francis of Assisi church. Stars including One Direction's Liam Payne and Parker's bandmates from The Wanted were amongst those in attendance. Traffic came to a standstill as the hearse, with a floral tribute to Tom, was driven through the streets One Direction star Liam Payne was among those in attendance at the service Fans were invited to pay their respects as the funeral procession made its way down the Queensway in Petts Wood. Traffic came to a standstill and the large crowd fell silent as the coffin was carried from the undertaker's into the waiting hearse. The silence, save for the occasional dog barking or baby crying, was striking for what is normally a busy high street. But as the procession set off on the 15-minute walk to the church, the hundreds of fans were encouraged by the celebrant to ""clap and cheer loudly"" - which they duly did. Upon arrival, family and friends made their way into the church as others congregated outside to watch the service on four large TV screens that had been erected outside. Many were in tears, hugging each other. Some were dressed in black, but others wore brightly-coloured T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with The Wanted's logo. Parker's bandmates Jay McGuiness, Max George, Siva Kaneswaran and Nathan Sykes carried his coffin into the church as the poignant Champagne Supernova by Oasis played over the speakers. The Wanted's Max George (left) and Jay McGuiness helped carry the coffin into the church Parker's brother Lewis, his wife Kelsey and his bandmates were among those who shared memories or did readings during the service. George delivered a touching and often-humorous speech as he shared memories of working with Parker. ""As we were carrying Tom in, I could actually hear him saying, 'It's about time', because he's carried us for the last 15 years,"" he joked. ""Tom was and always will be a brother to myself and my bandmates. He made such an impact on us from the start, and his love for music and his striving for success outmatched any of us."" He continued: ""[Tom] was the only member of The Wanted to have a punch-up with every member of The Wanted."" The mourners laughed warmly as Kaneswaran, who was standing beside George, added: ""He did lose every fight, by the way."" ""It is so wonderful to see all the support for Tom,"" Kaneswaran continued. ""There's one thing we can all agree on - Tom Parker was an absolute hero."" Parker's widow Kelsey (centre) with family members outside the funeral George concluded: ""He has left us far too early and we will miss him so much. The heartbreak shared here today is a credit to the love Tom shared. The people outside, the people all around the world, is a credit to him. Rest easy, mate."" Kelsey's eulogy was pre-recorded because, she explained, she would have found it ""too painful to stand up in front of everyone"". In her audio message, she recalled meeting Tom outside a nightclub when she was 19. The singer asked if he could add her on Facebook, ""and the rest is history,"" she said. ""I told everyone from that moment, I'm going to marry Tom Parker. ""Life with you, Tom, was never boring,"" she continued. ""We spent a lot of our first years together drinking Mahiki [nightclub] dry, dancing all night long, parties in our Battersea flat, and having the funniest, most irrelevant drunken fights. ""Tom, your energy was never-ending and your creativity was out of this world. We all know how much you loved an invention, I bet you're gutted you never made it on Dragons' Den. ""You were the best husband I could ever ask for... You did everything with love and no malice."" Parker married Kelsey in 2018, and the couple have two young children, Aurelia Rose and Bodhi. The singer's picture was on the front of the funeral order of service Tom's mother, in a message read out by the singer's brother Lewis, said: ""We have nothing but love and pride for not only his achievements, but his positive attitude, resourcefulness and determination. ""We will always be faithfully and unswervingly at his side. He was an amazing son and brother who we love dearly."" Bolton-born Parker died at the end of March, almost 18 months after he revealed he had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour. Kaneswaran remembered Parker's ""big Boltonian heart"", adding: ""He was never afraid to stand up for what was right, no matter the risk."" Other songs played during the service included Handbags and Gladrags by Stereophonics, Live Forever by Oasis, the hymn Amazing Grace and The Wanted's own single Gold Forever. As the coffin was taken from the church back to the hearse, some fans released golden heart-shaped balloons from the crowd. The Wanted fans Bethan (left) and Tamara told the BBC their butterfly hairclips were a tribute to Parker After the ceremony, fans comforted each other and shared their memories of meeting Parker and seeing the band in concert. ""Tom has been like a constant in our lives for like 12 years,"" one fan, Bethan, told BBC News. ""If you tweeted him, he'd always respond to you and big you up. It was like you were his favourite person in the world whenever you got to speak to him. ""And he was our favourite person in the world. None of us want to be here, obviously, but we get to do this together."" Another fan, Tamara, said the large number of people attending the funeral ""just shows the legacy he has created, and the love he has outpoured to so many people"". ""This love is for Kelsey and the family. We're so grateful we got the opportunity to be here for this."" She added: ""The funeral was a real tribute to Tom. To hear his family speak about him. I wasn't even surprised hearing the stories because it was kind of like we know him already. So it was just a beautiful moment to hear those stories."" Another member of the same group, Maddie, said: ""He was so lovely. He was always welcoming, the nicest person and the loveliest man."" All four friends had met Parker several times over the years. ""He loved his fame, he knew the power he held with being famous,"" Bethan said. ""So he always made sure he felt the love we'd been able to give him. He didn't take a second for granted with any of us."" Recalling one encounter with Parker, she said: ""Outside a radio station, I remember him running away from security, trying to come back to us. He wanted to be with us. Maddie (far right) described Parker as ""the nicest person and the loveliest man"" ""I'll cry listening to their music, but I won't ever not love listening to it, because that was our communication with him. It's going to be painful listening to their music for a long time, but he loved being in The Wanted."" Bethan and Tamara explained that they were wearing butterfly hairclips in tribute to Tom - the butterfly has been adopted by many fans as a symbol for the band. ""Everything is butterflies because of Gold Forever,"" Bethan explained. ""Could he have written a more perfect song to remember him by? We're all getting tattoos of butterflies and the lyrics of Gold Forever, all because of him."" Fans were seen crying and singing along to Gold Forever as it played at the end of the service. The lyrics seemed particularly fitting at the funeral: ""Say my name like it's the last time / Live today like its your last night / We want to cry but we know its alright / 'Cause I'm with you and you're with me / Butterflies, butterflies, we were meant to fly."" ""You'll have seen butterflies everywhere,"" said Bethan. ""If you go on Twitter you'll see most of our fan accounts have got the blue butterfly emoji in, and whenever Kelsey posts something there's always a butterfly in it, because that's our strongest symbol of connection with him."" The Wanted had 10 UK top-10 singles between 2010 and 2013, including All Time Low, Chasing The Sun, Heart Vacancy and Lightning.

"French rivals for presidency to clash in TV debateFour days before the vote, far-right leader Marine Le Pen is behind Emmanuel Macron in the polls.","This video can not be played WATCH: Le Pen and Macron come to blows over headscarf policy The two candidates for the French presidency have gone head to head in their only televised debate, ahead of Sunday's second-round run-off vote. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has fallen behind centrist Emmanuel Macron in the opinion polls but millions of voters are still undecided. It did not take long for the two-hour-45-minute clash to burst into life. The candidates confronted each other on the cost of living, Russia, climate change and immigration.

They became animated as they disagreed on how to bring down energy prices. Mr Macron repeatedly challenged his opponent's proposals as unworkable. She snapped back: ""I want to give the French their money back."" Mr Macron frequently went on the offensive during the long debate Russia's war in Ukraine:Emmanuel Macron said Russia was ""going down a fatal path"" and the role of France and Europe was to provide Ukraine with military equipment and take in refugees. Ms Le Pen, criticised for her close ties to the Kremlin and for taking a Russian bank loan for her party, warned that giving Ukraine weapons could make France a ""co-belligerent"". However, she supported her opponent's policy of backing Ukraine and taking in refugees. At this point Mr Macron went on the offensive, pointing out she was one of the first political leaders in 2014 to recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""You're speaking to your banker when you speak to Russia,"" he said. Ms Le Pen said she had taken Russian money as no French bank would lend to her party. When she argued that she had had to borrow money like millions of French people, he countered that the French did not look to Russia for finance. At one point Marine Le Pen held up a printed tweet to prove her backing for a free Ukraine European Union:Marine Le Pen has changed her policy from leaving the EU to seeking change from within it. But Mr Macron argued that her idea of a ""Europe of nations"" would spell the end of the EU and that ""you are selling a lie"". In the current EU she said France was failing to defend its interests and she would stop negotiating trade deals that ""hurt French producers and farmers"". Retirement age:This is another of the big election issues: Emmanuel Macron has said France needs to raise the pension age from 62 to 65 over nine years, while Ms Le Pen wants to keep it at 62. Ms Le Pen said his proposal was ""absolutely intolerable"". He hit back saying she was promising to be more generous with pensioners but did not explain how she would pay for it. Climate change:Renewable energy is another issue where the two candidates are diametrically opposed and it became one of the most animated points of the debate. The only thing they agree on is building more nuclear power stations. ""You are a climate sceptic, that's pretty obvious,"" Mr Macron said to his rival. The only Green presidential candidate has urged his voters to back the incumbent president. Marine Le Pen retorted that he was a ""climate hypocrite"". Marine Le Pen argued importing goods from thousands of miles away was responsible for climate change and producing locally would help tackle global warming. There was nothing worse than wind turbines, she complained. He countered that her policy of relying on nuclear power to replace fossil fuels was ""untenable"" and renewables had to be part of the mix. ""Wind turbines create jobs,"" he added. Immigration and Islam:Marine Le Pen went on the offensive, promising a referendum on who should stay and who should leave France and condemning what she called ""anarchic and massive immigration"" that contributed to a sense of insecurity. She then spoke about another of her key policies, banning the wearing of the headscarf in public, arguing that women had to be liberated from ""Islamist pressure"". Mr Macron objected it was wrong to mix Islam with Islamism. Her policy, he said, would lead to ""civil war"" and was a betrayal of French values: ""You would have police running down the street after girls in headscarves and [Jewish] boys wearing the kippah."" It was intolerant and she was pushing millions of compatriots out of the public space on account of their religion, he said. Constitutional change:Another of Marine Le Pen's big policies is for citizens' referendums, which she said were rooted in the yellow-vest orgilets jaunesprotests that began early in the Macron presidency. ""The main problem after your five-year term is that you have divided the country. We need to rebuild France and bring people together."" One of the big attractions of such referendums for Ms Le Pen is that they would bypass parliament, where she has only a handful of MPs. Mr Macron said they would be unconstitutional. Televised confrontations between the top two candidates have been a highlight of French presidential elections for almost five decades and they have proved most decisive when the polls are close. In 1974, conservative ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing went on to beat Socialist FranÃ§ois Mitterrand after performing well in their debate. Mitterrand did better in the rematch in 1981 and won the run-off vote. This was the first time since then that the same candidates have squared off in two consecutive elections. The 2017 debate was a disaster for Ms Le Pen that led to a big election defeat. This time around the race is much closer and her strong performance could help win over undecided voters. The gap in the opinion polls has widened slightly since the first round vote in which the incumbent president won 27.85% and Ms Le Pen came second with 23.15%. But they are still fluctuating wildly, suggesting Mr Macron will secure between 53% and 57% of the vote. The choice for voters is far clearer than five years ago, when Emmanuel Macron won with very little experience as a politician. His strict Covid policies alienated many voters and he has been accused of acting as a ""president for the rich"". He is more popular in the big cities but has secured the support of other mainstream left and right parties for his pro-EU liberal and global outlook. Marine Le Pen has toned down her nationalist, anti-EU rhetoric during the campaign but as she made clear in the debate her aim remains to revise France's relationship with the European Union.

Man admits posting offensive Grenfell model videoThe clip of a model Grenfell Tower burning on a bonfire was made at a party a year after the disaster.London,"Paul Bussetti handed himself in to police when the footage went viral A man has admitted sharing a grossly offensive video of a cardboard model of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire. Paul Bussetti, of Sundial Avenue in Croydon, south London, pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court. The clip was recorded at a party in south London a year after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, which killed 72 people, and was shared on WhatsApp. The 49-year-old was given a 10-week suspended jail sentence. Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring said he was ""horrified"" when he saw the film. He said: ""It was disgusting, it was disrespectful, it was abhorrent and it was - by the nature of the charge - grossly offensive. ""I suspect it was offensive to almost everybody who has an ounce of decency about them."" Paul Bussetti was given a 10-week suspended jail sentence Bussetti was previously found not guilty of posting the video at a two-day trial in August 2019 but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) appealed against the verdict. His acquittal was later quashed by the High Court. The magistrates court heard Bussetti filmed the footage, which was taken at an annual bonfire party hosted by a friend in November 2018, and posted it in two WhatsApp groups - one football-related and one for a holiday group. It prompted outrage when it was then shared widely online and made the national news, and was criticised as ""vile"" by a relative of one of the 72 victims of the disaster in west London. The court heard direct and indirect references were made in Bussetti's footage about the residents of Grenfell Tower. They included: ""Who's jumping?"", ""Don't worry, stay in your flats"", and ""Jump out of the window"". The model was burned at a bonfire party in south London on 3 November 2018 The court heard Bussetti said: ""That's what happens when you don't pay the rent."" He could also be heard making siren noises. Another person, who was not the defendant, could be heard making a racist comment in the video, while others could be heard laughing. The court heard Bussetti handed himself in to police when the footage went viral. Bussetti is said to have told police: ""It was all over the telly and so we thought it was better to tell the truth. ""It was terrible, definitely offensive to people, it was just complete stupidness, one of those stupid moments."" A victim impact statement on behalf of the Grenfell victims said ""the overall reaction of the Grenfell community was one of shock, horror and outrage"" at the video. In his ruling in August 2019, High Court judge Lord Justice Bean said he did not accept Bussetti's argument - that the figures in the bonfire were his friends - as a defence.

"Father wants 'flawed' suicide assessment overhauledHis son Tom died a day after being judged ""low risk"", in a final counselling session, Philip Pirie says.Health","A father whose son took his own life in July 2020 is calling for an ""urgent overhaul"" of the way some counsellors and therapists assess suicide risk. His son Tom had died a day after being judged ""low risk"", in a final counselling session, Philip Pirie said. A group of charities has written to the health secretary, saying the use of a checklist-type questionnaire to predict suicide risk is ""fundamentally flawed"". The government says it is now drawing up a new suicide-prevention strategy. BBC Action Line: Information and Support Trio meet ministers over suicide awareness lessons Mum's plea to young people after daughter's death According to the latest official data, 6,211 people in the UK killed themselves in 2020. It is the most common cause of death in 20-34-year-olds. And of the 17 people each day, on average, who kill themselves, five are in touch with mental health services and four of those five are assessed as ""low"" or ""no risk"", campaigners say. Tom Pirie, a young teacher from Fulham, west London, had been receiving help for mental-health issues. He had repeatedly told counsellors about his suicidal thoughts - but the day before he had killed himself, a psychotherapist had judged him low risk, his father said. ""It's difficult to admit suicidal thoughts, especially for young men,"" Philip told BBC One's Breakfast programme. ""And the danger, if the client is labelled at low risk, is they get the impression that this is not a topic to go into any further. ""And that is absolutely wrong."" Tom's assessment had been based on ""inadequate"" questionnaires widely used despite guidelines saying they should not be to predict suicidal behaviour, Philip said. The checklists, which differ depending on the clinicians and NHS trusts involved, typically ask patients questions about their mental health, such as ""Do you have suicidal thoughts?"" or ""Do you have suicidal intentions?"" At the end of the session, a score can be generated - placing the individual at low, medium or high risk of suicide, or rating the danger on a scale between one and 10. Allow Twitter content?

Hundreds shelter in factory as Mariupol holds out,"This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian commander calls for extraction from Mariupol, saying forces are facing their last hours A Ukrainian marine commander in Mariupol has made what he described as his troops' ""last address to the world"" as they try to resist overwhelming Russian forces in the city. They were outnumbered and running out of supplies, Major Serhiy Volyna said. A Russian deadline for the surrender of Ukrainian forces has passed with no sign that the troops have complied. The last holdouts are sheltering in the city's huge Azovstal steel plant, reportedly with 1,000 civilians. Kyiv said there was a tentative deal to rescue some civilians from the city. The city's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told national TV that Ukraine had hoped to send 90 buses to evacuate about 6,000 people on Wednesday. He said around 100,000 people are trapped in Mariupol. However, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko subsequently said that fewer buses than planned were able to reach trapped civilians and not many were evacuated. ""People of course gathered at the agreed meeting points, but few of them got onto the buses,"" he told Reuters news agency without giving specific figures. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but in a video message sent to the BBC, Maj Volyna, said around 500 injured troops were being cared for at the steel plant. Maj Volyna, who leads the 36th marine battalion, said his troops were running low on supplies and that the video marked ""our last address to the world. It may be our last one ever"". He said that Russian forces outnumbered his own by ""dozens of times,"" and that while Ukrainian morale remains high, Moscow's forces ""prevail in the air, in artillery, in ground troops, and in machines and tanks"". As Russian forces advanced slowly into the heart of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal complex became a home to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters from the Azov battalion - a controversial national guard unit with links to the far-right. The site is a mass of tunnels and workshops, and provides a natural advantage to defenders. Yan Gagin, an official with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state news network RIA Novosti over the weekend that there is ""basically another city"" beneath the plant. Russia has been bombarding the factory with artillery and air raids, and Moscow has issued two demands for the troops to surrender. An advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is targeting the defenders with bunker busters - colossal bombs designed to penetrate thick armour and kill targets underground. Smoke rises over the Azovstal plant after a Russian bombardment This is the second ultimatum Ukrainian troops at the plant have faced this week. Despite this, and the vicious nature of the Russian siege, Ukraine's defence ministry said not a single soldier surrendered when a similar ultimatum lapsed on Monday.

If it's safe: Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Deputy Mayor Orlov warned that basic supplies at the plant have almost run out. ""They have an absolute lack of everything. A lack of water, food, medicines, help, and Russia totally blocks everything, any humanitarian help or evacuation,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Olena Nikulina's cousin is fighting with Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. She saidher last contact with him had been on 8 Marchwhen he told her his unit had ""very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers"". Ukrainian officials say around 100,000 civilians remain in the city, which has been almost totally levelled by the Russian bombardment. Several previous attempts to organise humanitarian corridors from the city have failed, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of bad faith in negotiations and refusals to guarantee compliance with ceasefires. But Ms Vereshchuk said Moscow has agreed to allow 6,000 people to evacuate the city on Wednesday. Ukraine has previously alleged that Russia has been forcibly evacuating thousands of Ukrainian civilians from the city into Russia. US defence officials said on Tuesday that around 76 battalion tactical groups - combined Russian armour, infantry and air defence units - are operating inside Ukraine, with around 12 of these focused on the assault in Mariupol. If the city were to fall it would free up around 10,000 troops to take part in the refocused Russian assault on the Donbas region, and allow Moscow to link up its forces on the annexed Crimean Peninsula with separatist forces in the east. If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. The fall of Mariupol would also offer President Vladimir Putin a major propaganda opportunity. His forces have only captured one major Ukrainian city - Kherson - and seizing Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. Capturing the Azov battalion would also allow Mr Putin to play into his baseless narrative that the Ukrainian government has been overrun by ""Nazis"".

As Russian forces advanced slowly into the heart of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal complex became a home to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters from the Azov battalion - a controversial national guard unit with links to the far-right. The site is a mass of tunnels and workshops, and provides a natural advantage to defenders. Yan Gagin, an official with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state news network RIA Novosti over the weekend that there is ""basically another city"" beneath the plant. Russia has been bombarding the factory with artillery and air raids, and Moscow has issued two demands for the troops to surrender. An advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is targeting the defenders with bunker busters - colossal bombs designed to penetrate thick armour and kill targets underground. Smoke rises over the Azovstal plant after a Russian bombardment This is the second ultimatum Ukrainian troops at the plant have faced this week. Despite this, and the vicious nature of the Russian siege, Ukraine's defence ministry said not a single soldier surrendered when a similar ultimatum lapsed on Monday.

""They have an absolute lack of everything. A lack of water, food, medicines, help, and Russia totally blocks everything, any humanitarian help or evacuation,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Olena Nikulina's cousin is fighting with Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. She saidher last contact with him had been on 8 Marchwhen he told her his unit had ""very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers"". Ukrainian officials say around 100,000 civilians remain in the city, which has been almost totally levelled by the Russian bombardment. Several previous attempts to organise humanitarian corridors from the city have failed, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of bad faith in negotiations and refusals to guarantee compliance with ceasefires. But Ms Vereshchuk said Moscow has agreed to allow 6,000 people to evacuate the city on Wednesday. Ukraine has previously alleged that Russia has been forcibly evacuating thousands of Ukrainian civilians from the city into Russia. US defence officials said on Tuesday that around 76 battalion tactical groups - combined Russian armour, infantry and air defence units - are operating inside Ukraine, with around 12 of these focused on the assault in Mariupol. If the city were to fall it would free up around 10,000 troops to take part in the refocused Russian assault on the Donbas region, and allow Moscow to link up its forces on the annexed Crimean Peninsula with separatist forces in the east. If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. The fall of Mariupol would also offer President Vladimir Putin a major propaganda opportunity. His forces have only captured one major Ukrainian city - Kherson - and seizing Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. Capturing the Azov battalion would also allow Mr Putin to play into his baseless narrative that the Ukrainian government has been overrun by ""Nazis"".

Germany to ban Russian oil imports by end of yearGermany currently gets a quarter of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia,"Germany is moving ""as fast as possible"" to end its reliance on Russian energy, but it will take time, the country's finance minister has said. ""We have to be patient,"" Christian Lindner told the BBC. By contrast, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock had earlier said Germany would end oil imports by the end of the year, with gas following. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky hascriticised Germany for failing to curb Russian energy imports. He described energy payments as ""blood money"". Proceeds from the sale of Russian oil and gas amount to around $1bn (Â£770m) a day, undermining international efforts to put economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin to end the war. The US has already banned Russian oil imports and the UK plans to phase them out by the end of the year. But EU countries are more heavily dependent on Russian energy, with Germany currently buying around 25% of its oil and 40% of its gas from Russia. Save energy and annoy Putin, Germans told Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Mr Lindner told the BBC that his country was working to implement an embargo on Russian energy but that he preferred using sanctions which ""hurt [Putin] more than us"". He said a sudden halt to Russian energy imports could see the physical shutdown of German producers such as manufacturers and carmakers. Earlier this week, German economic institutes warned that immediately halting Russian imports would spark a sharp recession in Europe's biggest economy by 2023. ""We are willing to stop all energy imports from Russia, it's just a matter of time,"" said Mr Lindner, who is leader of the liberal Free Democrats, one constituent of Germany's coalition government. He insisted that any calculation on Vladimir Putin's part that Germany would continue to rely on Russian energy was ""wrong"". ""In the end, we don't want to have any further business with Putin,"" he said. However his stance was at odds with statements made by Germany's foreign minister, Ms Baerbock, a prominent Green politician and former co-leader of the party. Ms Baerbock said Germany would halve Russian oil imports by the summer and eliminate them altogether by the end of the year, to be followed quickly by a reduction in Russian gas imports. Germany's finance minister was keen to sound tough on Russia and appears acutely aware of the criticism levelled at his country for dragging its feet over a full energy embargo on the Kremlin. His basic message was - it is coming, but not quite yet, because it is impossible to enact immediately and would probably lead to shutdowns of large swathes of the German economy. President Zelensky used a BBC interview last week to demand an immediate embargo on Russia's lucrative oil trade, accusing those sending euros and dollars to Kremlin-controlled oil giants of ""trading in blood"". He singled out Germany alongside Hungary for blocking EU action. Mr Lindner said Germany would move as fast as possible, but did not confirm that would be within a year. In Berlin this issue appears to be putting some stress on the three-party governing coalition. Mr Lindner leads the free market FDP, not the normal bedfellows for the Social Democrats and Greens. Meanwhile Green Party leader Annalena Baerbock, also the foreign minister, said dependence on Russian oil would definitely finish by the end of the year. The Chancellery under Olaf Scholz appears to be the most cautious on this issue. Germany has already called off the opening of Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to the war, a project pursued by previous governments of different political stripes. But Mr Lindner said he was concerned about the macroeconomic effects an overnight shut-off of Russian energy would cause. ""I don't fear [the] economic costs [of buying less Russian energy]. I fear the physical scenario, if you have to stop the supply, for a complete production line, this causes more than economic costs,"" Mr Lindner told the BBC. ""I think it's preferable to have sanctions, which we can stand for months, for years,"" he said. Mr Lindner said Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the root cause of growing geopolitical and economic risks including inflation, food shortages and a debt crisis for low income countries. But he also criticised the approach of previous Berlin governments of relying on Russia for oil and gas. ""It was a strategic miscalculation from German governments, over the last two decades, and now we have to work on energy diversification,"" he said. Save energy and annoy Putin, Germans told How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

Fans pay respects to singer Tom Parker at funeral,"Mourners followed a horse-drawn hearse in south-east London Hundreds of fans have gathered outside the funeral of The Wanted singer Tom Parker, who died from brain cancer last month at the age of 33. They saw the star's widow, Kelsey, lead a hearse pulled by four black horses through Petts Wood, south-east London. On the side of the carriage, flowers spelled the words ""Tom"" and ""Daddy"". The title of the boy band's 2011 number one Glad You Came also formed a floral tribute outside St Francis of Assisi church. Stars including One Direction's Liam Payne and Parker's bandmates from The Wanted were amongst those in attendance. Traffic came to a standstill as the hearse, with a floral tribute to Tom, was driven through the streets One Direction star Liam Payne was among those in attendance at the service Fans were invited to pay their respects as the funeral procession made its way down the Queensway in Petts Wood. Traffic came to a standstill and the large crowd fell silent as the coffin was carried from the undertaker's into the waiting hearse. The silence, save for the occasional dog barking or baby crying, was striking for what is normally a busy high street. But as the procession set off on the 15-minute walk to the church, the hundreds of fans were encouraged by the celebrant to ""clap and cheer loudly"" - which they duly did. Upon arrival, family and friends made their way into the church as others congregated outside to watch the service on four large TV screens that had been erected outside. Many were in tears, hugging each other. Some were dressed in black, but others wore brightly-coloured T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with The Wanted's logo. Parker's bandmates Jay McGuiness, Max George, Siva Kaneswaran and Nathan Sykes carried his coffin into the church as the poignant Champagne Supernova by Oasis played over the speakers. The Wanted's Max George (left) and Jay McGuiness helped carry the coffin into the church Parker's brother Lewis, his wife Kelsey and his bandmates were among those who shared memories or did readings during the service. George delivered a touching and often-humorous speech as he shared memories of working with Parker. ""As we were carrying Tom in, I could actually hear him saying, 'It's about time', because he's carried us for the last 15 years,"" he joked. ""Tom was and always will be a brother to myself and my bandmates. He made such an impact on us from the start, and his love for music and his striving for success outmatched any of us."" He continued: ""[Tom] was the only member of The Wanted to have a punch-up with every member of The Wanted."" The mourners laughed warmly as Kaneswaran, who was standing beside George, added: ""He did lose every fight, by the way."" ""It is so wonderful to see all the support for Tom,"" Kaneswaran continued. ""There's one thing we can all agree on - Tom Parker was an absolute hero."" Parker's widow Kelsey (centre) with family members outside the funeral George concluded: ""He has left us far too early and we will miss him so much. The heartbreak shared here today is a credit to the love Tom shared. The people outside, the people all around the world, is a credit to him. Rest easy, mate."" Kelsey's eulogy was pre-recorded because, she explained, she would have found it ""too painful to stand up in front of everyone"". In her audio message, she recalled meeting Tom outside a nightclub when she was 19. The singer asked if he could add her on Facebook, ""and the rest is history,"" she said. ""I told everyone from that moment, I'm going to marry Tom Parker. ""Life with you, Tom, was never boring,"" she continued. ""We spent a lot of our first years together drinking Mahiki [nightclub] dry, dancing all night long, parties in our Battersea flat, and having the funniest, most irrelevant drunken fights. ""Tom, your energy was never-ending and your creativity was out of this world. We all know how much you loved an invention, I bet you're gutted you never made it on Dragons' Den. ""You were the best husband I could ever ask for... You did everything with love and no malice."" Parker married Kelsey in 2018, and the couple have two young children, Aurelia Rose and Bodhi. The singer's picture was on the front of the funeral order of service Tom's mother, in a message read out by the singer's brother Lewis, said: ""We have nothing but love and pride for not only his achievements, but his positive attitude, resourcefulness and determination. ""We will always be faithfully and unswervingly at his side. He was an amazing son and brother who we love dearly."" Bolton-born Parker died at the end of March, almost 18 months after he revealed he had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour. Kaneswaran remembered Parker's ""big Boltonian heart"", adding: ""He was never afraid to stand up for what was right, no matter the risk."" Other songs played during the service included Handbags and Gladrags by Stereophonics, Live Forever by Oasis, the hymn Amazing Grace and The Wanted's own single Gold Forever. As the coffin was taken from the church back to the hearse, some fans released golden heart-shaped balloons from the crowd. The Wanted fans Bethan (left) and Tamara told the BBC their butterfly hairclips were a tribute to Parker After the ceremony, fans comforted each other and shared their memories of meeting Parker and seeing the band in concert. ""Tom has been like a constant in our lives for like 12 years,"" one fan, Bethan, told BBC News. ""If you tweeted him, he'd always respond to you and big you up. It was like you were his favourite person in the world whenever you got to speak to him. ""And he was our favourite person in the world. None of us want to be here, obviously, but we get to do this together."" Another fan, Tamara, said the large number of people attending the funeral ""just shows the legacy he has created, and the love he has outpoured to so many people"". ""This love is for Kelsey and the family. We're so grateful we got the opportunity to be here for this."" She added: ""The funeral was a real tribute to Tom. To hear his family speak about him. I wasn't even surprised hearing the stories because it was kind of like we know him already. So it was just a beautiful moment to hear those stories."" Another member of the same group, Maddie, said: ""He was so lovely. He was always welcoming, the nicest person and the loveliest man."" All four friends had met Parker several times over the years. ""He loved his fame, he knew the power he held with being famous,"" Bethan said. ""So he always made sure he felt the love we'd been able to give him. He didn't take a second for granted with any of us."" Recalling one encounter with Parker, she said: ""Outside a radio station, I remember him running away from security, trying to come back to us. He wanted to be with us. Maddie (far right) described Parker as ""the nicest person and the loveliest man"" ""I'll cry listening to their music, but I won't ever not love listening to it, because that was our communication with him. It's going to be painful listening to their music for a long time, but he loved being in The Wanted."" Bethan and Tamara explained that they were wearing butterfly hairclips in tribute to Tom - the butterfly has been adopted by many fans as a symbol for the band. ""Everything is butterflies because of Gold Forever,"" Bethan explained. ""Could he have written a more perfect song to remember him by? We're all getting tattoos of butterflies and the lyrics of Gold Forever, all because of him."" Fans were seen crying and singing along to Gold Forever as it played at the end of the service. The lyrics seemed particularly fitting at the funeral: ""Say my name like it's the last time / Live today like its your last night / We want to cry but we know its alright / 'Cause I'm with you and you're with me / Butterflies, butterflies, we were meant to fly."" ""You'll have seen butterflies everywhere,"" said Bethan. ""If you go on Twitter you'll see most of our fan accounts have got the blue butterfly emoji in, and whenever Kelsey posts something there's always a butterfly in it, because that's our strongest symbol of connection with him."" The Wanted had 10 UK top-10 singles between 2010 and 2013, including All Time Low, Chasing The Sun, Heart Vacancy and Lightning.

"Russian oligarch lambasts country's 'massacre'Businessman Oleg Tinkov, is one of the most high profile Russians to publicly condemn the war.Business","A Russian tycoon has lambasted the country's ""massacre"" in Ukraine and called for an end to the ""crazy war"". Oleg Tinkov wrote in a profanity-littered Instagram post that he did not see ""any beneficiary"" of the conflict. Mr Tinkov is one of Russia's most well-known entrepreneurs and founded the global online bank Tinkoff Bank and owned the cycling team Tinkoff-Saxo. He is also one of the most high profile Russians to publicly condemn President Vladimir Putin's actions. Two of the country's most prominent oligarchs Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have made separate calls for peace, but have stopped short of direct criticism. Mr Fridman, a billionaire banker,has said any personal remarks could be a risknot just to himself but also staff and colleagues. However, the businessman Boris Mints, who worked for the Russian government in the 1990s but was discharged of his political roles four days after Mr Putin took office, has joined Mr Tinkov in voicing direct criticism of the president. Mr Mints, who lives in the UK, is the subject of current legal action by the Kremlin. He told the BBC ""every right-thinking person has a duty to speak out against this appalling war and Vladimir Putin's growing authoritarianism"". ""All of us must do what we can to support Ukrainians suffering from this vicious onslaught, whether in Ukraine or as refugees beyond its borders,"" he added. Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? The UK government has sanctioned Mr Tinkov along with many other Russians identified as having close links to the Kremlim. Mr Mints has not been sanctioned. Warning: This story contains language some may find offensive. Mr Tinkov has previously denied having any close relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin. In his Instagram post, Mr Tinkov said 90% of Russians were against the war in Ukraine and added ""morons in any country are 10%"". ""I don't see a SINGLE beneficiary of this insane war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying,"" Mr Tinkov added. ""Waking up with a hangover, the generals realised that they have a shit army. ""And how will the army be good, if everything else in the country is shitty and mired in nepotism, sycophancy and servility?"" Before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Mr Tinkov's wealth had been estimated at more than $4.4bn (Â£3.4bn). But he has since lost his billionaire status as shares in his bank have plummeted, Forbes reported last month. Switching to English in his post, Mr Tinkov wrote: ""Dear 'collective West' please give Mr Putin a clear exit to save his face and stop this massacre. Please be more rational and humanitarian."" Oleg Tinkov used to own cycling team Tinkoff-Saxo In a statement, Tinkoff Bank said it would not comment on the ""private opinion"" of its founder, who stepped down as chairman in 2020, saying he no longer made decisions for the brand started in 2006. Mr Tinkov, who is not currently in Russia, owns about 35% of Cyprus-based TCS Group Holding, whose stable of companies under the Tinkoff brand span sectors from banking and insurance to mobile services. He has been described as a ""serial entrepreneur"" whose career has seen him go from bike racing, to importing electronics, flogging frozen food, brewing beer, issuing credit cards and then back to bike racing as owner of cycling's Tinkoff-Saxo team.

"Hundreds shelter in factory as Mariupol holds outAs a Russian ultimatum for Mariupol's surrender passes, Kyiv hopes to evacuate thousands still trapped.Europe","This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian commander calls for extraction from Mariupol, saying forces are facing their last hours A Ukrainian marine commander in Mariupol has made what he described as his troops' ""last address to the world"" as they try to resist overwhelming Russian forces in the city. They were outnumbered and running out of supplies, Major Serhiy Volyna said. A Russian deadline for the surrender of Ukrainian forces has passed with no sign that the troops have complied. The last holdouts are sheltering in the city's huge Azovstal steel plant, reportedly with 1,000 civilians. Kyiv said there was a tentative deal to rescue some civilians from the city. The city's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told national TV that Ukraine had hoped to send 90 buses to evacuate about 6,000 people on Wednesday. He said around 100,000 people are trapped in Mariupol. However, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko subsequently said that fewer buses than planned were able to reach trapped civilians and not many were evacuated. ""People of course gathered at the agreed meeting points, but few of them got onto the buses,"" he told Reuters news agency without giving specific figures. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but in a video message sent to the BBC, Maj Volyna, said around 500 injured troops were being cared for at the steel plant. Maj Volyna, who leads the 36th marine battalion, said his troops were running low on supplies and that the video marked ""our last address to the world. It may be our last one ever"". He said that Russian forces outnumbered his own by ""dozens of times,"" and that while Ukrainian morale remains high, Moscow's forces ""prevail in the air, in artillery, in ground troops, and in machines and tanks"".

Upon arrival, family and friends made their way into the church as others congregated outside to watch the service on four large TV screens that had been erected outside. Many were in tears, hugging each other. Some were dressed in black, but others wore brightly-coloured T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with The Wanted's logo. Parker's bandmates Jay McGuiness, Max George, Siva Kaneswaran and Nathan Sykes carried his coffin into the church as the poignant Champagne Supernova by Oasis played over the speakers. The Wanted's Max George (left) and Jay McGuiness helped carry the coffin into the church Parker's brother Lewis, his wife Kelsey and his bandmates were among those who shared memories or did readings during the service. George delivered a touching and often-humorous speech as he shared memories of working with Parker. ""As we were carrying Tom in, I could actually hear him saying, 'It's about time', because he's carried us for the last 15 years,"" he joked. ""Tom was and always will be a brother to myself and my bandmates. He made such an impact on us from the start, and his love for music and his striving for success outmatched any of us."" He continued: ""[Tom] was the only member of The Wanted to have a punch-up with every member of The Wanted."" The mourners laughed warmly as Kaneswaran, who was standing beside George, added: ""He did lose every fight, by the way."" ""It is so wonderful to see all the support for Tom,"" Kaneswaran continued. ""There's one thing we can all agree on - Tom Parker was an absolute hero."" Parker's widow Kelsey (centre) with family members outside the funeral George concluded: ""He has left us far too early and we will miss him so much. The heartbreak shared here today is a credit to the love Tom shared. The people outside, the people all around the world, is a credit to him. Rest easy, mate."" Kelsey's eulogy was pre-recorded because, she explained, she would have found it ""too painful to stand up in front of everyone"". In her audio message, she recalled meeting Tom outside a nightclub when she was 19. The singer asked if he could add her on Facebook, ""and the rest is history,"" she said. ""I told everyone from that moment, I'm going to marry Tom Parker. ""Life with you, Tom, was never boring,"" she continued. ""We spent a lot of our first years together drinking Mahiki [nightclub] dry, dancing all night long, parties in our Battersea flat, and having the funniest, most irrelevant drunken fights. ""Tom, your energy was never-ending and your creativity was out of this world. We all know how much you loved an invention, I bet you're gutted you never made it on Dragons' Den. ""You were the best husband I could ever ask for... You did everything with love and no malice."" Parker married Kelsey in 2018, and the couple have two young children, Aurelia Rose and Bodhi. The singer's picture was on the front of the funeral order of service Tom's mother, in a message read out by the singer's brother Lewis, said: ""We have nothing but love and pride for not only his achievements, but his positive attitude, resourcefulness and determination. ""We will always be faithfully and unswervingly at his side. He was an amazing son and brother who we love dearly."" Bolton-born Parker died at the end of March, almost 18 months after he revealed he had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour. Kaneswaran remembered Parker's ""big Boltonian heart"", adding: ""He was never afraid to stand up for what was right, no matter the risk."" Other songs played during the service included Handbags and Gladrags by Stereophonics, Live Forever by Oasis, the hymn Amazing Grace and The Wanted's own single Gold Forever. As the coffin was taken from the church back to the hearse, some fans released golden heart-shaped balloons from the crowd. The Wanted fans Bethan (left) and Tamara told the BBC their butterfly hairclips were a tribute to Parker After the ceremony, fans comforted each other and shared their memories of meeting Parker and seeing the band in concert. ""Tom has been like a constant in our lives for like 12 years,"" one fan, Bethan, told BBC News. ""If you tweeted him, he'd always respond to you and big you up. It was like you were his favourite person in the world whenever you got to speak to him. ""And he was our favourite person in the world. None of us want to be here, obviously, but we get to do this together."" Another fan, Tamara, said the large number of people attending the funeral ""just shows the legacy he has created, and the love he has outpoured to so many people"". ""This love is for Kelsey and the family. We're so grateful we got the opportunity to be here for this."" She added: ""The funeral was a real tribute to Tom. To hear his family speak about him. I wasn't even surprised hearing the stories because it was kind of like we know him already. So it was just a beautiful moment to hear those stories."" Another member of the same group, Maddie, said: ""He was so lovely. He was always welcoming, the nicest person and the loveliest man."" All four friends had met Parker several times over the years. ""He loved his fame, he knew the power he held with being famous,"" Bethan said. ""So he always made sure he felt the love we'd been able to give him. He didn't take a second for granted with any of us."" Recalling one encounter with Parker, she said: ""Outside a radio station, I remember him running away from security, trying to come back to us. He wanted to be with us. Maddie (far right) described Parker as ""the nicest person and the loveliest man"" ""I'll cry listening to their music, but I won't ever not love listening to it, because that was our communication with him. It's going to be painful listening to their music for a long time, but he loved being in The Wanted."" Bethan and Tamara explained that they were wearing butterfly hairclips in tribute to Tom - the butterfly has been adopted by many fans as a symbol for the band. ""Everything is butterflies because of Gold Forever,"" Bethan explained. ""Could he have written a more perfect song to remember him by? We're all getting tattoos of butterflies and the lyrics of Gold Forever, all because of him."" Fans were seen crying and singing along to Gold Forever as it played at the end of the service. The lyrics seemed particularly fitting at the funeral: ""Say my name like it's the last time / Live today like its your last night / We want to cry but we know its alright / 'Cause I'm with you and you're with me / Butterflies, butterflies, we were meant to fly."" ""You'll have seen butterflies everywhere,"" said Bethan. ""If you go on Twitter you'll see most of our fan accounts have got the blue butterfly emoji in, and whenever Kelsey posts something there's always a butterfly in it, because that's our strongest symbol of connection with him."" The Wanted had 10 UK top-10 singles between 2010 and 2013, including All Time Low, Chasing The Sun, Heart Vacancy and Lightning.

"Mariupol ultimatum as hundreds shelter in factoryThousands of people are still trapped across the city, as Kyiv hopes to send evacuation buses.","This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian commander calls for extraction from Mariupol, saying forces are facing their last hours A Ukrainian marine commander in Mariupol has made what he described as his troops' ""last address to the world"" as they try to resist overwhelming Russian forces in the city. They were outnumbered and running out of supplies, Major Serhiy Volyna said. A Russian deadline for the surrender of Ukrainian forces has passed with no sign that the troops have complied. The last holdouts are sheltering in the city's huge Azovstal steel plant, reportedly with 1,000 civilians. Kyiv said there was a tentative deal to rescue some civilians from the city. The city's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told national TV that Ukraine had hoped to send 90 buses to evacuate about 6,000 people on Wednesday. He said around 100,000 people are trapped in Mariupol. However, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko subsequently said that fewer buses than planned were able to reach trapped civilians and not many were evacuated. ""People of course gathered at the agreed meeting points, but few of them got onto the buses,"" he told Reuters news agency without giving specific figures. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but in a video message sent to the BBC, Maj Volyna, said around 500 injured troops were being cared for at the steel plant. Maj Volyna, who leads the 36th marine battalion, said his troops were running low on supplies and that the video marked ""our last address to the world. It may be our last one ever"". He said that Russian forces outnumbered his own by ""dozens of times,"" and that while Ukrainian morale remains high, Moscow's forces ""prevail in the air, in artillery, in ground troops, and in machines and tanks"". As Russian forces advanced slowly into the heart of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal complex became a home to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters from the Azov battalion - a controversial national guard unit with links to the far-right. The site is a mass of tunnels and workshops, and provides a natural advantage to defenders. Yan Gagin, an official with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state news network RIA Novosti over the weekend that there is ""basically another city"" beneath the plant. Russia has been bombarding the factory with artillery and air raids, and Moscow has issued two demands for the troops to surrender. An advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is targeting the defenders with bunker busters - colossal bombs designed to penetrate thick armour and kill targets underground. Smoke rises over the Azovstal plant after a Russian bombardment This is the second ultimatum Ukrainian troops at the plant have faced this week. Despite this, and the vicious nature of the Russian siege, Ukraine's defence ministry said not a single soldier surrendered when a similar ultimatum lapsed on Monday.

""They have an absolute lack of everything. A lack of water, food, medicines, help, and Russia totally blocks everything, any humanitarian help or evacuation,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Olena Nikulina's cousin is fighting with Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. She saidher last contact with him had been on 8 Marchwhen he told her his unit had ""very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers"". Ukrainian officials say around 100,000 civilians remain in the city, which has been almost totally levelled by the Russian bombardment. Several previous attempts to organise humanitarian corridors from the city have failed, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of bad faith in negotiations and refusals to guarantee compliance with ceasefires. But Ms Vereshchuk said Moscow has agreed to allow 6,000 people to evacuate the city on Wednesday. Ukraine has previously alleged that Russia has been forcibly evacuating thousands of Ukrainian civilians from the city into Russia. US defence officials said on Tuesday that around 76 battalion tactical groups - combined Russian armour, infantry and air defence units - are operating inside Ukraine, with around 12 of these focused on the assault in Mariupol. If the city were to fall it would free up around 10,000 troops to take part in the refocused Russian assault on the Donbas region, and allow Moscow to link up its forces on the annexed Crimean Peninsula with separatist forces in the east. If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. The fall of Mariupol would also offer President Vladimir Putin a major propaganda opportunity. His forces have only captured one major Ukrainian city - Kherson - and seizing Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. Capturing the Azov battalion would also allow Mr Putin to play into his baseless narrative that the Ukrainian government has been overrun by ""Nazis"".

Pregnant women 'afterthought' in Covid jab rolloutA leading scientists says lives of pregnant women who died from Covid could have been saved.Health,"Professor Marian Knight said her job had made her cry Pregnant women have been an ""afterthought"" during the coronavirus pandemic and some of their deaths were ""preventable"", a leading scientist has told Newsnight. Data shows there have been at least 40 maternal deaths from Covid in the UK. Almost all were unvaccinated and more than half happened after pregnant women were advised to take-up the vaccine. The regulator says vaccines during pregnancy are ""safe"". Professor Marian Knight, who investigates every maternal death in the UK, said lifesaving messaging is still ""struggling"" to reach pregnant women, a year on since all of them were advised to get vaccinated. During the pandemic, there have been at least 40 deaths from Covid among women who were either pregnant or who had just given birth in the UK, according to data shared with Newsnight. Of those, 38 were unvaccinated and more than half of the deaths happened during the Delta and Omicron waves last year. Professor Knight said: ""This has perhaps been the first year where my job has made me cry because that was a preventable situation."" Latest data from the UK Health Security Agency shows out of the 528,362 women to give birth during 2021, 102,089 had received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine - just one in five. Out of an estimated 1.1 million women who gave birth in the UK between March 2020 and October 2021, 4,436 (0.4%) were admitted to hospital with a Covid infection,a recent study,externalfound.

Three months into her first pregnancy, the 28-year-old was told it was time for her booster. She panicked. ""I have always wanted a family and I was really scared that I was going to make a decision based on something I didn't really know anything about and it would affect our ability to have a family,"" she explains. ""It really did scare me."" Despite being surrounded by health officials in her admin role for the NHS, the 28-year-old couldn't understand why there had been the ""sudden shift"" in official advice during the first months of the vaccine rollout. Speculation and misinformation on social media compounded her anxiety further. Ellen, who is expecting her second child, agreed: ""I was worried at the beginning, but after I had Covid in January, I would rather get the protection. ""Being pregnant during the pandemic is hard. You're in constant fear because you're not just caring for yourself."" Both women, who are from Bradford, decided to get their third dose after a lot of research and speaking to health professionals. Ellen said being pregnant in the pandemic was hard They were able to do it during their routine appointments because their local maternity ward was running pop-up vaccine clinics. Vaccination Lead for Bradford District and Craven Clinical Commissioning Group, Rukeya Miah, said: ""Women want a bit more reassurance about what the side effects were and what the latest data is saying. ""I think it is natural for a pregnant woman to say: 'Is it safe for me? Is it safe for my baby?' And we've got the data to be able to say 'yes it is'."" The UK's regulator the MHRA said there was no evidence the vaccine increases the risks of miscarriage, stillbirth or other complications. Health officials are also keen to stress the benefits, such as babies are likely to be born with protective antibodies if their mothers have the vaccine. During the first months of the vaccine rollout, only pregnant health or care workers or those in at-risk groups were advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to ""consider"" the jab due to a ""lack of evidence"". In April 2021, the advice was updated to cover all pregnant women after real-world data raised no safety concerns. By December 2021, a year after the rollout began, pregnant women were deemed to be more at risk of falling seriously ill from Covid and were put on the priority list for jabs. Professor Knight, the maternal lead for pregnancy monitoring group MBRRACE-UK, said changing initial advice wasn't helpful, but stresses the JCVI had little choice because pregnant women were not included in Covid vaccine trials. ""It's a complicated message,"" she said. ""The message 'don't get vaccinated because we haven't got any information' is very subtly different from 'don't get vaccinated because it's not safe'. You may think, 'I can't get vaccinated because I'm pregnant, it must not be safe'. Whereas actually we don't yet have enough information."" Professor Knight said pregnant women were an ""afterthought"" during the pandemic and including them in clinical research must be the ""default"" in the future ""unless there's a good reason not to"". A JCVI spokesperson said the committee's advice for pregnant women has ""evolved over the course of the vaccine programme as evidence has accumulated"" and would encourage any pregnant women who have not yet taken up the vaccine to come forward to do so. The MHRA said it was looking at how it could safely increase diversity in clinical research including pregnant women. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We have always followed the expert advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. ""We continue to work closely with the NHS, clinicians and partners to provide advice and information at every possible opportunity to support women getting vaccinated.""

Pregnant women 'afterthought' in Covid jab rollout,"Professor Marian Knight said her job had made her cry Pregnant women have been an ""afterthought"" during the coronavirus pandemic and some of their deaths were ""preventable"", a leading scientist has told Newsnight. Data shows there have been at least 40 maternal deaths from Covid in the UK. Almost all were unvaccinated and more than half happened after pregnant women were advised to take-up the vaccine. The regulator says vaccines during pregnancy are ""safe"". Professor Marian Knight, who investigates every maternal death in the UK, said lifesaving messaging is still ""struggling"" to reach pregnant women, a year on since all of them were advised to get vaccinated. During the pandemic, there have been at least 40 deaths from Covid among women who were either pregnant or who had just given birth in the UK, according to data shared with Newsnight. Of those, 38 were unvaccinated and more than half of the deaths happened during the Delta and Omicron waves last year. Professor Knight said: ""This has perhaps been the first year where my job has made me cry because that was a preventable situation."" Latest data from the UK Health Security Agency shows out of the 528,362 women to give birth during 2021, 102,089 had received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine - just one in five. Out of an estimated 1.1 million women who gave birth in the UK between March 2020 and October 2021, 4,436 (0.4%) were admitted to hospital with a Covid infection,a recent study,externalfound. Covid in pregnancy linked to birth-related complications Covid: Stillbirth and prematurity risks may be higher in pregnancy Can the Covid vaccine harm unborn babies during pregnancy?,external Jessica has always been anxious about the thought of getting a Covid vaccine while pregnant. Three months into her first pregnancy, the 28-year-old was told it was time for her booster. She panicked. ""I have always wanted a family and I was really scared that I was going to make a decision based on something I didn't really know anything about and it would affect our ability to have a family,"" she explains. ""It really did scare me."" Despite being surrounded by health officials in her admin role for the NHS, the 28-year-old couldn't understand why there had been the ""sudden shift"" in official advice during the first months of the vaccine rollout. Speculation and misinformation on social media compounded her anxiety further. Ellen, who is expecting her second child, agreed: ""I was worried at the beginning, but after I had Covid in January, I would rather get the protection. ""Being pregnant during the pandemic is hard. You're in constant fear because you're not just caring for yourself."" Both women, who are from Bradford, decided to get their third dose after a lot of research and speaking to health professionals. Ellen said being pregnant in the pandemic was hard They were able to do it during their routine appointments because their local maternity ward was running pop-up vaccine clinics. Vaccination Lead for Bradford District and Craven Clinical Commissioning Group, Rukeya Miah, said: ""Women want a bit more reassurance about what the side effects were and what the latest data is saying. ""I think it is natural for a pregnant woman to say: 'Is it safe for me? Is it safe for my baby?' And we've got the data to be able to say 'yes it is'."" The UK's regulator the MHRA said there was no evidence the vaccine increases the risks of miscarriage, stillbirth or other complications. Health officials are also keen to stress the benefits, such as babies are likely to be born with protective antibodies if their mothers have the vaccine. During the first months of the vaccine rollout, only pregnant health or care workers or those in at-risk groups were advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to ""consider"" the jab due to a ""lack of evidence"". In April 2021, the advice was updated to cover all pregnant women after real-world data raised no safety concerns. By December 2021, a year after the rollout began, pregnant women were deemed to be more at risk of falling seriously ill from Covid and were put on the priority list for jabs. Professor Knight, the maternal lead for pregnancy monitoring group MBRRACE-UK, said changing initial advice wasn't helpful, but stresses the JCVI had little choice because pregnant women were not included in Covid vaccine trials. ""It's a complicated message,"" she said. ""The message 'don't get vaccinated because we haven't got any information' is very subtly different from 'don't get vaccinated because it's not safe'. You may think, 'I can't get vaccinated because I'm pregnant, it must not be safe'. Whereas actually we don't yet have enough information."" Professor Knight said pregnant women were an ""afterthought"" during the pandemic and including them in clinical research must be the ""default"" in the future ""unless there's a good reason not to"".

Wimbledon bans Russian and Belarusian playersMen's world number two Daniil Medvedev of Russia is the highest-ranked players to be affected.BBC Sport,"Daniil Medvedev replaced Novak Djokovic at the top of the world rankings for three weeks in 2022 Russian and Belarusian players will not be allowed to compete at Wimbledon this year because of the invasion of Ukraine. Men's world number two Daniil Medvedev of Russia and women's world number four Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus are the highest-ranked players to be affected. The players are also banned from any of the UK grass-court tournaments. The governing bodies of men's and women's professional tennis said the move was ""unfair"". Serbia's Novak Djokovic, a six-time men's singles champion at Wimbledon, said he did not support the ""crazy"" decision by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC). The men's body, the ATP, said it could ""set a damaging precedent for the game"", while the women's body, the WTA, said it was ""very disappointed"". In a statement, the ATP said: ""Discrimination based on nationality also constitutes a violation of our agreement with Wimbledon that states that player entry is based solely on ATP rankings. ""Any course of action in response to this decision will now be assessed in consultation with our board and member councils."" The WTA said it ""will be evaluating its next steps and what actions may be taken regarding these decisions"". Djokovic, the men's world number one, added: ""The players, the tennis players, the athletes have nothing to do with war. When politics interferes with sport, the result is not good."" Martina Navratilova, who won a record nine Wimbledon singles titles, said excluding Russian and Belarusian players was ""not the way to go"". ""I think it's the wrong decision. Tennis is such a democratic sport. It is difficult when you see politics destroy it,"" said the Czech-born American. Wimbledon runs from 27 June to 10 July. Explaining its decision, the AELTC said it had a responsibility to ""limit Russia's global influence through the strongest means possible"". ""In the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players,"" a statement from the AELTC read. ""It is therefore our intention, with deep regret, to decline entries from Russian and Belarusian players to Wimbledon."" Sabalenka reached the semi-finals of last year's tournament, while Medvedev, who has beenannounced as one of the star draws,externalat the grass-court warm-up event at 's-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands today, reached the fourth round. Russian world number 15 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova - whocalled for the war to stop,externalearlier this year - and 18th-ranked Victoria Azarenka of Belarus will also miss out. Russia's Andrey Rublev is eighth in the men's standings, with compatriot Karen Khachanov 26th. Only players are banned, which means coaches, umpires and physiotherapists can be involved in the tournament. While the Lawn Tennis Association has banned Russian or Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer, they will all still be able to play at the French Open, which begins in May. Players from both countries have been allowed to compete on the tennis tour but not under their national flags. Which sports have banned Russian athletes? The ATP said Russian and Belarusian players would still be allowed to compete at its events under a neutral flag. ""Our sport is proud to operate on the fundamental principles of merit and fairness, where players compete as individuals to earn their place in tournaments based on the ATP rankings,"" it said. ""We believe that today's unilateral decision by Wimbledon and the LTA to exclude players from Russia and Belarus from this year's British grass-court swing is unfair and has the potential to set a damaging precedent for the game."" The WTA said: ""Individual athletes should not be penalized or prevented from competing due to where they are from, or the decisions made by the governments of their countries. ""Discrimination, and the decision to focus such discrimination against athletes competing on their own as individuals, is neither fair nor justified. The WTA will continue to apply its rules to reject discrimination and ensure that all athletes are able to compete at our Tour events should they qualify to do so, a position that until today's announcement has been shared across professional tennis."" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov criticised the ban. ""Given that Russia is a strong tennis country and our athletes are among those at the top of the world rankings, the tournament itself would suffer because of this ban,"" he said. ""It is unacceptable to make the athletes once again hostages of certain political prejudice, intrigues and hostile actions towards our country."" The AELTC, which organises Wimbledon,consulted the governmentin April about whether to allow players to compete. ""We recognise that this is hard on the individuals affected, and it is with sadness that they will suffer for the actions of the leaders of the Russian regime,"" AELTC chairman Ian Hewitt said. ""Given the importance of not allowing sport to be used to promote the Russian regime and our broader concerns for public and player (including family) safety, we do not believe it is viable to proceed on any other basis at The Championships."" The AELTC is also working to withdraw TV rights from companies broadcasting in Russia and Belarus. Although the AELTC statement says the decision could be overturned if ""circumstances change materially between now and June"", that is considered very unlikely. A statement from the LTA said it is ""important to do all it can to support Ukraine at this time"". ""The LTA believes that tennis must join many other areas of sport and public life in sending a clear signal to the Russian and Belarusian states that their actions are the subject of international condemnation,"" a statement read. ""The continuing participation of Russian and Belarusian nationals at events risks providing a boost to these regimes when there is an unprecedented international effort to isolate them and sanction their actions."" UK sports minister Nigel Huddleston welcomed the ""decisive action"" by the AELTC and LTA. ""The UK has taken a leading role internationally to make clear President Putin must not be able to use sport to legitimise Russia's barbaric invasion of Ukraine. Whilst the withdrawal of individual athletes is a complex issue that will divide opinion, there is a bigger cause at stake."" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries added: ""This decision means Putin won't use the most iconic Grand Slam in tennis to try to legitimise the horrors he is inflicting on the Ukrainian people. The right move."" Russia was previously banned from defending its Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup team titles afterthe country's invasion of Ukraine- a military operation supported by Belarus. The ATP and the WTA have suspended their combined event scheduled to take place in Moscow in October. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has also cancelled its events in the country. Ukrainian world number 25 Elina Svitolina released a lengthy statement on Wednesday, calling on tennis' governing bodies to take a harsher stance against Russian and Belarusian athletes. Svitolina has taken a break from the sport to deal with a back problem and the emotional impact the invasion has had on her. She posted on social media urging the ATP, WTA and ITF to ask Russian and Belarusian players if they supported the war, the military activities in Ukraine or the regimes of Russian and Belarusian presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko. ""If applicable, we demand to exclude and ban any Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in any events,"" she wrote. ""In times of crisis, silence means agreeing with what is happening. ""There comes a time when silence is betrayal, and that time is now."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Olga Savchuk, who captained Ukraine in last week's Billie Jean King Cup tie against the USA, said Russian players should be banned from competing. ""It cannot just be a sanction against 90% of the Russian people and 10% not,"" Savchuktold the New York Times.,external ""It has to be even and I think it is collective guilt."" Ukrainian former world number 13 Alexandr Dolgopolov thanked Wimbledon for ""stepping up and showing the world an example"". ""I believe Russia should be isolated in all possible ways, and the people of Russia have to solve this problem,"" he told BBC Sport. This is a decision which makes the All England Club and the LTA stand out from the crowd. Not in the sporting sphere, in general, as athletics, badminton, canoeing and rowing have all banned individual athletes from Russia and Belarus. But in tennis, the initial French Open entry lists have been published with these players present, and neither the WTA nor the ATP Tour feel it is fair to prevent these individuals continuing their careers. There may possibly be some movement from Roland Garros after Sunday's second round of the French presidential election, but the approach in tennis thus far has been to ban Russian teams but let individuals play on - albeit it with their nationalities removed from scoreboards and ranking lists. A large majority of players have been happy with this stance up until now, but given the scale of what has been happening in Ukraine, and taking into account British public sentiment, the AELTC felt it had no alternative. And this with the possibility of legal repercussions in mind. The LTA, for example, has contracts in place with the ATP and the WTA for the grass-court events they stage at venues such as Queen's and Eastbourne in June.

Mariupol ultimatum as hundreds shelter in factory,"This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian commander calls for extraction from Mariupol, saying forces are facing their last hours A Ukrainian marine commander in Mariupol has made what he described as his troops' ""last address to the world"" as they try to resist overwhelming Russian forces in the city. They were outnumbered and running out of supplies, Major Serhiy Volyna said. A Russian deadline for the surrender of Ukrainian forces has passed with no sign that the troops have complied. The last holdouts are sheltering in the city's huge Azovstal steel plant, reportedly with 1,000 civilians. Kyiv said there was a tentative deal to rescue some civilians from the city. The city's mayor, Vadym Boichenko, told national TV that Ukraine had hoped to send 90 buses to evacuate about 6,000 people on Wednesday. He said around 100,000 people are trapped in Mariupol. However, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko subsequently said that fewer buses than planned were able to reach trapped civilians and not many were evacuated. ""People of course gathered at the agreed meeting points, but few of them got onto the buses,"" he told Reuters news agency without giving specific figures. The Azovstal Iron and Steel Works - a massive, four sq-mile (10 sq km) plant in the south-east of the city - has become the last centre of the Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol. It is unclear how many Ukrainian troops remain in the city, but in a video message sent to the BBC, Maj Volyna, said around 500 injured troops were being cared for at the steel plant. Maj Volyna, who leads the 36th marine battalion, said his troops were running low on supplies and that the video marked ""our last address to the world. It may be our last one ever"". He said that Russian forces outnumbered his own by ""dozens of times,"" and that while Ukrainian morale remains high, Moscow's forces ""prevail in the air, in artillery, in ground troops, and in machines and tanks"". As Russian forces advanced slowly into the heart of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal complex became a home to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters from the Azov battalion - a controversial national guard unit with links to the far-right. The site is a mass of tunnels and workshops, and provides a natural advantage to defenders. Yan Gagin, an official with the separatist Donetsk People's Republic, told Russian state news network RIA Novosti over the weekend that there is ""basically another city"" beneath the plant. Russia has been bombarding the factory with artillery and air raids, and Moscow has issued two demands for the troops to surrender. An advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is targeting the defenders with bunker busters - colossal bombs designed to penetrate thick armour and kill targets underground. Smoke rises over the Azovstal plant after a Russian bombardment This is the second ultimatum Ukrainian troops at the plant have faced this week. Despite this, and the vicious nature of the Russian siege, Ukraine's defence ministry said not a single soldier surrendered when a similar ultimatum lapsed on Monday. Are you in Mariupol - or do you have relatives or friends who remain in the city? If it's safe: Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Deputy Mayor Orlov warned that basic supplies at the plant have almost run out. ""They have an absolute lack of everything. A lack of water, food, medicines, help, and Russia totally blocks everything, any humanitarian help or evacuation,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. Olena Nikulina's cousin is fighting with Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. She saidher last contact with him had been on 8 Marchwhen he told her his unit had ""very little food and medical supplies - and it's harder and harder to treat wounded soldiers"". Ukrainian officials say around 100,000 civilians remain in the city, which has been almost totally levelled by the Russian bombardment. Several previous attempts to organise humanitarian corridors from the city have failed, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of bad faith in negotiations and refusals to guarantee compliance with ceasefires. But Ms Vereshchuk said Moscow has agreed to allow 6,000 people to evacuate the city on Wednesday. Ukraine has previously alleged that Russia has been forcibly evacuating thousands of Ukrainian civilians from the city into Russia. US defence officials said on Tuesday that around 76 battalion tactical groups - combined Russian armour, infantry and air defence units - are operating inside Ukraine, with around 12 of these focused on the assault in Mariupol. If the city were to fall it would free up around 10,000 troops to take part in the refocused Russian assault on the Donbas region, and allow Moscow to link up its forces on the annexed Crimean Peninsula with separatist forces in the east. If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of the Sea of Azov, cutting off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. The fall of Mariupol would also offer President Vladimir Putin a major propaganda opportunity. His forces have only captured one major Ukrainian city - Kherson - and seizing Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. Capturing the Azov battalion would also allow Mr Putin to play into his baseless narrative that the Ukrainian government has been overrun by ""Nazis"".

Man admits offensive Grenfell Tower model video,"Paul Bussetti handed himself in to police when the footage went viral A man has admitted sharing a grossly offensive video of a cardboard model of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire. Paul Bussetti, of Sundial Avenue in Croydon, south London, pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court. The clip was recorded at a party in south London a year after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, which killed 72 people, and was shared on WhatsApp. The 49-year-old was given a 10-week suspended jail sentence. Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring said he was ""horrified"" when he saw the film. He said: ""It was disgusting, it was disrespectful, it was abhorrent and it was - by the nature of the charge - grossly offensive. ""I suspect it was offensive to almost everybody who has an ounce of decency about them."" Paul Bussetti was given a 10-week suspended jail sentence Bussetti was previously found not guilty of posting the video at a two-day trial in August 2019 but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) appealed against the verdict. His acquittal was later quashed by the High Court. The magistrates court heard Bussetti filmed the footage, which was taken at an annual bonfire party hosted by a friend in November 2018, and posted it in two WhatsApp groups - one football-related and one for a holiday group. It prompted outrage when it was then shared widely online and made the national news, and was criticised as ""vile"" by a relative of one of the 72 victims of the disaster in west London. The court heard direct and indirect references were made in Bussetti's footage about the residents of Grenfell Tower. They included: ""Who's jumping?"", ""Don't worry, stay in your flats"", and ""Jump out of the window"". The model was burned at a bonfire party in south London on 3 November 2018 The court heard Bussetti said: ""That's what happens when you don't pay the rent."" He could also be heard making siren noises. Another person, who was not the defendant, could be heard making a racist comment in the video, while others could be heard laughing. The court heard Bussetti handed himself in to police when the footage went viral. Bussetti is said to have told police: ""It was all over the telly and so we thought it was better to tell the truth. ""It was terrible, definitely offensive to people, it was just complete stupidness, one of those stupid moments."" A victim impact statement on behalf of the Grenfell victims said ""the overall reaction of the Grenfell community was one of shock, horror and outrage"" at the video. In his ruling in August 2019, High Court judge Lord Justice Bean said he did not accept Bussetti's argument - that the figures in the bonfire were his friends - as a defence.

Man admits Grenfell model bonfire film,"Paul Bussetti handed himself in to police when the footage went viral A man has admitted sharing a grossly offensive video of a cardboard model of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire. Paul Bussetti, of Sundial Avenue in Croydon, south London, pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court. The clip was recorded at a party in south London a year after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, which killed 72 people, and was shared on WhatsApp. The 49-year-old was given a 10-week suspended jail sentence. Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring said he was ""horrified"" when he saw the film. He said: ""It was disgusting, it was disrespectful, it was abhorrent and it was - by the nature of the charge - grossly offensive. ""I suspect it was offensive to almost everybody who has an ounce of decency about them."" Paul Bussetti was given a 10-week suspended jail sentence Bussetti was previously found not guilty of posting the video at a two-day trial in August 2019 but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) appealed against the verdict. His acquittal was later quashed by the High Court. The magistrates court heard Bussetti filmed the footage, which was taken at an annual bonfire party hosted by a friend in November 2018, and posted it in two WhatsApp groups - one football-related and one for a holiday group. It prompted outrage when it was then shared widely online and made the national news, and was criticised as ""vile"" by a relative of one of the 72 victims of the disaster in west London. The court heard direct and indirect references were made in Bussetti's footage about the residents of Grenfell Tower. They included: ""Who's jumping?"", ""Don't worry, stay in your flats"", and ""Jump out of the window"". The model was burned at a bonfire party in south London on 3 November 2018 The court heard Bussetti said: ""That's what happens when you don't pay the rent.""

Fake reviews to be illegal under new rulesThe government has also announced people will be able to opt out of subscriptions more easily.Business,"People are set to be better protected from fake reviews and ""subscription traps"" under plans to tackle rip-offs.â¯ Proposals include making it ""clearly illegal"" to pay someone to write or host fake reviews. A competition watchdog will get new powers to fine firms up to 10% of their global turnover for bad business practices. But an industry group said the new rules shouldn't put ""any further unnecessary burdens on businesses"". 'Why I write fake online reviews' UK firms caught buying five-star Google reviews The average UK household spends about Â£900 each year after being influenced by online reviews and spends Â£60 on ""unwanted subscriptions"", the government said. Under the proposed rules, there will be a new laws against offering to write and commissioning fake reviews. Websites hosting consumer reviews will have to take reasonable steps to check they are genuine. Reviews website Trustpilot said it ""welcomes legislation introduced with the aim of protecting consumers from fake reviews"". It said it is ""continually working to ensure we are taking appropriate action against attempts to manipulate reviews on our site"". Tripadvisor, a travel reviews website, said its operations ""are geared towards identifying, blocking and removing fake reviews"". ""The most direct way to protect consumers from biased and inaccurate information is to focus public policies and enforcement on the bad actors,"" said Becky Foley, senior safety director at Tripadvisor. The government also wants to bring in new rules against ""subscription traps"", in which businesses make it difficult to leave a contract. Businesses will have to give clearer information to consumers before they sign up to a subscription contract. They will need to send a reminder that a free trial or low-cost introductory offer is coming to an end, and ensure customers can leave a contract in a ""straightforward, cost-effective and timely way"", the government said. Small business minister Paul Scully said the consumers deserved better and the majority of business doing the ""right thing"" deserved ""protection from rogue traders undermining them"". ""No longer will you visit a five star-reviewed restaurant only to find a burnt lasagne or get caught in a subscription in which there's no end in sight,"" he said. If the government proposals are made into law, prepayment schemes such as Christmas savings clubs will also have to safeguard fully customers' money through insurance or trust accounts. Shoppers' savings clubs - where consumers pay for goods and services in instalments throughout the year - are not currently covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Under the proposals, even if the company goes bust, shoppers' money will still be protected. The rules aim to prevent issues such as the collapse of Christmas savings club Farepak, which saw tens of thousands of people lose money when the company went bust in 2006. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will be able to award compensation to consumers and directly impose financial penalties worth up to 10% of global annual turnover for businesses that transgress the new rules, or up to Â£300,000 in the case of an individual. The government said CMA's new powers will mean cases will no longer need to go through the courts. Instead, the CMA will be able to award compensation to consumers and directly impose financial penalties. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said the impact of fake reviews was ""enormous"". She said the process to ""hold businesses to account"" was ""far too complicated and lengthy"". ""Britain's consumer and competition laws are in desperate need of an upgrade,"" Ms Concha added. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the extra powers the CMA stands to gain would ""help stamp out the practice of fake reviews, which do irreparable damage to businesses"". However, she said the ""devil will be in the detail"" of the policy. UK Hospitality wants to see that the ""consumers are safeguarded without placing any further unnecessary burdens on businesses"". She said the new CMA powers should not ""unfairly punish businesses"" especially small businesses, adding that there needed to be ""a clear right of appeal"". ""Fairness for both businesses and consumers, particularly when it comes to offering refunds, will be crucial and any new measures must also be made in the context of a sector facing an onslaught of challenges after a difficult two years,"" she added. The government also said the CMA's powers will allow it to ""have stronger tools to tackle companies colluding to bump-up prices"" and to also stop ""killer acquisitions"" in which big businesses snap up rivals before they can launch new products or services. CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the new rules were an ""important milestone towards strengthening the CMA's ability to hold companies to account, promote fair and open markets, and protect UK consumers"".

Online posts 'transform' war crimes documentationUkraine round-up: Ukraine defies Mariupol deadline,"This video can not be played How do you prove a war crime has been committed? Images posted online will be crucial in prosecuting war crimes in Ukraine, according to UK legal experts. A law professor said the use of bomb footage from Yemen during a mock war crimes trial showed how images shared online had ""transformed"" the documentation of atrocities. One online investigator said there was ""so much"" useful and verifiable information in warzone footage. But experts also said eyewitness accounts must not be overshadowed. Cases against individuals who have committed war crimes in Ukraine could depend on social media posts about unlawful killings, wartime sexual violence and torture, said Prof Yvonne McDermott Rees, who runs the Open Source Research for Human Rights project at Swansea University. Images shared online have ""transformed"" the documentation of atrocities, legal experts say She said material, known as open-source information, had ""completely transformed our way of knowing about human rights violations"". ""We're seeing increasingly the UN commissions of inquiry, fact-finding missions, even the International Criminal Court in the Hague, using this kind of evidence,"" she explained. Do Bucha civilian killings amount to genocide? Biden calls for Putin to face war crimes trial War crimes probe details Ethiopia ethnic cleansing Bucha satellite image contradicts Russian claims Prof McDermott Rees said open-source information had also been used in Swedish and Dutch courts to prosecute members of the so-called Islamic State returning from Syria. Open-source information is information that is freely available online. ""A video of a beheading that's recorded or shared on YouTube or Facebook... is evidence,"" she said, adding that similar material was recently tested for use in a UK court. In 2018, unverified footage of the aftermath of a deadly airstrike on the office of the presidency in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, was posted on Twitter. People were seen lifting injured people from the rubble following an airstrike in Sana'a, Yemen The open-source investigative website, Bellingcat, used geolocation, satellite imagery and comparisons of hundreds of imagesto document the attack,external. Their evidence was then presented in the mock trial of a fictitious Saudi pilot accused of war crimes. ""We wanted to see if one of these videos would be accepted as evidence in a common-law court in England and Wales,"" said Nick Waters, the justice accountability lead at Bellingcat. He said the result was a methodology ""we're now using to collect and verify incidents in Ukraine"". Six people were reported to have died in an airstrike in Yemen, footage of which was then used in a mock war crimes trial in the UK The problem, said Prof McDermott Rees, is that in the midst of war, bystanders are rarely thinking about a criminal trial. ""They're sharing it with the intention of showing the world what they've witnessed,"" she explained. Bystanders are being encouraged to film landmarks and known buildings in their footage of war crimes and to use a mobile phone app developed by the International Bar Association, calledeyeWitness,external. A young woman with a mobile phone takes pictures of a destroyed Retroville shopping centre in Kyiv following a Russian shelling attack ""It does things like capturing the metadata, the time, the date, the place where this piece of content was recorded,"" she said. ""If you are recording this, as well as showing the injuries suffered, the weapon, see if you can include landmarks or buildings in the background."" She said Witness, a charity that uses videos to document human rights abuses, has publishedguidelines on how bystanders can gather images,externalthat will be acceptable for use in courts. War crimes investigators are also fighting against the widely held view that online images cannot be trusted. ""That misses out on the fact that there is so much useful and verifiable information being posted on the Internet,"" Mr Waters said, adding that it is difficult to fake incidents online because real events come with a pattern of tweets from multiple sources. ""With the advent of social media, of smartphones, you effectively have an incredibly powerful information network where people are able to take pictures and take videos of the events,"" Mr Waters added. The presence of mobile phones in war zones has been a gamechanger Solicitor Dearbhla Minogue works with the human rights charity,Global Legal Action Network,externaland Bellingcat, She said viewing a video of something happening is a lot more compelling than hearing somebody talk about it. ""Think about... the death of George Floyd,"" said Ms Minogue. ""People actually saw that happening in real-time, including the jury, by watching what was filmed by a passer-by. ""That impacted the outcome of that trial because it was no longer one person's word against another person's."" The University of California has developed rules for the use of digital open-source material,called the Berkeley Protocol,external. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine WAR CRIMES:Are atrocities part of a strategy? WATCH:Finding our parents in a warzone ANALYSIS:Why is Russia losing so many tanks? READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external The question facing war crimes prosecutors, Ms Minogue said, is how to reassure a judge that the video is not faked or manipulated for political reasons. ""With a video that just appears online purporting to be the aftermath of an airstrike, how do we know that it is what it says it is?"" she said. ""That it's not staged or faked or these issues that are being raised by Russia in the context of these Bucha videos."" Ms Minogue said the normal way in domestic courts is to call the person who filmed it to give evidence in court. ""But in the cast of open-source information, where you don't have the creator, you can't ask them how they created it, whether they manipulated it [or] whether someone else could manipulate it. ""Using the information in the video and comparing it with other satellite imagery or other videos showing the same event, they can piece together all these bits of content and assess whether they think it real or fake."" This video can not be played ""Russian soldiers raped me and killed my husband"" Prof McDermott Rees warned that while open-source material can help, ""it's important not to lose the human side in all of this"". She said: ""In Yemen, this kind of evidence wasn't seen on its own, it was in close collaboration with accounts that were gathered by NGOs on the ground."" In Ukraine, she said evidence of rape had been documented in the testimony of survivors, ""so it's really important that we don't underplay the importance of those human accounts"". ""It's about showing that when international crimes are committed, they're not committed with impunity,"" Prof McDermott Rees said. ""So this work in documenting and gathering informationâ¦ we have to make sure that's going to stand up in court and that we'll see justice. ""All of us are seeing this really disturbing content coming out of Bucha, other areas in Ukraine and I think universally we want to see justice done."" Is Russia committing genocide in Ukraine?

Please join us at this webpagefor all the latest. Peter Chumak, who's lived in London for 22 years, returned to Ukraine for family reasons just before Russia invaded. Because he's a Ukrainian citizen he was ordered to remain in the country to help with the war effort. Seven weeks later the military alllowed him to return to the UK. The BBC interviewed the family when Chumak's wife, Nicola, was trying to get him home, and has spoken to them again now he's back.

The Biden administration is planning to announce another $800m (Â£615m) military aid package for Ukraine, according to US media. Asked on Tuesday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, if he would send more artillery to Ukraine, President Biden responded: ""Yes."" The White House last week announced it would sent an $800m package to Ukraine that includes 40,000 artillery rounds and 18 howitzers (155mm). Speaking at a domestic event in the US state of New Hampshire, President Joe Biden said that he's not sure whether he'll travel to Ukraine. âThe answer is, I donât know,â Biden told reporters, according to CNN. âIâve been to Ukraine many times, just havenât been there recently.â White House officials have been saying since last week that a senior official may travel to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky has also invited Biden to personally make the trip. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday that there are currently no plans for Biden to go. She later added that if there were plans in the works, she would not tell reporters in advance anyway. Officials say it's more likely that the US will send the secretary of state or secretary of defence. The Ukrainian president giving his latest video address Ukraineâs
President Zelensky has given his nightly video address, with an update on the
fighting in the east. He says ""the situation
in Mariupol remains as severe as possible without any changes,"" according to the Reuters news agency, adding that Russian forces have been blocking attempts to organise humanitarian corridors to help civilians leave the besieged city. He also says, ""the fate of tens of thousands of Mariupol residents, who have been earlier moved to the territory controlled by Russia, is unknown"". Zelensky claims ""the intensity of fire by Russian troops in the Kharkiv direction, in the Donbas, and in the Dnipro region has increased significantly"" and accuses Russia of targeting
residential buildings and civilians. He adds, ""this is such meanness, which for generations will mark the Russian state as a source of absolute evil.â Brimstone missiles seen attached to a British jet in 2014 More now on what's been promised by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following his video call with President Biden and others earlier. Johnson was among the Western leaders who pledged to send more artillery to Ukraine. Specifically, he said he planned to equip Kyiv with anti-ship missiles - including by mounting British Brimstone rockets to vehicles. Reuters reports that Brimstones have previously been used by UK forces in Libya and Syria, and are typically launched from fast jet aircraft. They're used against fast-moving land and sea targets. Ukraine's allies have provided Kyiv with additional military aircraft and aircraft parts to increase their fleet size and repair others in Ukraine's arsenal that were damaged, the US defence department said on Tuesday. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at a news briefing. He added that Washington had not provided aircraft to Kyiv. Earlier, US President Joe Biden held a video call with Western leaders about stepping up military support to Ukraine.They pledged to send more weaponsto help the country defend itself against the renewed Russian offensive in the east.  Jonathan BealeReporting from Dnipro Ukrainian forces are entrenched in the old industrial area The Donbas is mostly open countryside, outside the big
cities. Itâs Ukraineâs old industrial heartland. Youâll see slag heaps and
mines there. Open countryside gives both sides
room for manoeuvre. Russian tanks, which have been seen elsewhere stuck in
columns on roads, will be able to go over fields there and make life more difficult
for Ukrainian forces. But the Ukrainians are well dug-in. Theyâre in
trenches. They have anti-tank weapons supplied by the West which they can use
to effect. I think itâs important what happens in the air. The Donbas
is closer to Russian territory, and the Russians may have more freedom over the
air. They certainly havenât got air superiority at the moment. But itâs difficult for the Ukrainian air force, as small as
it is, to operate that far to the east of the country. So that might be one
advantage for the Russians. Russia's defence ministry has once again called on Ukrainian troops holding out inside Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant to lay down their weapons on Wednesday. Mariupol has been besieged by Russian attacks, but Ukraine's Azov Battalion is reportedly still holding out in Azovstal - a huge steelworks plant overlooking the Azov Sea. Russian troops will observe a cease-fire while the proposal is in effect - starting from 1100 GMT on 20 April. Not a single Ukrainian soldier accepted that same offer on Tuesday, the ministry said in a statement. Russia's military says it controls almost all of Mariupol, but Ukrainian officials insist their remaining soldiers will fight to the end.

Mykhailo
Podolyak said the current hiatus would likely be prolonged by the ongoing siege of Mariupol and Russia's apparent desire to strengthen its hand with a renewed offensive in the east. Relations were also soured by the alleged killing of civilians in the town of Bucha before the withdrawal of Russian forces earlier this month. The last face-to-face talks were on March 29. ""Obviously, against the backdrop of the Mariupol
tragedy, the negotiation process has become even more complicated,"" Podolyak told Reuters. ""Russia defiantly renounces any manifestations of
humanity and humanism when it comes to certain humanitarian corridors.
Especially when we talk about Mariupol."" Ukrainian authorities say at least 20,000 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the war, and that efforts to evacuate the city have been repeatedly hampered by Russian shelling. ""It
is difficult to say when the next face-to-face round of negotiations will be
possible because the Russians are seriously betting on [making gains in] the
so-called 'second stage of the special operation',"" Podolyak said. Russian-backed forces are reportedly storming the area where Mariupol's final Ukrainian defenders are holed-up - the vast Azovastal iron and steel works. Plumes of smoke can be seen drifting into the air from near the plant, in this drone video released by Ukraine's defence ministry.

The call also included French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, among others. According to the readout, the leaders on the call ""affirmed their solidarity"" with Ukraine and condemned ""the humanitarian suffering caused by Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion"".

Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring The Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier in Murmansk shipyard Google has denied making changes
to its satellite images of Russiaâs military sites after false claims were widely shared online that it
had unblurred images of certain spots. A number of self-described open source intelligence accounts claimed yesterday that Google had stopped hiding
Russiaâs âsecretâ military facilities from public view on its Google Earth and
Maps services. Images of those facilities went
viral online and the story was widely reported as a new development in Ukraine. But Google has never hidden those
facilities, and high-resolution images of Moscowâs military sites and equipment
have been publicly available for years. The companytook to Twitter to refute the claim,external, saying it hadnât made âany blurring changes to our satellite
imagery in Russiaâ. A search of the companyâs
historic imagery function on Google Earth confirms no specific changes have been
made with regard to satellite images from Russia. Google has been found to have
blurred satellite images of certain territories in the past,including parts of Israel and
Palestinian territories, owing to a now defunct US regulation. It also blurssatellite
images of certain sensitive sites,external, likely at the request of national
governments. Destroyed buildings and vehicles in Mariupol on 13 April The embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol could completely fall to Russian forces within days, a European official has told Reuters. The official, who asked not to be named, said they believe that Russia hopes to declare the city ""liberated"" by 9 May, the date when Russia marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. ""We do expect a complete destruction of the city and many civilian casualties in Mariupol,"" they added. The official added they fear the death toll could be worse than Bucha, where Russian troops have been accused of killing hundreds of civilians. Russia denies the claims. Additionally, the official said they believed Russia's medium-term objective was to control Luhansk and Donetsk and secure a land corridor with Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014. Such an operation is likely to take between four and six months to complete, after which the conflict could result in a stalemate, the official added. Joe Biden after landing in New Hampshire on 19 April US President Joe Biden has told reporter the US will send more artillery systems to Ukraine amid a renewed Russian offensive in the east. Since the beginning of the Biden administration began, the US has provided $3.2 billion (Â£2.46bn) in security aid to Ukraine, including $2.6bn since the conflict began on 24 February. ""What we have done here is...exactly what the president would do from the beginning. Which is to [provide] significant security assistance, economic assistance, and support to the Ukrainian people,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. ""And we're going to continue to do exactly that,"" she added.

Soviet-era T-72s - as well as BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, belonging to
its active reserves. There are also reports it has supplied self-propelled
artillery as well as multiple launch rocket systems. The defence ministry refuses to specify the amount and type of deliveries to Ukraine,
confirming only that it is sending both light and heavy weapons and will
continue to do so regardless of Russian objections. Alongside the official

Ukrainian armed forces has so far raised over â¬40m (Â£33m). UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK will step up aid to Ukraine and provide artillery systems at a time in which the conflict ""is in a very perilous stage"".

"Beautiful tourist town braces for Russian assaultKilled as he escaped, Elisei is one of 200 child victimsVideoVideoThe women left to survive in a deserted shelterVideoVideoMother and son reunited after 2,000-mile journey","Most of Sviatohirsk's residents have fled the town In a picturesque resort town on the northern edge of Ukraine's Donbas region, people can hear the shelling coming closer. The Russians are just five miles to the north. Sviatohirsk was once a staple of the tourist trail but now it is just another place in the Donbas where people flee the fighting. Most of its permanent residents have themselves fled, fearing the war will not stop its ruthless advance here. It was famed for its historic Russian Orthodox church and monastery, set amid the wooded Holy Mountains of the Donbas. That monastery has been damaged by shrapnel from a Russian air strike that hit a target nearby. There is now a gaping hole in the church spire. Just to the north is the city of Izyum where there is already fierce fighting. The residents who had fled Izyum told us they had been bombed day and night, been without running water and electricity for weeks. They also said there were bodies on the streets. The support of religious leaders is helping some cope with the trauma of war ""Everyone is worried,"" the town's mayor, Vladimir, tells me. He says those who have remained regularly call to check he's not leaving. He is not. He is staying put and organising food parcels for the town's dwindling population. These are people who are tired, hungry and scared, too scared sometimes to apportion any blame on Russia. ""I will not talk about it,"" one woman tells me, ""because we still have to go home."" Russia is open about the fact that its renewed focus in the war will be in Ukraine's east, the Donbas. The Russian offensive here is coming from three directions - from the north, south and the east. But the landscape of the town that so charms its visitors also offers some kind of protection to its terrified residents. Unlike most of the Donbas region, which is largely flat open landscape,  Sviatohirsk is set among hills and forests - providing some natural defences - making it harder for an army to manoeuvre with artillery and tanks. The people left in the area find themselves queuing for emergency food parcels The residents who have stayed behind now rub shoulders with soldiers getting a brief respite from the fighting. They grab a coffee from one of the few shops left open. The military's not allowed to speak to us without permission. One man proudly tells us he was trained by British troops before the latest war started. He's confident that Ukraine can win this war. But I meet another soldier who sounds less assured. The unrelenting Russian bombardment is taking its toll. Another soldier tells us that the Russians have been targeting their positions with white phosphorous shells - which burn into the flesh. There is now a real danger that Russia may soon try to encircle Ukrainian forces in the region who have been fighting Russian-backed separatist in the region since 2014. Ukrainian troops there are among the most battle hardened in the Ukrainian Army. But they, too, are  worried that their supply lines could be cut off as Russian forces push in from three different directions. The unit we saw look well trained and well equipped. Their automatic weapons were fitted with suppressors, which are silencers. An officer who agreed to be interviewed says his son, too, was trained - by US and British forces. The Ukrainian army now is better prepared than when separatists took over the Donbas in 2014 Volodomyr told us that the Ukrainian Army is now much better prepared than the one of 2014 - when Russian backed separatists took over part of the Donbas. ""If this war had happened then, I don't know how it would end, but now we know the Russian aggressors will get what they deserve."" Volodomyr says the Russians are using similar tactics they have used elsewhere in Ukraine - ""creating panic among the local population"". He says ""it's inhuman"". It is now happening right across the Donbas. ANALYSIS:What does Putin want? WATCH:The elderly who can't flee their homes DIPLOMACY:Germany's conundrum over ties with Russia READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external From the distance we could see and hear the city of Severodonetsk being pounded. We tried to enter but had to turn back when we heard the whistle of a shell landing nearby. It was a similar scene further south in the city of Avdiivka - where the remnants of a once bustling industrial  city were now hiding in bunkers. Gallina showed the crater caused by a bomb landing in her garden Even a nearby village hadn't been spared. Sixty-year-old Gallina showed us the crater which had landed in her garden - blowing out the windows of her small home the night before. Inside, her granddaughter, Anastasia, was cowering under a table - still too frightened to come out. Gallina told me ""there's nothing funny about this situation"". ""We live here like cannon fodder,"" she added. Anastasia has been hiding under a table since a bomb landed near her home, frightened to come out Ukrainian forces are  trying to slow any Russian advance - as they did in Kyiv. One soldier shows us drone footage of a bridge they recently blew up - to the north of Izyum. It brings a  column of military trucks to a standstill. But more will be coming. What is happening in the Donbas now - the incessant, unrelenting shelling - is the prelude to the long expected offensive. Russia is trying to weaken Ukraine's defences and its people's resolve. There have been also Russian probing attacks across the frontline. Most have been so far repelled by Ukraine forces. But they know more will be coming. Russia is still massing and reconstituting its battered units. There are still questions as to whether Russian forces will perform any better in the east than they did outside the capital Kyiv - where they were forced to retreat. The UK's Ministry of Defence believes Russian commanders will also be concerned by the time it is taking them to subdue the port city of Mariupol - which has diverted men and materiel - slowing the Russian advance elsewhere. Ukraine still fears worse is to come. That's why President Volodymyr Zelensky has once again been calling for more weapons. Until recently Western support has been limited to ""defensive weapons"" - such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. But some countries are now sending heavier weapons. We have seen some of it - such as armoured vehicles - arrive on the frontline. The Czech Republic is providing Ukraine with a dozen T-72 tanks. The latest batch of US military aid will include 18 howitzers. But that will probably not be enough to tip to balance overwhelmingly in favour of Ukraine. Back in Sviatohirsk, Mayor Vladimir says he is still holding out hope that this conflict can be resolved through diplomacy. ""All this is terrible,"" he says. ""This destruction has no future.""

Because he's a Ukrainian citizen he was ordered to remain in the country to help with the war effort. Seven weeks later the military alllowed him to return to the UK. The BBC interviewed the family when Chumak's wife, Nicola, was trying to get him home, and has spoken to them again now he's back. This video can not be played The shattered city of Mariupol remains on the brink Here's a roundup of the latest: On the ground Ukraine claims to have retaken Maryinka - pictured here last week In diplomacy  You can read morehereabout the fresh pledges from Western nations. The Biden administration is planning to announce another $800m (Â£615m) military aid package for Ukraine, according to US media. Asked on Tuesday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, if he would send more artillery to Ukraine, President Biden responded: ""Yes."" The White House last week announced it would sent an $800m package to Ukraine that includes 40,000 artillery rounds and 18 howitzers (155mm). Speaking at a domestic event in the US state of New Hampshire, President Joe Biden said that he's not sure whether he'll travel to Ukraine. âThe answer is, I donât know,â Biden told reporters, according to CNN. âIâve been to Ukraine many times, just havenât been there recently.â White House officials have been saying since last week that a senior official may travel to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky has also invited Biden to personally make the trip. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday that there are currently no plans for Biden to go. She later added that if there were plans in the works, she would not tell reporters in advance anyway. Officials say it's more likely that the US will send the secretary of state or secretary of defence. The Ukrainian president giving his latest video address Ukraineâs
President Zelensky has given his nightly video address, with an update on the
fighting in the east. He says ""the situation
in Mariupol remains as severe as possible without any changes,"" according to the Reuters news agency, adding that Russian forces have been blocking attempts to organise humanitarian corridors to help civilians leave the besieged city. He also says, ""the fate of tens of thousands of Mariupol residents, who have been earlier moved to the territory controlled by Russia, is unknown"". Zelensky claims ""the intensity of fire by Russian troops in the Kharkiv direction, in the Donbas, and in the Dnipro region has increased significantly"" and accuses Russia of targeting
residential buildings and civilians. He adds, ""this is such meanness, which for generations will mark the Russian state as a source of absolute evil.â Brimstone missiles seen attached to a British jet in 2014 More now on what's been promised by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following his video call with President Biden and others earlier. Johnson was among the Western leaders who pledged to send more artillery to Ukraine. Specifically, he said he planned to equip Kyiv with anti-ship missiles - including by mounting British Brimstone rockets to vehicles. Reuters reports that Brimstones have previously been used by UK forces in Libya and Syria, and are typically launched from fast jet aircraft. They're used against fast-moving land and sea targets. Ukraine's allies have provided Kyiv with additional military aircraft and aircraft parts to increase their fleet size and repair others in Ukraine's arsenal that were damaged, the US defence department said on Tuesday. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at a news briefing. He added that Washington had not provided aircraft to Kyiv. Earlier, US President Joe Biden held a video call with Western leaders about stepping up military support to Ukraine.They pledged to send more weaponsto help the country defend itself against the renewed Russian offensive in the east.  Jonathan BealeReporting from Dnipro Ukrainian forces are entrenched in the old industrial area The Donbas is mostly open countryside, outside the big
cities. Itâs Ukraineâs old industrial heartland. Youâll see slag heaps and
mines there. Open countryside gives both sides
room for manoeuvre. Russian tanks, which have been seen elsewhere stuck in
columns on roads, will be able to go over fields there and make life more difficult
for Ukrainian forces. But the Ukrainians are well dug-in. Theyâre in
trenches. They have anti-tank weapons supplied by the West which they can use
to effect. I think itâs important what happens in the air. The Donbas
is closer to Russian territory, and the Russians may have more freedom over the
air. They certainly havenât got air superiority at the moment. But itâs difficult for the Ukrainian air force, as small as
it is, to operate that far to the east of the country. So that might be one
advantage for the Russians. Russia's defence ministry has once again called on Ukrainian troops holding out inside Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant to lay down their weapons on Wednesday. Mariupol has been besieged by Russian attacks, but Ukraine's Azov Battalion is reportedly still holding out in Azovstal - a huge steelworks plant overlooking the Azov Sea. Russian troops will observe a cease-fire while the proposal is in effect - starting from 1100 GMT on 20 April. Not a single Ukrainian soldier accepted that same offer on Tuesday, the ministry said in a statement. Russia's military says it controls almost all of Mariupol, but Ukrainian officials insist their remaining soldiers will fight to the end.

Mykhailo
Podolyak said the current hiatus would likely be prolonged by the ongoing siege of Mariupol and Russia's apparent desire to strengthen its hand with a renewed offensive in the east. Relations were also soured by the alleged killing of civilians in the town of Bucha before the withdrawal of Russian forces earlier this month. The last face-to-face talks were on March 29. ""Obviously, against the backdrop of the Mariupol
tragedy, the negotiation process has become even more complicated,"" Podolyak told Reuters. ""Russia defiantly renounces any manifestations of
humanity and humanism when it comes to certain humanitarian corridors.
Especially when we talk about Mariupol."" Ukrainian authorities say at least 20,000 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the war, and that efforts to evacuate the city have been repeatedly hampered by Russian shelling. ""It
is difficult to say when the next face-to-face round of negotiations will be
possible because the Russians are seriously betting on [making gains in] the
so-called 'second stage of the special operation',"" Podolyak said. Russian-backed forces are reportedly storming the area where Mariupol's final Ukrainian defenders are holed-up - the vast Azovastal iron and steel works. Plumes of smoke can be seen drifting into the air from near the plant, in this drone video released by Ukraine's defence ministry. Russia already claims to be in control of most of the key southern city, and were the city to fall completely, it would be a big strategic prize for Russia.

In atweet,external, the MoD says: We've just received a White House readout of President Joe Biden's video call with European allies, in which they discussed the ""ongoing provision"" of security, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The call also included French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, among others. According to the readout, the leaders on the call ""affirmed their solidarity"" with Ukraine and condemned ""the humanitarian suffering caused by Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion"". ""They also discussed their coordinated efforts to impose severe economic costs to hold Russia accountable,"" the readout says.

Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring The Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier in Murmansk shipyard Google has denied making changes
to its satellite images of Russiaâs military sites after false claims were widely shared online that it
had unblurred images of certain spots. A number of self-described open source intelligence accounts claimed yesterday that Google had stopped hiding
Russiaâs âsecretâ military facilities from public view on its Google Earth and
Maps services. Images of those facilities went
viral online and the story was widely reported as a new development in Ukraine. But Google has never hidden those
facilities, and high-resolution images of Moscowâs military sites and equipment
have been publicly available for years. The companytook to Twitter to refute the claim,external, saying it hadnât made âany blurring changes to our satellite
imagery in Russiaâ. A search of the companyâs
historic imagery function on Google Earth confirms no specific changes have been
made with regard to satellite images from Russia. Google has been found to have
blurred satellite images of certain territories in the past,including parts of Israel and
Palestinian territories, owing to a now defunct US regulation. It also blurssatellite
images of certain sensitive sites,external, likely at the request of national
governments. Destroyed buildings and vehicles in Mariupol on 13 April The embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol could completely fall to Russian forces within days, a European official has told Reuters. The official, who asked not to be named, said they believe that Russia hopes to declare the city ""liberated"" by 9 May, the date when Russia marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. ""We do expect a complete destruction of the city and many civilian casualties in Mariupol,"" they added. The official added they fear the death toll could be worse than Bucha, where Russian troops have been accused of killing hundreds of civilians. Russia denies the claims. Additionally, the official said they believed Russia's medium-term objective was to control Luhansk and Donetsk and secure a land corridor with Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014. Such an operation is likely to take between four and six months to complete, after which the conflict could result in a stalemate, the official added. Joe Biden after landing in New Hampshire on 19 April US President Joe Biden has told reporter the US will send more artillery systems to Ukraine amid a renewed Russian offensive in the east. Since the beginning of the Biden administration began, the US has provided $3.2 billion (Â£2.46bn) in security aid to Ukraine, including $2.6bn since the conflict began on 24 February. ""What we have done here is...exactly what the president would do from the beginning. Which is to [provide] significant security assistance, economic assistance, and support to the Ukrainian people,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. ""And we're going to continue to do exactly that,"" she added.
