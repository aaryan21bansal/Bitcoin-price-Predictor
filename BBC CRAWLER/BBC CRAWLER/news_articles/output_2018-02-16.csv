Defendants. â INDICTMENT The Grand Jury for the District of Columbia charges: INTRODUCTION 1.The United States of America, through its departments and agencies, regulates the activities of foreign individuals and entities in and affecting the United States in order to prevent, disclose, and counteract improper foreign influence on U.S. elections and on the U.S. political system. U.S. law bans foreign nationals from making certain expenditures or financial disbursements for the purpose of influencing federal elections. U.S. law also bars agents of any foreign entity from engaging in political activities within the United States without first registering with the Attorney General. And U.S. law requires certain foreign nationals seeking entry to the United States to obtain a visa by providing truthful and accurate information to the government. Various federal agencies, including the Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S> Department of State, are charged with enforcing these laws. 2.Defendant INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY LLC (""ORGANIZATION"") is a Russian organization engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes. Defendants MIKHAIL IVANOVICH BYSTROV, MIKHAIL LEONIDOVICH BURCHIK, ALEKSANDRA YURYEVNA KRYLOVA, ANNA VLADISLAVOVNA BOGACHEVA, SERGEY PAVLOVICH POLOZOV, MARIA ANTOLYEVNA BODVA, ROBERT SERGEYEVICH BOVDA, DZHEYKHUN NASIMI OGLY ASLANOV, VADIM VLADIMIROVICH PODKOPAEV, GLEB IGOREVICH VASILCHENKO,IRINA VIKTOROVNA KAVERZINA, and VLADIMIR VENKOV worked in various capacities to carry out Defendant ORGANIZATION's interference operations targeting the United States. From in or around 2014 to the present, Defendants knowingly and intentionally conspired with each other (and with persons known and unknown to â the Grand Jury) to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the presidential election of 2016. 3.Beginning as early as 2014, Defendant ORGANIZATION began operations to interfere with the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Defendant ORGANIZATION received funding for its operations from Defendant YEVGENIY VIKTOROVICH PRIGOZHIN and companies he controlled, including Defendants CONCORD MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTING LLC and CONCORD CATERING (collectively ""CONCORD""). Defendants CONCORD and PRIGOZHIN spent significant funds to further the ORGANIZATION's operations and to pay the remaining Defendants, along with other uncharged ORGANIZATION employees, salaries and bonuses for their work at the ORGANIZATION. 4.Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and creating false U.S. personas, operated social media pages and groups designed to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and pages, which addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists when, in fact, they were controlled by Defendants. Defendants also used the stolen identities of real U.S> persons to post on ORGANIZATION-controlled social media accounts. Over time, these social media accounts became Defendants' means to reach significant numbers of Americans for purposes of interfering with the U.S. political system, including the presidential election of 2016. 5.Certain Defendants travelled to the United States under false pretenses for the purpose of collecting intelligence to inform Defendants' operations. Defendants also procured and used computer infrastructure, based partly in the United States, to hide the Russian origin of their activities and to avoid detection by U.S. regulators and law enforcement. â 6.Defendant ORGANIZATION had a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Defendants posted derogatory information about a number of candidates, and by early to mid-2016, Defendants'' operations included supporting the presidential campaign of the -candidate Donald J. Trump (""Trump Campaign"") and disparaging Hillary Clinton. Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. Some Defendants, posing as U.S> persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities. 7.In order to carry out their activities to interfere in U.S. political and electoral processes without detection of their Russian affiliation, Defendants conspired to obstruct the lawful functions of the United States government through fraud and deceit, including by making expenditures in connection with the 2016 U.S. presidential election without proper regulatory disclosure; failing to register as foreign agents carrying out political activities within the United States; and obtaining visas through false and fraudulent statements. COUNT ONE (Conspiracy to Defraud the United States) 8.Paragraphs 1 through 7 of this Indictment are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. 9.From in or around 2014 to the present, in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, â Defendants, together with others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, knowingly and intentionally conspired to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the Federal Election Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of States in administering federal requirements for disclosure of foreign involvement in certain domestic activities.

Federal Regulatory Agencies 25.The Federal Election Commission is a federal agency that administers the Federal Election Campaign Act (""FECA""). Among other things, FECA prohibits foreign nationals from making any contributions, expenditures, independent expenditures, or disbursements for electioneering communications. FECA also requires that individuals or entities who make certain independent expenditures in federal elections report those expenditures to the Federal Election Commission. The reporting requirements permit the Federal Election Commission to fulfill its statutory duties of providing the American public with accurate data about the financial activities of individuals and entities supporting federal candidates, and enforcing FECA's limits and prohibitions, including the ban on foreign expenditures. 26.The US. Department of Justice administers the Foreign Agent Registration Act (""FARA""). FARA establishes a registration, reporting, and disclosure regime for agents of foreign principals (which includes foreign non-government individuals and entities) so that the U.S. government and the people of the United States are informed of the source of information and the identity of persons attempting to influence U.S. public opinion, policy, and law. FARA requires, among other things, that persons subject to its requirements submit periodic registration statements containing truthful information about their activities and the income from them. Disclosure of the required information allows the federal government and the American people to evaluate the statements and activities of such persons in light of their function as foreign agents. 27.The U.S. Department of States is the federal agency responsible for the issuance of non-immigrant visas to foreign individuals who need a visa to enter the United States. Foreign individuals who are required to obtain a visa must, among other things, provide truthful information in response to questions on the visa application form, including information about their employment and the purpose of their visit to the United States. Object of the Conspiracy 28.The conspiracy had as its object impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful governmental functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the Defendants to interfere with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Manner and Means of the Conspiracy Intelligence-Gathering to Inform U.S. Operations. 29.Starting at least in or around 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to track and study groups on U.S. social media sites dedicated to U.S. politics and social issues. In order to gauge the performance of various groups on social media sites, the ORGANIZATION tracked certain metrics like the group's size, the frequency of content placed by the group, and the level of audience engagement with that content, such as the average number of comments or responses to a post. 30.Defendants and their co-conspirators also travelled, and attempted to travel, to the United States under false pretenses in order to collect intelligence for their interference operations. a.KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA, together with other Defendants and co-conspirators, planned travel itineraries, purchased equipment (such as cameras, SIM cards, and drop phones), and discussed security measures (including ""evacuation scenarios"") for Defendants who travelled to the United States. b.To enter the United States, KRLYOVA, BOGACHEVA, R. BOVDA, and other co-conspirator applied to the U.S. Department of State for visas to travel. During their application process, KRYLOVA, BOGACHEVA, R. BOVDA, and their co-conspirator falsely claimed they were traveling for personal reasons and did not fully disclose their place of employment to hide the fact that they worked for the ORGANIZATION. c.Only KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA received visas, and from approximately June 4, 2014 through June 26, 2014, KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA travelled in and around the United States, including stops in Nevada, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Louisiana, Texas, and New York to gather intelligence. After the trip, KRYLOVA and BURCHIK exchanged an intelligence report regarding the trip. d.Another co-conspirator who worked for the ORGANIZATION travelled to Atlanta, Georgia from approximately November 26, 2014 through November 30, 2014. Following the trip, the co-conspirator provided POLOZOV a summary of his trip's itinerary and expenses. 31.In order to collect additional intelligence, Defendants and their co-conspirators posed as U.S. persons and contacted U.S. political and social activists. For example, starting in or around June 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators posing online as U.S. persons, communicated with a real U.S. person affiliated with a Texas-based grassroots organization. During the exchange, Defendants and their co-conspirators learned from the real U.S. person that they should focus their activities on ""purple states like Colorado, Virginia & Florida."" After that exchange, Defendants and their co-conspirators commonly referred to targeting ""purple states"" in directing their efforts. â Use of U.S. Social Media Platforms 32.Defendants and their co-conspirators, through fraud and deceit, created hundreds of social media accounts and used them to develop certain fictitious U.S. personas into ""leader[s] of public opinion"" in the United States. 33.ORGANIZATION employees, referred to as ""specialists,"" were tasked to create social media accounts that appeared to be operated by U.S. persons. The specialists were divided into the day-shift and night-shift hours and instructed to make posts in accordance with the appropriate U.S. time zone. The ORGANIZATION also circulated lists of U.S. holidays so that specialists could develop and post appropriate account activity. Specialists were instructed to write about topics germane to the United States such as U.S. foreign policy and U.S. economic issues. Specialists were directed to create ""political intensity through supporting radical group, users dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements."" 34.Defendants and their co-conspirators also created thematic group pages on social media sites, particularly on the social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. ORGANIZATION-controlled pages addressed a range of issues, including: immigration (with group names including ""Secured Borders""); the Black Lives Matter movement (with group names including ""Blacktivist""); religion (with group names including ""United Muslims of America"" and ""Army of Jesus"")' and certain geographic regions within the United States (with group names including ""South United"" and ""Heart of Texas""). By 2016, the size of many ORGANIZATION-controlled groups had grown to hundreds of thousands of online followers. 35.Starting at least in or around 2015, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to purchase advertisements on online social media sites to promote ORGANIZATION-controlled social media groups, spending thousands of U.S. dollars every month. These expenditures were included in the budgets the ORGANIZATION submitted to CONCORD. 36.Defendants and their co-conspirators also created and controlled numerous Twitter accounts designed to appear as if U.S. personas or groups controlled them. For example, the ORGANIZATION created and controlled the Twitter account ""Tennessee GOP,"" which used the handle @TEN_GOP. The @TEN_GOP account falsely claimed to be controlled by a U.S. state political party. Over time, the @TEN_GOP account attracted more than 100,000 online followers. 37.To measure the impact of their online social media operations, Defendants and their co-conspirators tracked the performance of content they posted over social media. They tracked the size of the online U.S. audiences reached through posts, different types of engagement with the posts (such as likes, comments, and reports), changes in audience size, and other metrics. Defendants and their co-conspirators received and maintained metrics reports on certain group pages and individualized posts. 38.Defendants and their co-conspirators also regularly evaluated the content posted by specialists (sometimes referred to as ""content analysis"") to ensure they appeared authenticâas if operated by U.S. persons. Specialists received feedback and directions to improve the quality of their posts. Defendants and their co-conspirators issued or received guidance on: ratios of text, graphics, and video to use in posts; the number of accounts to operate; and the role of each account (for example, differentiating a main account from which to post information and auxiliary accounts to promote a main account through links and reposts). Use of U.S. Computer Infrastructure 39.To hide their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, Defendants and their co-conspiratorsâparticularly POLOZOV and the ORGANIZATION's IT departmentâpurchased space on computer servers located inside the United States in order to set up virtual private networks (""VPNs""). Defendants and their co-conspirators connected from Russia to the U.S.- based infrastructure by way of these VPNs and conducted activity inside the United Statesâincluding accessing online social media accounts, opening new accounts, and communicating with real U.S. personsâwhile masking the Russian origin and control of the activity. 40.Defendants and their co-conspirators also registered and controlled hundreds of web-based email accounts hosted by U.S. email providers under false names so as to appear to be U.S persons and groups. From these accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators registered or linked to online social media accounts in order to monitor them; posed as U.S. persons when requesting assistance from real U.S. persons; contacted media outlets in order to promote activities inside the United States; and conducted other operations, such as those set forth below. Use of Stolen U.S. Identities 41. In or around 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also used, possessed, and transferred, without lawful authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of real U.S. persons without those persons' knowledge or consent. Using these means of identification, Defendants and their co-conspirators opened accounts at PayPal, a digital payment service provider; created false means of identification, including fake drivers' licenses; and posted on ORGANIZATION-controlled social media accounts using the identities of these U.S. victims. Defendants and their co-conspirators also obtained, and attempted to obtain, false identification documents to use as proof of identity in connection with maintaining accounts and purchasing advertisements on social media sites. Actions Targeting the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election 42. By approximately May 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators discussed efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Defendants and their co-conspirators began to monitor U.S. social media accounts and other sources of information about the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 43. By 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump. a. On or about February 10, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators internally circulated an outline of themes for future content to be posted to ORGANIZATION-controlled social media accounts. Specialists were instructed to post content that focused on ""politics in the USA"" and to ""use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trumpâwe support them)."" b. On or about September 14, 2016, in an internal review of ORGANIZATION-created and controlled Facebook group called ""Secured Borders,"" the account specialist was criticized for having a ""low number of posts dedicated to criticizing Hillary Clinton"" and was told ""it is imperative to intensify criticizing Hillary Clinton"" in future posts. 44. Certain ORGANIZATION-produced materials about the 2016 U.S. presidential election used election-related hashtags, including: ""#Trump2016,"" ""#TrumpTrain,"" ""#MAGA,"" ""#IWontProtectHillary,"" and ""#Hillary4Prison."" Defendants and their co-conspirators also established additional online social media accounts dedicated to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including the Twitter account ""March for Trump"" and Facebook accounts ""Clinton FRAUDation"" and ""Trumpsters United."" 45. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false U.S. personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump. These individuals and entities at times distributed the ORGANIZATION's materials through their own accounts via retweets, reposts, and similar means. Defendants and their co-conspirators then monitored the propagation of content through such participants. 46. In or around the latter half of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through their ORGANIZATION-controlled personas, began to encourage U.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate. a. On or about October 16, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the ORGANIZATION-controlled Instagram account ""Woke Blacks"" to post the following message: [A] particular hpe and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off without voting AT ALL."" b. On or about November 3, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased an advertisement to promote a post on the ORGANIZATION-controlled Instagram account ""Blacktivist"" that read in part: ""choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it's not a wasted vote."" c. By in or around early November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the ORGANIZATION-controlled ""United Muslims of America"" social media accounts to post anti-vote messages such as: ""American Muslims [are] boycotting elections today, most of the American Muslim voters refuse to vote for Hillary because she wants to continue the war on Muslims in the middle east and voted yes for invading Iraq."" 47. Starting in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also began to promote allegations of voter fraud by the Democratic Party through their fictitious U.S. personas and groups on social media. Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook to further promote the allegations. a.On or about August 4, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators began purchasing advertisements that promoted a post on the ORGANIZATION-controlled Facebook account ""Stop A.I."" The post alleged that ""Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus."" b.On or about August 11, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators posted that allegations of voter fraud were being investigated in North Carolina on the ORGANIZATION-controlled Twitter account @TEN_GOP. c.On or about November 2, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the same account to post allegations of ""#VoterFraud by counting tens of thousands of ineligible mail in Hillary votes being reported in Broward County, Florida."" Political Advertisements 48. From at least last April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION alffiliation thorugh false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisementsa on U.S. social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the U.S. Department of Justice. 49. To pay for the political advertisements, Defendants and their co-conspirators established various Russian bank accounts and credit cards, often registered in the names of fictitious U.S. personas created and used by the ORGANIZATION on social media. Defendants and their co-conspirators also paid for other political advertisements using PayPal accounts. 50. The political advertisements included the following: Approximate DateExcerpt of Advertisement April 6, 2016""You know, a great number of black people support us saying that #HillaryClintonIsNotMyPresident"" April 7, 2016""I will say no to Hillary Clinton / I say no to manipulation"" April 19, 2016""JOIN our #HillaryClintonForPrison2016"" May 10, 2016""Donald wants to defeat terrorism â¦ Hillary wants to sponsor it"" May 19, 2016""Vote Republican, vote Trump, and support the Second Amendment!""

October 19, 2016""Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is."" Staging U.S. Political Rallies in the United States 51. Starting in approximately June 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators organization and coordinated political rallies in the United States. To conceal the fact that they were based in Russia, Defendants and their co-conspirator promoted these rallies while pretending to be U.S. grassroots activists who were located in the United States but unable to meet or participate in person. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not register as foreign agents with the U.S. Department of Justice. 52. In order to build attendance for the rallies, Defendants and their co-conspirators promoted the events through public posts on their false U.S. persona social media accounts. In addition, Defendants and their co-conspirators contacted administrators of large social media groups focused on U.S. politics and requested that they advertise the rallies. 53. In or around late June 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the Facebook group ""United Muslims of America"" to promote a rally called ""Support Hillary. Save American Muslims"" held on July 9, 2016 in the District of Columbia. Defendants and their co-conspirators recruited a real U.S. person to hold a sign depicting Clinton and a quote to her stating ""I think Sharia Law will be a powerful new direction of freedom."" Within three weeks, on or about July 26, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators posted on the same Facebook page that Muslim voters were ""between Hillary Clinton and a hard place."" 54. In or around June and July 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the Facebook group ""Being Patriotic,"" the Twitter account @March_for_Trump, and other ORGANIZATION accounts to organize two political rallies in New York.

In or around June through July 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook to promote the ""March for Trump"" and ""Down with Hillary"" rallies. b. Defendants and their co-conspirators used false U.S. personas to send individualized messages to real U.S. persons to request that they participate in and help organize the rally. To assist their efforts, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through false U.S> personas, offered money to certain U.S. personas to cover rally expenses. c. On or about June 5, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while posing as a U.S. grassroots activist, used the account @March_for_Trump to contact a volunteer for the Trump Campaign in New York. The volunteer agreed to provide signs for the ""March for Trump"" rally. 55. In or around late July 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the Facebook group ""Being Patriotic,"" the Twitter account @March_for_Trump, and other false U.S. personas to organize a series of coordinated rallies in Florida. The rallies were collectively referred to as ""Florida Goes Trump"" and held on August 20, 2016. a. In or around August 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used false U.S. personas to communicate with Trump Campaign staff involved in local community outreach about the ""Florida Goes Trump"" rallies. b. Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook and Instagram to promote the ""Florida Goes Trump"" rallies. c. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false U.S. personas to contact multiple grassroots groups supporting then-candidate Trump in an unofficial capacity. Many of these groups agreed to participate in the ""Florida Goes Trump"" rallies and serve as local coordinators. d. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false U.S. personas to ask real U.S. persons to participate in the ""Florida Goes Trump"" rallies. Defendants and their co-conspirators asked certain of these individuals to perform tasks at the rallies. For example, Defendants and their co-conspirators asked one U.S. person to build a cage on a flatbed truck and another U.S. person to wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform. Defendants and their co-conspirators paid these individuals to complete the requests. 56. After the rallies in Florida, Defendants and their co-conspirators used false U.S. personas to organize and coordinate U.S. political rallies supporting then-candidate Trump in New York and Pennsylvania. Defendants and their co-conspirators used the same techniques to build and promote these rallies as they had in Florida, including: buying Facebook advertisements; paying U.S. persons to participate in, or perform certain tasks at, the rallies; and communicating with real U.S. persons and grassroots organizations supporting then-candidate Trump. 57. After the election of Donald Trump in or around November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used false U.S. personas to organize and coordinate U.S. political rallies in support of then president-elect Trump, while simultaneously using other false U.S. personas to organize and coordinate U.S. political rallies protesting the results of the 2016 presidential election. For example, in or around November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators organized a rally in New York through one ORGANIZATION-controlled group designed to ""show your support for President-Elect Donald Trump"" held on or about November 12, 2016. At the same time, Defendants and their co-conspirators, though another ORGANIZATION-controlled group, organized a rally in New York called ""Trump is NOT my President"" held on or about November 12, 2016. Similarly, Defendants and their co-conspirators organized a rally entitled ""Charlotte Against Trump"" in Charlotte, North Carolina, held on or about November 19, 2016. Destruction of Evidence 58.

Beginning in or around September 2017, U.S. social media companies, starting with Facebook, publicly reported that they had identified Russian expenditures on their platforms to fund political and social advertisements. Facebook's initial disclosure of the Russian purchases occurred on or about September 6, 2017, and included a statement that Facebook had ""shared [its] findings with US authorities investigating these issues."" c. Media reporting on or about the same day as Facebook's disclosure referred to Facebook working with investigators for the Special Counsel's Office o the U.S. Department of Justice, which had been charged with investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. d. Defendants and their co-conspirators thereafter destroyed evidence for the purpose of impeding the investigation. On or about September 13, 2017, KAVERZINA wrote in an email to a family member: ""We had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity (not a joke). So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues.""

Florida is still a purple state and we need to paint it red. If we lose Florida, we lose America. We can't let it happen, right? What about organizing a YUGE pro-Trump flash mob in every Florida town? We are currently reaching out to local activists and we've got the folks who are okay to be in charge of organizing their events almost everywhere in FL. However, we still need your support. What do you think about that? Are you in? 70. On or about August 2, 2016, and August 3, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through the use of a stolen identity of a real U.S. person, T.W., sent emails to certain grassroots groups located in Florida that stated in part: My name is [T.W.] and I represent a conservative patriotic community named as ""Being Patriotic."" . . . So we're gonna organize a flash mob across Florida to support Mr. Trump. We clearly understand that the elections winner will be predestined by purple states. And we must win Florida. . . .

The activist identified two additional sites in Florida for possible rallies. Defendants and their co-conspirators subsequently used their false U.S. persona accounts to communicate with the activist about logistics and an additional rally in Florida. 75. On or about August 15, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used a false U.S. persona Instagram account connected to the ORGANIZATION-created group ""Tea Party News"" to purchase advertisements for the ""Florida Goes Trump"" rally. 76.

Let us introduce ourselves first. ""Being Patriotic"" is a grassroots conservative online movement trying to unite people offline. . . .

The tactics of a Russian troll farm,"The indictment of 13 Russians charged with attempting to manipulate American voters using social media shines a fascinating light on a sophisticated, relentless operation to exploit the internet for political gain. Here's how US investigators say the Russians did it. It was 2014, and in a building in St Petersburg, the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) was already hard at work building its arsenal to take on US politics. According to US prosecutors, the IRA had gathered stolen identities of real Americans, and a formidable encyclopaedia of what ""works"" on social media when it comes to riling up Americans talking about politics. Two members of the agency were said to have travelled to the US to gather more intelligence, a fact-finding tour taking in nine states, according to investigators. Back on Russian soil, the IRA began posing online as US volunteers in order to gather tips on how to effectively target voters. One real volunteer, based in Texas, told the Russians to aim for the ""purple states"" - those where the race was going to be tighter. And so they did, prosecutors say. By 2016, operations had ramped up as the presidential election drew near. The IRA is alleged to have had a budget of more than a million dollars, and the US now claims they used it to buy advertising on sites such as Twitter and Facebook. How Russian bots appear in your timeline The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? ""Hillary Clinton doesn't deserve the black vote!"" read one, posted in May 2016. ""Trump is our only hope for a better future!"" read another just under a month later. The intent was to create an atmosphere of division and anger online. The Kremlin, the indictment says, wanted instability in America. It wanted to sway some people's vote, and for others, particularly minorities, persuade them not to vote at all. Moscow vociferously denies meddling in the US vote and called the allegations ""absurd"". The indictment says that the IRA controlled an Instagram account called ""Woke Blacks"". ""A particular hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary,"" one message, posted by the account in October 2017, declared. ""We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off without voting AT ALL."" Prosecutors said Russian operatives would work shifts to make sure their posting times matched the timezone of the area they were pretending to be based. But the work was round-the-clock. When the operatives - they called themselves ""specialists"" - weren't posting, they were learning and getting feedback on writing style. They were said to be constantly monitoring the viral success of their approach, tweaking and adjusting to maximise retweets and the spread of the message. The team is also said to have had a list of US public holidays, and appropriate content ready to go so they would blend in. According to court documents, the IRA took several measures to hide its tracks, duping the technology companies who were unaware, or unable, to stop what was filtering through their systems. The key - and obvious - move was to hide the fact that these posts were coming from Russia. For that, the IRA is said to have used several Virtual Private Networks - VPNs - to route their operations through computers in the US. The operatives allegedly used stolen identities to set up PayPal accounts using real American names. The indictment outlines a campaign so effective at reaching American voters, US businesses began paying the Russians to run promotional material. The IRA would charge the businesses - presumably unaware who was behind the account - between $25-$50 per post. It wasn't difficult to transfer this online anger into real life displays on American streets. From their desks in St Petersburg, and using fake American personas such as enthusiastic volunteer ""Matt Skiber"", the Russian operatives are alleged to have orchestrated real-life protests and demonstrations. In one, a person dressed as Hillary Clinton in prison attire stood inside a purpose-built cage on the back of a flatbed truck, investigators say. The IRA is said to have paid for advertisements on Facebook that pushed rallies in the ""purple"" states it had been advised to target by the volunteer on the ground in Texas. Once Mr Trump was elected, investigators said the IRA moved to sow more discontent. It pushed two conflicting demonstrations in New York, one in support of the new president-elect and another bearing the message ""Trump is NOT my President"". In the process, the IRA is said to have built up a list of more than 100 real Americans who it had contacted for help in organising these real-world efforts - none of them aware they were puppets in a most audacious Russian campaign. A campaign that, as far as we know, is very much ongoing.

Who's who in Russia scandal?,"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on. Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 35 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered. This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?! It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season. Who was he?Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher,here's his life story. Key plot lineAs Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said. The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know? Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called ""a complete and total exoneration"". But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension. Who was he?He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine. Key plot lineHe was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker. Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while. He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later). After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison. In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Read more:The man who helped Trump win Who was he?The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians. Key plot lineDonald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is. The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton. This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought. Read more:Trump Jr's habit for making headlines DonaldTrumpconfounded his critics by winningthe presidency.But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come. Who was he?The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI. Key plot lineFlynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only ""simple things""). The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. At the end of Season Three, in December 2017,Flynn pleaded guiltyto making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle. Read more:Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn? Who was he?Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 wasthe Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot lineKislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots. The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place. Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a ""top spy and recruiter of spies"". Who was he?Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years. Key plot lineSessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings. When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation. That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign. That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist. Read more:An attorney general dogged by scandal This was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling. Who was she?A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an ""informant"" for Russia's prosecutor general. Key plot lineHers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges. That meeting would never have happened without... Who were they?Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough tosend each other birthday messages,external. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow. Key plot lineAgain in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the ""crown prosecutor"" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up? Read more:The tough-talking networker Who was he?He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot lineWhen Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. Read more:Who is Rod Rosenstein? Who was he?Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard. Key plot lineAmid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave. Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose. Read more:The son-in-law with Trump's ear Who was he?A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric. Key plot lineRob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Read more:The Music Man with a love for hats Who was he?At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story. Key plot lineHe first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him. Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point. Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused. Read more:The FBI director who took centre stage Who was he?A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation. Key plot lineIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so. Read more:Why Papadopoulos case matters Who was he?The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands. Key plot lineSome characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as ""special counsel"" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI. There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office. There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series. After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four.The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...? Who was he?OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Key plot lineA little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US. In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Read more:Seven key takeaways from indictment Who was he?The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him. Key plot lineCohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth. When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York. Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence. Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell. Who was he?A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: ""One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."" Key plot lineStone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back. Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public. After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia. All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a ""witch-hunt"" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were ""a steaming plate of bull"".

Boy 'marked 17th' with 'animalistic' rape,"This video can not be played CCTV shows Charlie Pearce on the night of the attack with a slab under his arm A teenager who ""marked his 17th birthday"" by bludgeoning a woman with a paving slab before raping her has been given a life sentence. ""Animalistic"" Charlie John Pearce wasfound guilty of attempted murderat Leicester Crown Court last year. The court heard he had searched the internet for videos showing attacks on ""helpless"" women before the attack. Pearce, who had denied trying to kill the woman but admitted rape, was told he must serve a minimum of 11 years. Pearce was captured on CCTV on the night the attack happened Sentencing at the Old Bailey, Justice Charles Haddon-Cave described Pearce as ""exceptionally dangerous"" and said he attacked the woman with ""animalistic savagery"". ""The defendant set out that evening to mark his 17th birthday to find a woman to rape and violently attack,"" he said. ""[The victim] could remember nothing of her ordeal, her life had been hanging on a thread."" Charlie Pearce's defence said it is ""of significant concern"" someone of his age ""could commit such a serious crime"" The court heard the attack in Victoria Park in Leicester took place at about 23:35 on 3 July, after Pearce had celebrated his birthday in a pub. Youths nearby witnessed the initial struggle and called 999 but a police patrol could not identify the location, the court heard. The woman - who cannot be identified - was found with ""truly dreadful"" injuries about an hour later by a passing cyclist. Leicestershire Police released a ""remarkably clear"" CCTV image of Pearce running towards the woman holding the slab. He was recognised by his own family who then contacted police. Pearce - who could only be named when a court order was lifted - denied intending to kill the woman, but had admitted two counts of rape. He also admitted causing grievous bodily harm and stealing the woman's handbag which he later burned. The victim was dragged into bushes near an entrance to the park Pearce's victim said she has been ""mentally and physically scarred"" by the attack. In a victim impact statement read out in court she said she still has bald patches and suffers jaw pain and loss of hearing following the attack. ""I am reminded on a daily basis - and sometimes multiple times a day - of the extensive trauma my body has endured and my mind cannot remember,"" she said. ""I have had thoughts about hurting myself and ending my life because I feel that I cannot live with the knowledge I have that what happened to me has happened to me.""

Brazil army takes control of Rio security,"Rio de Janeiro has seen levels of violent crime soar amid a financial crisis The Brazilian government has appointed an army general to oversee security in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in response to growing gang violence. President Michel Temer compared the violence to ""a cancer"" and said organised criminals had all but seized control of the state. Rio's governor issued an appeal for help after the annual carnival celebrations were marred by violence. The army will oversee police and other security services. Overseeing the operation will be Gen Walter Souza Braga Netto, head of the Eastern Military Command. He was widely praised for his part in co-ordinating security for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. Signing the decree, Mr Termer said he was taking ""extreme measures"" because circumstances demanded it. ""The government will give tough and firm answers, taking all necessary measures to eradicate organised crime,"" he said. There were chaotic scenes during the famous Rio carnival, with gun fights and looting. Three police officers died in violent clashes. Is Rio de Janeiro a city at war? Stray bullets: The girl shot in the play area An education disrupted by violence National TV news bulletins also broadcast footage of gangs surrounding and robbing tourists. With the security situation apparently spiralling out of control, state governor Luiz Fernando Pezao made a plea to the national government saying military intervention was the only way to tackle the heavily armed gangs. He apologised to those revellers affected, saying:  ""We were not ready. There were mistakes in the first days and we reinforced the patrols."" President Michel Temer (l) acted after a plea from Rio governor Luiz Fernando Pezao (r) Rio's police budget has been slashed in recent years because of a financial crisis. There have been criticisms that police do not even have the money to pay for the petrol in their patrol cars. Finances in Rio state have been badly hit by a national recession and a slump in oil prices, as well as high levels of corruption. The financial problems have only emboldened criminal gangs. Figures from the Rio state government show an 8% increase in killings last year over 2016 and a 26% jump since 2015. Samba school wins with anti-corruption message Julia Carneiro, BBC News, Rio de Janeiro Stunned, numb, in shock or in denial. Living in Rio brings such mixed feelings today. Life continues as usual in the city and residents go about trying to lead their lives normally. There's ""nothing happening"" - until something does. And more and more violence has been getting in the way, with stray bullets killing children in favelas, shoot-outs closing down major highways and mass robberies ruining the fun for several residents and tourists in the middle of the Carnival celebrations. The saying goes in Brazil that the year starts once Carnival ends, and the intervention announced by the federal government reinforces the feeling that there's no escaping reality. If Rio already felt misgoverned, the fact that the state governor willingly gave up his power for the president to call the shots in the security arena adds to the feeling of helplessness in the hands of unpopular politicians. For now, there will be hope that at least something is being done. But Brazilians are weary of big political gestures - especially in the months leading up to a presidential election. The army regularly patrols some of the most dangerous areas of Rio de Janeiro where drugs gangs hold sway, but now the military presence could be felt all over the city's metropolitan area of 12 million people and the wider state. Correspondents say it will be the first time the army has had such a high profile since Brazil's return to democracy in 1985, which followed 21 years of military rule. The move still needs to be approved by Brazil's National Congress. Rio's spectacular carnival celebrations were marred by escalating violence ""Organised crime has almost taken over the state of Rio de Janeiro, it is a cancer that spreads throughout the country and threatens the tranquillity of our people, so we have now enacted the federal intervention of the public security area of ââRio de Janeiro,"" Mr Temer said. Brazilian media, citing government sources, said the current head of public security, Roberto SÃ¡, would be removed from office. It is understood Gen Netto will be in charge of Rio state security at least until the end of the year. The UK woman leading the dance at the Rio Carnival Evil rat stars in political Rio parade.

Romney launches comeback with Trump dig,"Mitt Romney lost his race to oust President Barack Obama in 2012 Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has announced he is running for a US Senate seat in Utah, while taking a dig at President Donald Trump. In a Facebook campaign video, he lamented that Washington was sending ""a message of exclusion"" to immigrants. A vocal critic of Mr Trump, Mr Romney is seen as a shoo-in for outgoing Republican Senator Orrin Hatch's seat. The ex-private equity manager has kept a low profile since losing his 2012 race to oust President Barack Obama. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Touting his management of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, Mr Romney said his adopted home state was a model for Washington DC. ""Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world,"" he said in a Facebook campaign video. ""Washington sends them a message of exclusion."" Since his failed White House campaign, Mr Romney has served as a chairman of his son's investment firm and on the board of directors of Marriott International. While he was in the running to be secretary of state, Mr Romney dined with Mr Trump at a Manhattan restaurant But he has assiduously maintained his links to the Republican party. In 2016 he positioned himself as the voice of mainstream conservatism with stinging attacks on Mr Trump. ""His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University,"" said Mr Romney. Mr Trump hit back, calling Mr Romney a ""failed candidate"" who ""choked like a dog"" in the 2012 race. This video can not be played Mitt Romney on Donald Trump: ''His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University'' However, once Mr Trump captured the White House, Mr Romney dined with him in November 2016 at a Manhattan restaurant while he was in the running to be the president-elect's secretary of state. Mr Romney did not get the job. Perhaps mindful of a Romney resurgence, the president recently urged Mr Hatch, seen as a Trump loyalist, to run again for another six-year term. In December, Mr Trump travelled to Utah where he called Mr Hatch ""a true fighter"" and said he hoped he would continue to serve ""in the Senate for a very long time to come"". Senator Hatch is the longest-serving Republican senator in US history But the veteran senator announced last month he would step down at the end of the year. ""Every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves,"" said Mr Hatch. The longest-serving Senate Republican with seven terms under his belt, he was first elected in 1976. Mr Romney's campaign announcement was enthusiastically welcomed by his former running mate, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan was chosen as Mitt Romney's running mate in the 2012 presidential election against incumbent Barack Obama ""This is a terrific day for the United States Senate,"" said the most powerful Republican congressman in a statement. ""Our party and our country are always better off when Mitt is engaged, and I know that he will put his unparalleled experience, conservative leadership, and lifetime of service to work for Utah in the US Senate.""

Q&A: Trump Russia story,"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin For nearly two years the Trump-Russia affair has dominated front pages and mired the president's administration in conflict and controversy. But what is it exactly? How did it begin? And what did it find out? The inquiry, led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller, focused on alleged collusion between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out 10 instances where the president possibly obstructed justice. Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option. Here's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Both the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of ""collusion"", with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". At least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according toan analysis of public records by the New York Times,external, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications. Trump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters. The special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies. A former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0. With a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation. What is a special counsel? America's most mysterious public figure On 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign. The448-page report,externalpainted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Mr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime. Eight new things in the Mueller report ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" It also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned. Around 10% of the public report is redacted. As well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations: The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides The House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials The Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow Meanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia All of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January. The Senate committee has yet to release its findings. Before the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report beforeissuing his interpretation to Congress. There was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI. But legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of ""corrupt intent"". In his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: ""The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'."" Mr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month. He said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump ""clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so"". Mr Mueller added that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process. The special counsel said he did not believe it was ""appropriate to speak further"" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report. But the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story. The former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice. This video can not be played What to expect from Mueller hearings Mr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements. Democrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety. Back in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials. Then-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation. The FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Mr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting. A few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing ""this Russia thing"", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up. Part of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be ""very useful to your father"". It was part of the Russian government's ""support"" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I love it."" Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only ""inane nonsense"" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"". In an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics"". President Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry. See our fullRussia timeline. The arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama. The charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Stone: Trump ally, political strategist and Nixon fan It means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling. Mr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign. In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. Emails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter. Just before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had ""never met a single Russian official"". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled ""Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump"". In January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this. The file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president. Mr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. It didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier. The special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called ""phishing"" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords. Hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details. The second prong allegedly involved flooding social media networks, especially Facebook, with bogus stories designed to smear the Democrats and undermine the Clinton campaign. According to testimony by Facebook before Congress, Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on the social network during and after election. In August 2016, an envelope arrived at the White House marked for the eyes of President Barack Obama and three senior aides. According to theWashington Post,external, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election. The FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way. According to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet. Other intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow. Warnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name. The president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. However, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? As for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded. In the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president. That's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage. With a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.

Real Ale group sorry for 'offensive' crossword,"Clues seven and 18 in the crossword published in the Derby Drinker have been criticised The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) group has apologised after one of its branches published a crossword clue with the word ""negro"". The crossword, printed in Derby Camra's bi-monthly magazine, also suggests ""effeminate"" men share a name with a sex toy. The publication has been described as ""homophobic"" and ""disgusting"" by some social media users. Camra said it had begun an investigation. The crossword features on the back page of the January/February issue of Derby Camra's free magazine, the Derby Drinker. One clue reads: ""US negro could become an operational doctor (7)"". Another asks readers to fill in the squares with a word which relates to: ""A sex toy or an effeminate man (5)"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Merkel 'curious' about UK's Brexit aims,"Angela Merkel has said she is ""not frustrated"" by the Brexit process but is ""curious"" to know more about the UK's aims after meeting Theresa May. The German chancellor said she hoped to establish ""common ground"" on future trade goals in the coming months and wanted a ""close partnership"" of equals. Mrs May said she wanted a ""bold and ambitious"" trade partnership as well as a new security arrangement with the EU. But amid calls for more UK detail, she said it was not a ""one-way street"". Friday's meeting between the two leaders at Berlin's Chancellery comes ahead of a speech on Saturday in which Mrs May will set out the ""security partnership"" she envisages with European partners at the annual Munich Security Conference. European spy chiefs in Brexit joint plea Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision Juncker angry at 'superstate' claims British ministers are making a series of speeches mapping out the ""road to Brexit"" to counter criticism of a lack of clarity and contradictions in their vision of the UK's future relationship with the EU once it leaves in March 2019. Asked whether she was frustrated by the UK's position, Mrs Merkel said: ""I'm not frustrated at all. I'm just curious how Britain envisages this future partnership and obviously we also have our own vested interests as regards, for example, economic commitments."" She added: ""We would like to preserve this close partnership and maybe both sides, in a way, are in a process of learning and trying to find out where we find common ground."" Asked about the possible trade relationship the UK could expect with the EU, she said the partnership would not be as close as it currently is, but that this did not mean ""cherry picking"" from the UK side would be required in what she anticipated would be a ""very complex set of negotiations"". Who knew Chancellor Merkel had such good comic timing? She wasn't ""frustrated"" by the lack of clarity from the UK she was (slight pause, raised eyebrow) ""curious"". A masterpiece of wry understatement. Before the prime minister's trip to Berlin, the German government said it hoped the UK would produce ""concrete"" plans for Brexit soon. But if Theresa May did flesh out her thinking in talks with Angela Merkel, neither leader was letting on. Their post-meeting remarks were courteous and warm but heavy on platitudes and light on detail. Mrs Merkel said there could be a close economic partnership between the UK and the EU that did not amount to ""cherry picking"" all the benefits of single market membership without the costs. This will have encouraged Theresa May who said EU firms would benefit too. But for negotiations to move on, Theresa May's divided cabinet needs to hammer out a collective position on what it's asking for after the transition period expires. Angela Merkel isn't the only politician curious to discover the answers. Mrs May said she was seeking a ""future economic partnership"" that suited both sides, and for British and German companies to have the maximum possible freedom to operate in each other's markets. The UK prime minister's trip to Berlin comes as the UK and the EU attempt to agree details of the temporary ""transition"" period that will come immediately after Brexit day and is intended to smooth the path to the permanent post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU. Speaking after the last round of talks, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said ""substantial"" disagreements remained and he had ""some problems understanding the UK's position"". This video can not be played Ex-GCHQ boss: UK defence will decline if there is no Brexit plan in place On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attempted to appeal to Remain supporters, urging people to unite behind his vision of a ""liberal Brexit"". The British government, meanwhile, has offered to extend guarantees on EU citizens' rights after Brexit to the 20,000 Norwegian, Icelandic and Liechtensteinian nationals living in the UK. Citizens from the three countries - all members of the European Economic Area - living in the UK for the past five years will be able to apply for settled status on the same basis as nationals from the other 27 EU member states. This would grant them permanent residency and largely the same access as now to healthcare, pensions and other benefits. The UK hopes the offer will be reciprocated and will give similar assurances to the 15,000 British expats in Norway, the 800 in Iceland and 60 in Liechtenstein. On the first day of the Munich security event, the heads of the three largest European intelligence agencies have made an unprecedented joint appearance to emphasise the necessity of international co-operation. After holding talks, the head of Britain's MI6, Alex Younger, and his German and French counterparts issued a statement committing themselves to cross-border information sharing after Brexit to tackle international terrorism, illegal migration, nuclear proliferation and cyber attacks. ""Modern threats require a modern response. Any failure to do so would lead to even greater risk,"" they said.

May warns EU not to block security deal,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Those who threaten our security would like nothing more than to see us fractured"" Theresa May has called for a new ""deep and special partnership"" to ensure the UK and EU can continue to work together on security after Brexit. She said new arrangements in foreign and defence policy cooperation should be effective by next year. In a speech to the Munich Security Conference the prime minister said the UK would remain committed to Europe's security after leaving the EU. New security arrangements have yet to be negotiated for after Brexit. Theresa May said that, without cooperation, the UK would no longer be able to help the European police agency Europol as it currently does or extradite suspects as quickly. This video can not be played Theresa May's response to Brexit 'extremely regrettable' remark. To maintain coordination on security Theresa May said the UK and EU should continue to work together on sanctions, operations on the ground and developing capabilities in defence, cyber and space. The prime minister warned that ""rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated ideology"" should not jeopardise the security of UK citizens. ""We must do whatever is most practical and pragmatic in ensuring our collective security,"" she added. She said the UK and EU's enemies would ""like nothing better than to see us fractured"". President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""security bridge between the UK and the EU would still be maintained"" but added ""you cannot mix it up with other issues."" Secure exit? How will Brexit affect UK security? Europol head fears loss of UK influence Theresa May noted that the EU had comprehensive relationships with other countries on trade and argued that there is ""no legal or operational reason"" why similar agreements could not be reached on security. During talks with Angela Merkel on Friday, Mrs May said both sides need to be ""bold and ambitious"" in framing their future relations. The German chancellor said that while the UK could not replicate its existing membership outside the EU, she wanted relations to be ""as close as possible"". EU member states currently work closely in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Merkel 'curious' about UK's Brexit aims UK reveals proposed EU security deal European spy chiefs in Brexit joint plea Key initiatives include the European Arrest Warrant - under which suspects can be speedily extradited between member states - Europol, the EU intelligence agency, and the Schengen Information System of real-time alerts about suspects. The UK says that while the legal framework for its membership of these arrangements will end when it leaves the EU in March 2019, it wants to draw up new working arrangements - which ministers have described as being ""as close to the status quo as possible"". Mrs Merkel said she was ""curious not frustrated"" about the UK's approach In her speech, Mrs May pointed to the arrest of suspected terrorists and operations against people traffickers as examples of the benefits of cooperation across borders. The moderator at the event, Wolfgang Ischinger, said that the UK's decision to leave the EU was ""extremely regrettable"" and that ""everything would be so much easier if you stayed."" The Lib Dem's defence spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said it was ""high time"" the prime minister said ""what she wants and what she is willing to give way on."" Theresa May has spent months calling for a deep and special economic partnership with the EU after Brexit and now her focus turns to security. Again she's asking for a unique arrangement. Britain will be outside the EU, a ""third"" country, and it would be unprecedented for the current close cooperation  to continue. But the thrust of the British government's argument is that we should be a special case. The UK is offering its substantial resources (the second largest defence budget in NATO) and expertise in counter terrorism. The prime minister wants a treaty to enshrine what Downing Street describes as the real, tangible benefits of cooperation, and says failure to sign up will play into the hands of our enemies who'd like nothing more than to see Europe divided. Her warning to EU leaders is blunt. Don't let your deep seated ideology put Europe's citizens in danger. Mrs May has consistently said that she won't use security as a bargaining chip, that her offer is ""unconditional"" but that's no guarantee that the EU would simply accept a request from the UK to continue to be a part of Europol or the European Arrest Warrant. Her hope is that the EU takes a practical, pragmatic approach because they accept that continuing to work together is mutually beneficial. Earlier this year the outgoing head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told the BBC Brexit would mean the UK losing influence on cross-border policing and security work. ""We will find other ways of influencing, more informal ways, but they will be less direct, less pronounced and probably less successful than they are now,"" he said. Mrs May's speech is one of a series dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" with her government under pressure to set out in detail what it wants life outside the EU to look like.

Right now, you're the most important sportsperson in the whole country. Take a moment to think about that: right now, the whole UK is talking about a woman in sport. You personally are responsible for making so many women feel like they can get involved. You're a legend and an inspiration already and you'll be the reason a whole load of girls decide to stop bunking off PE and start being like you. You're exactly the role model we've needed for so long and we're all so proud of you back home. Go and show the field who's boss this weekend. You'll always be our ice queen."" Kevan Dunne, Maidstone: ""Win or lose, you're an inspiration. You're strong and will find a way through whatever happens. Skate like you're free as the wind; live life like you skate; and never give up."" Leanne Dedunu, Devon: ""Hey Elise, just to let you know that many of us (myself included) have never watched or followed this crazy and brutal sport of yours, until you inspired us to follow and THAT is bigger than a medal - that is a legacy! We are proud of you and please keep going. PS When you're back, come to Devon and I'll treat you to a cream tea; you've earned it!"" Simon Kershaw, Edinburgh: ""Elise, use that disappointment to fire yourself up even more for the next two events. For me, you are everything an Olympic champion should be: someone that can come back from multiple setbacks and still achieve your dream. Believe in yourself as everyone back home believes in you. You got this!"" Clara, Wirral: ""Elise. I have been captured by your story and spent all day watching you with my two-year-old banging on the TV every time you were on! You are brave, you are a warrior. Fall seven times... and stand up eight. We're all rooting for you!"" Ben, Plymouth: ""Elise... our whole family watched you put your trust in a few millimetres of steel and it not quite work out. You must feel you are a long way from home at the moment but rest assured the whole nation is behind you. My kids have been sliding round on the laminate flooring in their socks pretending to be you all afternoon!"" Margaret McFarlane, Cumbernauld: ""E is for Exceptional. L is for Lovely. I is for Intrepid. S is for Steely. E is for Ecstatic. All of these adjectives will describe you after your next race! Go for gold and keep the heid as we say in Scotland!"" Andy Jeron, Milton Keynes: ""You have given more than enough proof of your quality and what you can achieve. In those dark moments, many do give in, but you continued, even when you received vile comments, you endured, carried on, never gave up. That in itself makes you a winner and inspiration. The nation stands behind you regardless of what comes next. Elise, you're brilliant, gifted and a proven winner. Remember those moments and go in confidence, fear no-one and that medal will be yours."" Angela, Reading, Berkshire: ""I am proud to be British watching you, and we wish you all the very best. Roar like the lion you are."" Mikhail: ""Elise, I hope you are keeping a diary, because as well as a gold medal, you can look forward to a shared writing credit in the 'Best Original Screenplay' category at a future Oscars ceremony! This story is going to deserve the full Hollywood treatment, as long as you stick with it right to the final credits."" Keith Thompson, Blackfordby: ""Elise, here we are, another day and another croissant. Take a bite out of this new day. Pyeongchang is not Sochi and comparing the two is a fool's errand. Your day is to come, be it Saturday or Tuesday/Wednesday. You have to do this, not for us but for you.""

The woman claims she was also sexually assaulted by another Oxfam worker after a party in South Sudan months later. She says she was ""screaming for help"" during the incident at her accommodation ""but nobody came"".

But the woman - who said it had been her dream to work for Oxfam - said the assault continued in a car later. ""He got in next to me and I was scared so I got out and went to sit in the back,"" she said. ""He just threw me out of my seat and pinned me into the ground and one of my colleagues - a woman who was also my roommate - reached  back and tried to grab me and pick me out. ""I was hitting him and kicking him and she helped me and I got back into the middle seat and jumped into the front seat on the passenger side.

"Boy 'marked 17th' with 'animalistic' rapeCharlie Pearce marked his 17th birthday by finding ""a woman to rape and violently attack,"" a judge says.3h3 hours agoLeicester","This video can not be played CCTV shows Charlie Pearce on the night of the attack with a slab under his arm A teenager who ""marked his 17th birthday"" by bludgeoning a woman with a paving slab before raping her has been given a life sentence. ""Animalistic"" Charlie John Pearce wasfound guilty of attempted murderat Leicester Crown Court last year. The court heard he had searched the internet for videos showing attacks on ""helpless"" women before the attack. Pearce, who had denied trying to kill the woman but admitted rape, was told he must serve a minimum of 11 years. Pearce was captured on CCTV on the night the attack happened Sentencing at the Old Bailey, Justice Charles Haddon-Cave described Pearce as ""exceptionally dangerous"" and said he attacked the woman with ""animalistic savagery"". ""The defendant set out that evening to mark his 17th birthday to find a woman to rape and violently attack,"" he said. ""[The victim] could remember nothing of her ordeal, her life had been hanging on a thread."" Charlie Pearce's defence said it is ""of significant concern"" someone of his age ""could commit such a serious crime"" The court heard the attack in Victoria Park in Leicester took place at about 23:35 on 3 July, after Pearce had celebrated his birthday in a pub. Youths nearby witnessed the initial struggle and called 999 but a police patrol could not identify the location, the court heard. The woman - who cannot be identified - was found with ""truly dreadful"" injuries about an hour later by a passing cyclist. Leicestershire Police released a ""remarkably clear"" CCTV image of Pearce running towards the woman holding the slab. He was recognised by his own family who then contacted police. Pearce - who could only be named when a court order was lifted - denied intending to kill the woman, but had admitted two counts of rape. He also admitted causing grievous bodily harm and stealing the woman's handbag which he later burned. The victim was dragged into bushes near an entrance to the park Pearce's victim said she has been ""mentally and physically scarred"" by the attack. In a victim impact statement read out in court she said she still has bald patches and suffers jaw pain and loss of hearing following the attack. ""I am reminded on a daily basis - and sometimes multiple times a day - of the extensive trauma my body has endured and my mind cannot remember,"" she said. ""I have had thoughts about hurting myself and ending my life because I feel that I cannot live with the knowledge I have that what happened to me has happened to me.""

FBI failed to act on gunman concerns,"This video can not be played Florida survivors on gun laws: 'Something has to change' The FBI has said it did not properly follow up on a warning that Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz might carry out an attack. Last month, a person close to the 19-year-old contacted the law enforcement agency to warn of ""the potential of him conducting a school shooting"". But protocols were not followed and the tipline did not pass along the complaint, the FBI said. It was not the first potential warning to the FBI regarding Mr Cruz. This video can not be played Inside the classroom: 'We watched gunman shoot our friends' He has confessed to carrying out Wednesday's attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has been charged with 17 counts of murder. It was the deadliest US school shooting since 2012. On Friday, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited a hospital in Florida where victims of the shooting were being treated. A White House spokeswoman said the couple came to the hospital to ""pay their respects"" and thank employees for their response to the shooting. The president and his wife later visited the Broward County sheriff's office to meet law enforcement officials who responded to the shooting. ""What a great job you've done,"" Mr Trump said, adding: ""I hope you get credit for it because believe me, you deserve it."" US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said he is ordering a review of the justice department's processes in the wake of the FBI's mishandling of the tip. The review will look at what went wrong and broadly examine how the justice department responds to such cases. ""It is now clear that the warning signs were there and tips to the FBI were missed,"" he said in a statement. ""We see the tragic consequences of those failures."" Florida Governor Rick Scott said in a furious statement that the director of the FBI must resign. ""The FBI's failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable,"" he said. ""The families will spend a lifetime wondering how this could happen, and an apology will never give them answers they desperately need."" The Republican governor said Americans must have confidence in the FBI to act on ""see something, say something"" tips. Florida shooting: A survivor's story White House won't release photo of Trump gun law repeal Analysis: One shooting, two Americas A group of Florida lawmakers who travelled from the state capitol to visit the school on Thursday agreed to tear down and replace Building 12, where the massacre occurred. ""It will still be very difficult for students to return,"" Republican Senator Bill Galvano told the Miami Herald newspaper. ""But that particular building should be razed, and the memory of the perpetrator erased and a memorial honoring the victims and their families be put in its place."" On 5 January a person close to the teenager contacted the FBI tipline to provide ""information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behaviour, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting"", said an FBI press release. The agency said that under established protocols, the caller's information to the Public Access Line should have been assessed as a potential threat to life and passed on to the Miami field office. ""We have determined these protocols were not followed,"" said the FBI. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau is ""still investigating the facts"". ""I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public,"" he said. ""We have spoken with victims and families, and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy,"" he added. In 2016, the FBI received about 1,300 tips a day through its website, which is staffed around the clock by two dozen people. In addition to online tips, FBI field offices receive dozens of calls. About 100 of the tips are considered ""actionable"".

Gun law repeal photo hidden,"The White House released a photo of a different bill signing from the same day relating to environmental regulations The White House has refused to release a photo of President Donald Trump signing a law making it easier for some people with mental illness to buy guns. Despite repeated requests from CBS News, the White House press office has issued only a one-line response. Mr Trump last year repealed an Obama-era rule allowing the names of certain people on mental health benefits to be entered into a criminal database. The controversy follows a shooting by a suspect who had mental health issues. Teen admits Florida shooting, police say Who are the victims? How the school attack happened Nikolas Cruz is accused of using a legally-purchased rifle to kill 17 people at his former high school in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday. In a tweet, Mr Trump called the gunman ""mentally disturbed"" and vowed to ""tackle the difficult issue of mental health"" during a speech to the nation. But the Republican president's critics noted his own annual budget proposed this week would cuts hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for mental health programmes. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? HJ Resolution 40 was signed by President Trump on 28 February last year, weeks after his inauguration. It repealed an Obama-era rule that would have affected about 75,000 US citizens who are too mentally ill to handle their own disability benefits. The Obama measure covered those of ""marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease,external"". It also ordered the US Social Security Administration, which administers benefits, to add these names to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. That database is used by the FBI to determine who is able to purchase a firearm. The National Rifle Association, an influential gun lobby, was not the only opponent of the Obama-era gun control measure. The ACLU, a prominent civil-rights organisation, and mental health advocacy organisations backed the repeal that was signed by Mr Trump. English teen hid from gunman in cupboard Analysis: One shooting, two Americas Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump likes to tout how many laws he's signed - even if some are no more significant than naming a post office or appointing a member of an advisory board. There's one bit of legislation the White House seems keen for Americans to forget, however. The repeal of an Obama-era rule requiring the Social Security Administration to provide information about individuals with mental health issues for gun-purchase background checks is a bit more complicated than Mr Trump's critics make it out to be. Civil libertarians and disability rights activists had serious reservations about the potential for privacy violations and a chilling effect the rule might have on those who need counselling services. What's worth noting, however, is that the White House - with its reluctance to provide evidence of the bill-signing - is acknowledging this could be damaging for them. Presidential strategists probably envision photographs of the event in countless Democratic campaign adverts. The president reportedly told aides after Parkland that they have to ""do something"" in response. The White House's reluctance to own up to its only legislative action on firearms is another indication that, when it comes to gun control, they may feel the ground shifting beneath their feet. Late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel, who has often used his show as a political platform, excoriated Mr Trump for signing the bill. ""You've literally done nothing,"" on guns, Kimmel said tearfully on Thursday. ""Actually, you've done worse than nothing. You like to say this is a mental health issue. ""One of your very first acts as president, Mr Trump, was to roll back the regulations that were designed to keep firearms out of the hands of mentally ill,"" he continued. ""So I agree, this is a mental illness issue, because if you don't think we need to do something about it, you're obviously mentally ill.""

The crossword, printed in Derby Camra's bi-monthly magazine, also suggests ""effeminate"" men share a name with a sex toy. The publication has been described as ""homophobic"" and ""disgusting"" by some social media users. Camra said it had begun an investigation. The crossword features on the back page of the January/February issue of Derby Camra's free magazine, the Derby Drinker. One clue reads: ""US negro could become an operational doctor (7)"". Another asks readers to fill in the squares with a word which relates to: ""A sex toy or an effeminate man (5)"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

British man charged with terror offences,"Aidan James was arrested at Liverpool Airport on 14 February A British man who fought against so-called Islamic State in Syria has been charged with three terror offences. Aidan James, a father-of-one from Formby, Merseyside, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday. The 27-year-old had been fighting alongside the YPG Kurdish militia. He has been charged with one count of the preparation of acts of terrorism and two counts of attendance at a place used for terrorist training. The court heard that Mr James left the UK on 26 August 2017, travelling to Iraq via Jordan. He later travelled to Syria, the court was told. Mr James was arrested on his return to the UK at Liverpool Airport on 14 February. He was remanded in custody and will appear at the Old Bailey for a plea hearing on 1 March. By Emma Vardy, BBC News correspondent Aidan James is the second person in a week to appear in court charged with terror offences after fighting against so-called Islamic State. Since 2015, the government has often restated warnings about the cohort of British citizens who have been fighting with the Kurds in Syria, saying their actions could be in breach of UK terrorism laws. Local counter-terror police ""Prevent"" teams have also tried to intervene in cases of British citizens who have gone to fight against IS. Many of these volunteer fighters have been arrested on their return, but have faced a long wait to find out whether there would be serious legal consequences. They have justified their actions by saying they have been fighting on the same side as the Western coalition, in trying to destroy IS.

EU 'drops Brexit punishment clause',"Both sides say they want a time-limited transition after the UK leaves the EU next year EU diplomats have removed a so-called ""punishment clause"" from a draft text of the arrangement for the Brexit transition period, the BBC understands. A footnote published by the European Commission last week suggested that the UK would lose access to elements of the European single market if it broke EU rules during the transition period. But officials have now promised new wording that makes reference to the EU's standard infringement procedures. Brexit is scheduled for 29 March 2019. The two sides are set to begin negotiations next month on the terms of transition period after the UK's departure, which the EU has said should last until 31 December 2020. Theresa May has said a time-limited implementation period of about two years will allow businesses to adjust to changes arising from Brexit and enable the UK to negotiate its future relationship with the EU. The EU has said the UK should abide by all existing rules and regulations during the transition phase and, in text published last week, suggested there would be specific sanctions if this was not respected. Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision Juncker angry at  EU 'superstate' claims This angered a number of Conservative MPs who argue the transition terms being proposed are too punitive and, in particular, the UK should not be expected to sign up to any new laws that it has not had any say over. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said that, following a meeting earlier on Wednesday, officials from the other 27 nations promised a new, less tough-sounding paragraph will feature in an expanded draft of the withdrawal agreement - expected to be published by the end of the month.

Commonwealth in secret succession plans Tax haven firms own 23,000 UK properties Official portraits of Obamas unveiled Speaking on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it would be ""intolerable and undemocratic"" if the UK was subject to EU laws after Brexit and was not able to determine its own regulations when it came to trading with the rest of the world. He suggested the benefits of being in the single market and customs union were ""nothing like as conspicuous or irrefutable"" as claimed by their supporters.

Johnson's plea for Brexit unity,"This video can not be played Johnson: We need to get positive agenda across Boris Johnson has told his fellow Brexiteers they should not ""gloat"" about the UK's departure from the EU, which he said was a cause for ""hope not fear"". The foreign secretary urged people to ""unite about what we all believe in"", an ""outward-looking, confident"" UK. Leaving the EU was not a ""great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover"", he said. Mr Johnson also said the result cannot be reversed and that Britain should not be bound by EU rules after Brexit. And he questioned the economic benefits of being in the EU single market and customs union, which the government plans to leave. Analysis: What was the aim of Johnson's speech European Union growth rate at 10-year high Kamal Ahmed: EU joins global growth bandwagon It was the first in a series of speeches by Theresa May and her ministers designed to map out ""road to Brexit"". Mr Johnson was one of the leading figures in the 2016 Leave campaign, and has previously been accused of undermining Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy. But he stuck to the government's official negotiating position during his speech in central London. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: I have to try - people's feelings matter In seeking to build bridges with the other side of the EU debate, Mr Johnson said he risked ""simply causing further irritation"" and accepted he would not ""persuade everybody"" but added: ""I have to try. In the end these are people's feelings and people's feelings matter."" ""We must accept that many [Remainers] are actuated by entirely noble sentiments, a real sense of solidarity with our European neighbours and a desire for the UK to succeed,"" he said. ""If we are to carry this project through to national success - as we must - then we must also reach out to those who still have anxieties. ""I want to try to anatomise at least some of those fears and to show... that Brexit is not grounds for fear but hope."" According to Mr Johnson, Brexit is ""not some great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover"", but ""the expression of legitimate and natural desire to self govern of the people"". ""That is surely not some reactionary Farageist concept,"" he added in a reference to former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who hit back on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Alongside his calls to Brexit supporters not to ""gloat"" and ""sit back in silent satisfaction"", Mr Johnson said holding another referendum on the UK's membership of the EU - as some campaigners are calling for - would be a ""disastrous mistake that would lead to permanent and ineradicable feelings of betrayal"". He frequently used variants of the 2016 referendum's ""take back control"" argument - on things like regulations and tariffs so businesses did not have laws affecting them ""imposed from abroad"" when they have no power to elect or remove the people making them. It would be ""intolerable and undemocratic"" if the UK was subject to EU laws after Brexit, he said. Mr Johnson said the benefits of being in the single market and customs union were ""nothing like as conspicuous or irrefutable"" as claimed by their supporters, saying other countries were able to trade with the EU without paying membership fees. However, during a transition period immediately after the UK leaves in March 2019 things would ""remain as they are"", he said. Laura Kuenssberg: The UK trade options Brexit: All you need to know Ex-Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney joined a protest outside Mr Johnson's speech Pro-EU campaigners hit back at his overtures to Remain voters - with Labour MP Chuka Umunna describing the speech as an ""exercise in hypocrisy"". Mr Umunna, of the anti ""hard Brexit"" Open Britain campaign, said: ""We are already a great country, we are already internationalist and we are already global."" Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said the speech revealed the government's intention to ""casually cast aside"" rights and protections and ignore the benefits of the EU single market. ""Nobody will be fooled or reassured by the foreign secretary's empty rhetoric,"" he said. Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston accused Mr Johnson of an ""optimism bias"" about the benefits of Brexit. The SNP's Brexit spokesman Stephen Gethins said he was not reassured by Mr Johnson's speech and said the government ""still can't really tell us what leaving the EU will mean"". And Liberal Democrat Tom Brake said the speech was mainly about ""Boris' ambitions to become the next prime minister"". Conservative MP Nigel Evans said the foreign secretary had reflected the views of many people, irrespective of how they voted in 2016, that the UK now needed to get on with the process of leaving. ""It's also about the opportunities that are now going to exist for the United Kingdom,"" he told the BBC. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said the speech may have come as a surprise to those who, in his opinion, mistakenly believed the government was set ""to reinvent a customs union, forego an independent trade policy and accept the need to follow all new EU laws"".

For many Remainers, Boris Johnson is the bogeyman of Brexit, heartily loathed for his approach and some of his claims during the referendum campaign. This video can not be played Damon Albarn, dogs and David Davisâ¦ another classic Brexitcast episode! He set himself an ambitious aim of trying to reassure Remainers - but at times it sounded as if we were back in the campaign, which served to highlight just how divisive that debate was. I was left with the thought that perhaps the person most relieved would be Theresa May, as he repeatedly and doggedly stuck to the principles set out in her Lancaster House speech. This video can not be played Juncker: Superstate claims 'total nonsense' Asked about Mr Johnson's speech, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hit back at suggestions from some critics he is seeking to create an EU ""superstate"". Mr Juncker replied: ""Some in the British political society are against the truth, pretending that I am a stupid, stubborn federalist, that I am in favour of a European superstate. ""I am strictly against a European superstate. We are not the United States of America, we are the European Union, which is a rich body because we have these 27, or 28, nations.

Consumer products 'affecting air quality',"US research has found that chemicals in everyday household products are now a key contributor to city air pollution, rivalling some vehicle emissions. The study, led from Colorado University, focussed on so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These are contained in petroleum-based products such as cleaning fluids and paints, and when they get into the air can form particles that affect health. The scientists say the sources of non-vehicle VOCs have been underestimated. This appears a somewhat surprising result because by weight, we use far more fuel than we do these other chemical products. About 95% of raw oil goes into the production of fuels, whereas roughly only 5% is refined for use in chemicals that are included in the likes of deodorants, pesticides, and adhesives. But Dr Jessica Gilman said it should not be seen as that remarkable because vehicle fuels are burned (to yield mostly carbon dioxide and water), whereas many of the household products are simply wafted into the air by design. ""Most commonly, they're used as solvents - things like nail polish remover, the hairspray I used this morning; they are used in many cases as cleaning agents like carpet cleaners,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist told reporters. ""It would be difficult to remove them because the alternative is to use straight water, which as you know doesn't work for all stains."" One of Dr Gilman's colleagues, Dr Brian McDonald, did however suggest that reduced use would be helpful. ""Use as little of the product as you can to get the job done,"" he said. Cleaning products 'affect lung health' 'Sooty birds' reveal pollution history Your practical solutions to air pollution The air we breathe contains such a diverse mix of compounds it's impossible for researchers to be sure what chemical is causing what problem. And there's an even trickier issue - setting pollution limits that are appropriate for everyone. Air fresheners are loved by some people - but they make others choke. Cleaning sprays are useful - but they make some people's eyes run. I know someone whose childhood asthma is thought to have been provoked by chemical emissions from flat-packed furniture in his bedroom. This is a neglected field of research as public and media attention has focused on cars outdoors at the expense of chemicals indoors. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin,external The researchers pulled together a wide range of information for their study. They looked again at what manufacturers put in their products; they reviewed the statistics held by regulatory agencies; they flew atmospheric sampling missions above Los Angeles to examine the air chemistry; and they also evaluated indoor and outdoor air quality measurements collected by other researchers. The team concluded that in the US, the amount of VOCs emitted by consumer and industrial products is very probably two or three times greater than estimated by current air pollution inventories.  (There are also natural sources of VOCs in the environment.) They add that these inventories likely also overestimate the motor vehicle sources. The researchers cite as an example the current estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA considers that about 75% of petroleum-based VOC emissions come from vehicle fuels, and roughly 25% from chemical products. The Colorado reassessment puts the split closer to 50-50. ""The use of these products emits VOCs in a magnitude that's comparable to what comes out of the tailpipe of your car. One of the main reasons for this is that in the US, as well as in Europe, air quality regulations have been really successful at controlling emissions from motor vehicles,"" said Dr McDonald, who is affiliated to the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Colorado and is the lead author on the study. ""In some ways, this is a good news story that, as we control some of the bigger sources in the past, the other sources are emerging in relative importance, such as these consumer products."" Experts say the results of this research are broadly applicable to other industrialised nations, including those in Europe. Los Angeles: For these particular types of compound, motor vehicles are not the only culprit Anthony Frew, a professor of respiratory medicine at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the UK, commented: ""This research is a useful reminder that discussions of air pollution need to consider all sources of pollutants and that measures targeting cars only address part of the problem. ""Engineering changes to car exhausts have dramatically reduced the amount of pollution produced per mile, meaning that (a) there is now less to be gained from further changes to cars and (b) the public need more information on how their activities, apart from driving, contribute to current pollution levels."" Vehicles emit pollutants beyond just VOCs, of course. These include nitrogen oxides (NOx). Indeed, it is the reaction between the NOx and the VOCs that produces some of the particles of most health concern. The Colorado study ispublished in Science Magazine,external. It was also presented on Thursday to theannual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,externalin Austin, Texas.

Mid-earners 'locked out of buying a home',"The extent to which young people are locked out of the British housing market has been revealed in new figures from economists. The biggest decline in home ownership in the last 20 years has been among middle-income 25 to 34-year-olds, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. In 1995-96, 65% of this group owned a home, but just 27% do in 2015-16, with the biggest drop in south-east England. Your biggest financial decision - in charts First-time buyers 'at 11-year-high' Middle earners are defined as having take-home pay of Â£22,200 to Â£30,600. This can be either as an individual or as a couple. A third of them are university graduates, while 30% left school at 16. Three-quarters of them live with a partner, and around 60% have children. The proportion of these middle earners owning a home (27%) has moved closer to the likelihood of those with a low income (8%) than those on a high income (64%). This video can not be played Tom Bourlet says buying a home ""seems beyond reach"" Tom Bourlet pays Â£535 per month to rent a room in a flat in central Brighton. ""I've been renting it for two-and-a-half years. It really is money down the drain,"" the 30-year-old says. ""I don't really see much for it - it's not the biggest room."" The location is handy for work, and is close to the railway station, but Mr Bourlet would prefer to have somewhere ""to be proud of, and build up myself"", he adds. However, buying somewhere is ""completely beyond budget at the moment"". ""It's absolute Mission Impossible,"" he says. ""From rent, to paying for trains... all the utility bills keep shooting up. I mean, I'm nowhere near, I'm not even slightly close. I'm saving every month, but the deposit is so high that it just seems beyond reach at the moment."" Andrew Hood, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: ""Home ownership among young adults has collapsed over the past 20 years, particularly for those on middle incomes. ""The reason for this is that house prices have risen around seven times faster in real terms than the incomes of young adults over the last two decades."" Property price rises were significant in the South East of England. As a result, the region has seen the proportion of homeowners among 25 to 34-year-olds fall from 64% to 32% in two decades. This video can not be played Want to buy a house? Under 25? Watch this Every region of Britain had seen a 10 percentage point drop over the same period, the IFS said. This will lead to some tough decisions for today's 20 to 30-somethings, according to Iona Bain, founder of the Young Money blog. ""It is really hard to see how we can make this better when we are still seeing a huge demand for housing and that housing demand is not being met with the right number of houses,"" she said. ""Individuals are having to decide for themselves: do I want to rent and have the flexibility but pay more for it, or do I want make a lot of difficult decisions to get on the property ladder sooner and potentially stay put for many, many years to come?"" Housing minister Dominic Raab said that schemes such as Help to Buy and the removal of stamp duty for most first-time buyers had helped people to buy their first home. He also said that Â£45m would be invested into community projects that would help kick-start the building of thousands of new homes. John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said: ""This research should be a wake-up call for Conservative ministers. After almost eight years of failure on housing, the government is still failing to tackle the fundamental problems with our broken housing market."" He said a Labour government would build 100,000 first-buy homes. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

Figure skaterâs tumble prompts fan sympathy,"US figure skater Nathan Chen was tipped to win figure skating gold at Pyeongchang. He'd just won the US national figure skating championship for the second year in a row in January 2018 and he'd dazzled both fans and judges with his complex quadruple jumps. He did everything he needed to to prepare for his first Winter Olympics and some journalists were claiming he was ""on the verge of becoming the best figure skater alive.,external"" It seemed there was never any doubt he would win gold. And then... During his performance on Friday in the men's short programme, he fell, on all of his jumps. The icy tumbles left him in 17th place and could spell the end of his medal dreams. So where did it all go wrong? Speaking to the media after his display, Chen said: ""Honestly, it was bad. I made as many mistakes as I possibly could have. ""I thought I did everything right going into this, things just didn't click together."" Was the 18-year-old American burdened by extra pressure during his performance? Could that have been the reason for all the errors? Some of his fans seem to think so as they rallied to his defence. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Romney launches comeback with dig at Trump,"Mitt Romney lost his race to oust President Barack Obama in 2012 Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has announced he is running for a US Senate seat in Utah, while taking a dig at President Donald Trump. In a Facebook campaign video, he lamented that Washington was sending ""a message of exclusion"" to immigrants. A vocal critic of Mr Trump, Mr Romney is seen as a shoo-in for outgoing Republican Senator Orrin Hatch's seat.

Touting his management of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, Mr Romney said his adopted home state was a model for Washington DC. ""Utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world,"" he said in a Facebook campaign video. ""Washington sends them a message of exclusion."" Since his failed White House campaign, Mr Romney has served as a chairman of his son's investment firm and on the board of directors of Marriott International. While he was in the running to be secretary of state, Mr Romney dined with Mr Trump at a Manhattan restaurant But he has assiduously maintained his links to the Republican party. In 2016 he positioned himself as the voice of mainstream conservatism with stinging attacks on Mr Trump. ""His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University,"" said Mr Romney. Mr Trump hit back, calling Mr Romney a ""failed candidate"" who ""choked like a dog"" in the 2012 race. This video can not be played Mitt Romney on Donald Trump: ''His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University'' However, once Mr Trump captured the White House, Mr Romney dined with him in November 2016 at a Manhattan restaurant while he was in the running to be the president-elect's secretary of state. Mr Romney did not get the job. Perhaps mindful of a Romney resurgence, the president recently urged Mr Hatch, seen as a Trump loyalist, to run again for another six-year term. In December, Mr Trump travelled to Utah where he called Mr Hatch ""a true fighter"" and said he hoped he would continue to serve ""in the Senate for a very long time to come"". Senator Hatch is the longest-serving Republican senator in US history But the veteran senator announced last month he would step down at the end of the year. ""Every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves,"" said Mr Hatch. The longest-serving Senate Republican with seven terms under his belt, he was first elected in 1976. Mr Romney's campaign announcement was enthusiastically welcomed by his former running mate, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan was chosen as Mitt Romney's running mate in the 2012 presidential election against incumbent Barack Obama ""This is a terrific day for the United States Senate,"" said the most powerful Republican congressman in a statement. ""Our party and our country are always better off when Mitt is engaged, and I know that he will put his unparalleled experience, conservative leadership, and lifetime of service to work for Utah in the US Senate.""

May holding talks with Merkel in Berlin,"Angela Merkel has said she is ""not frustrated"" by the Brexit process but is ""curious"" to know more about the UK's aims after meeting Theresa May. The German chancellor said she hoped to establish ""common ground"" on future trade goals in the coming months and wanted a ""close partnership"" of equals. Mrs May said she wanted a ""bold and ambitious"" trade partnership as well as a new security arrangement with the EU. But amid calls for more UK detail, she said it was not a ""one-way street"". Friday's meeting between the two leaders at Berlin's Chancellery comes ahead of a speech on Saturday in which Mrs May will set out the ""security partnership"" she envisages with European partners at the annual Munich Security Conference. European spy chiefs in Brexit joint plea Johnson: Let's unite around Brexit vision Juncker angry at 'superstate' claims British ministers are making a series of speeches mapping out the ""road to Brexit"" to counter criticism of a lack of clarity and contradictions in their vision of the UK's future relationship with the EU once it leaves in March 2019. Asked whether she was frustrated by the UK's position, Mrs Merkel said: ""I'm not frustrated at all.

A masterpiece of wry understatement. Before the prime minister's trip to Berlin, the German government said it hoped the UK would produce ""concrete"" plans for Brexit soon. But if Theresa May did flesh out her thinking in talks with Angela Merkel, neither leader was letting on. Their post-meeting remarks were courteous and warm but heavy on platitudes and light on detail. Mrs Merkel said there could be a close economic partnership between the UK and the EU that did not amount to ""cherry picking"" all the benefits of single market membership without the costs. This will have encouraged Theresa May who said EU firms would benefit too. But for negotiations to move on, Theresa May's divided cabinet needs to hammer out a collective position on what it's asking for after the transition period expires. Angela Merkel isn't the only politician curious to discover the answers. Mrs May said she was seeking a ""future economic partnership"" that suited both sides, and for British and German companies to have the maximum possible freedom to operate in each other's markets. The UK prime minister's trip to Berlin comes as the UK and the EU attempt to agree details of the temporary ""transition"" period that will come immediately after Brexit day and is intended to smooth the path to the permanent post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU.

Citizens from the three countries - all members of the European Economic Area - living in the UK for the past five years will be able to apply for settled status on the same basis as nationals from the other 27 EU member states. This would grant them permanent residency and largely the same access as now to healthcare, pensions and other benefits.

'More' prisoners to be freed with tags,"More offenders could be freed from prison in England and Wales with an electronic tag under government plans to simplify an early-release scheme. The Ministry of Justice says only a fifth eligible for ""home detention curfew"" are currently being released. The move may reduce pressure on prison numbers - but the type of offenders the scheme covers is not being changed. It applies to terms of between three months and four years and excludes sex, weapon and certain other offences. Foreign national prisoners and people convicted of violent offences, terrorism, or those who have previously breached a curfew are also excluded. Don't ignore prison inspectors, jails warned Why are community sentences falling out of favour? Prisoners 'lack support after release' The scheme - introduced by Labour in 1999 - sees prisoners freed between two weeks and four-and-a-half months before their automatic release date. They are made to wear a tag and abide by a curfew. Figures released this week show the total population of prisons and immigration removal centres remains high at 84,255, under an overall capacity of 86,771. There are currently 2,770 people subject to home detention curfew (HDC). The Ministry of Justice says simplifying the administration of the system will reduce delays, and increase the numbers released. In an instruction to prison governors the MoJ said only 21% of offenders eligible for the scheme are being released. The MoJ said it wanted the curfews to be ""a normal part of release"". It also wants governors to review cases where home detention curfew has been refused, often because the address inmates plan to move to is deemed unsuitable. The MoJ said: ""We are not expanding the scheme to allow the release of any prisoner who was not already eligible and could be released on HDC. ""We are simplifying the HDC process, reducing the number of forms used in the assessment process and maintaining the strict eligibility and suitability tests. ""This will mean governors can make well-informed, more timely decisions and ensure robust risk management plans are in place for offenders released under the scheme.""

"Teen admits Florida shooting, police say","This video can not be played Fred Guttenberg said he couldn't remember if he had told his daughter Jaime that he loved her The teenager accused of killing 17 people at a Florida high school on Wednesday has confessed to the shooting, police say. Nikolas Cruz, 19, said he arrived on campus and began shooting students before abandoning his weapon and escaping, according to a court document. He has appeared in court charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. The FBI has admitted it received a tip-off about him last year.

He said he was carrying extra ammunition in a black duffel bag and backpack, it said. Mr Cruz then discarded his weapon in an attempt to blend in and escape, the documents showed. He was reportedly able to flee the scene undetected before entering a Walmart and then a McDonald's, and was eventually spotted by police and arrested one hour after the attack. Mr Cruz had been expelled from the school he has confessed to attacking and some students said they had joked ""he's the one to shoot up the school"".

Two separate Instagram accounts, now deleted, purport to show Mr Cruz posing with guns and knives.

"Should everybody get Â£10,000?","What would you do with Â£10,000? The government should give Â£10,000 to every citizen under 55, a report suggests. The Royal Society for the encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) said,externalit could pave the way to everyone getting a basic state wage. The idea sees two payments of Â£5,000 paid over two years, but certain state benefits and tax reliefs would be removed at the same time. The RSA said it would compensate workers for the way jobs are changing. The money would help to steer UK citizens through the 2020s, ""as automation replaces many jobs, climate change hits and more people face balancing employment with social care"", the report said. Payments would come from a British sovereign wealth fund in the form of two annual Â£5,000 dividends, the RSA proposes. The payments would not be means tested, and applicants would only have to demonstrate how they intended to use the money. Anthony Painter, director of the RSA's Action and Research Centre, said: ""The simple fact is that too many households are highly vulnerable to a shock in a decade of disruption, with storm clouds on the horizon if automation, Brexit and an ageing population are mismanaged. ""Without a real change in our thinking, neither tweaks to the welfare state nor getting people into work alone, when the link between hard work and fair pay has broken, will help working people meet the challenges ahead."" A Government spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to have a welfare system that supports those who work and cares for those who can't, while being fair to the taxpayer. ""Providing a universal basic income would not allow for the same targeted support that is tailored to meet individual needs."" But the RSA The report says the fund could help people: ""A low-skilled worker might reduce their working hours to attain skills enabling career progression. This video can not be played A pilot scheme in Finland is giving 2,000 unemployed people an income, instead of benefits ""The fund could provide the impetus to turn an entrepreneurial idea into a reality. It could be the support that enables a carer to be there for a loved one."" The fund would be built from public debt, levies on untaxed corporate assets and investments in long term infrastructure projects, and be similar to Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund. As the dividends would replace payments such as Child Benefit, Tax Credits and Jobseeker's Allowance, the savings for the government could also be ploughed into the fund. Anyone receiving the ""dividends"" would not be able to claim any tax allowances, which the RSA says would act as a disincentive to wealthier earners wanting to apply for the handout. In all, the RSA puts the cost of the scheme at Â£14.5bn a year if it is fully subscribed to, and a total of Â£462bn over 13 years, more than half of which would be paid for by government savings. The Labour Party has said it is looking into similar arguments for a Universal Basic Income (UBI). Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said: ""This new report from the RSA raises the right questions about the future of work and the long-term challenges we face, including making sure automation and the changing nature of work deliver a fairer, more prosperous society."" Scotland is considering piloting UBI schemes in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Fife and North Ayrshire. The RSA report suggests that options for funding a full UBI included a tax on wealth, levies on companies' assets, and a tax on tech firms - such as Amazon, Facebook and Apple - using or transferring people's data. The history of UBI can be dated back to Thomas Paine's essay, Agrarian Justice, where he proposes the idea as part of a social security system. More recently the idea has been put into practice in limited ways. For instance, in Alaska all residents have been entitled since 1982 to a yearly cash dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund. Finland is half way through a two year nationwide pilot scheme, giving 2,000 unemployed Finns a monthly income of â¬560 (Â£497) which continues even if they find work. Scotland has provided funding for four local authorities to look into the idea. In the US one Democrat presidential nominee hopeful, Andrew Yang is proposing his version of UBI, a $1,000 a month ""Freedom Dividend"". Even so, some economists believe full UBI can't work. Brexit campaigner Patrick Minford from Cardiff University's Business School said UBI is ""not a workable scheme because it's far too expensive"". ""It creates a tremendous tax, a disincentive for the average person further up the income scale who's paying for it all."" There are questions over how much of a social security system UBI would replace. Would citizens still be able to claim disability allowance or help with housing? The RSA believes that properly done UBI would help people get into work, give them an opportunity to rethink their lives and contribute to better health and wellbeing. Others claim it would be a disincentive. However,a report by the National Bureau of Economic Research,externalinto the Alaska Permanent Fund concluded that ""it does not significantly decrease aggregate employment"". A report by the OECD,externalinto UBI said that its effect would be hugely different depending on the circumstances of each individual and the existing tax and benefits systems. UBI could also be ruinously expensive for governments and provide limited benefit for the poor, it said. According to the OECD report, if the UK were to fund UBI only with money saved by abolishing the existing benefits system it would lead to higher levels of poverty. It adds: ""However, even in the case where taxes are raised significantly to pay for [UBI] it does not significantly reduce poverty.""

"1,000-year-old oak on Offa's Dyke falls","The Buttington Oak had stood in a field outside Welshpool for 1,000 years One of the oldest trees in Wales which was probably planted 1,000 years ago as a boundary marker along Offa's Dyke has fallen down. The Buttington Oak was spotted collapsed in its field two miles from Welshpool in Powys by a man nicknamed the ""tree hunter"". Rob McBride said he was sad to see such a significant tree grounded. The tree's girth measured 11m, which made it about 1,000 years old, he added. Rob McBride with the fallen tree Mr McBride, who records ancient trees in Wales, said the oak had enormous cultural significance as it was a pollard - it had not grown in the field naturally.

Oxfam chief promises justice for victims,"This video can not be played Oxfam head: 'I know we have a problem' Oxfam says it will set up a commission to investigate past and present allegations of exploitation by staff. Oxfam International's executive director Winnie Byanyima said it would ""do justice"" and ""atone for the past"". She invited victims to come forward ""for justice to be done"" for them, saying she was ""here for all the women who have been abused"". The British charity has facedcriticism over the way it handled claims staff hired prostitutes in Haiti in 2011. Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Antonio Gutteres told the BBC there must be ""zero tolerance"" of sexual misconduct within the aid community. Oxfam rehired man fired over sex claims Catholic charity sacks former Oxfam worker How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam? Ms Byanyima, the most senior Oxfam executive to speak on the issue, said she first heard of the controversy after news reports last week. She said the organisation was ""hurt"", but added: ""There is no way this organisation can die... the world needs it."" In an interview with the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale, she switched to speaking in the Ugandan language of Runyankore to make an apology: ""From the bottom of my heart forgive us, forgive Oxfam."" She admitted she could not guarantee there were not sex offenders currently working at the organisation but vowed Oxfam would ""build a new culture that doesn't tolerate that behaviour"". She said the reforms at Oxfam would include: setting up a high-level independent commission that will look into culture and practices at the organisation, with a mandate to investigate past and current claims of sexual exploitation more than tripling the budget for the charity's safeguarding team, and doubling the number of staff working in the department setting up a global database of accredited referees to ensure sex offenders cannot falsify references and reoffend at other charities making the organisation's ""whistleblowing mechanism"" external, safe and confidential Mr Gutteres said Oxfam were ""very reliable partners"" during his time as UN high commissioner for refugees and he hoped the charity would ""overcome this difficulty and to do everything necessary to re-establish... normal operations"". He added: ""In relation to sexual harassment and sexual exploitation... These are widespread problems that all organisations - international organisations, national organisations, the private sector - have and they need to fight it very strongly."" Earlier this month, news reports said that during a humanitarian mission in Haiti in 2011, the charity's country directorRoland van Hauwermeiren hired prostitutes at a villa paid for by Oxfam. Roland Van Hauwermeiren worked in Chad from 2006-09 before going to Haiti in 2010 Mr Van Hauwermeiren, who left Oxfam in 2011 amid a sexual misconduct inquiry,has denied hiring prostitutes but said he had ""intimate relations""with a woman who was ""not a prostitute"". Oxfam had staff working in Haiti following the earthquake in the country which killed about 200,000 people in 2010. As a result of the revelation, the charity has faced severe criticism from the British government andthe Haitian president.

International Development SecretaryPenny Mordaunt has threatened to cut the charity's government funding, which was Â£32m last year. The charity has also lost a number of celebrity ambassadors includingGood Will Hunting actress Minnie Driver, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Ms Byanyima said she was sad to lose ambassadors she ""respects so much"", but added: ""What hurts me most is out there in Haiti, there are poor women who have been abused and have not received justice."" Meanwhile, Oxfam's chief executiveMark Goldring has used an interview in the Guardian,externalto repeat his apology for the charity's failings, while maintaining that ""the scale and the intensity of the attacks feels out of proportion to the level of culpability"".

Archbishop Tutu is ""deeply disappointed"" over alleged misconduct at Oxfam On Thursday a new allegation came to light that a worker fired by Oxfam over sexual misconduct allegations inHaiti was rehired later the same year by the charity.

I was abused by my football coach," Gary Cliffe was 11 in 1981. He was living south of Manchester and dreaming of FA Cup glory. Manchester City had reached the cup final at Wembley that season, only losing to Spurs after a replay and one of the FA Cup's iconic moments: Argentine midfielder Ricky Villa dribbling his way brilliantly through the City defence and turning the ball past the goalkeeper. Cliffe, though, like his father, was always much more of a United fan. His parents encouraged him to play at an early age. They weren’t pushy, just very supportive. Most weekends were spent jumping into the back of his dad’s battered Chrysler Sunbeam to be dropped off at muddy changing rooms from Nantwich to Crewe. Gary Cliffe Every 11-year-old kid at school wanted to play for City or United. Just a lucky few would ever come close. “Obviously I wanted to make it as a footballer, who wouldn’t?” he told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme. “That was my dream and I almost got there.” Like others, many others, Cliffe’s life was changed forever by a coach he once respected and his parents once trusted. “He was the star-maker, the guy who was going to take me to become a professional footballer,” he says. My childhood was ruined by this man. He's ruined hundreds of lives. I know because I was there.” Gary Cliffe talked to Victoria Derbyshire: This was the era just before the Premier League. Before live football on TV. Before youth development programmes and academies. Professional clubs still recruited young players from local feeder teams linked to adult sides but run at arm’s length by amateur coaches. In this world of dreams and promises one name really stood out. Barry Bennell had a strong reputation. He was a talented coach with a new way of doing things. He was lively, charismatic and good looking. He had a back story to impress as well. Bennell had played briefly for Chelsea’s reserve side before brittle bones, supposedly, forced him to quit. Now he was back where he grew up, running his own chain of video and sports shops in the North West and training youngsters in his spare time. Gary Cliffe By the autumn of 1981, he had just taken over the running of Cliffe’s under 12s side, Pegasus FC, one of a number of clubs he managed linked to Manchester City. Straight away the new coach said he wanted to get to know his young players properly. In pairs they were invited over to his house on the edge of the Peak District for the weekend. Kitted out with the latest gadgets it was what one young player described as an Aladdin’s cave for kids. There were arcade machines, pool tables and an endless supply of free football kit. Bennell had dogs, a wildcat, even a pet monkey. He would turn off the lights and let 10 and 11-year-old children watch adult-rated horror films borrowed from his own video store downstairs. The heating would be turned down so some boys would get closer to him as a precursor to more serious abuse. For Cliffe, there was no build up. No serious attempt to groom him first. It started almost immediately. The touching quickly moved on to forced oral sex and attempted rape. Mostly it took place when he was alone in Bennell’s house or in his car. But there were times, many times, when other children were abused while they were in the same room as each other. “There’d be me on one side, Bennell would be in the middle and the other boy on the other side,” says Gary. “I would know I was being abused, and it’d be naive of anyone to think that the other boy wasn’t. I know they were. I was there. But I couldn’t say anything.” From the age of 11 to 15, it happened to Cliffe over and over again. At weekends, at Christmas time, every school holiday. Hundreds of times. I knew it was wrong but I just didn’t have the stomach or the vocabulary to put my hands up and stop it.” Gary Cliffe “It was happening with other boys around. They weren’t saying anything. I didn’t say anything. No parents were saying anything. No officials at the club were saying anything. “I just didn’t have the words. I was dreaming of being a footballer and the bubble would have burst.” With his confidence and swagger Bennell could also win over parents. Some mothers worked for him from time-to-time in his chain of video shops. Another family invited him around for Christmas dinner because they thought he looked lonely. In Gary’s words Bennell held adults in “the palm of his hand”. They were “in awe of him, taken in by him”. As for young children, his favoured boys would be promised a bright future in the game. If a player resisted or, worse, struck back, they would be humiliated, shunned and dropped from the team. A captain of one of Bennell’s sides told how, after forcing the coach away one night, he was sidelined and stripped of the captaincy. A rumour quickly went round that he was stealing money from his teammates. He never played for the club again. On the pitch there was no doubt Bennell was a gifted football coach, one of the most promising in the North West. His name quickly became linked to one team: Manchester City. He was never a full member of staff at the club but it’s thought he was paid expenses and given his own pass to its Platt Lane training ground. His teams all played in Manchester City strips. “In other words,” claims Cliffe, “He had the run of the place.” “He was producing the teams who won everything. We were the envy of most boys. We’d come back with a trophy most times,” he says. Bennell would go on to coach a generation of City stars from David White to Andy Hinchcliffe, as well as former Leeds United midfielder Gary Speed. White has confirmed he was abused. There is no suggestion Hinchcliffe and Speed were victims. Gary Speed His young teams were winners. The most talented players signed schoolboy forms, the first step towards a career in the professional game. But for those looking closely enough, the warning signs were already there. There were fights with other managers in the youth leagues. Bennell was attacked with a metal peg used to tie down goal nets, leaving him with a deep cut below his eye socket. The parents of one boy complained to Manchester City after their son was kept up late in a hotel room on an away trip. Other members of the playing staff were becoming more suspicious about his behaviour. Former goalkeeper and youth team manager Steve Fleet said he first heard rumours in the late 70s. Steve Fleet At one point Fleet says, he was under pressure from a club official to give Bennell a proper role, to make him an official part of the City line-up. I said it was either him or me. I wasn’t working with a person like that. I’d heard he was doing things with kids that weren’t normal.” On that occasion, he says, he won the argument. After Fleet left the club in 1980, it appears Bennell became more involved, though he never did make it onto the full coaching staff there. His victims from that time, and to date seven have come forward publicly, are convinced more could and should have been done. “They let us down, they didn’t challenge him,” says Cliffe. “They knew what he was and they allowed it to continue because he was producing results.” Other young players abused around that time speak of the same culture of wilful ignorance and neglect. Interviewed by Channel 4 back in 1997, Manchester City officials said they didn’t receive a single formal complaint about Bennell’s behaviour. There was “no evidence whatsoever from that side of the fence”, claimed former chief scout, the late Ken Barnes. Manchester City is now in the middle of its own internal review led by the QC Jane Mulcahy. It will examine if more should have been done to protect young players in the past and look at the club’s current child protection policies. In a statement, the club said: “Manchester City offers its heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured.” “All victims were entitled to expect full protection.” On 30 November 1984 in a short ceremony at Platt Lane, Cliffe finally signed associated schoolboy forms with Manchester City. It was an important milestone. Only the most talented youngsters made it so far. Bennell was alongside him in that room at that moment. There was once a photograph to prove it. His mother found it years later and cut the coach out of the frame. By then aged 14, Cliffe started training with the youth side and was stopped from playing for any other team. But even though he was moving on he could not escape Bennell’s influence and the stigma that went with it. He says he was bullied for his close association with the coach, who was, according to other staff members, by then the subject of raised eyebrows and knowing looks at the club. Cliffe says another coach, again not directly employed by Manchester City, would often laugh about it, calling him Bennell’s “bum boy” in front of his teenage teammates. He says that finished him off. “He used those words and the other boys didn’t say anything but they knew,” says Cliffe. “Not only had I had it physically off Bennell but now this other coach who was supposed to take me through to 16 - the crucial time when you get signed on. “He had the audacity to say those words and take the Mick. It was horrific.” Aged 16, Cliffe quit the game. He eventually became a detective with Cheshire Police. Gary Cliffe As for Barry Bennell, his time with Manchester City ended abruptly in 1984. No-one is quite sure why but it’s thought he was, once again, turned down for a full-time coaching position. With his options limited, his attention simply switched from one club in North West England to another. Just an hour’s drive south of Manchester is the old railway town of Crewe. In the world of football the two places could not be much further apart. In 1984 Crewe Alexandra were struggling in the old fourth division, the lowest tier in the football league. The club had just appointed a promising young manager, Dario Gradi, who knew Barry Bennell from his time as a coach at Chelsea. His old contact was brought in to help modernise the youth set up. Over the next decade Crewe consistently produced young players who would later be sold on for good money to top flight clubs. Its academy became one of the most respected in the game. England internationals Rob Jones, Danny Murphy and Seth Johnson all came through there. David Platt joined as a 19-year-old and left three years later to become one of the country’s brightest stars. Its youth system was so successful it was soon known by a different name: The Football Factory. After years of trying, Barry Bennell was finally on a professional club’s payroll, officially responsible for development and scouting. One of the first players he spotted was a promising 11-year-old playing for Stockport Boys. His name was Andy Woodward. Andy Woodward The pattern of abuse was horribly familiar. “Within about three or four weeks he asked my parents if I could go and stay at his address. It started there,” Woodward says. Initially it was sexual touching but then it got worse. He raped me. I don’t want to put a number on how many times, but it was over a four-year period.” Like other victims, Woodward, an outgoing young boy, quickly became introverted and withdrawn. Bennell appeared to target the quieter, more thoughtful players, threatening to rip up their dreams if they ever stepped out of line or spoke up. “It was that control,” says Woodward. “All I wanted to do was be a footballer. But he threatened to take that away from me.” “I was crying out for somebody at the club, at Crewe, to say it’s wrong. But that didn’t happen.” Andy Woodward Woodward was far from the only victim linked to Crewe Alexandra. To date another five players have come forward, in public, to say they were abused in the same way. Bennell’s crimes took place not just at his house in Cheshire. A court later heard it also happened on one of Crewe’s training pitches and at the home of manager Gradi, himself, though he knew nothing about it. Again with Crewe’s football factory churning out so much talent, it appears few wanted to ask too many questions about Bennell’s treatment of the children in his care. At one point Bennell became so important to the club’s success, that one source says Gradi asked to split his share of sell-on fees with his youth coach. Gradi, by then a club director, had struck a deal with the board to receive 10 percent of any payment if one of the team’s young players was sold to another side. He asked the board for this to be cut to seven percent, with the other three percent passed directly to Bennell, according to the club’s former managing director.

At one point Bennell became so important to the club’s success, that one source says Gradi asked to split his share of sell-on fees with his youth coach. Gradi, by then a club director, had struck a deal with the board to receive 10 per cent of any payment if one of the team’s young players was sold to another side. He asked the board for this to be cut to seven per cent, with the other three per cent passed directly to Bennell, according to the club’s former managing director. Throughout the 1980s, there is no evidence that a single complaint was ever made to either the police or Crewe Alexandra itself. Again, though, there were plenty of rumours about Bennell’s behaviour. A senior member of the backroom staff at Crewe was said to have refused to allow their own children to be trained by the coach. There was talk that Sir Alex Ferguson personally asked security guards to escort Bennell off Manchester United’s training ground at Littleton Road. Sir Alex says he cannot recall the incident happening. The mother of a young Crewe player said she sent an anonymous letter to Gradi, when he was manager, to complain about boys sharing hotel beds with Bennell on away trips. No allegation of sexual abuse was made at the time and it’s not clear if the letter, which she remembers writing in 1989 or 1990, was ever opened by Gradi or Crewe. Perhaps the strongest warning, though, is said to have come from one of the most senior officials at the club, former managing director Hamilton Smith. Hamilton Smith After hearing rumours of inappropriate behaviour and a second-hand allegation of abuse from an anonymous parent, he says he changed the agenda of a board meeting to deal directly with concerns about the youth coach. “I thought no this is no good. I’ve had it right up to here. It’s got to stop,” he said. “I got back home and I rang the then vice-chairman John Bowler and told him what had happened,” said Smith. “I said, ‘This is hot. We’ve got to address it.’” During the board meeting, held at the house of then-chairman Norman Rowlinson, a senior police source was called who suggested Bennell should be moved on. By this time though Barry Bennell was a full-time employee at Crewe and there was no direct complaint from a parent. Instead Smith says the club directors present decided John Bowler, now Crewe Alexandra’s chairman, should raise only more general concerns with manager Dario Gradi about Barry Bennell letting children stay overnight in his house. Smith described Mr Gradi’s response as “very angry”. At a follow-up meeting the manager made it clear he did not have a problem with Bennell and the coach was allowed to continue working at Crewe Alexandra. “It makes me furious when [Crewe Alexandra FC] say they didn’t know something was going on,” says Hamilton Smith. “Everybody involved could and should have done a lot more.” Dario Gradi In a 1997 interview Dario Gradi said the club had no cause for any concern when Bennell was working at Crewe. He later said the first he or anyone else at the club knew of any crimes was when Bennell was finally arrested in 1994. Now Crewe’s director of football, Gradi has had his coaching licence suspended by the Football Association while it carries out a wider inquiry into abuse allegations and how they’ve been handled across football. In a statement following the guilty verdicts against Bennell, Crewe Alexandra FC expressed its deepest sympathies for his victims - and reiterated that it had not been aware of any sexual abuse by him, either before or during his time with the club. The club also stressed “it would have contacted the police immediately” if it had any suspicion that Bennell was committing acts of abuse, “either before, during or after he left the club’s employment”. Cheshire police say that during the course of their inquiry Crewe Alexandra, Manchester City and the FA were “nothing but cooperative”. They say they could find no evidence of a conspiracy to cover up allegations of abuse. Andy Woodward worked through the ranks at Crewe Alexandra, making his first-team debut in 1992 at the age of 19. Three years later he signed for Bury, playing 24 times in his first full season as the Lancashire club won the division two title. Then out of nowhere he was shopping at Tesco’s one Sunday night, when he broke down, almost collapsed and was taken to hospital. “I went through the door and all of a sudden this rush of adrenaline went through my body,” he says. “I wouldn’t wish that feeling on anyone. It was the scariest thing that had happened in my life.” He started to suffer from repeated panic attacks while playing, covering them up by claiming he was injured - inventing a twisted ankle or problem hamstring. Andy Woodward His career faded out, ending at the age of 29 after short spells with Sheffield United, Scunthorpe and Halifax. “In my head there were all sorts of things going on. I don’t know how I even played,” he says. “I can’t put into words what was done to me. But I think other people out there will understand. I think we survive and that’s it. We just survive.” As with Manchester City, the reasons why Bennell finally left Crewe Alexandra are unclear. People say he was sacked quietly in 1991 after a dispute over tactics. He was soon back coaching at a small local team in the Cheshire area, Stone Dominoes, where he took young boys overseas to training camps in Jacksonville, Florida. It was there in the summer of 1992 that his long history of abuse finally caught up with him. Bennell sexually assaulted a 13-year-old British boy in a hotel room. Only this time the child, who has never been named, told his parents partly because he said he was terrified of catching Aids. Bennell was arrested by police in the US and eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual battery of a child. He spent three years in an American prison. The US authorities suspected this wasn’t the first time he had abused young boys. Libby Senterfitt from the State Attorney’s office in Florida wrote a strong warning letter to Fifa’s head office in Switzerland and to the Football Association. Cheshire Police was alerted and started investigating possible crimes in the UK. With Bennell serving time in prison, the subject was tackled by the national media for the first time. In January 1997 investigative journalist Deborah Davis presented Soccer’s Foul Play, an hour-long documentary for Channel 4. It named Bennell and other alleged abusers in the game, giving a voice to victims for the first time and asking tough questions of club officials. But the Football Association reacted defensively and the response from the rest of the media was muted. One television critic dismissed the programme as alarmist, savaging it for “charging around, looking for somewhere to bang in its nails”. A year later, in 1998, Bennell was deported from the US and flown back to the UK. Barry Bennell He was arrested as he landed and later admitted 23 charges of sexual abuse against six British boys aged nine to 15, changing his plea to guilty just a day before trial. One of those boys was Andy Woodward. “When he was jailed I just felt safe he was in prison,” he says. “His sentence was nine years. Looking back now, nine years for just what happened to me was not enough.” “I can’t put into words what it has done to me. The impact it had on my life was just catastrophic.” After Bennell’s release he was convicted once again for historical offences against yet another schoolboy back in the late 1970s. At trial his own barrister described him as a monster. But all this news was covered only briefly in a handful of local press articles. There was no huge scandal, no major police investigation, certainly no FA inquiry or soul searching from the clubs involved. That took another decade. In November 2016 Woodward made the decision to speak publicly about the abuse and the impact on his life. He told his story to the Guardian newspaper and the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire Programme. His testimony, sitting first on his own, then alongside a group of other survivors on national television, started something unexpected as victim after victim came forward. At the last count police forces across the country had identified 294 alleged suspects in cases involving 839 possible victims linked to football. Steve Walters talked to Victoria Derbyshire: The chairman of the FA, Greg Clarke, has called it the biggest scandal facing the game. Gary Cliffe was at work that day, checking Twitter on his phone as Andy Woodward sat in a TV studio in London alongside Steve Walters, Jason Dunford and Chris Unsworth. All four footballers were victims of Bennell, though Jason Dunford had fought him off and wasn’t sexually abused. As the updates came in, Cliffe decided he couldn’t concentrate on work. He got in his car, pulled over and watched the interview back on his phone sitting at the side of the road. “They all spoke with such dignity,” he says. “Reassurance is the wrong word but you got the idea that others are there with you and you take comfort from that. That’s what I felt.” But Cliffe couldn’t add his voice publicly at the time. By coincidence months earlier he had already contacted the police about Bennell and wanted to press charges. Barry Bennell An investigation had started and he had been asked not to speak out in the media while detectives were working on the case. This wasn’t the first time Cliffe had been in contact with the authorities. He gave a police statement in 1995 when Bennell was eventually convicted on other charges. At the same time he told his parents what had happened. Back then though he didn’t feel strong enough to take the case to court, with the possibility he might have to give evidence in front of his abuser. Now, in his mid-40s, his feelings had changed. “You get to the stage where you get older and you think, do you know what, I don’t want to have any regrets,” he says. “So I picked up that phone and made that call.” Barry Bennell So did others. After Woodward spoke out more players came forward with their accounts of what happened decades ago. Bennell was charged with another 55 counts of sexual abuse - which took place between 1979 and 1991. On 15 February 2018, after a six-week long trial at Liverpool Crown Court, he was convicted once again. He was found guilty of 43 counts of child sex abuse against another 11 boys. “My childhood was wrecked. He’s damaged me, there’s no doubt about it. I’ve been on medication for many years now, probably will be for the rest of my life,” says Cliffe. Built with Shorthand"
Botched gun murder inquiry to be reviewed,"The killing of Kevin Nunes in 2002 remains unsolved after a string of police mistakes A botched investigation into the murder of Kevin Nunes, who was killed in 2002, is to be reviewed. Staffordshire Police has asked another force to review the case after ""serious flaws"" in its original investigation led to the murder convictions of five men being overturned. Mr Nunes' bullet-ridden body was found in Pattingham, Staffordshire. His former partner and her family, including his son, have welcomed the announcement. Midlands Live: Teen hid from Florida gunman in cupboard; bleed kits launched for stab victims ""Justice has not been received for Kevin Nunes's murder,"" Chief Constable Gareth Morgan from Staffordshire Police said. Staffordshire Police said it was ""finalising arrangements"" for the review with another police force, but it cannot yet say which one. Mr Nunes's body was found on a country lane in South Staffordshire in 2002 A catalogue of police mistakes after the semi-professional footballer's murderhas meant that 16 years later, nobody has been held responsible. Mr Nunes, from Wolverhampton, was 20 when he died in a gangland killing after he started dealing drugs. Despite police taking more than 1,000 statements, only one witness, Simeon Taylor, was willing to give evidence. Analysis: Phil Mackie, BBC News correspondent Kevin Nunes' partner Leanne Williams and her family still feel badly let down by Staffordshire Police. I investigated the catalogue of police mistakes forFile on 4and the family told me of their shock they'd gone unpunished. Initially they were pleased a successful prosecution was brought in 2008, but as details emerged of how the force had mishandled a key witness and failed to disclose details during the criminal trial, they lost faith. Gareth Morgan has kept the promise he made when he became chief constable last year, which was that the case would be reviewed and the family kept informed. They have welcomed today's announcement but remain cautious - saying they're worried what effect it will have on Kevin Nunes's son, who is now 15, if his father's killers aren't caught. Taylor was given gold-plated police protection, which he abused, continuing to commit crime and breaching a behaviour code of conduct 76 times. But he was never charged by police, amid fears it would harm his role as key witness. The force took Taylor on nights out drinking and even sent him on a taxpayer funded trip to South Africa, believed to have cost up to Â£10,000. The five men who were put at the scene of Nunes's murder by Taylor were jailed for life in 2008, but they were freed in 2012 when police's handling of Taylor came to light.

Fans leap to Nathan Chen's defence,"US figure skater Nathan Chen was tipped to win figure skating gold at Pyeongchang. He'd just won the US national figure skating championship for the second year in a row in January 2018 and he'd dazzled both fans and judges with his complex quadruple jumps. He did everything he needed to to prepare for his first Winter Olympics and some journalists were claiming he was ""on the verge of becoming the best figure skater alive.,external"" It seemed there was never any doubt he would win gold. And then... During his performance on Friday in the men's short programme, he fell, on all of his jumps. The icy tumbles left him in 17th place and could spell the end of his medal dreams. So where did it all go wrong? Speaking to the media after his display, Chen said: ""Honestly, it was bad. I made as many mistakes as I possibly could have. ""I thought I did everything right going into this, things just didn't click together."" Was the 18-year-old American burdened by extra pressure during his performance? Could that have been the reason for all the errors? Some of his fans seem to think so as they rallied to his defence. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

China's biggest show in 'racist blackface',"By some estimates, the show is the most watched entertainment programme on earth A skit on China's biggest Lunar New Year TV show has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of racism. In a comedy routine celebrating Chinese-African ties an Asian actress appears in blackface and with exaggerated buttocks. Using make-up to lampoon black people - a practice known as blackface - is seen by many as deeply offensive. The annual state media variety show is hugely popular, and has up to 800 million viewers. China 'racist' video on India sparks fury Lunar New Year pictures from across Asia Some observers have pointed out that this sketch would not have been intended as offensive to Africans. However, this is not the first time Chinese entertainment shows have caused controversy with their portrayals of other ethnicities. Allow Twitter content?

The controversial sketch was part of the four-hour CCTV New Year Gala - also known as the Spring Festival Gala - which aired on Thursday night. By some estimates, the show is the most watched entertainment programme on earth. The skit begins with a routine by a group of African dancers in ""tribal"" attire and people dressed up as zebras, giraffes, lions and antelopes. This is followed by a comedy skit where a young black woman asks a Chinese man to pose as her husband when meeting her mother. While the young woman is played by a black actor, her mother appears to be an Asian actor in blackface make-up, donning a traditional outfit complete with huge fake buttocks. The African mother is played by a Chinese lady with extra buttocks added on She walks on stage carrying a fruit plate on her head and is accompanied by what is thought to be have been a black actor in a monkey suit, carrying a basket on his back.

At one stage, the character of the African mother exclaims how much she loves China. China has over the past years stepped up investment into many African countries. The sketch was set around people working on the Nairobi-Mombasa railway project. by John Sudworth, BBC News, Beijing China's TV gala has become as much a part of the spring festival tradition as dumplings and lanterns. The gaudy sets, highly choreographed dance troupes and sentimental ballads serve as the background noise to hundreds of millions of private family reunions and provide the mass media glue that binds them all into a genuine national moment. In recent years though there have been grumblings that the gala is taking on a more political tone and this year was no exception - with the whole event a kind of pageant to China's rising power and national rejuvenation. The Africa skit was clearly meant to be part of this same vision and is, if nothing else, proof that art is rarely improved by a large dollop of propaganda. But what's particularly striking about the whole toe-curling spectacle is that it is also strangely at odds with China's own message. Chinese investment in Africa is one of the defining economic stories of our time and it has been accompanied by a massive publicity drive. Bristling at any suggestion that it is involved in neo-colonialism, China insists that it comes not to exploit, but in partnership with and for the mutual benefit of its African partners. The sight then, of a Chinese actress in blackface, leading an African man dressed as a monkey around a stage as a way of celebrating a vital trading relationship on prime-time national TV, seems particularly ill-judged. Simply naive and clumsy? Or a sign of something deeper? Either way it suggests China's soft-power project is still a work in progress. The notion of blackface being racist is linked to the history of minstrel shows in the US and Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries where white actors would paint their skin black for condescending portrayals of black people. In China, the vast majority of people have no experience of interacting with black people and are less aware of Europe's and the US' history of slavery and racism. Celebrating Chinese-African ties? Nonetheless, Chinese users on the country's biggest social media website Weibo have condemned the programme. Comments included ""it's full of racism,"" that ""it makes me feel like I'm living in the last century,"" and that ""we are going to lose face internationally"". Putting it into a larger context beyond the specific history of blackface, one user asks ""if an American white person painted yellow, says I love the USA and recites some Trump quotes while pulling his eyes, how would you feel?"" Some Chinese articles criticising the annual gala on the eve of Lunar New Year, China's biggest holiday, have been blocked overnight, as have some critical comments on Chinese social media sites. In 2016,a TV advertisement for a laundry detergent had caused widespread outragefor being racist. The ad featured a black man with paint stains on his face who gets put into a washing machine by a young Chinese woman to later re-emerge as a fair-skinned Chinese man.

Top women doctors earn less than men,"Senior NHS female doctors are earning less than their male counterparts, a BBC investigation shows. Of the top 100 earning consultants in England, just five are women, despite more than a third of the workforce being female. The top-paid man earned nearly Â£740,000 - two-and-a-half times that of the top woman. On average, full-time women consultants earned nearly Â£14,000 a year less than men - a pay gap of 12%. Senior female doctors described the findings as ""disappointing"" and said it showed more needs to be done to tackle the gender pay gap in medicine. The figures were obtained by the BBC following requests to individual health trusts, the government and NHS Digital. The top earning male consultant in England earned Â£739,460 in 2016-17 The best paid woman got Â£281,616 by comparison On average, full-time men in England earned Â£127,683, nearly Â£14,000 more than full-time women When you strip out overtime and bonuses and just look at basic pay there was nearly Â£1,500 difference Six-and-a-half times as many men as women in England and Wales get the top platinum award bonus worth Â£77,000 a year In Northern Ireland the gap between men and women's gross earnings was over Â£8,000 Some doctors the BBC spoke to said some of the difference was probably down to the fact men were more likely to do overtime. But they said it was clear some of the gap was unfair with the system of bonuses and awards weighted in favour of men. Dr Anthea Mowat, of the British Medical Association, said despite recent progress on gender pay, the figures obtained by the BBC showed there was ""clearly still a long way to go"". She said women needed more support, including leadership training, mentoring and more flexible working opportunities. ""With women making up the majority of medical graduates in recent years, it's vitally important that we address the root causes of the gender pay gap, and develop a wider programme of work to eliminate it across the medical workforce,"" she added. Dr Jacky Davis, a radiologist and former chair of the NHS Consultants Association, said she was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the figures. ""Some of it we can explain - men are more likely to do overtime for example - but that doesn't account for it all.  In my experience men are better at pushing for more money, putting the case for awards and they get them."" Dr Sally Davies, of the Medical Woman's Federation, agreed. ""We need to do more to support women. They often fall behind when they have children and have to take time off. ""By the time they get to the point where overtime is available or the awards are being handed out they find themselves behind men. It's a serious problem."" Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said: ""This appears to be a long-term and serious problem within the medical workforce which the government, the profession and employers are committed to resolving."" He said one of the causes was the consultants' contract - in the past it has been argued it allows high premiums to be charged for overtime and creates a bonus system that is skewed. The government and BMA are currently in negotiations about the future of the contract. The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We are committed to ensuring that our hardworking doctors are rewarded fairly and equally for their work â regardless of gender â and have commissioned an independent report alongside the medical profession to examine exactly how that can be achieved.""

Council may feed children 365 days a year,"North Lanarkshire will offer meals 365 days a year A Scottish council is planning to provide free meals 365 days a year to children from low income families. North Lanarkshire Council said its proposal would help tackle ""holiday hunger"". The ""Food 365"" programme would cover the 175 days of the year when lunches are not served in school. If approved, the council will run a pilot project in the spring break and could then extend the scheme over the summer holidays. Frank McNally, convener of education, said: ""These proposals to tackle weekend and holiday hunger are the most ambitious in the country. ""Groups like the Trussell Trust are struggling to cope with demand from parents and research has suggested that pressure on food banks doubles during the holidays. ""North Lanarkshire has one of the highest concentrations of deprivation in the country and this is only going to be exacerbated by further welfare reforms."" The council cited national research which suggests that almost a third of parents with incomes under Â£25,000 skip meals during the school holidays so that their children can eat, and nearly two thirds are not always able to afford food outside of term time. This rises to half and three-quarters respectively for parents with incomes under Â£15,000. Teachers report that children sometimes return from holiday suffering from poor nutrition In a survey carried out by the National Union of Teachers in England, 80% of teachers noted a rise in ""holiday hunger"" where children return from holidays suffering from poor nutrition. Almost three-quarters of teachers said this was negatively affecting children's education. While some councils in the UK have committed to holiday programmes, these do not include weekends. North Lanarkshire Council said its scheme would be the most comprehensive in the country. Mr McNally continued: ""A good diet plays a key role in healthy growth and development, supporting learning and social skills and sets a positive habit to be continued later in life. ""Our plans will do much to promote healthy eating and address some of the symptoms of poverty for children who need it most."" John Dickie of the Child Poverty Action Group warmly welcomed the proposal. But he warned it was vital to provide the meals in such a way that there was no risk of children or their families feeling stigmatised. He said: ""I haven't seen the detail of this proposal but in general terms we would welcome extension of free school meals but also stress that's it's really important that healthy free holiday lunches are offered as part of a wider package of holiday activities ""Every effort should be made to avoid the risk of stigmatising holiday provision, for example by making sure it is open to those who pay for school lunches too and isn't promoted purely as a feeding programme."" The local SNP group welcomed the proposal but said the council should not axe school breakfast clubs. SNP's education spokesman Councillor Tom Johnston said: ""I am delighted that this council has finally agreed with our position that children shouldn't go hungry simply because the schools are closed for holidays."" He said SNP proposals to introduce the policy in 2003 had been blocked by the Labour administration. ""The SNP will support this proposal but we will amend it to go further and reverse the Labour decision to cut breakfast clubs from this summer,"" he added. ""Our proposal will commit this council not only to continuing breakfast clubs, but extending them from August to cover every primary school in North Lanarkshire."" The Scottish government said tackling poverty and inequality was a ""key priority"". A spokesman added: ""Our Â£1m a year Fair Food Fund supports projects which promote sustainable solutions to food poverty. ""In addition, local authorities also have the flexibility to provide meals to children outwith term time and some chose to use this flexibility during school holidays by providing holiday lunch clubs."" Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith MSP said: ""Delivering free school meals for low income families for every day of the year may be a noble objective but it is undoubtedly expensive if each child is to have a nutritious meal. ""Hopefully the council has carefully considered all its options and explained to parents how it will be paying for this service."" North Lanarkshire is one of the nine ""challenge authorities"" in Scotland with the highest levels of deprivation. Nearly 21% of children live in low income households. If the pilot is successful, the programme would be delivered in 23 ""hubs"" across the authority area, usually in community facilities. Based on demand for other previous holiday initiatives, the cost is estimated to be Â£500,000. The proposals will be discussed by councillors at a meeting of the education committee on 20 February.

British man charged with terror offencesAidan James was arrested after returning from Syria where he fought against so-called Islamic State.,"Aidan James was arrested at Liverpool Airport on 14 February A British man who fought against so-called Islamic State in Syria has been charged with three terror offences. Aidan James, a father-of-one from Formby, Merseyside, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday. The 27-year-old had been fighting alongside the YPG Kurdish militia. He has been charged with one count of the preparation of acts of terrorism and two counts of attendance at a place used for terrorist training. The court heard that Mr James left the UK on 26 August 2017, travelling to Iraq via Jordan. He later travelled to Syria, the court was told. Mr James was arrested on his return to the UK at Liverpool Airport on 14 February. He was remanded in custody and will appear at the Old Bailey for a plea hearing on 1 March. By Emma Vardy, BBC News correspondent Aidan James is the second person in a week to appear in court charged with terror offences after fighting against so-called Islamic State. Since 2015, the government has often restated warnings about the cohort of British citizens who have been fighting with the Kurds in Syria, saying their actions could be in breach of UK terrorism laws. Local counter-terror police ""Prevent"" teams have also tried to intervene in cases of British citizens who have gone to fight against IS. Many of these volunteer fighters have been arrested on their return, but have faced a long wait to find out whether there would be serious legal consequences. They have justified their actions by saying they have been fighting on the same side as the Western coalition, in trying to destroy IS.

"'100,000 orangutans' killed in 16 years","This video can not be played Bornean orangutans' forest habitat is changing at an ""unsustainable rate"" More than 100,000 Critically Endangered orangutans have been killed in Borneo since 1999, research has revealed. Scientists who carried out a 16-year survey on the island described the figure as ""mind-boggling"". Deforestation, driven by logging, oil palm, mining and paper mills, continues to be the main culprit. But the research,published in the journal Current Biology,external, also revealed that animals were ""disappearing"" from areas that remained forested. This implied large numbers of orangutans were simply being slaughtered, said lead researcher Maria Voigt of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. Read also: Saving the orangutans of Sumatra Dr Voigt and her colleagues say the animals are being targeted by hunters and are being killed in retaliation for crop-raiding - a threat that has been previously underestimated. Prof Serge Wich from Liverpool John Moores University, UK, also part of the team, told BBC News: ""We didn't expect the losses to be so large in standing forest, so these [studies] confirm that hunting is a major issue."" ""When these animals come into conflict with people on the edge of a plantation, they are always on the losing end. People will kill them. ""Just last week, we had a report of an orangutan that had 130 pellets in its body, after being shot at in Borneo. ""It's shocking and it's unnecessary. Orangutans might eat farmers' fruit, but they are not dangerous."" Prof Wich called for leaders in Malaysia and Indonesia to speak out against this deliberate targeting of the apes. But the research also showed that natural resources were still being exploited in Borneo ""at an unsustainable rate"". Deforestation alone, the researchers predict, could wipe out a further 45,000 orangutans over the next 35 years. Roads and plantations fragment forest habitat The cultivation of oil palm, found in a wide variety of food products, is a well-known cause of that habitat loss. Dr Emma Keller from the conservation charity WWF told BBC News but that consumers should ""put pressure"" on companies to commit to a sustainable supply for this almost ubiquitous food product. Referring to the certification system known as theRound Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),external, Dr Keller said that the standards for what constitutes sustainable were ""constantly being updated"". ""The big objectives now are to have a complete ban on deforestation and no planting on peat soils,"" she said. And while an independent assessment of the scheme,published in 2017,,externalfound that it ""significantly reduced deforestation"", it also concluded that participating plantations needed monitoring if it was to have a significant impact on fires and peatland clearance. Man-made bridges are a short-term solution allowing orangutans to move in fragmented habitat As the stark new figures on orangutan declines were published, conservationists also highlighted a glimmer of hope for patches of their habitat. A team from Chester Zoo in the UK released the first pictures of the animals using man-made ""forest canopy bridges"", constructed from tough cargo-strapping that the zoo uses to make swings and bridges in orangutan enclosures. Catherine Barton, the zoo's field conservation manager explained that - working with the charity Hutan in Malaysia - the zoo had set out to reconnect habitats fragmented by oil palm plantations, roads and drainage channels. ""To see the animals start to use these bridges and to reconnect across this fragmented habitat is a really positive sign,"" said Ms Barton. ""But it's a short-term solution."" In the long-term, she added, the aim was to replant forests and make space for the great apes. But as Prof Wich pointed out, his team's survey confirmed that it would not be enough merely to protect the animals' forest habitat. ""We have to protect the animals, so we don't end up with forest that looks fine, but has no orangutans.""

Consumer products 'affecting air quality'Chemicals from household products rival vehicles as a key source of urban air pollution.1han hour agoScience & EnvironmentComments,"US research has found that chemicals in everyday household products are now a key contributor to city air pollution, rivalling some vehicle emissions. The study, led from Colorado University, focussed on so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These are contained in petroleum-based products such as cleaning fluids and paints, and when they get into the air can form particles that affect health. The scientists say the sources of non-vehicle VOCs have been underestimated. This appears a somewhat surprising result because by weight, we use far more fuel than we do these other chemical products. About 95% of raw oil goes into the production of fuels, whereas roughly only 5% is refined for use in chemicals that are included in the likes of deodorants, pesticides, and adhesives. But Dr Jessica Gilman said it should not be seen as that remarkable because vehicle fuels are burned (to yield mostly carbon dioxide and water), whereas many of the household products are simply wafted into the air by design. ""Most commonly, they're used as solvents - things like nail polish remover, the hairspray I used this morning; they are used in many cases as cleaning agents like carpet cleaners,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist told reporters. ""It would be difficult to remove them because the alternative is to use straight water, which as you know doesn't work for all stains."" One of Dr Gilman's colleagues, Dr Brian McDonald, did however suggest that reduced use would be helpful. ""Use as little of the product as you can to get the job done,"" he said. Cleaning products 'affect lung health' 'Sooty birds' reveal pollution history Your practical solutions to air pollution The air we breathe contains such a diverse mix of compounds it's impossible for researchers to be sure what chemical is causing what problem. And there's an even trickier issue - setting pollution limits that are appropriate for everyone. Air fresheners are loved by some people - but they make others choke. Cleaning sprays are useful - but they make some people's eyes run. I know someone whose childhood asthma is thought to have been provoked by chemical emissions from flat-packed furniture in his bedroom. This is a neglected field of research as public and media attention has focused on cars outdoors at the expense of chemicals indoors. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin,external The researchers pulled together a wide range of information for their study. They looked again at what manufacturers put in their products; they reviewed the statistics held by regulatory agencies; they flew atmospheric sampling missions above Los Angeles to examine the air chemistry; and they also evaluated indoor and outdoor air quality measurements collected by other researchers. The team concluded that in the US, the amount of VOCs emitted by consumer and industrial products is very probably two or three times greater than estimated by current air pollution inventories.  (There are also natural sources of VOCs in the environment.) They add that these inventories likely also overestimate the motor vehicle sources. The researchers cite as an example the current estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA considers that about 75% of petroleum-based VOC emissions come from vehicle fuels, and roughly 25% from chemical products. The Colorado reassessment puts the split closer to 50-50. ""The use of these products emits VOCs in a magnitude that's comparable to what comes out of the tailpipe of your car. One of the main reasons for this is that in the US, as well as in Europe, air quality regulations have been really successful at controlling emissions from motor vehicles,"" said Dr McDonald, who is affiliated to the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Colorado and is the lead author on the study. ""In some ways, this is a good news story that, as we control some of the bigger sources in the past, the other sources are emerging in relative importance, such as these consumer products."" Experts say the results of this research are broadly applicable to other industrialised nations, including those in Europe. Los Angeles: For these particular types of compound, motor vehicles are not the only culprit Anthony Frew, a professor of respiratory medicine at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the UK, commented: ""This research is a useful reminder that discussions of air pollution need to consider all sources of pollutants and that measures targeting cars only address part of the problem. ""Engineering changes to car exhausts have dramatically reduced the amount of pollution produced per mile, meaning that (a) there is now less to be gained from further changes to cars and (b) the public need more information on how their activities, apart from driving, contribute to current pollution levels."" Vehicles emit pollutants beyond just VOCs, of course. These include nitrogen oxides (NOx). Indeed, it is the reaction between the NOx and the VOCs that produces some of the particles of most health concern. The Colorado study ispublished in Science Magazine,external. It was also presented on Thursday to theannual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,externalin Austin, Texas.

Communities 'cut off' by bus service loss,"This video can not be played A group of people in the Yorkshire Dales decided to drive their own buses Britain's bus network has shrunk to levels last seen in the late 1980s, BBC analysis has revealed. Rising car use and cuts to public funding are being blamed for a loss of 134 million miles of coverage over the past decade alone. Some cut-off communities have taken to starting their own services, with Wales and north-west England hardest hit. The government has encouraged councils and bus companies to work together to halt the decline. One lobbying group fears the scale of the miles lost are a sign buses are on course to be cut to the same extent railways were in the 1960s. During that decade thousands of miles of track were scrapped and hundreds of stations closed following a report by British Railways Board chairman Dr Richard Beeching. Chris Todd, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ""We are not talking a loss of that level, but we are heading that way. ""We live in a society that is quite prepared to completely abandon certain groups of people and leave them with no options of getting around."" Communities around the UK say the shrinking bus network is leaving people unable to reach basic services such as shops and GP surgeries. In Chard in Somerset, mother Melissa Whittaker told the BBC how a 10-mile journey to take her autistic son Issac to their nearest community hospital can take three hours, the same time it would take to walk. Villagers in Ditton Priors, Shropshire, who have not had a regular bus service since 2012, say some elderly residents have been forced to move away. And some cut-off communities have even gone as far as setting up their own replacement bus services. Cumbria's Western Dales Bus company runs its routes with the help of 20 volunteer drivers. The Western Dales Bus company relies on National Lottery funding One of its directors, John Carey, said the National Lottery-funded company was a lifeline for hundreds in the county. He said: ""Without this people would have been cut off, absolutely. ""They wouldn't have been able to go to the shops. It has preserved the mobility of elderly residents in the area."" Although car use is at an all-time high, buses remain Britain's most popular form of public transport. But analysis of official statistics by the BBC Shared Data Unit found the UK's bus network has shrunk by 8% in the last decade. That equates to 134 million fewer miles - the equivalent of more than 5,000 trips around the equator. Passenger numbers have increased marginally (0.7%) over the same period. Dr John Disney, an academic specialising in transport There are a number of reasons why Britain's bus network is shrinking in size, according to John Disney, a transport researcher and lecturer at Nottingham Business School. He said: ""Commercial operators have definitely, over the last 10 years, become much more risk-averse and so they are really concentrating on what they consider to be their core routes and are not really bothered about much else."" He said at the same time many local authorities, which would have stepped up to subsidise unprofitable routes, have reduced this spending. But the trade body for operators, the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT), denied the claim that companies were becoming risk-averse. A spokeswoman said: ""Where routes become unviable, sound business decisions need to be taken and there are many examples of operators continuing to operate lightly used and uneconomic services, or developing innovative ways of meeting passengers' needs."" In England, the scale of the bus network has fallen to levels last seen in 1991, even though passenger numbers are now 8% higher than they were then. The figures show big regional variations, with the North West the worst-hit, losing nearly a quarter (23%) of miles from its network in a decade. London, the East of England and the South East, on the other hand, were the only English regions to see bus mileage increase over the past decade. A quarter of all journeys driven by English buses now take place in London The capital now accounts for a quarter of all bus miles travelled in England, the highest proportion since this measurement began in 1982. This has prompted campaigners to describe England's public transport system as ""two-tier"". Outside the capital, England's metropolitan areas were hardest hit, which experts believe is linked to increasing congestion. The bus coverage in metropolitan areas has dropped by a tenth since 2013-14 alone, figures show, while rural areas saw bus routes cut by 7.8%. Wales has seen the biggest drop in bus coverage over the past decade. Annual bus mileage fell by a fifth between 2006-07 and 2016-17, a loss of 15 million miles. Experts suggest the slump in Wales could be down to a succession of bus companies going into administration in recent years. A spokesman for the Welsh government said the figures do not reflect growth on some local services and the longer distance TrawsCymru network of buses. Scotland's network shrank by 15% over the past decade. The Scottish region hit hardest was South West and Strathclyde, which saw bus mileage fall by more than a fifth in 10 years. Only one Scottish region saw bus mileage increase: North East, Tayside and Central, which covers Dundee and Aberdeen. Northern Ireland's bus network is publicly-run. It covers 6.4% fewer miles a year than it did ten years ago, a loss of 2.6 million miles. Tom Daley announces baby news Swift lyric too 'banal' to copyright Lions eat suspected big cat poacher Crypto-cash craze 'hinders alien search' Most of Britain's bus network is provided by commercial companies, although local government can subsidise routes which are deemed unprofitable but socially important. Many campaigners say the shrinking pot of funding available for these subsidies is a major contributor to the decline of Britain's buses. However, the BBC's analysis shows subsidy cuts are only part of the picture. Excluding London, all English regions have seen bus subsidies reduced in the past four years, losing a third (32%) of their subsidised miles on average. But at the same time, bus companies have also been reducing the number of commercially-run miles in the North, while increasing them in the South, the analysis shows. In Brighton and Hove, for instance, its bus network appears to be thriving, despite only 3% of miles now being paid for by the council. Some areas have seen public sector investment pay off. In Nottingham, which has the third highest bus use per head of population in England, passengers can travel with a range of different companies using a Robin Hood card. But the authority there also spends more on buses each year than the whole of Tyne and Wear, which has four times the population. The Local Government Association has said councils could do more to prop up transport routes if they had more Whitehall funding. Its transport spokesman Chris Tett said the shrinking of Britain's bus network was ""hugely concerning"". The government has given English 'metro mayors' new powers to set up Transport for London-style bus franchise systems. It means they could set the routes and timetables for their areas and invite companies to bid to run them. The Bus Services Act 2017 also aims to get local authorities and bus companies in other areas of England to work in partnership to improve services. A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: ""Buses connect people, homes and businesses, and that's why we have given councils extra powers to work in partnership with bus companies to improve the service passengers expect and deserve.""

China's biggest show in 'racist blackface'The annual Lunar New Year gala featured an Asian woman in blackface and with fake buttocks.,"By some estimates, the show is the most watched entertainment programme on earth A skit on China's biggest Lunar New Year TV show has sparked widespread criticism and accusations of racism. In a comedy routine celebrating Chinese-African ties an Asian actress appears in blackface and with exaggerated buttocks. Using make-up to lampoon black people - a practice known as blackface - is seen by many as deeply offensive. The annual state media variety show is hugely popular, and has up to 800 million viewers. China 'racist' video on India sparks fury Lunar New Year pictures from across Asia Some observers have pointed out that this sketch would not have been intended as offensive to Africans. However, this is not the first time Chinese entertainment shows have caused controversy with their portrayals of other ethnicities. Allow Twitter content?

The controversial sketch was part of the four-hour CCTV New Year Gala - also known as the Spring Festival Gala - which aired on Thursday night. By some estimates, the show is the most watched entertainment programme on earth. The skit begins with a routine by a group of African dancers in ""tribal"" attire and people dressed up as zebras, giraffes, lions and antelopes. This is followed by a comedy skit where a young black woman asks a Chinese man to pose as her husband when meeting her mother. While the young woman is played by a black actor, her mother appears to be an Asian actor in blackface make-up, donning a traditional outfit complete with huge fake buttocks. The African mother is played by a Chinese lady with extra buttocks added on She walks on stage carrying a fruit plate on her head and is accompanied by what is thought to be have been a black actor in a monkey suit, carrying a basket on his back.

At one stage, the character of the African mother exclaims how much she loves China. China has over the past years stepped up investment into many African countries. The sketch was set around people working on the Nairobi-Mombasa railway project. by John Sudworth, BBC News, Beijing China's TV gala has become as much a part of the spring festival tradition as dumplings and lanterns. The gaudy sets, highly choreographed dance troupes and sentimental ballads serve as the background noise to hundreds of millions of private family reunions and provide the mass media glue that binds them all into a genuine national moment. In recent years though there have been grumblings that the gala is taking on a more political tone and this year was no exception - with the whole event a kind of pageant to China's rising power and national rejuvenation. The Africa skit was clearly meant to be part of this same vision and is, if nothing else, proof that art is rarely improved by a large dollop of propaganda. But what's particularly striking about the whole toe-curling spectacle is that it is also strangely at odds with China's own message. Chinese investment in Africa is one of the defining economic stories of our time and it has been accompanied by a massive publicity drive. Bristling at any suggestion that it is involved in neo-colonialism, China insists that it comes not to exploit, but in partnership with and for the mutual benefit of its African partners. The sight then, of a Chinese actress in blackface, leading an African man dressed as a monkey around a stage as a way of celebrating a vital trading relationship on prime-time national TV, seems particularly ill-judged. Simply naive and clumsy? Or a sign of something deeper? Either way it suggests China's soft-power project is still a work in progress. The notion of blackface being racist is linked to the history of minstrel shows in the US and Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries where white actors would paint their skin black for condescending portrayals of black people. In China, the vast majority of people have no experience of interacting with black people and are less aware of Europe's and the US' history of slavery and racism. Celebrating Chinese-African ties? Nonetheless, Chinese users on the country's biggest social media website Weibo have condemned the programme. Comments included ""it's full of racism,"" that ""it makes me feel like I'm living in the last century,"" and that ""we are going to lose face internationally"". Putting it into a larger context beyond the specific history of blackface, one user asks ""if an American white person painted yellow, says I love the USA and recites some Trump quotes while pulling his eyes, how would you feel?"" Some Chinese articles criticising the annual gala on the eve of Lunar New Year, China's biggest holiday, have been blocked overnight, as have some critical comments on Chinese social media sites. In 2016,a TV advertisement for a laundry detergent had caused widespread outragefor being racist. The ad featured a black man with paint stains on his face who gets put into a washing machine by a young Chinese woman to later re-emerge as a fair-skinned Chinese man.

Council may feed children 365 days a yearNorth Lanarkshire says it could be the first UK local authority to offer school meals during holidays and weekends.6h6 hours agoGlasgow & West Scotland,"North Lanarkshire will offer meals 365 days a year A Scottish council is planning to provide free meals 365 days a year to children from low income families. North Lanarkshire Council said its proposal would help tackle ""holiday hunger"". The ""Food 365"" programme would cover the 175 days of the year when lunches are not served in school. If approved, the council will run a pilot project in the spring break and could then extend the scheme over the summer holidays. Frank McNally, convener of education, said: ""These proposals to tackle weekend and holiday hunger are the most ambitious in the country. ""Groups like the Trussell Trust are struggling to cope with demand from parents and research has suggested that pressure on food banks doubles during the holidays. ""North Lanarkshire has one of the highest concentrations of deprivation in the country and this is only going to be exacerbated by further welfare reforms."" The council cited national research which suggests that almost a third of parents with incomes under Â£25,000 skip meals during the school holidays so that their children can eat, and nearly two thirds are not always able to afford food outside of term time. This rises to half and three-quarters respectively for parents with incomes under Â£15,000. Teachers report that children sometimes return from holiday suffering from poor nutrition In a survey carried out by the National Union of Teachers in England, 80% of teachers noted a rise in ""holiday hunger"" where children return from holidays suffering from poor nutrition. Almost three-quarters of teachers said this was negatively affecting children's education. While some councils in the UK have committed to holiday programmes, these do not include weekends. North Lanarkshire Council said its scheme would be the most comprehensive in the country. Mr McNally continued: ""A good diet plays a key role in healthy growth and development, supporting learning and social skills and sets a positive habit to be continued later in life. ""Our plans will do much to promote healthy eating and address some of the symptoms of poverty for children who need it most."" John Dickie of the Child Poverty Action Group warmly welcomed the proposal. But he warned it was vital to provide the meals in such a way that there was no risk of children or their families feeling stigmatised. He said: ""I haven't seen the detail of this proposal but in general terms we would welcome extension of free school meals but also stress that's it's really important that healthy free holiday lunches are offered as part of a wider package of holiday activities ""Every effort should be made to avoid the risk of stigmatising holiday provision, for example by making sure it is open to those who pay for school lunches too and isn't promoted purely as a feeding programme."" The local SNP group welcomed the proposal but said the council should not axe school breakfast clubs. SNP's education spokesman Councillor Tom Johnston said: ""I am delighted that this council has finally agreed with our position that children shouldn't go hungry simply because the schools are closed for holidays."" He said SNP proposals to introduce the policy in 2003 had been blocked by the Labour administration. ""The SNP will support this proposal but we will amend it to go further and reverse the Labour decision to cut breakfast clubs from this summer,"" he added. ""Our proposal will commit this council not only to continuing breakfast clubs, but extending them from August to cover every primary school in North Lanarkshire."" The Scottish government said tackling poverty and inequality was a ""key priority"". A spokesman added: ""Our Â£1m a year Fair Food Fund supports projects which promote sustainable solutions to food poverty. ""In addition, local authorities also have the flexibility to provide meals to children outwith term time and some chose to use this flexibility during school holidays by providing holiday lunch clubs."" Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith MSP said: ""Delivering free school meals for low income families for every day of the year may be a noble objective but it is undoubtedly expensive if each child is to have a nutritious meal. ""Hopefully the council has carefully considered all its options and explained to parents how it will be paying for this service."" North Lanarkshire is one of the nine ""challenge authorities"" in Scotland with the highest levels of deprivation. Nearly 21% of children live in low income households. If the pilot is successful, the programme would be delivered in 23 ""hubs"" across the authority area, usually in community facilities. Based on demand for other previous holiday initiatives, the cost is estimated to be Â£500,000. The proposals will be discussed by councillors at a meeting of the education committee on 20 February.

"My dreams were shattered by Barry BennellFor three decades, Barry Bennell used his powerful position to abuse dozens of boys. Two of his victims have told us their stories."," Gary Cliffe was 11 in 1981. He was living south of Manchester and dreaming of FA Cup glory. Manchester City had reached the cup final at Wembley that season, only losing to Spurs after a replay and one of the FA Cup's iconic moments: Argentine midfielder Ricky Villa dribbling his way brilliantly through the City defence and turning the ball past the goalkeeper. Cliffe, though, like his father, was always much more of a United fan. His parents encouraged him to play at an early age. They weren’t pushy, just very supportive. Most weekends were spent jumping into the back of his dad’s battered Chrysler Sunbeam to be dropped off at muddy changing rooms from Nantwich to Crewe. Gary Cliffe Every 11-year-old kid at school wanted to play for City or United. Just a lucky few would ever come close. “Obviously I wanted to make it as a footballer, who wouldn’t?” he told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire programme. “That was my dream and I almost got there.” Like others, many others, Cliffe’s life was changed forever by a coach he once respected and his parents once trusted. “He was the star-maker, the guy who was going to take me to become a professional footballer,” he says. My childhood was ruined by this man. He's ruined hundreds of lives. I know because I was there.” Gary Cliffe talked to Victoria Derbyshire: This was the era just before the Premier League. Before live football on TV. Before youth development programmes and academies. Professional clubs still recruited young players from local feeder teams linked to adult sides but run at arm’s length by amateur coaches. In this world of dreams and promises one name really stood out. Barry Bennell had a strong reputation. He was a talented coach with a new way of doing things. He was lively, charismatic and good looking. He had a back story to impress as well. Bennell had played briefly for Chelsea’s reserve side before brittle bones, supposedly, forced him to quit. Now he was back where he grew up, running his own chain of video and sports shops in the North West and training youngsters in his spare time. Gary Cliffe By the autumn of 1981, he had just taken over the running of Cliffe’s under 12s side, Pegasus FC, one of a number of clubs he managed linked to Manchester City. Straight away the new coach said he wanted to get to know his young players properly. In pairs they were invited over to his house on the edge of the Peak District for the weekend. Kitted out with the latest gadgets it was what one young player described as an Aladdin’s cave for kids. There were arcade machines, pool tables and an endless supply of free football kit. Bennell had dogs, a wildcat, even a pet monkey. He would turn off the lights and let 10 and 11-year-old children watch adult-rated horror films borrowed from his own video store downstairs. The heating would be turned down so some boys would get closer to him as a precursor to more serious abuse. For Cliffe, there was no build up. No serious attempt to groom him first. It started almost immediately. The touching quickly moved on to forced oral sex and attempted rape. Mostly it took place when he was alone in Bennell’s house or in his car. But there were times, many times, when other children were abused while they were in the same room as each other. “There’d be me on one side, Bennell would be in the middle and the other boy on the other side,” says Gary. “I would know I was being abused, and it’d be naive of anyone to think that the other boy wasn’t. I know they were. I was there. But I couldn’t say anything.” From the age of 11 to 15, it happened to Cliffe over and over again. At weekends, at Christmas time, every school holiday. Hundreds of times. I knew it was wrong but I just didn’t have the stomach or the vocabulary to put my hands up and stop it.” Gary Cliffe “It was happening with other boys around. They weren’t saying anything. I didn’t say anything. No parents were saying anything. No officials at the club were saying anything. “I just didn’t have the words. I was dreaming of being a footballer and the bubble would have burst.” With his confidence and swagger Bennell could also win over parents. Some mothers worked for him from time-to-time in his chain of video shops. Another family invited him around for Christmas dinner because they thought he looked lonely. In Gary’s words Bennell held adults in “the palm of his hand”. They were “in awe of him, taken in by him”. As for young children, his favoured boys would be promised a bright future in the game. If a player resisted or, worse, struck back, they would be humiliated, shunned and dropped from the team. A captain of one of Bennell’s sides told how, after forcing the coach away one night, he was sidelined and stripped of the captaincy. A rumour quickly went round that he was stealing money from his teammates. He never played for the club again. On the pitch there was no doubt Bennell was a gifted football coach, one of the most promising in the North West. His name quickly became linked to one team: Manchester City. He was never a full member of staff at the club but it’s thought he was paid expenses and given his own pass to its Platt Lane training ground. His teams all played in Manchester City strips. “In other words,” claims Cliffe, “He had the run of the place.” “He was producing the teams who won everything. We were the envy of most boys. We’d come back with a trophy most times,” he says. Bennell would go on to coach a generation of City stars from David White to Andy Hinchcliffe, as well as former Leeds United midfielder Gary Speed. White has confirmed he was abused. There is no suggestion Hinchcliffe and Speed were victims. Gary Speed His young teams were winners. The most talented players signed schoolboy forms, the first step towards a career in the professional game. But for those looking closely enough, the warning signs were already there. There were fights with other managers in the youth leagues. Bennell was attacked with a metal peg used to tie down goal nets, leaving him with a deep cut below his eye socket. The parents of one boy complained to Manchester City after their son was kept up late in a hotel room on an away trip. Other members of the playing staff were becoming more suspicious about his behaviour. Former goalkeeper and youth team manager Steve Fleet said he first heard rumours in the late 70s. Steve Fleet At one point Fleet says, he was under pressure from a club official to give Bennell a proper role, to make him an official part of the City line-up. I said it was either him or me. I wasn’t working with a person like that. I’d heard he was doing things with kids that weren’t normal.” On that occasion, he says, he won the argument. After Fleet left the club in 1980, it appears Bennell became more involved, though he never did make it onto the full coaching staff there. His victims from that time, and to date seven have come forward publicly, are convinced more could and should have been done. “They let us down, they didn’t challenge him,” says Cliffe. “They knew what he was and they allowed it to continue because he was producing results.” Other young players abused around that time speak of the same culture of wilful ignorance and neglect. Interviewed by Channel 4 back in 1997, Manchester City officials said they didn’t receive a single formal complaint about Bennell’s behaviour. There was “no evidence whatsoever from that side of the fence”, claimed former chief scout, the late Ken Barnes. Manchester City is now in the middle of its own internal review led by the QC Jane Mulcahy. It will examine if more should have been done to protect young players in the past and look at the club’s current child protection policies. In a statement, the club said: “Manchester City offers its heartfelt sympathy to all victims for the unimaginably traumatic experiences they have endured.” “All victims were entitled to expect full protection.” On 30 November 1984 in a short ceremony at Platt Lane, Cliffe finally signed associated schoolboy forms with Manchester City. It was an important milestone. Only the most talented youngsters made it so far. Bennell was alongside him in that room at that moment. There was once a photograph to prove it. His mother found it years later and cut the coach out of the frame. By then aged 14, Cliffe started training with the youth side and was stopped from playing for any other team. But even though he was moving on he could not escape Bennell’s influence and the stigma that went with it. He says he was bullied for his close association with the coach, who was, according to other staff members, by then the subject of raised eyebrows and knowing looks at the club. Cliffe says another coach, again not directly employed by Manchester City, would often laugh about it, calling him Bennell’s “bum boy” in front of his teenage teammates. He says that finished him off. “He used those words and the other boys didn’t say anything but they knew,” says Cliffe. “Not only had I had it physically off Bennell but now this other coach who was supposed to take me through to 16 - the crucial time when you get signed on. “He had the audacity to say those words and take the Mick. It was horrific.” Aged 16, Cliffe quit the game. He eventually became a detective with Cheshire Police. Gary Cliffe As for Barry Bennell, his time with Manchester City ended abruptly in 1984. No-one is quite sure why but it’s thought he was, once again, turned down for a full-time coaching position. With his options limited, his attention simply switched from one club in North West England to another. Just an hour’s drive south of Manchester is the old railway town of Crewe. In the world of football the two places could not be much further apart. In 1984 Crewe Alexandra were struggling in the old fourth division, the lowest tier in the football league. The club had just appointed a promising young manager, Dario Gradi, who knew Barry Bennell from his time as a coach at Chelsea. His old contact was brought in to help modernise the youth set up. Over the next decade Crewe consistently produced young players who would later be sold on for good money to top flight clubs. Its academy became one of the most respected in the game. England internationals Rob Jones, Danny Murphy and Seth Johnson all came through there. David Platt joined as a 19-year-old and left three years later to become one of the country’s brightest stars. Its youth system was so successful it was soon known by a different name: The Football Factory. After years of trying, Barry Bennell was finally on a professional club’s payroll, officially responsible for development and scouting. One of the first players he spotted was a promising 11-year-old playing for Stockport Boys. His name was Andy Woodward. Andy Woodward The pattern of abuse was horribly familiar. “Within about three or four weeks he asked my parents if I could go and stay at his address. It started there,” Woodward says. Initially it was sexual touching but then it got worse. He raped me. I don’t want to put a number on how many times, but it was over a four-year period.” Like other victims, Woodward, an outgoing young boy, quickly became introverted and withdrawn. Bennell appeared to target the quieter, more thoughtful players, threatening to rip up their dreams if they ever stepped out of line or spoke up. “It was that control,” says Woodward. “All I wanted to do was be a footballer. But he threatened to take that away from me.” “I was crying out for somebody at the club, at Crewe, to say it’s wrong. But that didn’t happen.” Andy Woodward Woodward was far from the only victim linked to Crewe Alexandra. To date another five players have come forward, in public, to say they were abused in the same way. Bennell’s crimes took place not just at his house in Cheshire. A court later heard it also happened on one of Crewe’s training pitches and at the home of manager Gradi, himself, though he knew nothing about it. Again with Crewe’s football factory churning out so much talent, it appears few wanted to ask too many questions about Bennell’s treatment of the children in his care. At one point Bennell became so important to the club’s success, that one source says Gradi asked to split his share of sell-on fees with his youth coach. Gradi, by then a club director, had struck a deal with the board to receive 10 percent of any payment if one of the team’s young players was sold to another side. He asked the board for this to be cut to seven percent, with the other three percent passed directly to Bennell, according to the club’s former managing director.

He asked the board for this to be cut to seven per cent, with the other three per cent passed directly to Bennell, according to the club’s former managing director. Throughout the 1980s, there is no evidence that a single complaint was ever made to either the police or Crewe Alexandra itself. Again, though, there were plenty of rumours about Bennell’s behaviour. A senior member of the backroom staff at Crewe was said to have refused to allow their own children to be trained by the coach. There was talk that Sir Alex Ferguson personally asked security guards to escort Bennell off Manchester United’s training ground at Littleton Road. Sir Alex says he cannot recall the incident happening. The mother of a young Crewe player said she sent an anonymous letter to Gradi, when he was manager, to complain about boys sharing hotel beds with Bennell on away trips. No allegation of sexual abuse was made at the time and it’s not clear if the letter, which she remembers writing in 1989 or 1990, was ever opened by Gradi or Crewe. Perhaps the strongest warning, though, is said to have come from one of the most senior officials at the club, former managing director Hamilton Smith. Hamilton Smith After hearing rumours of inappropriate behaviour and a second-hand allegation of abuse from an anonymous parent, he says he changed the agenda of a board meeting to deal directly with concerns about the youth coach. “I thought no this is no good. I’ve had it right up to here. It’s got to stop,” he said. “I got back home and I rang the then vice-chairman John Bowler and told him what had happened,” said Smith. “I said, ‘This is hot. We’ve got to address it.’” During the board meeting, held at the house of then-chairman Norman Rowlinson, a senior police source was called who suggested Bennell should be moved on. By this time though Barry Bennell was a full-time employee at Crewe and there was no direct complaint from a parent. Instead Smith says the club directors present decided John Bowler, now Crewe Alexandra’s chairman, should raise only more general concerns with manager Dario Gradi about Barry Bennell letting children stay overnight in his house. Smith described Mr Gradi’s response as “very angry”. At a follow-up meeting the manager made it clear he did not have a problem with Bennell and the coach was allowed to continue working at Crewe Alexandra. “It makes me furious when [Crewe Alexandra FC] say they didn’t know something was going on,” says Hamilton Smith. “Everybody involved could and should have done a lot more.” Dario Gradi In a 1997 interview Dario Gradi said the club had no cause for any concern when Bennell was working at Crewe. He later said the first he or anyone else at the club knew of any crimes was when Bennell was finally arrested in 1994. Now Crewe’s director of football, Gradi has had his coaching licence suspended by the Football Association while it carries out a wider inquiry into abuse allegations and how they’ve been handled across football. In a statement following the guilty verdicts against Bennell, Crewe Alexandra FC expressed its deepest sympathies for his victims - and reiterated that it had not been aware of any sexual abuse by him, either before or during his time with the club. The club also stressed “it would have contacted the police immediately” if it had any suspicion that Bennell was committing acts of abuse, “either before, during or after he left the club’s employment”. Cheshire police say that during the course of their inquiry Crewe Alexandra, Manchester City and the FA were “nothing but cooperative”. They say they could find no evidence of a conspiracy to cover up allegations of abuse. Andy Woodward worked through the ranks at Crewe Alexandra, making his first-team debut in 1992 at the age of 19. Three years later he signed for Bury, playing 24 times in his first full season as the Lancashire club won the division two title. Then out of nowhere he was shopping at Tesco’s one Sunday night, when he broke down, almost collapsed and was taken to hospital. “I went through the door and all of a sudden this rush of adrenaline went through my body,” he says. “I wouldn’t wish that feeling on anyone. It was the scariest thing that had happened in my life.” He started to suffer from repeated panic attacks while playing, covering them up by claiming he was injured - inventing a twisted ankle or problem hamstring. Andy Woodward His career faded out, ending at the age of 29 after short spells with Sheffield United, Scunthorpe and Halifax. “In my head there were all sorts of things going on. I don’t know how I even played,” he says. “I can’t put into words what was done to me. But I think other people out there will understand. I think we survive and that’s it. We just survive.” As with Manchester City, the reasons why Bennell finally left Crewe Alexandra are unclear. People say he was sacked quietly in 1991 after a dispute over tactics. He was soon back coaching at a small local team in the Cheshire area, Stone Dominoes, where he took young boys overseas to training camps in Jacksonville, Florida. It was there in the summer of 1992 that his long history of abuse finally caught up with him. Bennell sexually assaulted a 13-year-old British boy in a hotel room. Only this time the child, who has never been named, told his parents partly because he said he was terrified of catching Aids. Bennell was arrested by police in the US and eventually pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual battery of a child. He spent three years in an American prison. The US authorities suspected this wasn’t the first time he had abused young boys. Libby Senterfitt from the State Attorney’s office in Florida wrote a strong warning letter to Fifa’s head office in Switzerland and to the Football Association. Cheshire Police was alerted and started investigating possible crimes in the UK. With Bennell serving time in prison, the subject was tackled by the national media for the first time. In January 1997 investigative journalist Deborah Davis presented Soccer’s Foul Play, an hour-long documentary for Channel 4. It named Bennell and other alleged abusers in the game, giving a voice to victims for the first time and asking tough questions of club officials. But the Football Association reacted defensively and the response from the rest of the media was muted. One television critic dismissed the programme as alarmist, savaging it for “charging around, looking for somewhere to bang in its nails”. A year later, in 1998, Bennell was deported from the US and flown back to the UK. Barry Bennell He was arrested as he landed and later admitted 23 charges of sexual abuse against six British boys aged nine to 15, changing his plea to guilty just a day before trial. One of those boys was Andy Woodward. “When he was jailed I just felt safe he was in prison,” he says. “His sentence was nine years. Looking back now, nine years for just what happened to me was not enough.” “I can’t put into words what it has done to me. The impact it had on my life was just catastrophic.” After Bennell’s release he was convicted once again for historical offences against yet another schoolboy back in the late 1970s. At trial his own barrister described him as a monster. But all this news was covered only briefly in a handful of local press articles. There was no huge scandal, no major police investigation, certainly no FA inquiry or soul searching from the clubs involved. That took another decade. In November 2016 Woodward made the decision to speak publicly about the abuse and the impact on his life. He told his story to the Guardian newspaper and the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire Programme. His testimony, sitting first on his own, then alongside a group of other survivors on national television, started something unexpected as victim after victim came forward. At the last count police forces across the country had identified 294 alleged suspects in cases involving 839 possible victims linked to football. Steve Walters talked to Victoria Derbyshire: The chairman of the FA, Greg Clarke, has called it the biggest scandal facing the game. Gary Cliffe was at work that day, checking Twitter on his phone as Andy Woodward sat in a TV studio in London alongside Steve Walters, Jason Dunford and Chris Unsworth. All four footballers were victims of Bennell, though Jason Dunford had fought him off and wasn’t sexually abused. As the updates came in, Cliffe decided he couldn’t concentrate on work. He got in his car, pulled over and watched the interview back on his phone sitting at the side of the road. “They all spoke with such dignity,” he says. “Reassurance is the wrong word but you got the idea that others are there with you and you take comfort from that. That’s what I felt.” But Cliffe couldn’t add his voice publicly at the time. By coincidence months earlier he had already contacted the police about Bennell and wanted to press charges. Barry Bennell An investigation had started and he had been asked not to speak out in the media while detectives were working on the case. This wasn’t the first time Cliffe had been in contact with the authorities. He gave a police statement in 1995 when Bennell was eventually convicted on other charges. At the same time he told his parents what had happened. Back then though he didn’t feel strong enough to take the case to court, with the possibility he might have to give evidence in front of his abuser. Now, in his mid-40s, his feelings had changed. “You get to the stage where you get older and you think, do you know what, I don’t want to have any regrets,” he says. “So I picked up that phone and made that call.” Barry Bennell So did others. After Woodward spoke out more players came forward with their accounts of what happened decades ago. Bennell was charged with another 55 counts of sexual abuse - which took place between 1979 and 1991. On 15 February 2018, after a six-week long trial at Liverpool Crown Court, he was convicted once again. He was found guilty of 43 counts of child sex abuse against another 11 boys. “My childhood was wrecked. He’s damaged me, there’s no doubt about it. I’ve been on medication for many years now, probably will be for the rest of my life,” says Cliffe. Built with Shorthand"
Council to feed children 365 days a yearNorth Lanarkshire says it is the first UK local authority to offer school meals during holidays and weekends.6h6 hours agoGlasgow & West Scotland,"North Lanarkshire will offer meals 365 days a year A Scottish council is planning to provide free meals 365 days a year to children from low income families. North Lanarkshire Council said its proposal would help tackle ""holiday hunger"". The ""Food 365"" programme would cover the 175 days of the year when lunches are not served in school. If approved, the council will run a pilot project in the spring break and could then extend the scheme over the summer holidays. Frank McNally, convener of education, said: ""These proposals to tackle weekend and holiday hunger are the most ambitious in the country. ""Groups like the Trussell Trust are struggling to cope with demand from parents and research has suggested that pressure on food banks doubles during the holidays. ""North Lanarkshire has one of the highest concentrations of deprivation in the country and this is only going to be exacerbated by further welfare reforms."" The council cited national research which suggests that almost a third of parents with incomes under Â£25,000 skip meals during the school holidays so that their children can eat, and nearly two thirds are not always able to afford food outside of term time. This rises to half and three-quarters respectively for parents with incomes under Â£15,000. Teachers report that children sometimes return from holiday suffering from poor nutrition In a survey carried out by the National Union of Teachers in England, 80% of teachers noted a rise in ""holiday hunger"" where children return from holidays suffering from poor nutrition. Almost three-quarters of teachers said this was negatively affecting children's education. While some councils in the UK have committed to holiday programmes, these do not include weekends. North Lanarkshire Council said its scheme would be the most comprehensive in the country. Mr McNally continued: ""A good diet plays a key role in healthy growth and development, supporting learning and social skills and sets a positive habit to be continued later in life. ""Our plans will do much to promote healthy eating and address some of the symptoms of poverty for children who need it most."" John Dickie of the Child Poverty Action Group warmly welcomed the proposal. But he warned it was vital to provide the meals in such a way that there was no risk of children or their families feeling stigmatised. He said: ""I haven't seen the detail of this proposal but in general terms we would welcome extension of free school meals but also stress that's it's really important that healthy free holiday lunches are offered as part of a wider package of holiday activities ""Every effort should be made to avoid the risk of stigmatising holiday provision, for example by making sure it is open to those who pay for school lunches too and isn't promoted purely as a feeding programme."" The local SNP group welcomed the proposal but said the council should not axe school breakfast clubs. SNP's education spokesman Councillor Tom Johnston said: ""I am delighted that this council has finally agreed with our position that children shouldn't go hungry simply because the schools are closed for holidays."" He said SNP proposals to introduce the policy in 2003 had been blocked by the Labour administration. ""The SNP will support this proposal but we will amend it to go further and reverse the Labour decision to cut breakfast clubs from this summer,"" he added. ""Our proposal will commit this council not only to continuing breakfast clubs, but extending them from August to cover every primary school in North Lanarkshire."" The Scottish government said tackling poverty and inequality was a ""key priority"". A spokesman added: ""Our Â£1m a year Fair Food Fund supports projects which promote sustainable solutions to food poverty. ""In addition, local authorities also have the flexibility to provide meals to children outwith term time and some chose to use this flexibility during school holidays by providing holiday lunch clubs."" Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith MSP said: ""Delivering free school meals for low income families for every day of the year may be a noble objective but it is undoubtedly expensive if each child is to have a nutritious meal. ""Hopefully the council has carefully considered all its options and explained to parents how it will be paying for this service."" North Lanarkshire is one of the nine ""challenge authorities"" in Scotland with the highest levels of deprivation. Nearly 21% of children live in low income households. If the pilot is successful, the programme would be delivered in 23 ""hubs"" across the authority area, usually in community facilities. Based on demand for other previous holiday initiatives, the cost is estimated to be Â£500,000. The proposals will be discussed by councillors at a meeting of the education committee on 20 February.

Britain's bus coverage hits 28-year low,"This video can not be played A group of people in the Yorkshire Dales decided to drive their own buses Britain's bus network has shrunk to levels last seen in the late 1980s, BBC analysis has revealed. Rising car use and cuts to public funding are being blamed for a loss of 134 million miles of coverage over the past decade alone. Some cut-off communities have taken to starting their own services, with Wales and north-west England hardest hit. The government has encouraged councils and bus companies to work together to halt the decline. One lobbying group fears the scale of the miles lost are a sign buses are on course to be cut to the same extent railways were in the 1960s. During that decade thousands of miles of track were scrapped and hundreds of stations closed following a report by British Railways Board chairman Dr Richard Beeching. Chris Todd, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ""We are not talking a loss of that level, but we are heading that way. ""We live in a society that is quite prepared to completely abandon certain groups of people and leave them with no options of getting around."" Communities around the UK say the shrinking bus network is leaving people unable to reach basic services such as shops and GP surgeries. In Chard in Somerset, mother Melissa Whittaker told the BBC how a 10-mile journey to take her autistic son Issac to their nearest community hospital can take three hours, the same time it would take to walk. Villagers in Ditton Priors, Shropshire, who have not had a regular bus service since 2012, say some elderly residents have been forced to move away. And some cut-off communities have even gone as far as setting up their own replacement bus services. Cumbria's Western Dales Bus company runs its routes with the help of 20 volunteer drivers. The Western Dales Bus company relies on National Lottery funding One of its directors, John Carey, said the National Lottery-funded company was a lifeline for hundreds in the county. He said: ""Without this people would have been cut off, absolutely. ""They wouldn't have been able to go to the shops. It has preserved the mobility of elderly residents in the area."" Although car use is at an all-time high, buses remain Britain's most popular form of public transport. But analysis of official statistics by the BBC Shared Data Unit found the UK's bus network has shrunk by 8% in the last decade. That equates to 134 million fewer miles - the equivalent of more than 5,000 trips around the equator. Passenger numbers have increased marginally (0.7%) over the same period. Dr John Disney, an academic specialising in transport There are a number of reasons why Britain's bus network is shrinking in size, according to John Disney, a transport researcher and lecturer at Nottingham Business School. He said: ""Commercial operators have definitely, over the last 10 years, become much more risk-averse and so they are really concentrating on what they consider to be their core routes and are not really bothered about much else."" He said at the same time many local authorities, which would have stepped up to subsidise unprofitable routes, have reduced this spending. But the trade body for operators, the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT), denied the claim that companies were becoming risk-averse. A spokeswoman said: ""Where routes become unviable, sound business decisions need to be taken and there are many examples of operators continuing to operate lightly used and uneconomic services, or developing innovative ways of meeting passengers' needs."" In England, the scale of the bus network has fallen to levels last seen in 1991, even though passenger numbers are now 8% higher than they were then. The figures show big regional variations, with the North West the worst-hit, losing nearly a quarter (23%) of miles from its network in a decade. London, the East of England and the South East, on the other hand, were the only English regions to see bus mileage increase over the past decade. A quarter of all journeys driven by English buses now take place in London The capital now accounts for a quarter of all bus miles travelled in England, the highest proportion since this measurement began in 1982. This has prompted campaigners to describe England's public transport system as ""two-tier"". Outside the capital, England's metropolitan areas were hardest hit, which experts believe is linked to increasing congestion. The bus coverage in metropolitan areas has dropped by a tenth since 2013-14 alone, figures show, while rural areas saw bus routes cut by 7.8%. Wales has seen the biggest drop in bus coverage over the past decade. Annual bus mileage fell by a fifth between 2006-07 and 2016-17, a loss of 15 million miles. Experts suggest the slump in Wales could be down to a succession of bus companies going into administration in recent years. A spokesman for the Welsh government said the figures do not reflect growth on some local services and the longer distance TrawsCymru network of buses. Scotland's network shrank by 15% over the past decade. The Scottish region hit hardest was South West and Strathclyde, which saw bus mileage fall by more than a fifth in 10 years. Only one Scottish region saw bus mileage increase: North East, Tayside and Central, which covers Dundee and Aberdeen. Northern Ireland's bus network is publicly-run. It covers 6.4% fewer miles a year than it did ten years ago, a loss of 2.6 million miles. Tom Daley announces baby news Swift lyric too 'banal' to copyright Lions eat suspected big cat poacher Crypto-cash craze 'hinders alien search' Most of Britain's bus network is provided by commercial companies, although local government can subsidise routes which are deemed unprofitable but socially important. Many campaigners say the shrinking pot of funding available for these subsidies is a major contributor to the decline of Britain's buses. However, the BBC's analysis shows subsidy cuts are only part of the picture. Excluding London, all English regions have seen bus subsidies reduced in the past four years, losing a third (32%) of their subsidised miles on average. But at the same time, bus companies have also been reducing the number of commercially-run miles in the North, while increasing them in the South, the analysis shows. In Brighton and Hove, for instance, its bus network appears to be thriving, despite only 3% of miles now being paid for by the council. Some areas have seen public sector investment pay off. In Nottingham, which has the third highest bus use per head of population in England, passengers can travel with a range of different companies using a Robin Hood card. But the authority there also spends more on buses each year than the whole of Tyne and Wear, which has four times the population. The Local Government Association has said councils could do more to prop up transport routes if they had more Whitehall funding. Its transport spokesman Chris Tett said the shrinking of Britain's bus network was ""hugely concerning"". The government has given English 'metro mayors' new powers to set up Transport for London-style bus franchise systems. It means they could set the routes and timetables for their areas and invite companies to bid to run them. The Bus Services Act 2017 also aims to get local authorities and bus companies in other areas of England to work in partnership to improve services. A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: ""Buses connect people, homes and businesses, and that's why we have given councils extra powers to work in partnership with bus companies to improve the service passengers expect and deserve.""

"Don't ignore prison inspectors, jails warned","Prison inspectors said living conditions in Liverpool jail were the worst they had ever seen Prison inspectors need more funding to hold the government and prison bosses to account when jails have ""urgent and serious failings"", MPs have said. A Justice Committee report comes afterthe BBC revealed the appalling conditions at Liverpool Prison. The MPs pointed out that inspectors had made recommendations in 2015 but it ""did not result in improvements"". Chief inspector Peter Clarke said too many prisons failed to take inspection reports seriously. He described this as an ""abject failure"" that ""must stop"". The MPs report focused primarily on Liverpool Prison but warned the jail was ""not unique"", adding that its problems were ""symptomatic of shortcomings evident across the prison estate"". Key recommendations from the report include: additional funds for HMIP to hold prisons to account when they do not achieve recommendations greater scrutiny of major contracts at prisons and penalties for providers who fail to meet their obligations for the Ministry of Justice and HM Prison and Probation Service to publish a plan to resolve persistent overcrowding (71 of 116 UK prisons are currently overcrowded) This video can not be played Chief inspector of prisons criticises on Today management of prisons ""at all levels"" An inspection in September 2017 found rats and cockroaches were rife at Liverpool Prison, with one area of the jail so dirty, infested and hazardous it could not be cleaned. Some prisoners were kept for more than 22 hours a day in cells that should be condemned, said inspectors, with exposed electrical wiring and filthy, leaking lavatories. A 2015 inspection led to 89 recommendations, but only 22 had been fully implemented two years later. There were also more than 2,000 outstanding maintenance jobs atthe prison, which had its healthcare budget cut last month. The Justice Committee said national, regional and local management had all failed in their oversight of the prison. Mr Neill added: ""It is clear that HMIP require additional resources so they can make sure that their recommendations are properly acted upon."" Inspectors found cockroaches and rats at HMP Liverpool How Liverpool prison became UK's 'worst jail' Liverpool jail's severely ill inmates at substantial risk, says psychiatrist HMP Liverpool: 'Squalid' jail's maintenance jobs doubled A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Ministers have been absolutely clear that conditions at HMP Liverpool were unacceptable and we will not stand for them. ""We want to be held accountable when failings persist, which is why Ministers introduced the Urgent Notification process - demanding the Secretary of State introduce tough measures to improve failing prisons."" Head of the prison service Michael Spurr told the committee there was ""a failure at local level to follow through on the recommendations [made by HMIP in 2015]"". He added: ""I accept that from an organisational perspective we did not have enough robust governance above establishment level to make sure that [the recommendations made in 2015] were being delivered properly."" Liverpool Prison's new governor Pia Sinha told the committee she had ""initiated a deep clean of all external areas"" and had increased the number of prisoners cleaning.

Lecturers want 'radical' fee review,"University staff are calling for a ""radical"" overhaul of tuition fees and higher education funding in England in a review of student finance. Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, says the review must be more than ""tinkering at the edges"". The review, to be formally announced in the next few days, follows a promise by the prime minister to examine the cost of university. Theresa May said the review would show ""we have listened and we have learned"". Ms Hunt, whose members are threatening strike action next week in a pensions dispute, says there needs to be a ""fundamental look at university funding"". ""Too often recent reviews have simply resulted in finding new ways to saddle students with record levels of debt,"" said Ms Hunt. The system of student fees and loans should be based on an assumption that ""higher education is a public good,"" she said. The fees review, expected to be announced by the prime minister and Education Secretary Damian Hinds, will consider cutting or freezing Â£9,250 fees and lowering interest rates of up to 6.1% for repayments. There will also be discussion of funding for vocational courses and apprenticeships to tackle skills shortages. But universities are concerned about a loss of funding - and Ms Hunt said that businesses should be asked to make a ""fairer contribution"" to the cost of higher education. The Russell Group of leading universities has warned that any changes to fees and funding should not mean a limit on places. ""Finding the right balance is likely to involve making a series of difficult trade-offs,"" said a spokesman for the university group. The Russell Group said that the funding model that emerges from the review needs to give universities a ""predictable and sustainable"" income - as well as fees that reflect the benefits to students from having a degree. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said he was concerned the review would focus too much on tuition fees and not ""spend enough time on things like part-time funding and students' cost of living"". The review will examine how the level of fees and student debt can be balanced with the benefits of having a degree. Former education ministers Justine Greening, Lord Willetts and Charles Clarke have called for the restoration of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students and have raised concerns over the level of interest charges. Lord Adonis, another former education minister, has called for fees to be scrapped entirely. A study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that the increase in fees to Â£9,250 and interest rates of up to 6.1% has pushed average student debt on graduation to more than Â£50,000. Next week a number of university leaders and representatives will face a select committee inquiry into whether higher education is delivering ""value for money"". The Labour Party has been calling for a complete scrapping of tuition fees. A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We will be conducting a major review of funding across tertiary education to ensure a joined-up system that works for everyone. Further details will be set out shortly."" Day of reckoning for tuition fees? 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees Will tuition fees be scrapped or saved by university review?

Women may get ovarian cancer risk from dads,"US scientists believe they have identified a new gene mutation that can raise the risk of ovarian cancer, and is passed from father to daughter. It is inherited through the X-chromosome and is independent of other known susceptibility genes that women can already be tested for. Experts say more studies are needed to confirm the identity and function of the gene. The latest findings appear in the journalPLoS Genetics,external. Currently, women with a strong family history of cancer can be tested for the BRCA gene, which greatly increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Angelina Jolie inherited BRCA1 from her mother- she had preventative surgery after her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. Butresearchers,externalbelieve there may be many other cases of seemingly sporadic ovarian cancer that are actually inherited - some via the X chromosome girls get from their father. Angelina Jolie had her first preventative surgery in 2013 Men pass on one X chromosome to their daughters. Dr Kevin Eng and colleagues at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute honed in on one suspect gene, called MAGEC3, located on the X chromosome from fathers. Ovarian cancers linked to genes inherited from the father (and paternal grandmother) had an earlier age-of-onset than ones linked to maternal genes, and were also associated with higher rates of prostate cancer in fathers and sons. Lead author Kevin Eng from the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Buffalo, New York said: ""What we have to do next is make sure we have the right gene by sequencing more families. This finding has sparked a lot of discussion within our group about how to find these X-linked families. ""It's an all-or-none kind of pattern:  A family with three daughters who all have ovarian cancer is more likely to be driven by inherited X mutations than by BRCA mutations."" Most women in the UK have a one in 54 chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetime, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that help repair damage to the DNA in our cells. If people inherit a mutated version of either of these genes it puts them at greater risk of certain cancers. BRCA 1 mutation gives women a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of 40-50%. If women know they have BRCA gene mutations, they can choose to take action before cancer develops. Angelina Jolie had her fallopian tubes and ovaries removedwhen she found she had BRCA1 Dr Catherine Pickworth from Cancer Research UK said: ""This research suggests that some women's risk of ovarian cancer could be passed down through their father's family, as well as their mother's, due to newly discovered faulty genes. ""In future, this could help women with a family history of ovarian cancer better understand their risk of developing the disease. This is important because ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage when it's harder to treat. Further work is now needed to get a clearer picture of how the genetic faults uncovered in this research might affect inherited risk of ovarian cancer."" Annwen Jones, Chief Executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said: ""These findings, if borne out by further research, would represent a significant step forward in ovarian cancer prevention, saving thousands of lives"".

"Women doctors lose out in NHS pay stakesThe best paid male consultant pocketed Â£740,000 last year - two-and-a-half times that of the top woman.","Senior NHS female doctors are earning less than their male counterparts, a BBC investigation shows. Of the top 100 earning consultants in England, just five are women, despite more than a third of the workforce being female. The top-paid man earned nearly Â£740,000 - two-and-a-half times that of the top woman. On average, full-time women consultants earned nearly Â£14,000 a year less than men - a pay gap of 12%. Senior female doctors described the findings as ""disappointing"" and said it showed more needs to be done to tackle the gender pay gap in medicine. The figures were obtained by the BBC following requests to individual health trusts, the government and NHS Digital. The top earning male consultant in England earned Â£739,460 in 2016-17 The best paid woman got Â£281,616 by comparison On average, full-time men in England earned Â£127,683, nearly Â£14,000 more than full-time women When you strip out overtime and bonuses and just look at basic pay there was nearly Â£1,500 difference Six-and-a-half times as many men as women in England and Wales get the top platinum award bonus worth Â£77,000 a year In Northern Ireland the gap between men and women's gross earnings was over Â£8,000 Some doctors the BBC spoke to said some of the difference was probably down to the fact men were more likely to do overtime. But they said it was clear some of the gap was unfair with the system of bonuses and awards weighted in favour of men. Dr Anthea Mowat, of the British Medical Association, said despite recent progress on gender pay, the figures obtained by the BBC showed there was ""clearly still a long way to go"". She said women needed more support, including leadership training, mentoring and more flexible working opportunities. ""With women making up the majority of medical graduates in recent years, it's vitally important that we address the root causes of the gender pay gap, and develop a wider programme of work to eliminate it across the medical workforce,"" she added. Dr Jacky Davis, a radiologist and former chair of the NHS Consultants Association, said she was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the figures. ""Some of it we can explain - men are more likely to do overtime for example - but that doesn't account for it all.  In my experience men are better at pushing for more money, putting the case for awards and they get them."" Dr Sally Davies, of the Medical Woman's Federation, agreed. ""We need to do more to support women. They often fall behind when they have children and have to take time off. ""By the time they get to the point where overtime is available or the awards are being handed out they find themselves behind men. It's a serious problem."" Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said: ""This appears to be a long-term and serious problem within the medical workforce which the government, the profession and employers are committed to resolving."" He said one of the causes was the consultants' contract - in the past it has been argued it allows high premiums to be charged for overtime and creates a bonus system that is skewed. The government and BMA are currently in negotiations about the future of the contract. The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We are committed to ensuring that our hardworking doctors are rewarded fairly and equally for their work â regardless of gender â and have commissioned an independent report alongside the medical profession to examine exactly how that can be achieved.""

"Australia PM 'inept', own deputy says","Malcolm Turnbull and Barnaby Joyce at a press conference in 2016 Australian Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce has sharply criticised the nation's leader, Malcolm Turnbull, in an escalation of tensions that have rocked the government. On Thursday, Mr Turnbull admonished Mr Joyce for making a ""shocking error"" over his affair with a former staffer - saying it had set off a ""world of woe"". It prompted thePM to officially ban sex between ministers and their staff. Mr Joyce said Mr Turnbull's remarks were ""inept"" and ""unnecessary"". ""In many instances, they caused further harm,"" said Mr Joyce, who leads junior coalition party the Nationals. The opposition party, Labor, said the Liberal-Nationals coalition was ""in crisis"". Mr Joyce said he would try to repair his relationship with Mr Turnbull, but again stared down calls to resign. Mr Turnbull has repeatedly said Mr Joyce's future is a decision for the Nationals, most of whom have publicly backed their leader. Mr Joyce's relationship with his former media adviser, Vikki Campion, has raised several politically damaging questions since it was revealed last week. The scandal threatening Australia's deputy PM Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent It's just two months since Barnaby Joyce and Malcolm Turnbull posed in matching plaid shirts as they celebrated ""getting the band back together"" after Mr Joyce's by-election victory. It looks like the band has struck some musical differences. Mr Joyce clearly didn't like being openly castigated by the PM over his extramarital affair, and so has gone on the attack. As the leaders of different parties within a coalition, you would expect a little friction from time to time. But by engaging in some very public name-calling, the pair have given the opposition plenty of ammunition for the days and weeks ahead. On Thursday, Mr Turnbull said Mr Joyce's affair had caused ""terrible hurt and humiliation"" to his estranged wife Natalie Joyce, their four daughters and Ms Campion. Mr Joyce said on Friday: ""I would not wish on friend nor foe the hurt, the scrutiny, the intense intrusion into your life that I have gone through [in] this process."" Mr Joyce says the PM's criticism of his affair was unnecessary Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten said the government was ""eating itself alive"", and called on Mr Turnbull to sack Mr Joyce immediately. ""When the two most senior leaders of the government hate each other and are criticising each other, the people of Australia's interests are not being served,"" Mr Shorten said. Mr Turnbull technically has the power to sack Mr Joyce, but such a move would be politically untenable, said Australian Broadcasting Corp election analyst Antony Green. ""It's very difficult for the prime minister to sack him without breaking the coalition agreement,"" he said. The coalition has only a one-seat majority in the House of Representatives. Mr Joyce has faced scrutiny over the timing of two jobs offered to Ms Campion within the Nationals last year, and whether he sought a gift of free housing from a businessman. Mr Joyce denies ministerial standards were broken in either case. He will take a week of leave from Monday, meaning he will not be acting prime minister when Mr Turnbull conducts a visit to the US. Mr Joyce had only returned to parliament in December after briefly losing his job over his New Zealand dual citizenship.

Council to feed children 365 days a year,"North Lanarkshire will offer meals 365 days a year A Scottish council is planning to provide free meals 365 days a year to children from low income families. North Lanarkshire Council said its proposal would help tackle ""holiday hunger"". The ""Food 365"" programme would cover the 175 days of the year when lunches are not served in school. If approved, the council will run a pilot project in the spring break and could then extend the scheme over the summer holidays. Frank McNally, convener of education, said: ""These proposals to tackle weekend and holiday hunger are the most ambitious in the country. ""Groups like the Trussell Trust are struggling to cope with demand from parents and research has suggested that pressure on food banks doubles during the holidays. ""North Lanarkshire has one of the highest concentrations of deprivation in the country and this is only going to be exacerbated by further welfare reforms."" The council cited national research which suggests that almost a third of parents with incomes under Â£25,000 skip meals during the school holidays so that their children can eat, and nearly two thirds are not always able to afford food outside of term time. This rises to half and three-quarters respectively for parents with incomes under Â£15,000. Teachers report that children sometimes return from holiday suffering from poor nutrition In a survey carried out by the National Union of Teachers in England, 80% of teachers noted a rise in ""holiday hunger"" where children return from holidays suffering from poor nutrition. Almost three-quarters of teachers said this was negatively affecting children's education. While some councils in the UK have committed to holiday programmes, these do not include weekends. North Lanarkshire Council said its scheme would be the most comprehensive in the country. Mr McNally continued: ""A good diet plays a key role in healthy growth and development, supporting learning and social skills and sets a positive habit to be continued later in life. ""Our plans will do much to promote healthy eating and address some of the symptoms of poverty for children who need it most."" John Dickie of the Child Poverty Action Group warmly welcomed the proposal. But he warned it was vital to provide the meals in such a way that there was no risk of children or their families feeling stigmatised. He said: ""I haven't seen the detail of this proposal but in general terms we would welcome extension of free school meals but also stress that's it's really important that healthy free holiday lunches are offered as part of a wider package of holiday activities ""Every effort should be made to avoid the risk of stigmatising holiday provision, for example by making sure it is open to those who pay for school lunches too and isn't promoted purely as a feeding programme."" The local SNP group welcomed the proposal but said the council should not axe school breakfast clubs. SNP's education spokesman Councillor Tom Johnston said: ""I am delighted that this council has finally agreed with our position that children shouldn't go hungry simply because the schools are closed for holidays."" He said SNP proposals to introduce the policy in 2003 had been blocked by the Labour administration. ""The SNP will support this proposal but we will amend it to go further and reverse the Labour decision to cut breakfast clubs from this summer,"" he added. ""Our proposal will commit this council not only to continuing breakfast clubs, but extending them from August to cover every primary school in North Lanarkshire."" The Scottish government said tackling poverty and inequality was a ""key priority"". A spokesman added: ""Our Â£1m a year Fair Food Fund supports projects which promote sustainable solutions to food poverty. ""In addition, local authorities also have the flexibility to provide meals to children outwith term time and some chose to use this flexibility during school holidays by providing holiday lunch clubs."" Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith MSP said: ""Delivering free school meals for low income families for every day of the year may be a noble objective but it is undoubtedly expensive if each child is to have a nutritious meal. ""Hopefully the council has carefully considered all its options and explained to parents how it will be paying for this service."" North Lanarkshire is one of the nine ""challenge authorities"" in Scotland with the highest levels of deprivation. Nearly 21% of children live in low income households. If the pilot is successful, the programme would be delivered in 23 ""hubs"" across the authority area, usually in community facilities. Based on demand for other previous holiday initiatives, the cost is estimated to be Â£500,000. The proposals will be discussed by councillors at a meeting of the education committee on 20 February.

Mid-earners 'locked out of buying a home'The biggest decline in homeownership in the last 20 years has been among middle-income 25 to 34-year-olds.4h4 hours agoBusiness,"The extent to which young people are locked out of the British housing market has been revealed in new figures from economists. The biggest decline in home ownership in the last 20 years has been among middle-income 25 to 34-year-olds, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. In 1995-96, 65% of this group owned a home, but just 27% do in 2015-16, with the biggest drop in south-east England. Your biggest financial decision - in charts First-time buyers 'at 11-year-high' Middle earners are defined as having take-home pay of Â£22,200 to Â£30,600. This can be either as an individual or as a couple. A third of them are university graduates, while 30% left school at 16. Three-quarters of them live with a partner, and around 60% have children. The proportion of these middle earners owning a home (27%) has moved closer to the likelihood of those with a low income (8%) than those on a high income (64%). This video can not be played Tom Bourlet says buying a home ""seems beyond reach"" Tom Bourlet pays Â£535 per month to rent a room in a flat in central Brighton. ""I've been renting it for two-and-a-half years. It really is money down the drain,"" the 30-year-old says. ""I don't really see much for it - it's not the biggest room."" The location is handy for work, and is close to the railway station, but Mr Bourlet would prefer to have somewhere ""to be proud of, and build up myself"", he adds. However, buying somewhere is ""completely beyond budget at the moment"". ""It's absolute Mission Impossible,"" he says. ""From rent, to paying for trains... all the utility bills keep shooting up. I mean, I'm nowhere near, I'm not even slightly close. I'm saving every month, but the deposit is so high that it just seems beyond reach at the moment."" Andrew Hood, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: ""Home ownership among young adults has collapsed over the past 20 years, particularly for those on middle incomes. ""The reason for this is that house prices have risen around seven times faster in real terms than the incomes of young adults over the last two decades."" Property price rises were significant in the South East of England. As a result, the region has seen the proportion of homeowners among 25 to 34-year-olds fall from 64% to 32% in two decades. This video can not be played Want to buy a house? Under 25? Watch this Every region of Britain had seen a 10 percentage point drop over the same period, the IFS said. This will lead to some tough decisions for today's 20 to 30-somethings, according to Iona Bain, founder of the Young Money blog. ""It is really hard to see how we can make this better when we are still seeing a huge demand for housing and that housing demand is not being met with the right number of houses,"" she said. ""Individuals are having to decide for themselves: do I want to rent and have the flexibility but pay more for it, or do I want make a lot of difficult decisions to get on the property ladder sooner and potentially stay put for many, many years to come?"" Housing minister Dominic Raab said that schemes such as Help to Buy and the removal of stamp duty for most first-time buyers had helped people to buy their first home. He also said that Â£45m would be invested into community projects that would help kick-start the building of thousands of new homes. John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said: ""This research should be a wake-up call for Conservative ministers. After almost eight years of failure on housing, the government is still failing to tackle the fundamental problems with our broken housing market."" He said a Labour government would build 100,000 first-buy homes. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

"'Three Billboards' stunt for Grenfell TowerThe demonstration was inspired by Oscar-nominated film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.10h10 hours agoUK","The banners were inspired by those featured in the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Three large billboards demanding justice following the Grenfell Tower fire have been driven through London by campaigners. Group Justice 4 Grenfell hired three vans with adverts which read: ""71 dead. And still no arrests? How come?"" The banners were inspired by those featured in the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The Metropolitan Police said its investigation into the fire was ongoing and no arrests had been made. Yvette Williams, one of the organisers, said there were fears the tragedy was ""ebbing out of public consciousness"". The stunt was organised by group Justice 4 Grenfell Wednesday marked eight months since last year's 14 June fire at the 24-storey tower block,which killed 71 people. A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower Who were the victims? What has happened to the donations? The three red and black billboards were paraded through London from 07:00 GMT on Thursday, passing by sites including the Houses of Parliament, London Bridge and St Paul's Cathedral. Ms Williams, 52, who lives in West Kensington and co-founded the Justice 4 Grenfell group, said the campaigners were approached by a creative advertising agency, which had the idea to copy the Oscar-nominated film. The billboards were inspired by those in the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri The movie, which stars Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson, tells the story of a mother who pays for three billboards to demand answers into her daughter's unsolved murder. Ms Williams said: ""When I watched the film, one of the things that stood out for me was that it's really important to keep an issue around justice in the public eye. The three red and black billboards were driven around London, including through Westminster ""We felt that it was really powerful. Over the last few weeks we felt what happened is ebbing out of the public consciousness and people are becoming desensitised."" Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick has previously said the force would do ""whatever it takes"" to bring justice to anyone who had committed a criminal offence linked to the fire.

Ovarian cancer link to paternal genes,"US scientists believe they have identified a new gene mutation that can raise the risk of ovarian cancer, and is passed from father to daughter. It is inherited through the X-chromosome and is independent of other known susceptibility genes that women can already be tested for. Experts say more studies are needed to confirm the identity and function of the gene. The latest findings appear in the journalPLoS Genetics,external. Currently, women with a strong family history of cancer can be tested for the BRCA gene, which greatly increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Angelina Jolie inherited BRCA1 from her mother- she had preventative surgery after her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. Butresearchers,externalbelieve there may be many other cases of seemingly sporadic ovarian cancer that are actually inherited - some via the X chromosome girls get from their father. Angelina Jolie had her first preventative surgery in 2013 Men pass on one X chromosome to their daughters. Dr Kevin Eng and colleagues at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute honed in on one suspect gene, called MAGEC3, located on the X chromosome from fathers. Ovarian cancers linked to genes inherited from the father (and paternal grandmother) had an earlier age-of-onset than ones linked to maternal genes, and were also associated with higher rates of prostate cancer in fathers and sons. Lead author Kevin Eng from the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Buffalo, New York said: ""What we have to do next is make sure we have the right gene by sequencing more families. This finding has sparked a lot of discussion within our group about how to find these X-linked families. ""It's an all-or-none kind of pattern:  A family with three daughters who all have ovarian cancer is more likely to be driven by inherited X mutations than by BRCA mutations."" Most women in the UK have a one in 54 chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetime, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that help repair damage to the DNA in our cells. If people inherit a mutated version of either of these genes it puts them at greater risk of certain cancers. BRCA 1 mutation gives women a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of 40-50%. If women know they have BRCA gene mutations, they can choose to take action before cancer develops. Angelina Jolie had her fallopian tubes and ovaries removedwhen she found she had BRCA1 Dr Catherine Pickworth from Cancer Research UK said: ""This research suggests that some women's risk of ovarian cancer could be passed down through their father's family, as well as their mother's, due to newly discovered faulty genes. ""In future, this could help women with a family history of ovarian cancer better understand their risk of developing the disease. This is important because ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage when it's harder to treat. Further work is now needed to get a clearer picture of how the genetic faults uncovered in this research might affect inherited risk of ovarian cancer."" Annwen Jones, Chief Executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said: ""These findings, if borne out by further research, would represent a significant step forward in ovarian cancer prevention, saving thousands of lives"".

Bannon questioned in Russia investigation,"Mr Bannon photographed during his arrival at the House intelligence committee earlier today President Donald Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has been interviewed as part of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He met with special counsel Robert Mueller, who leads the inquiry, over two days this week. Mr Bannon was chairman of Mr Trump's presidential campaign before becoming a top White House official. But he left his post in August amid reports of tension with other aides. Mr Mueller is leading an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the US election. Both Moscow and Mr Trump deny this. All you need to know about Trump Russia story The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Investigators believe Mr Bannon may hold crucial information on the Trump administration, including details on why former FBI Director James Comey was fired by the president. Mr Comey has previously said he has ""no doubt"" that he was fired by Mr Trump to ""change"" the Russia investigation, a charge the White House denies. It is not clear what Mr Bannon was questioned about, but he is reported to have spent around 20 hours speaking with Mr Mueller's team. A source close to the process though told the Associated Press thatMr Bannon answered every question put to him,external. Robert Mueller is investigating possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign This inquiry is running alongside four similar ones being conducted by politicians in Congress, and Mr Bannon spoke to one of them on Thursday. He appeared in front of the House intelligence committee as part of their own, separate, investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he frustrated the committee when he refused to answer their questions, opting instead to answer 25 pre-written questions that had been approved by the White House. The dates that define Steve Bannon's sharp rise and fall It led top Democrats to call for contempt proceedings against Mr Bannon. ""There was a refusal to answer any questions that would have brought out the full facts. That is not how privilege works. That's how stonewalling works,"" the panel's Democratic leader Adam Schiff said. In a tweet, Democratic member Joaquin Castro also accused Mr Bannon of stonewalling. Allow Twitter content?

Republican Representative Mike Conaway said members of the panel were unhappy with Mr Bannon's responses. ""He did not answer all the questions we'd like answered, so there was frustration among committee members with respect to that,"" he said. It is not the first time Mr Bannon has been criticised by the panel. He voluntarily met with the same committee in January and refused to answer their questions over a 10-hour period. The committee then issued a subpoena compelling him to return for a second time.

"'Three Billboards' stunt for Grenfell TowerThe demonstration was inspired by Oscar-nominated film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.9h9 hours agoUK","The banners were inspired by those featured in the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Three large billboards demanding justice following the Grenfell Tower fire have been driven through London by campaigners. Group Justice 4 Grenfell hired three vans with adverts which read: ""71 dead. And still no arrests? How come?"" The banners were inspired by those featured in the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The Metropolitan Police said its investigation into the fire was ongoing and no arrests had been made. Yvette Williams, one of the organisers, said there were fears the tragedy was ""ebbing out of public consciousness"". The stunt was organised by group Justice 4 Grenfell Wednesday marked eight months since last year's 14 June fire at the 24-storey tower block,which killed 71 people. A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower Who were the victims? What has happened to the donations? The three red and black billboards were paraded through London from 07:00 GMT on Thursday, passing by sites including the Houses of Parliament, London Bridge and St Paul's Cathedral. Ms Williams, 52, who lives in West Kensington and co-founded the Justice 4 Grenfell group, said the campaigners were approached by a creative advertising agency, which had the idea to copy the Oscar-nominated film. The billboards were inspired by those in the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri The movie, which stars Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson, tells the story of a mother who pays for three billboards to demand answers into her daughter's unsolved murder. Ms Williams said: ""When I watched the film, one of the things that stood out for me was that it's really important to keep an issue around justice in the public eye. The three red and black billboards were driven around London, including through Westminster ""We felt that it was really powerful. Over the last few weeks we felt what happened is ebbing out of the public consciousness and people are becoming desensitised."" Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick has previously said the force would do ""whatever it takes"" to bring justice to anyone who had committed a criminal offence linked to the fire. The Grenfell Tower Inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, was formally opened in September last year. Thesecond procedural hearing will take place on 21 and 22 March,externalto review its progress. Reality Check: What has happened to the Grenfell donations?

"Transgender woman 'breastfeeds baby'She was able to produce enough milk to be the baby's only food for the first six weeks, a study says.10h10 hours agoHealth","A transgender woman has been able to breastfeed a baby in the first recorded case of its kind, researchers say. The 30-year-old wanted to breastfeed after her pregnant partner said she did not want to do it herself,according to the Transgender Health journal,external. She was able to breastfeed after taking a course of drugs and breast pumping, the US case report said. A UK expert said the ""exciting"" research could lead to more cases of transgender women breastfeeding. Paying mothers can 'incentivise breastfeeding' UK 'world's worst' at breastfeeding Transgender people face two-year wait The woman had been on hormone replacement therapy for six years, but had not gender reassignment surgery, when she approached doctors with the aim of breastfeeding the child. Before the baby was born, doctors put her on a three-and-a-half-month course of treatment to help her artificially produce milk, usually given to women who have adopted babies or who have them via surrogates. This included breast pumping, taking hormones produced by biological mothers, a drug which can stimulate milk production and a male hormone blocker. As a result, the woman was able to produce a ""modest but functional"" amount of breast milk - some 8oz a day. Researchers said this was the baby's only source of nutrition for its first six weeks, during which time her growth, feeding and bowel habits were ""developmentally appropriate"". After this, the baby also started having formula milk because not enough breast milk was being produced. The baby is now six months old and she continues to be breastfed as part of her diet, the study's authors said. Researchers said further investigation was needed to determine the optimal treatment for transgender women wishing to breastfeed Dr Channa Jayasena, a senior lecturer at Imperial College who specialises in reproductive endocrinology, said the research was an ""exciting development"". He said he had heard of a few cases in the UK of transgender women being helped to breastfeed, but until now no report has been published. Dr Jayasena added: ""What we really need to do is pool together these cases and share our knowledge, to find the best recipe for breastfeeding in these patients without exposing them to any health risks."" The researchers said it was not clear whether all of the medications used in the woman's treatment were necessary to achieve lactation. They said further investigation was needed to determine the optimal treatment for transgender women wishing to breastfeed.
