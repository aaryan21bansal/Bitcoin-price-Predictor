Hammond promises ÃÂ£26bn 'deal dividend',"The chancellor has pledged to spend a Â£26.6bn Brexit war chest to boost the economy, if MPs vote to leave the European Union with a deal. Philip Hammond vowed to free up more money to help end austerity in a ""deal dividend"". However, he said tax cuts and spending risesdepended on a smooth Brexit. Mr Hammond used hisSpring Statementto warn that a disorderly Brexit would deal a ""significant"" blow to economic activity in the short term. He said the decision by MPs to reject Theresa May's Brexit deal for a second time had left a ""cloud of uncertainty hanging over our economy"". The latest figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that the UK economy will grow at the slowest pace since the financial crisis this year. The OBR cut its 2019 growth forecast to 1.2%, the weakest growth rate since 2009. That is a significant cut from the 1.6% expansion predicted by the government's economic watchdog last October. After that growth is expected to rebound. Mr Hammond said the economy had ""defied expectations"" as wages were expected to keep growing at rates of above 3% over the next five years. He hinted that the government would have up to an extra Â£26.6 billion to spend if MPs voted to leave the EU with a deal, while still meeting self-imposed limits on government borrowing. This is almost double the Â£15.4bn estimated by the OBR in October. The statement left the forecast for GDP growth in 2020 at 1.4% and now expects the UK economy to expand by 1.6% a year in the following three years. The government is expected to borrow Â£22.8bn this financial year to plug the gap between the money it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. This is almost Â£3 billion lower than the Â£25.5bn predicted by the OBR in the October Budget. The watchdog expects the improvement in the public finances to continue in future years, helped by stronger tax receipts and lower spending on debt interest. While borrowing is expected to rise to Â£29.3bn next year, it is then predicted to fall over the next four years. Mr Hammond announced a Â£800m increase in non-NHS spending by the middle of the next decade to keep pace with inflation In January the government announced it would pump a similar amount into the NHS to maintain real-terms spending. The chancellor also said he was making an additional Â£100m available over the course of the next year to help deal with the surge in knife crime. The cash is to be used for police overtime and to fund new 'Violent Crime Reduction Units' to help respond to the increase. The NHS was the main beneficiary of planned spending increases announced in the October budget Mr Hammond is expected to set out detailed plans about how money will be allocated to different government departments beyond 2020 in a spending review starting this summer. However, changes to the way student loans are treated on the government's books will eat away at the Brexit war chest that Mr Hammond has set aside. The changes, which reflect the fact that many students will never fully repay their loans, are expected to reduce the pot of available cash by around Â£12bn this autumn. The watchdog said this would also make an ongoing aspiration of eliminating the deficit ""harder to achieve"". Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said the Chancellor could respond to the statistical shake up by changing his borrowing targets, or by tweaking other tax and spending measures. Changes to the way the Office for National Statistics treats student loans in the autumn will reduce the cash Hammond has to spend The government's fiscal rules state that it must keep borrowing, adjusted for the ups and downs of the economy, below 2% of GDP in 2020-21. The OBR said there was a 40% chance that the government would eliminate borrowing entirely by 2023/24. Mr Chote also highlighted that the OBR's forecasts were based on a smooth Brexit, with employment expected to remain steady and business investment predicted to rise. He said the economic outlook remained uncertain, with the Spring Statement sandwiched between crucial votes that will determine the UK's exit from the EU. Mr Chote said no deal would probably lead to a ""short-term shock to the economy"" which would have implications for taxes and spending. However, he said the hit to the country's longer term growth prospects and UK living standards would be a bigger concern. While Mr Chote said the government was likely to spend more money to support the economy, he said the direct effects of this on the economy were ""presently unknowable"".

Facebook services suffer widespread outages,"The Facebook ""family"" of apps was suffering issues, the company confirmed Facebook appears to be recovering from a more than 14-hour disruption to all of its products that left them mostly inaccessible across the world. The company's main social network, its two messaging apps and image-sharing site Instagram were all affected. Facebook has yet to offer an explanation for the outage. The last time Facebook had a disruption of this magnitude was in 2008, when the site had 150m users - compared with around 2.3bn monthly users today. The problems began yesterday afternoon, and only showed real signs of recovery this morning. They meant core platforms many people rely on every day to communicate were rendered mostly useless. ""We're aware that some people are currently having trouble accessing the Facebook family of apps,"" Facebook said in a statement, posted on Twitter. Facebook outages hit business owners ""We're working to resolve the issue as soon as possible."" Facebook's apps seemed to be recovering on Thursday morning, withInstagram announcing it was back,external. In response to rumours posted on other social networks, the company said the outages were not a result of a Distributed Denial of Service attack, known as DDoS - a type of cyber-attack that involves flooding a target service with extremely high volumes of traffic. An NBC News broadcaster reported the cause was related to ""overloaded"" databases.,external Estimates suggest the issue began around 16:00 GMT on Wednesday. While Facebook's main service appeared to load, users reported not being able to post. Those on Instagram were not able to refresh feeds or post new material. Facebook Messenger's desktop version did not load - but the mobile app appeared to allow the sending of some messages; however, users reported glitches with other kinds of content, such as images. WhatsApp, Facebook's other messaging app, had similar problems. Athird-party outage map suggested the problem was global,external- DownDetector monitors posts on other social networks for users mentioning a loss of service elsewhere. According to the site, areas of Europe and Asia are still reporting problems as of Thursday morning. Ongoing issues are likely to hit Facebook hard in the wallet. The company, which funds the majority of its business through advertising revenue, told Bloomberg that it was investigating ""the possibility of refunds for advertisers"". The issue also affected Facebook Workplace, the service used by businesses to communicate internally. Buenos Aires-based designer Rebecca Brooker told the BBC the interruption was having a significant impact on her firm's work. ""Facebook for personal use is fine - but what happens when we rely on large companies such as this to provide business services?"" she said. ""I'm trying to communicate with my team in New York. Facebook Workplace is our only channel for [communication] with the exception of email."" In the UK, an NHS paediatric consultant told the BBC how staff were upset not to be kept updated on a party being held for a beloved nurse who was retiring after 20 years. ""Being a working day most consultants could not make it,"" said Dr Nikhil Ganjoo. ""So I represented them - but was unable to share the retirement party pics with them as it happened."" The outage occurred against a political backdrop of legislators in the US and beyond considering whether large technology firms - not just Facebook - should be broken up. Elizabeth Warren, who is hoping to be the Democratic candidate in the next US presidential election,told the New York Times,external: ""We need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favour and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor."" On Wednesday's issue, Ms Brookeradded on Twitter,external: ""Look at what happens when we let one company control everything.

Free sanitary products promised for schools,"Amika George started campaigning on period poverty when she was 17 years old Government funding for free sanitary products in all English secondary schools and colleges has been welcomed as a ""huge step"" by campaigners. Amika George, 19, who started campaigning on period poverty two years ago, said the move would make a ""massive difference"" to girls who struggled to afford tampons and pads. But campaigners said it should also include primary schools. Chancellor Philip Hammond made the announcement in hisSpring Statement. He said the government was responding to concerns from head teachers that some girls were missing school because they could not afford sanitary products. One in 10 girls between the ages of 14 and 21 in the UK have been unable to afford sanitary products, while 49% have missed an entire day of school because of their period,according to research by Plan International,external. Last year the Scottish government announced a Â£5.2m scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities. The Treasury said the Department for Education would now develop a similar scheme for England. Is there period poverty in the UK? Surviving period poverty with 'socks and tissues' Ms George, now a student at Cambridge University, was inspired to start campaigning on the issue after reading about period poverty in the news. She said she was ""shocked"" to find out girls were missing school because of not having sanitary products. ""I was still at school myself at the time and I couldn't imagine having to deal with that,"" she said. In 2017 she started a petition calling for the government to fund free sanitary products in schools, using social media to build support for her campaign. Just a few months later she organised a protest outside Downing Street which attracted around 2,000 people. In January this year she launched alegal campaign,externalalongsidethe Red Box Project,externalandThe Pink Protest,external, arguing that period poverty was denying some girls their right to an education. Reacting to the funding announcement Ms George said it was an ""amazing first step"" and the government had ""finally taken action against period poverty"". However she said the scheme should also be available in primary schools, as some children can start menstruating as young as eight, and it should be enshrined in law to ensure future governments had a legal obligation to maintain the commitment. Amika George helped organise a protest of 2,000 people against period poverty Gemma Abbott, from the Red Box Project, which provides free sanitary products to schools across the country, agreed the announcement was a ""huge step forward"" and ""long overdue"". Ms Abbott said her organisation had been contacted by hundreds of schools asking for help to provide products for their students. Many schools relied on individual teachers to provide tampons and sanitary pads or even charged pupils because they did not have the funds to give them out for free, she said. ""Schools do their best but it's really important we relieve them of this burden,"" she added. She said some girls were forced to use toilet roll, newspaper or socks because they could not pay for sanitary products. ""The experience of being unable to access these products can affect a child's ability to reach their potential,"" she said. ""Who is going to be able to concentrate properly in lessons if you are worrying about leaking or spending your lunch money on sanitary products?"" Gemma Abbot said the announcement was ""long overdue"" Ms George said she hoped her campaign had also helped tackle the stigma around periods. ""Part of the reason period poverty hasn't been addressed is because of the taboo around the subject,"" she said. ""But now so many more people are talking about it - it's almost like there's a period revolution happening at the moment."" She said the campaign also showed the impact young people could have. ""I was literally 17 years old, doing it from my laptop in my bedroom,"" she said. ""I think it's testament to the fact that politics is really changing at the moment. ""Young people don't have to rely on MPs to start campaigns, they can do it themselves using social media.""

What is a no-deal Brexit?,"Dutch ports are preparing their customers for Brexit MPs have rejected a no-deal Brexit, in a non-binding Commons vote. What does that mean? This is not about whether Britain is leaving the European Union or not. It is written into law that the UK is leaving the EU on 29 March. Hammond calls for compromise on Brexit Brexit: What could happen next? The government has reached an agreement with the European Union that both sides say will keep Brexit disruption to a minimum. If the UK leaves under the terms of that agreement, very little will change, in the short term at least. A key part of the agreement is a 21 month ""transition period"", which kicks in the day the UK leaves. Trade will carry on roughly as it does now and citizens will continue to be able to move freely between countries as if the UK was still a member of the EU. The idea of the transition period is to allow the UK and EU to hammer out a permanent trading relationship - the prime minister has also agreed a statement on what that relationship might look like. They are worried about what will happen when the transition period comes to an end. Instead of breaking free from the EU, they fear the UK will be permanently tied to its rules, with no say in how they are made. That is because one section of the withdrawal agreement - known as the Irish backstop - would keep the UK part of a customs union with the EU, if no trade deal has been agreed. The backstop is meant to prevent the return of physical checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit. No tariffs for Irish goods going to NI The UK would sever all ties with the EU with immediate effect, with no transition period - and, therefore, no talks on a tailor-made trade deal between the UK and the EU. The UK would trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, in the same way that it does with many non-EU countries. The government fears it would cause significant disruption to businesses in the short-term, with lengthy tailbacks of lorries at the channel ports, as drivers face new checks on their cargos. Food retailers have warned of shortages of fresh produce and the NHS is stockpiling medicines, in case supplies from EU countries are interrupted. Government ministers and multinational companies with factories in the UK have also warned about the long-term impact on the British economy. Most MPs are thought to be against a no-deal Brexit for these reasons. Many who campaigned for Brexit in the 2016 referendum believe the no-deal warnings have been exaggerated and that Britain will not only survive, but thrive, if it is allowed to make a totally clean break from the EU and what they see as its burdensome regulations. They fear the UK will never be allowed to make trade deals with other countries if it ends up trapped in a customs union with the EU. And the country would also save on the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" it is set to pay to the EU under the terms of Mrs May's agreement. The 29 March exit date could slip if MPs vote to ask for an extension from the European Union - something they could do in a vote planned for Thursday. The EU may decide not to grant an extension unless the UK has a reason for it, such as deciding to hold another EU referendum, with the option of staying in the EU on the ballot paper. And the UK government could cancel Brexit altogether if it wanted to. But as things currently stand, Brexit is definitely happening. Having been comprehensively rejected twice by MPs, many think the prime minister's deal is now dead. MPs have been proposing different ideas for deals. Labour wants the UK to be in a customs union with the EU, and some Labour and Tory MPs want an even closer relationship, like the one Norway has with the EU. There were no votes on these options on Wednesday. MPs voted against proposals from a group of Conservative MPs for a ""managed no-deal"", which would see the transition period extended by a year until December 2021 to allow more time to agree a new trading relationship. However, the prime minister has indicated that she will make a third attempt to get her EU withdrawal deal through Parliament in the coming days. She has told MPs that if her deal fails again to get their backing, a lengthy delay to Brexit may be needed.

Ex-Trump chief gets 43 more months in jail,"Manafort said the case had taken everything from him US President Donald Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort has been jailed for 43 more months on charges stemming from the Russia investigation. It comes a week after the 69-year-old was given a 47-month prison sentence for fraud in a separate case. The latest sentencing arises from two conspiracy charges Manafort pleaded guilty to last year. Speaking from a wheelchair, he told the federal court in Washington DC that he wanted to apologise for his actions. In a separate development, Wednesday also saw Manafort charged in New York with residential mortgage fraud and other crimes. President Trump has the power to pardon his former aide for the federal crimes - but not for the charges brought in New York. ""I do feel badly for Paul Manafort, that I can tell you,"" Mr Trump told reporters after the sentencing on Wednesday. Asked if he was planning to pardon Manafort, the president answered: ""I have not even given it a thought, as of this moment. It's not something that's right now on my mind."" Both cases for which Manafort has been convicted stem from an inquiry into alleged Russian election meddling in the 2016 US elections. None of Manafort's charges, however, relates to allegations of collusion with Russia. Mr Trump has always denied the charge, describing the inquiry as a ""witch hunt"". Trump feels 'very bad' for jailed Manafort Trump's high-rolling campaign boss The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words Manafort's jail term is the longest handed down since the inquiry began. On Wednesday, US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced Manafort to a total of 73 months, of which 30 were to run concurrently with last week's sentence. Before sentencing, the judge said it was ""hard to overstate"" the number of lies and the amount of fraud involved. ""The defendant is not public enemy number one,"" she said. ""But he is not a victim either."" In the courtroom, Manafort said: ""I am sorry for what I have done and for all the activities that have gotten us here today. ""This case has taken everything from me already - my properties, my cash, my life insurance, trust accounts for my children and grandchildren, and even more."" Manafort pleaded guilty last September to two felony counts - conspiracy against the US and conspiracy to obstruct justice - related to his lobbying. He also agreed to co-operate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation in a deal for a possible lighter sentence. However, just two months later that plea deal collapsed as investigators said Manafort had repeatedly lied to the government. Last week, a judge in Alexandria, Virginia, sentenced Manafort to nearly four years for hiding millions of dollars of income earned by his consulting work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. That sentence was far shorter than that recommended by Mr Mueller, who had sought a minimum of 19 years. Do white-collar criminals get lighter sentences? Manafort pictured with Donald Trump at the Republican Convention in July 2016 Last August, a jury convicted him of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of failing to declare a foreign bank account. The judge, however, declared a mistrial on 10 other fraud-related charges. As well as the prison term, Manafort was ordered to pay $24m (Â£18m) in restitution and a $50,000 fine. Who's who in the Russia-Trump inquiry? Trump's biggest headache might not be Mueller Manafort served for three months as Trump's campaign chairman until August 2016, when he was forced to resign over his previous work in Ukraine. He was the first former Trump aide to be arrested in the special counsel investigation, in October 2017. Manafort's legal team had previously said he suffered from debilitating foot pain resulting from gout as a result of his incarceration.

Johnson comments on child abuse 'horrific',"Boris Johnson was speaking to radio station LBC about police numbers and investment Child sex abuse victims have criticised Boris Johnson for claiming police funding was being ""spaffed up the wall"" investigating historical allegations. The Tory MP said in an interview with LBC that ""an awful lot of police time"" was spent looking at ""historic offences and all this malarkey"". One victim, Gary Cliffe, said the comments were ""horrific"". Children's charity NSPCC said the former London mayor's remark was an ""affront to victims"". Mr Cliffe, who was a victim of Barry Bennell when the serial paedophile youth coach ran junior clubs linked to Manchester City, added: ""Mr Johnson needs educating on both child sex abuse and policing."" Man City launch abuse victim payment fund '80 coaches convicted of child sex abuse' Who is Barry Bennell? Chris Unsworth, director of the Offside Trust, the organisation set up by survivors of child sexual abuse in football in the wake of the football abuse scandal, said Mr Johnson's comments were ""ignorant, dangerous, disgraceful and unbelievably distasteful"". ""Not only has he caused untold upset and offence among survivors and their families affected by child abuse, he has failed to understand that learning mistakes from the past is critical to keeping our children today safe. ""Boris Johnson clearly has no understanding whatsoever of the issues involved. On behalf of the thousands of people impacted by child abuse we demand an apology."" Barry Bennell ran summer holiday camps in the UK - including at Butlin's SAVE Association, which was also founded by men who were victims of childhood sexual abuse, called Mr Johnson's comments ""insensitive and ill-informed"". A spokesman said: ""These investigations allow us to learn and ultimately have been successful in incarcerating some of society's most abominable monsters. ""Johnson should learn to keep his mouth well and truly shut when it comes to subjects he simply knows nothing about. Child sexual abuse is definitely one of those subjects. ""When talking about spaffing money up the wall, can I remind Johnson of the colossal amount he spent in theLondon Garden bridge fiascoor thewater cannons debacle."" Mr Johnson was speaking to the radio station about police numbers on the streets and investment. ""Keeping numbers high on the streets is certainly important. But the question is where you spend the money and where you deploy the officers,"" he said. ""One comment I would make is that I think an awful lot of the money, an awful lot of police time, now goes into these historic offences and all this malarkey - Â£60m I saw was being spaffed up the wall on some investigation into historic child abuse and all this kind of thing. ""What on earth is that going to do to protect the public now? What the people want is to see officers out on the streets doing what they signed up to do."" Mr Johnson did not make clear which investigation he was referring to, according to BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw. Our correspondent says the Â£60m figure Mr Johnson quoted roughly equates to the cost of the first four years of the child sexual abuse inquiry,which was set up in 2014 by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. Staffordshire's chief constable, Gareth Morgan, said Mr Johnson's remarks were ""wrong on so many levels"". The NSPCC said: ""Bringing child abuse perpetrators to justice is not a 'malarkey' and such crass language is an affront to victims who have suffered in silence for decades."" Rival politicians have also criticised Mr Johnson, with shadow police minister Louise Haigh tweeting: ""Could you look the victims in the eye and tell them investigating and bringing to justice those who abused them, as children, is a waste of money? You shameless, dangerous oaf."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) set upOperation Hydrant,externalin 2014 to oversee investigations of ""non-recent"" child sex abuse within institutions or by people of public prominence. Football became an area of focus in 2016 after several former players came forward publicly to tell their stories and the NSPCC set up a dedicated football abuse hotline. Subsequent police investigations have helped to convict a number of paedophiles, including Bennell, who was last yearconvicted of 43 chargesrelating to 12 former junior players between 1979 and 1990 during his time working for Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra. The Football Association has also set up an independent investigation into the issue, with FA chairman Greg Clarke calling the football child sex abuse scandal one of the biggest crises in the history of the game.

Crop top passenger 'told to cover up',"A spokesman for Thomas Cook said the airline was ""sorry"" to have upset Miss O'Connor A passenger says she was left ""shaking and upset"" when she was told to cover up on a flight. Emily O'Connor said cabin crew told her what she was wearing - a crop top and high-waisted trousers - was ""inappropriate"" and ""caused offence"". She said the manager of the Birmingham to Tenerife flight and staff surrounded her, saying she must put a jacket on.

Man killed gull for stealing his chips,"John Llewellyn-Jones is subject to a curfew between 20:00 and 08:00 for 12 weeks A man who killed a seagull when it tried to steal his chips has been ordered to serve a curfew. John Llewellyn-Jones, 64, of Bishopston Road, Cardiff, ""smashed"" the bird against a wall during a trip to Weston-super-Mare in July 2018. He denied breaching the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 but was found guilty at North Somerset Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. The RSPCA said: ""He cared more for his chips than what he did to the gull."" Mr Llewellyn-Jones was ordered to serve a 12-week curfew between the hours of 20:00 and 08:00, pay costs of Â£750 and an Â£85 victim surcharge. RSPCA inspector Simon Evans said: ""This was an unthinkable and despicable way to treat an animal. ""The gull was smashed against a wall by the man... and bystanders, including children, had to look on as the man killed the gull.""

Prosecutions 'not Bloody Sunday report aim',"Lord Saville chaired the Bloody Sunday inquiry, which looked into the events of 30 January 1972 A public inquiry into Bloody Sunday was not ""a question of prosecutions"", the judge who led it has said. Thirteen people were shot dead in Londonderry when members of the Parachute Regiment opened fire on civilians in 1972. On Thursday a decision will be made on whether or not 17 former paratroopers will be prosecuted for the killings. Lord Saville told the BBC the purpose of the inquiry he led was ""to try to find out what happened"". What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday victim awarded thousands The victims of Bloody Sunday Key findings of Saville Report The events of 30 January 1972 became one of the most infamous incidents in the history of The Troubles. Thirteen people were killed and 15 injured on January 30, 1972, when troops fired more than 100 times as trouble broke out at a civil rights march. One of the injured died five months later, but the Saville Inquiry said it was ""not the result of any of the wounds he sustained on Bloody Sunday"". The Saville Inquiry was set up in April 1998 and lasted for 12 years. It cost about Â£200m, making it the longest and most expensive public inquiry in British legal history, and led to then Prime Minister David Cameronapologising to the Bloody Sunday families. He said the killings were ""unjustified and unjustifiable"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010 after the Saville Report said those who were killed or injured on Bloody Sunday were innocent. Eighteen former paratroopers were reported to Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service over the killings. Thirteen people were shot dead on Bloody Sunday One of those soldiers died in 2018, and a decision on whether or not to prosecute the other 17 for criminal offences is due on Thursday. Lord Saville is aware of this and the sensitivities around it, but he is keen to stress the difference between his inquiry and any criminal investigation by police. ""We were not there for that purpose - we were there simply to try to find out what happened,"" Lord Saville told the BBC. When asked if he accepted that without the Saville Report the prospect of former soldiers being prosecuted may not have happened, he said: ""I simply don't have the answer. The campaign by the families was for a new inquiry. ""Some thought that those soldiers who were found responsible should be prosecuted but overall the campaign for Bloody Sunday originally was for an inquiry to find out what happened and why, rather than a question of prosecutions."" Former soldiers were granted anonymity and assured that their evidence to the Saville Inquiry wouldn't be used in any subsequent criminal proceedings. ""If we had not given those assurances, backed by the director of public prosecutions, people could quite legitimately have refused to answer questions on the grounds that answering might incriminate them,"" said Lord Saville. ""We were there simply to try to find out what happened,"" said Lord Saville of his Â£200m inquiry ""So, we were there to find out what happened rather than investigating criminal offences. We sought assurance and gave it to those people, which is protected in law."" When asked if he, like many, took the view that the Saville Report would draw a line under Bloody Sunday, he replied: ""I didn't know what was likely to happen. We hoped the inquiry would help the situation in Ireland and I think and hope it did to a degree. ""The question as to whether it draws a line under events or whether there should be prosecutions is not one for me, it's one for politicians and prosecuting authorities. ""If people want more and feel that justice can only be served by prosecutions against those that they believe to be responsible, then that is a matter again on which I can't really comment."" ""I think we did a pretty thorough job and I was satisfied we had done a fair job at finding out what happened that day as was realistically possible."" He says the prospect of prosecutions hasn't changed his view in any way. Lord Saville said that a decision on prosecutions ""is not a matter for me and I have no particularly strong views about it"". He added: ""Our job was to do as thorough and fair a report as we could as to what happened on that day."" What happened on Bloody Sunday?

Michael Jackson 'innocent' adverts to be removed,"Transport for London says it will be removing advertisements that proclaim Michael Jackson is innocent. The decision comes after a sexual assault victims' charity said it was ""concerned"" about the adverts that have appeared on buses and bus stops. Posters were put up in response to a documentary in which the singer is accused of child sex abuse. The adverts have been financed through a crowdfunding campaign and feature the slogan: ""Facts don't lie. People do."" The Survivors Trust said the message could discourage victims of sexual assault from coming forward. In a statement to BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat, TfL says: ""We have reviewed our position and will be removing these advertisements. ""They have been rejected due to the public sensitivity and concern around their content."" The person who took this photo, who wants to remain anonymous, said: ""A blanket statement to say that people lie is damaging to victims of sexual assault"" The Leaving Neverland documentary, broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 last week, featured claims bytwo men who say they were sexually abused by Michael Jacksonwhen they were young. Wade Robson and James Safechuck claim they were molested and described the alleged incidents in graphic detail. The singer died in 2009 so cannot defend himself, but his family and fans have been protesting his innocence since the film was broadcast. Michael Jackson's nephew Taj told Radio 1 Newsbeat the allegations in Leaving Neverland felt like""the ultimate betrayal""but he believes they won't have a lasting effect on his uncle's legacy. Leaving Neverland: Is Michael Jackson's legacy ruined? This video can not be played ""Every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me"" The poster campaign appeared after a ""Michael Jackson Innocent"" crowdfunding page hit its Â£20,000 target. The page says: ""Like countless others within the MJ Community and society in general, we would not think twice in turning our backs on his legacy, if we for one second felt that there was any truth at all in these heinous events... There is a huge group in society that believe and know he is innocent."" It is reportedly being led by former Big Brother UK contestant and Jackson fanatic Seany O'Kane. However the Survivors Trust said the adverts were inappropriate. ""We have been particularly concerned by the recent news that TfL has chosen to run an advertising campaign... that endorses Jackson's innocence,"" a statement from the charity said. ""The decision to prioritise advertising revenue over the option of remaining neutral on such an emotive topic is disappointing."" Neverland - Michael Jackson's home The charity said victims of sexual assault often did not come forward because they thought that they would not be believed. ""An advertising campaign such as this perpetuates this fear among survivors and is very misplaced,"" the charity stated.

Extra ÃÂ£100m pledged to tackle knife crime,"Jodie Chesney was killed in a stabbing in an east London park as she played music with friends Police have been promised an extra Â£100m by the government to help them tackle a knife crime ""epidemic"" in England and Wales. The money will mainly go to the seven forces where violence is highest. But the fund - announced by Chancellor Philip Hammond in his Spring Statement - falls short of the Â£200m to Â£300m requested by police chiefs last week. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the extra money was ""a drop in the ocean"" after years of decreasing police budgets. ""Cuts have consequences and the government needs to urgently give our police the funding they desperately need,"" he said. Funding to police forces - which comes from central government and council tax - fell by 19% in real terms between 2010-11 and 2018-19, according to theNational Audit Office,external. Officer numbers have fallen by around 20,000 since 2010. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims Mr Hammond initially saidpolice forces must use their existing budgets to tackle knife crime, following requests from senior officers. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) welcomed the new money, saying it would boost the number of officers patrolling crime hotspots, increase the use of stop and search, and help to disrupt criminal gangs. The funding would also be used to fundViolence Reduction Unitsthat seek to tackle the underlying causes of violent crime. The chancellor's announcement follows a spate of fatal teenage stabbings, with two 17-year-olds killed in separate knife attacks in London and Greater Manchester earlier this month. Jodie Chesneywas killed in an east London park as she played music with friends, andYousef Ghaleb Makkiwas stabbed to death in the village of Hale Barns, near Altrincham. Mr Hammond told the Commons a ""wider, cross-agency response to this epidemic"" was required. ""Action is needed now. So the prime minister and I have decided exceptionally, to make available immediately to police forces in England an additional Â£100m,"" he said. Yousef Makki and Jodie Chesney, both 17, were killed in separate knife attacks two days apart The money is for one year, with a longer-term funding settlement for the police expected to form part of the Spending Review. Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: ""It's vital police have the resources they need to crack down on the rising levels of knife crime. ""I've listened and we will be giving Â£100m extra to forces, targeting the hardest hit areas. I'll continue to give police the support they need."" Allow Twitter content?

Missing Briton died from 'blow to head',"Catherine Shaw left her accommodation in Guatemala in the early hours of 5 March A woman who went missing in Guatemala died of a blow to the head, a post-mortem examination has found. Catherine Shaw, 23, from Witney, Oxfordshire, was reported missing after she left Hotel Mayachik near Lake Atitlan on 5 March. Her body was found between four and six days after her death, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences of Guatemala told local media. She was found on Monday near the top of the Indian Nose hiking trail. The Lucie Blackman Trust,external, which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, said on Tuesday that ""foul play was probably not involved"". The preliminary report, released by the institute, said she was found naked, face-down and with visible blows to her body. Miguel Angel Samayoa, the doctor who performed the examination, told AP there were no visible gunshot or stab wounds. Further tests are still being carried out to find out more about the circumstances in which she died. Ms Shaw's body was found on a mountain near Lake Atitlan in Guatemala On Tuesday the chief executive of the Lucie Blackman Trust, which has been helping Ms Shaw's family,said speculation that she was raped and murderedwas ""incredibly unhelpful, distressing and unnecessary"". Matthew Searle said Ms Shaw had been fasting and she may have passed out or fallen ""due to her lack of intake of food and fluid"". He added: ""She was very much a nature lover and adored sunrises, so it seems quite conceivable that she went up the mountain to greet the sunrise, shedding clothing as she went."" In a statement her parents, Ann and Tarquin, thanked those who helped find her or sent messages of support. ""Catherine just loved mountains and sunrises,"" they said. ""She died doing what she loved.""

Extra Â£100m pledged to tackle knife crime,"Jodie Chesney was killed in a stabbing in an east London park as she played music with friends Police have been promised an extra Â£100m by the government to help them tackle a knife crime ""epidemic"" in England and Wales. The money will mainly go to the seven forces where violence is highest. But the fund - announced by Chancellor Philip Hammond in his Spring Statement - falls short of the Â£200m to Â£300m requested by police chiefs last week. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the extra money was ""a drop in the ocean"" after years of decreasing police budgets. ""Cuts have consequences and the government needs to urgently give our police the funding they desperately need,"" he said. Funding to police forces - which comes from central government and council tax - fell by 19% in real terms between 2010-11 and 2018-19, according to theNational Audit Office,external. Officer numbers have fallen by around 20,000 since 2010. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims Mr Hammond initially saidpolice forces must use their existing budgets to tackle knife crime, following requests from senior officers. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) welcomed the new money, saying it would boost the number of officers patrolling crime hotspots, increase the use of stop and search, and help to disrupt criminal gangs. The funding would also be used to fundViolence Reduction Unitsthat seek to tackle the underlying causes of violent crime. The chancellor's announcement follows a spate of fatal teenage stabbings, with two 17-year-olds killed in separate knife attacks in London and Greater Manchester earlier this month.

Michael Jackson 'innocent' adverts to be removedA charity says the adverts could discourage victims of sexual assault from coming forward.Newsbeat,"Transport for London says it will be removing advertisements that proclaim Michael Jackson is innocent. The decision comes after a sexual assault victims' charity said it was ""concerned"" about the adverts that have appeared on buses and bus stops. Posters were put up in response to a documentary in which the singer is accused of child sex abuse. The adverts have been financed through a crowdfunding campaign and feature the slogan: ""Facts don't lie. People do."" The Survivors Trust said the message could discourage victims of sexual assault from coming forward. In a statement to BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat, TfL says: ""We have reviewed our position and will be removing these advertisements. ""They have been rejected due to the public sensitivity and concern around their content."" The person who took this photo, who wants to remain anonymous, said: ""A blanket statement to say that people lie is damaging to victims of sexual assault"" The Leaving Neverland documentary, broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 last week, featured claims bytwo men who say they were sexually abused by Michael Jacksonwhen they were young. Wade Robson and James Safechuck claim they were molested and described the alleged incidents in graphic detail. The singer died in 2009 so cannot defend himself, but his family and fans have been protesting his innocence since the film was broadcast. Michael Jackson's nephew Taj told Radio 1 Newsbeat the allegations in Leaving Neverland felt like""the ultimate betrayal""but he believes they won't have a lasting effect on his uncle's legacy. Leaving Neverland: Is Michael Jackson's legacy ruined? This video can not be played ""Every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me"" The poster campaign appeared after a ""Michael Jackson Innocent"" crowdfunding page hit its Â£20,000 target. The page says: ""Like countless others within the MJ Community and society in general, we would not think twice in turning our backs on his legacy, if we for one second felt that there was any truth at all in these heinous events...

However the Survivors Trust said the adverts were inappropriate.

Is Hammond telling May to change course?,"I know the idea that cabinet ministers stick to a script is deeply old fashioned. But for a chancellor to stand right in front of a prime minister and, even obliquely, tell them to change course, as Chancellor Philip Hammond has just done in his Spring Statement, is quite something. Mr Hammond's remarks might, in fact, be a step towards so-called indicative votes in the Commons, where a range of potential plans are presented to MPs - and maybe soon. Some ministers have argued privately for that for some time, although it's been frowned on by Number 10. LIVE: MPs debate no-deal Brexit ahead of vote Hammond calls for compromise on Brexit His remarks may delight some of his colleagues, who believe ""reasonable Remainer"" MPs have been locked out of the process for too long. Mr Hammond's team are already insisting there is no difference between him and Number 10. But for weeks a debate has raged at Westminster about what to do if the prime minister's deal can't get through the House of Commons. And for weeks it's been clear that there is a contingent in cabinet who think the solution to the gridlock is to move to a closer Brexit relationship with the EU, a compromise that could get a wider form of cross-party consensus. That has not, though, been Number 10's view. The prime minister has been trying to hold on to her negotiated deal, whatever happens, and to resist - at almost all costs - softening up her Brexit offer in any way, scrubbing out any more of her red lines. Because, while it is easy to say - and sounds eminently reasonable - to call for compromise, there's a huge political risk. The PM could compromise to get a hypothetical softer Brexit through the Commons - but days later find out that she could no longer govern. In this febrile atmosphere when the chancellor makes a call, as he has just done, for a ""consensus"" across Parliament to find a way out of this hole, he is also hinting very publicly to the prime minister that it might be time now to think about making that sacrifice. It's important to remember that Mr Hammond's preferred option all along has been to back the prime minister's deal, to try to get it through. But a mild-sounding call for compromise just now, is not necessarily politically mild at all.

Actress admits 'Bulger killer photo' post,"Tina Malone leaves the High Court in London where she admitted breaching an injunction protecting the identity of James Bulger killer Jon Venables Actress Tina Malone has been given a suspended prison sentence after she admitted breaching an injunction protecting the identity of James Bulger's killer Jon Venables. There is aglobal banon publishing anything about the identity of Venables or his accomplice Robert Thompson. Malone's barrister said the actress accepted she had breached the injunction by sharing a Facebook post. The ex-Shameless star was given an eight-month suspended sentence. She was also ordered to pay Â£10,000. The 56-year-old, who also starred in Brookside, pleaded guilty to the charge of contempt of court earlier. Malone told the court she had been living in Liverpool at the time of James's murder and knew his killers had been given anonymity when they were released. She shared the Facebook message in February last year, which was said to include an image and the new name of Venables, the High Court heard. The court heard Malone initially said she had not been aware she had done anything wrong. Her barrister, Adam Speker, said she had mental health problems at the time she shared the post and was caring for her five-year-old daughter and elderly mother. He said his client understood Venables had been given anonymity for his protection but there were no characteristics of vigilantism in Ms Malone's case. Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger Venables and Thompson were 10 when they tortured and killed James after abducting the two-year-old from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993. In November that year, they became theyoungest children ever to be convictedof murder in England. They have been living under new identities since they were released in 2001. Solicitor General Robert Buckland QC said: ""The injunction in this case is intended to both protect the identities of the offenders, but also innocent individuals who may be incorrectly identified as them. ""Posting this material online is a very serious matter and can result in a prison sentence."" In January, two people weregiven suspended sentencesafter admitting posting photos on social media they said identified Venables. Richard McKeag, 28, was handed a 12-month sentence and Natalie Barker, 36, was given eight months, both suspended for two years.

Brexit: What could happen next?Brexit: A really simple guideWhat is a no-deal Brexit?Is Hammond telling May to change course?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed.

Brexit: A really simple guideWhat is a no-deal Brexit?Is Hammond telling May to change course?,"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

What is a no-deal Brexit?Is Hammond telling May to change course?,"Dutch ports are preparing their customers for Brexit MPs have rejected a no-deal Brexit, in a non-binding Commons vote. What does that mean? This is not about whether Britain is leaving the European Union or not. It is written into law that the UK is leaving the EU on 29 March. Hammond calls for compromise on Brexit Brexit: What could happen next? The government has reached an agreement with the European Union that both sides say will keep Brexit disruption to a minimum. If the UK leaves under the terms of that agreement, very little will change, in the short term at least. A key part of the agreement is a 21 month ""transition period"", which kicks in the day the UK leaves. Trade will carry on roughly as it does now and citizens will continue to be able to move freely between countries as if the UK was still a member of the EU. The idea of the transition period is to allow the UK and EU to hammer out a permanent trading relationship - the prime minister has also agreed a statement on what that relationship might look like. They are worried about what will happen when the transition period comes to an end. Instead of breaking free from the EU, they fear the UK will be permanently tied to its rules, with no say in how they are made. That is because one section of the withdrawal agreement - known as the Irish backstop - would keep the UK part of a customs union with the EU, if no trade deal has been agreed. The backstop is meant to prevent the return of physical checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which will be the land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit. No tariffs for Irish goods going to NI The UK would sever all ties with the EU with immediate effect, with no transition period - and, therefore, no talks on a tailor-made trade deal between the UK and the EU. The UK would trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, in the same way that it does with many non-EU countries. The government fears it would cause significant disruption to businesses in the short-term, with lengthy tailbacks of lorries at the channel ports, as drivers face new checks on their cargos. Food retailers have warned of shortages of fresh produce and the NHS is stockpiling medicines, in case supplies from EU countries are interrupted. Government ministers and multinational companies with factories in the UK have also warned about the long-term impact on the British economy. Most MPs are thought to be against a no-deal Brexit for these reasons. Many who campaigned for Brexit in the 2016 referendum believe the no-deal warnings have been exaggerated and that Britain will not only survive, but thrive, if it is allowed to make a totally clean break from the EU and what they see as its burdensome regulations. They fear the UK will never be allowed to make trade deals with other countries if it ends up trapped in a customs union with the EU. And the country would also save on the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" it is set to pay to the EU under the terms of Mrs May's agreement. The 29 March exit date could slip if MPs vote to ask for an extension from the European Union - something they could do in a vote planned for Thursday. The EU may decide not to grant an extension unless the UK has a reason for it, such as deciding to hold another EU referendum, with the option of staying in the EU on the ballot paper. And the UK government could cancel Brexit altogether if it wanted to. But as things currently stand, Brexit is definitely happening. Having been comprehensively rejected twice by MPs, many think the prime minister's deal is now dead. MPs have been proposing different ideas for deals. Labour wants the UK to be in a customs union with the EU, and some Labour and Tory MPs want an even closer relationship, like the one Norway has with the EU. There were no votes on these options on Wednesday. MPs voted against proposals from a group of Conservative MPs for a ""managed no-deal"", which would see the transition period extended by a year until December 2021 to allow more time to agree a new trading relationship. However, the prime minister has indicated that she will make a third attempt to get her EU withdrawal deal through Parliament in the coming days. She has told MPs that if her deal fails again to get their backing, a lengthy delay to Brexit may be needed.

Adler: EU points finger at UK,"EU politicians are united whereas British ones are not Once again - just as the last time the Brexit deal was rejected in parliament - reaction by EU leaders was prompt, co-ordinated and on message. It was a result they'd been dreading but expecting. European politician after European politician tweeted to say how disappointed they were, how businesses and citizens across the EU and UK now faced more agonising uncertainty and that the vote in the House of Commons brought everyone much closer to a no-deal Brexit. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier best summed up the European mood when he insisted the EU had done everything it could and that the deadlock could only be solved in the UK. There would be no more negotiations. Brexit: A really simple guide What just happened with Brexit? Brexit deal: What do the documents say? Notable on Tuesday night was the complete absence of any self-recrimination. Even in private, there was no discernible European soul-searching that more could have or should have been offered. Quite the opposite. The EU finger of blame points directly at the UK and the fact that parliament did not decide, or rather was never consulted about, what kind of Brexit it wanted before negotiations began - even when everyone knew MPs would have the final say on any resulting deal. Continuing disarray in the House of Commons just makes the EU wonder what the point could now be in delaying Brexit by just a few weeks - if the prime minister does request a short extension of the leaving process. Under EU law, Theresa May needs to formally ask for an extension and the 27 EU leaders need to be unanimous in their agreement. This should be interesting. Theresa May (L) with the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier European leaders have never formally debated how long an extension they would favour and what conditions - if any - they would lay down. That discussion will only start at ambassador level on Wednesday. Up until now, public EU statements about an extension have been part and parcel of negotiations. Threats to force the departing UK to field candidates in the upcoming European parliamentary elections or to make the UK extend by a whacking 21 months were partly designed to put pressure on MPs and (it was hoped) to help focus minds on voting in favour of the prime minister's Brexit deal. Business âexasperatedâ after Brexit vote EU sticks to Brexit script in final sprint EU in bleak mood in 'crunch' Brexit week But that didn't work and by this stage of the Brexit process, Germany, France, Ireland and others have slightly differing priorities. Not that you can speak of real rifts in the EU position (though Germany is so keen to keep the UK close, its politicians keep saying the government should take the time it needs to solve its political crisis, while France, for example, is impatient to get Brexit done and over with). Theresa May (r) would need to formally ask the EU's 27 leaders for an extension However, if Theresa May were tempted to use next week's EU leaders' summit in Brussels to ask for new concessions, opinion would be divided, even if leaders managed, as they mostly have until now, to keep differences behind closed doors. Clearly on a technical, civil servant-level the EU believes that EU-UK negotiations can't go any further. If the EU were to move at all on its Brexit position now, that would be a political decision which can only be taken by the leaders of the 27 EU member countries. This video can not be played MPs voted by 391 to 242 against Theresa May's Brexit plan And they are already worrying about the next round of ""magical thinking"" in the UK. Moments after the deal was rejected by parliament on Tuesday, Mr Barnier took to Twitter to express concern that there seemed to be what he called a ""dangerous illusion"" amongst some MPs that the UK can have a transition period after Brexit even if no formal EU-UK divorce deal is agreed. Brussels has always ruled that option out as impossible - a case of cherry-picking extraordinaire. As much as EU leaders want to avoid an acrimonious no-deal Brexit, they are not willing to pay just any price. MPs reject PM's Brexit deal by 149 votes.

Hammond calls for compromise on Brexit,"This video can not be played Philip Hammond on Brexit vote: ""Last night's events mean we are not where I hoped we would be today."" Chancellor Philip Hammond has signalled his backing for a cross-party consensus over Brexit, despite the PM still appearing to support her own deal. He told MPs they had ""a solemn duty in the days ahead to put aside our differences and seek a compromise"". It came after Theresa May said the UK could still leave the EU with a ""good deal"", despite MPs rejecting her plan. MPs are now voting on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal or not. Battling a sore throat at prime minister's questions earlier, the prime minister said: ""I may not have my own voice but I understand the voice of the country."" Jeremy Corbyn has called on the PM to change course after her deal was ""decisively rejected"" by 149 votes on Tuesday. The Labour leader repeated his calls for Mrs May to ""move on from her red lines"" and suggested his alternative plan to remain in a customs union was ""the only show in town"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the chancellor's comments are likely to be seen as support for moves by senior cross-party MPs to forge an alternative Brexit agreement. This could include holding a series of indicative votes on different options, which would show what next steps MPs would be prepared to back. LIVE: Reaction as MPs prepare for no-deal vote PM: 'I understand voice of the country' Adler: EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Hammond's comments showed the government was being forced to ""look seriously"" at his party's proposals - which also include closer ties to the single market. After Tuesday's defeat, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the bloc ""cannot go any further"" in trying to persuade MPs to back the agreed terms of exit and it was down to the UK to sort out. MPs are voting on whether to block the UK from leaving the EU without an agreement later this month. If the government motion passes, the block on no-deal would only apply to the 29 March deadline. It wouldn't rule out the prospect of a no-deal exit later this year, if Parliament is ultimately unable to agree a way forward. Two amendments were also chosen by the Speaker John Bercow to be put to the Commons: Amendment (a) - put forward by Tory Caroline Spelman and Labour's Jack Dromey, which would remove the reference to 29 March and make the motion a straightforward rejection of no-deal Amendment (f) - known as the Malthouse Compromise, which includes terms for a ""managed"" no-deal, an extension of Brexit until 22 May and gives protection to citizens' rights Dame Caroline then told the Commons she wanted to withdraw the amendment, because the government motion would do the same job. But she was told by Mr Bercow that she could not withdraw it because other supporters of the amendment could ""persist with it"". Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit amendments: What will MPs vote on? The prime minister has said she will vote to rule out a no-deal, as per her own motion, but she has promised a ""free vote"" - meaning party bosses will not tell MPs which way to vote. There will also be a free vote allowed on the Malthouse Compromise, which was tabled by a group of both Remain and Leave-backing Tory MPs. Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, has already said she will vote in the opposite way, telling BBC Two's Politics Live that a no-deal Brexit was not the ""optimal scenario"", but it had to be left on the table. Delivering his Spring Statement to the Commons, Mr Hammond called on MPs across the Commons to ""remove the threat of an imminent no-deal exit hanging over our economy"" in the vote. He said the uncertainty that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit brought was damaging the UK economy, and the country's ""standing and reputation in the world"". But the chancellor then moved on to talk about a further vote that could take place on Thursday. If MPs vote against a no deal, the prime minister has said a motion would be tabled the following day allowing MPs to vote for an extension to Article 50 - the legal mechanism that sees the UK leaving the EU on 29 March. Mr Hammond said: ""Tomorrow [Thursday], we will have the opportunity to start to map out a way forward towards building a consensus across this House for a deal we can collectively support to exit the EU in an orderly way, to a future relationship that will allow Britain to flourish, protecting jobs and businesses."" He added that, while he had hoped MPs would reach a consensus during Tuesday's vote on Mrs May's deal, he was ""confident that we, as a House, will do it over the coming weeks"". The PM could compromise to get a hypothetical softer Brexit through the Commons - but days later find out that she could no longer govern. In this febrile atmosphere when the chancellor makes a call, as he has just done, for a ""consensus"" across Parliament to find a way out of this hole, he is also hinting very publicly to the prime minister that it might be time now to think about making that sacrifice. It's important to remember that Mr Hammond's preferred option all along has been to back the prime minister's deal, to try to get it through. But a mild-sounding call for compromise just now, is not necessarily politically mild at all. Read more from Laura Asked after the statement if the chancellor was setting out an alternative way forward from the prime minister, his spokeswoman insisted he ""wasn't indicating directionality"". But when pushed, she added: ""He's backed the deal up to now, the way forward will involve compromise. ""He believes compromise is the spirit in which we all have to try to find a way forward."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told reporters that the government was ""coming up to our agenda"". He added: ""All the way along we have been there with our proposals and now they are being forced to look at it seriously. ""I think the Cabinet and the Tory party are fracturing over where to go next and some of them may well now look seriously at our proposal."" He also said Mrs May should meet Mr Corbyn again, saying: ""I think the onus is upon the government now to start talking to people."" Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow economic secretary, told Politics Live Mr Hammond ""can come and talk to us anytime"". But Liz Truss denied the chancellor had given up on the prime minister's deal and was instead seeking a consensus with Labour on a softer Brexit. ""Philip Hammond doesn't give up,"" she said. ""I don't believe he has given up on that."" A No 10 source told the Press Association said Mr Hammond was ""consistent"" with what the prime minister has said, adding: ""He clearly believes, as she does, that the best outcome for the country is to leave with a deal.""

Under a temporary scheme 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access - up from 80% at present. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. The government also announcedit will not introduce any new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving across the border from Ireland to Northern Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.

Brexit amendments: What will MPs vote on?,"MPs will vote later on whether or not the UK should leave the EU without a deal. Backbench MPs and opposition parties put forward eight amendments to show which direction they want the government to take on Brexit. Speaker John Bercow has selected two of them to be put to the vote in the Commons later. LIVE: MPs prepare to vote on no-deal Brexit EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat The government motion for debate is: That this House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship on 29 March 2019; and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this House and the EU ratify an agreement. Jack Dromey and Caroline Spelman are working across party lines The amendment (a) from Labour MP Jack Dromey and Conservative Dame Caroline Spelman changes the wording of the government motion to ""this House rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship"". Dame Caroline told MPs she wanted to withdraw the amendment, because Theresa May's government motion would do the same job. But she was told by Commons Speaker John Bercow that she could not withdraw it because other signatories could ""persist with it"". The 'Alternative Arrangements Working Group' is formed of Tory leavers and remainers working on the 'Malthouse Compromise' This amendment (f) sets out the process for a ""managed no-deal"". It requests: The government publish tariff schedules An extension of leaving to 22 May 2019 'Mutual standstill agreements' between the UK and EU until the end of 2021, including payments to the EU A unilateral guarantee of citizens' rights It is called the Malthouse compromise because it was put together by Conservative minister Kit Malthouse, but it has been tabled in the name of former Conservative minister Damian Green. It is supported by members of the Brexiteer European Research Group of Conservative MPs and former Remain supporters such as Mr Green and Nicky Morgan. Some members of the Independent Group left their parties over Brexit Amendment (d) states that ""under no circumstances"" should the UK leave without a deal, listing the alternatives as revocation of the UK's intention to leave, extension of the Article 50 period or a second referendum. Amendment (e) scraps the second half of the government motion, shortening it to: ""that this House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship on 29 March 2019"" It was tabled by the Independent Group, which is consists of eight former Labour MPs and three former Tories, who are all supporters of another EU referendum, and who quit their parties in protest at their Brexit policies. Amendment (c) calls for an extension to the Article 50 leaving process to 2021, or until a future relationship is agreed. The amendment also requests a second referendum to take place, on whether or not the UK should leave with the agreed deal, or remain in the EU. Ken Clarke One final amendment - (b) was tabled by former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke, Labour's Keith Vaz and the SNP's Angus MacNeil. It simply calls for the revocation of Article 50 to cancel Brexit. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford expresses his concern at a no-deal Brexit Amendment (h), tabled by the SNP, calls for the UK to not leave the EU without a deal ""under any circumstances"", regardless of the exit date. It further gives MPs the option to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh wants no-deal to remain on the table Amendment (g) was tabled by Tory Brexiteer Sir Edward Leigh. The amendment calls for the option of no-deal to be kept on the table during the government's continued negotiations with the EU.

Children die in Lagos school collapse,"This video can not be played Deaths confirmed in Lagos school collapse At least 10 people have died and many more are feared trapped after a building containing a school collapsed in the Nigerian city of Lagos. The school, which was on the top floor of the four-storey building in Ita Faji on Lagos Island, had more than 100 pupils, a rescue official told the BBC. About 40 pupils had been pulled out alive, the official said. The building had been identified as ""distressed"" and listed for demolition, Lagos building officials told the BBC. The collapse happened at about 10:00 local time (09:00 GMT). There were frantic scenes at the site as rescuers and local men searched for survivors, and family members crowded the area in the hope of finding their loved ones alive. This video can not be played Eyewitness says ""everybody had to run for their lives"" The collapsed building was a residential block containing a number of apartments as well as the school, residents and rescue officials at the scene told the BBC. Emergency teams pulled several injured pupils from the rubble, but many worried parents at the scene were unable to find their children, while others went to a local hospital to look for theirs. It Is not clear how many children remain trapped Men from the local area were assisting rescuers but large crowds of people were hindering the rescue operation. Mohammed Muftau, a local resident who witnessed the collapse, told the BBC that the building had been cracking for long time and that complaints had been raised about it. The Lagos State Building Control Agency confirmed to the BBC that the building had been marked and listed for demolition. It is not unusual for buildings to collapse in Nigeria; materials are often sub-standard and the enforcement of regulations is lax. In September 2014, 116 people died when a six-storey building collapsed in Lagos during a service given by a celebrity televangelist. And in 2016, more than 100 people died when the roof of a church in Uyo, in the south of Nigeria, caved in. Rescuers were working frantically to free those trapped under the rubble At the Lagos Island General Hospital, there was a scene of chaos as parents and family members scrambled after every ambulance that arrived to see if it contained a loved one. Many of the victims brought in were children in school uniforms. Visiting the hospital, the Lagos state deputy governor, Idiat Oluranti Adebule, offered condolences to the families of the victims and called for calm. ""We plead for their understanding to allow the rescue team to do their work... so that the medical team can take prompt and immediate action as soon as the patients are brought in,"" she told the BBC. President Muhammadu Buhari offered his condolences to the families of the victims. ""It touches one to lose precious lives in any kind of mishap, particularly those so young and tender,"" he said. ""May God grant everyone affected by this sad incident fortitude and succour."" Are you in the area? If it is safe to do so please contact us by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Canada joins ban on Boeing crash aircraft,"Canada has grounded the world's third largest fleet of Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on Sunday. The country's regulator said that three Canadian airlines, operating 41 Max 8 jets, would be unable to use them in Canada's airspace. Canada joins a long list of countries to halt the aircraft's use. But the US regulator says it is safe to fly. Canada's transport minister said it had received new evidence about the crash. Boeing: Which airlines use the 737 Max 8? US refuses to ground Boeing 737 Max crash aircraft Marc Garneau said that satellite data showed possible similarities between flight patterns of Boeing 737 Max planes operating in Canada and the Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed. He said: ""As a result of new data that we received this morning, and had the chance to analyze, and on the advice of my experts and as a precautionary measure, I issued a safety notice. ""This safety notice restricts commercial passenger flights from any operator of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 or MAX 9 variant aircraft, whether domestic or foreign, from arriving, departing or overflying Canadian air space. ""This safety notice is effective immediately and will remain in place until further notice."" The Polish Civil Aviation Authorities also announced on Wednesday that it had closed its aerospace to the Boeing 737 Max 8. The UK, the European Union, China, Australia and India are among the countries that have suspended the Boeing 737 Max from their airspace. However, the US Federal Aviation Administration said a review had showed ""no systemic performance issues"" and that there was no basis for grounding the aircraft. On Wednesday, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines,Tewolde Gebremariam, told the BBC that all 737 Max aircraft worldwide should be groundeduntil the causes of the crash were known. Meanwhile, it has emerged that pilots in the US had complained about problems controlling the Boeing 737 Max 8 during take-off, echoing difficulties that contributed to the fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October. Documents reveal that pilots reported engaging autopilot only for the aircraft's nose to pitch lower, prompting the warning system to exclaim: ""Don't sink! Don't sink!"" The Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed just six minutes into its flight. Two US pilots reported separate incidents involving the 737 Max's automatic anti-stalling system in November. The feature - new to the the 737 Max family, which began flying commercially in 2017 - is designed to keep the plane from stalling. The system prevents the aircraft from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. Investigators examine wreckage from the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash However, according to filings with the US Aviation Safety Reporting System, which pilots use to disclose information anonymously, it appeared to force the nose down. In both cases, pilots were forced to intervene to stop the plane from descending. One first officer said that they had discussed what had happened at length with the captain ""I reviewed in my mind our automation setup and flight profile but can't think of any reason the aircraft would pitch nose down so aggressively,"" they said. Investigators have recovered the flight data recorders from the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash but have yet to determine what caused the accident. Flightradar24 reported that that the plane vertical speed was unstable after take off. After the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued guidance on what to do regarding erroneous readings from the sensor, which sends out information about what angle a plane is flying at. But another pilot said that ""it did nothing"" to address the problems with the sensor. They said: ""I think it is unconscionable that a manufacturer, the FAA, and the airlines would have pilots flying an airplane without adequately training, or even providing available resources and sufficient documentation to understand the highly complex systems that differentiate this aircraft from prior models. They added: ""I am left to wonder: what else don't I know? The flight manual is inadequate and almost criminally insufficient."" Which airlines use the Boeing 737 Max 8?

Airline crash boss wants aircraft grounded,"This video can not be played Relatives pay their respects to those who died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash The boss of Ethiopian Airlines has called for the grounding of all Boeing's 737 Max 8 aircraft until it is established they are safe to fly. Many countries have already suspended the plane after one of the airline's jets crashed on Sunday minutes after take-off, killing 157 people on board. Tewolde Gebremariam told the BBC that although the exact causes were still unknown, there were similarities to a Lion Air crash last October. But US officials say the jet is safe. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said a review had showed ""no systemic performance issues"" and that there was no basis for grounding the aircraft. Sunday's Nairobi-bound plane was the same type as the Indonesian Lion Air jet that crashed in October, killing 189 passengers and crew, and Mr Tewolde said there were other similarities. He accepted that Boeing and the FAA must have their reasons for arguing that the 737 Max 8 is safe. But ""extreme precaution"" was needed and ""all of us who have grounded the plane have very good justification,"" Mr Tewolde said. This video can not be played Tewolde Gebremariam: Grounding is the right thing to do Both aircraft were brand new and in both cases there were problems minutes after take-off, he said. Which airlines use the 737 Max 8? The victims of 'a global tragedy' Ethiopian Airlines: Africa's largest airline Regulators, including across the European Union, Hong Kong, Singapore, China and Australia, have banned 737 Max aircraft from flying in or over their airspace. Those authorities must have good reason to ground the aircraft, Mr Tewolde said, adding that safety is paramount and ""grounding is the right thing to do"". Meanwhile,a number of US politicians have called on the FAA to temporarily ground the Boeing modeluntil their safety is confirmed. But the FAA said other civil aviation authorities had not ""provided data to us that would warrant action"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Boeing confirmed that it had been developing a ""flight control software enhancement"" for the aircraft, but said it was confident they were safe to fly. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union said the 737 MAX fleet should be grounded out of ""an abundance of caution"". The Allied Pilots Association said members who had safety concerns would ""not be forced to fly"". Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, both major operators of the Boeing 737 Max, are continuing to use the planes. The Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft are the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating. The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion.It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"",externalon 4 February, the airline said. Followinglast October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted. Eyewitnesses say they saw a trail of smoke, sparks and debris as the plane nosedived. These flight radar maps show the impact of the many 737 Max 8 bans - which have not been imposed in the US.

Missing Briton died from 'blow to head'Catherine Shaw was reported missing after she left a Guatemala hotel on 5 March.Oxford,"Catherine Shaw left her accommodation in Guatemala in the early hours of 5 March A woman who went missing in Guatemala died of a blow to the head, a post-mortem examination has found. Catherine Shaw, 23, from Witney, Oxfordshire, was reported missing after she left Hotel Mayachik near Lake Atitlan on 5 March. Her body was found between four and six days after her death, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences of Guatemala told local media. She was found on Monday near the top of the Indian Nose hiking trail. The Lucie Blackman Trust,external, which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, said on Tuesday that ""foul play was probably not involved"". The preliminary report, released by the institute, said she was found naked, face-down and with visible blows to her body. Miguel Angel Samayoa, the doctor who performed the examination, told AP there were no visible gunshot or stab wounds. Further tests are still being carried out to find out more about the circumstances in which she died. Ms Shaw's body was found on a mountain near Lake Atitlan in Guatemala On Tuesday the chief executive of the Lucie Blackman Trust, which has been helping Ms Shaw's family,said speculation that she was raped and murderedwas ""incredibly unhelpful, distressing and unnecessary"". Matthew Searle said Ms Shaw had been fasting and she may have passed out or fallen ""due to her lack of intake of food and fluid"". He added: ""She was very much a nature lover and adored sunrises, so it seems quite conceivable that she went up the mountain to greet the sunrise, shedding clothing as she went."" In a statement her parents, Ann and Tarquin, thanked those who helped find her or sent messages of support. ""Catherine just loved mountains and sunrises,"" they said. ""She died doing what she loved.""

Michael Jackson bus ads 'perpetuate fear'A charity says the adverts could discourage victims of sexual assault from coming forward.,"Transport for London says it will be removing advertisements that proclaim Michael Jackson is innocent. The decision comes after a sexual assault victims' charity said it was ""concerned"" about the adverts that have appeared on buses and bus stops. Posters were put up in response to a documentary in which the singer is accused of child sex abuse. The adverts have been financed through a crowdfunding campaign and feature the slogan: ""Facts don't lie. People do."" The Survivors Trust said the message could discourage victims of sexual assault from coming forward. In a statement to BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat, TfL says: ""We have reviewed our position and will be removing these advertisements. ""They have been rejected due to the public sensitivity and concern around their content."" The person who took this photo, who wants to remain anonymous, said: ""A blanket statement to say that people lie is damaging to victims of sexual assault"" The Leaving Neverland documentary, broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 last week, featured claims bytwo men who say they were sexually abused by Michael Jacksonwhen they were young. Wade Robson and James Safechuck claim they were molested and described the alleged incidents in graphic detail. The singer died in 2009 so cannot defend himself, but his family and fans have been protesting his innocence since the film was broadcast. Michael Jackson's nephew Taj told Radio 1 Newsbeat the allegations in Leaving Neverland felt like""the ultimate betrayal""but he believes they won't have a lasting effect on his uncle's legacy. Leaving Neverland: Is Michael Jackson's legacy ruined? This video can not be played ""Every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me"" The poster campaign appeared after a ""Michael Jackson Innocent"" crowdfunding page hit its Â£20,000 target. The page says: ""Like countless others within the MJ Community and society in general, we would not think twice in turning our backs on his legacy, if we for one second felt that there was any truth at all in these heinous events... There is a huge group in society that believe and know he is innocent."" It is reportedly being led by former Big Brother UK contestant and Jackson fanatic Seany O'Kane. However the Survivors Trust said the adverts were inappropriate. ""We have been particularly concerned by the recent news that TfL has chosen to run an advertising campaign... that endorses Jackson's innocence,"" a statement from the charity said. ""The decision to prioritise advertising revenue over the option of remaining neutral on such an emotive topic is disappointing."" Neverland - Michael Jackson's home The charity said victims of sexual assault often did not come forward because they thought that they would not be believed. ""An advertising campaign such as this perpetuates this fear among survivors and is very misplaced,"" the charity stated.

Here's our basic guide. Check how your MP voted in the latest Brexit vote. The grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft by the FAA has been welcomed by air workers in the US. John Samuelsen, international president of the Transport
Workers Union of America, which represent aviation workers and
flight attendants, said the grounding of the fleet was right
""both for air travellers and aviation workers."" The Dow has closed up by 0.6%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq by 0.7% each. Shares in Boeing experienced a volatile time after President Trump's decision to ground all 
of the 737 MAX aircraft. But the share price ended the day 0.5% up to $377.12, putting it ahead for the first time in three days but still 
down nearly 11% since before Sunday's deadly crash in Ethiopia. The Nikkei press agency is reporting that South Korean Airlines will be banned by the authorities from accepting delivery of Boeing jets if the US aircraft maker does nod satisfy questions over their safety. IBM has been accused of using Flickr photos for a facial-recognition project, without the full consent of people in the images. The company extracted nearly one million photos from a dataset of Flickr images originally compiled by Yahoo. Many people pictured were probably unaware of how their data had been used,according to an NBC News report,external. IBM said in a statement that it had taken great care to comply with privacy principles. MPs have voted to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement. Theresa May said there was a ""clear majority"" against a no-deal Brexit but the ""legal default"" was that the UK would leave without a deal on 29 March if no deal is reached. MPs will now get a vote on delaying Brexit, said the prime minister. That vote will take place on Thursday, and if it is passed - and the EU agrees to it - the UK will not leave the EU as planned on 29 March. The government tabled a motion to prevent the UK from exiting the EU on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement. But before MPs voted on that, they backed an amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances - by just four votes. This dramatic development led to the government ordering Conservative MPs to vote against its own motion. But the government motion, as amended, was passed by 321 votes to 278, reinforcing the message that MPs do not want to leave without a deal. MPs also voted by 374 to 164 to reject a plan to delay the UK's departure from the EU until 22 May, 2019 so that there can be what its supporters call a ""managed no-deal"" Brexit. The US decision comes afterCanada earlier in the day decided to ban the Boeing Max planes from its airspace. Announcing the decision, Canadian transport minister Marc Garneau said he made his decision after reviewing ""validated satellite 
tracking data suggesting a possible, although unproven, similarity in the 
flight profile of the Lion Air aircraft."" Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent Legal border issues There
has been some learned debate among legal academics on Twitter over whether the
UK no-deal tariff proposals are compatible with World Trade Organization rules.
One issue is the plan for special treatment â no tariffs - for goods crossing
coming into the UK over the land border in Ireland. Similar goods entering
elsewhere â Dover or Felixstowe for example â would be subject to any
applicable tariffs. Does that violate the non-discrimination principle in WTO
rules (known somewhat confusingly as Most Favoured Nation)? It might do,
although there is some dispute among the lawyers. And then there is the
plan to continue some EU actions against goods that are (allegedly) dumped or
subsidised. A former WTO appeal judge says that would violate the requirement
that these actions are taken only after the country concerned has done an
investigation and shown that its own industry has been harmed. It wonât do if
you just adopt the EU investigation. So WTO challenges in the pipeline on these
points and potentially others? Could be.  But also worth bearing in mind
that the WTOâs dispute settlement system is currently on track to seize up
completely in December. Unless some more appeal judges are selected it wonât
have enough to hear cases and the US has blocked the recruitment process. Southwest Airlines is immediately complying with today's FAA requirement for all U.S. airlines to ground the Boeing 737 MAX 8. As a result, we have removed our 34 MAX 8 aircraft from scheduled service. Southwest operates a fleet of more than 750 Boeing 737s, and the 34 MAX 8 aircraft account for less than 5% of our daily flights.

high on Wednesday after MPs rejected a no-deal Brexit. The pound hit $1.3270 and was up 1.5% against the
dollar after the 312-308 vote, having traded at $1.3240 before the vote. The pound was also up 0.9% against the euro.  Dennis Muilenburg, chief executive of Boeing says: ""We are supporting this pro-active step out of an abundance of caution. ""Safety is a core value at Boeing for as long as we have been building airplanes; and it always will be. There is no greater priority for our company and our industry. ""We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again."" The House of Commons has voted by 312 to 308 to reject a no-deal Brexit, in a non-binding vote American Airlines is working to rebook
customers due to fly on Boeing 737 Max planes as quickly as
possible after the US banned the aircraft, which has
suffered two crashes in five months. American, which has 24 of the 737 Max aircraft, was notified by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of its decision to ground
the jets earlier on Wednesday, it said in a statement. Boeing continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX.  However, after consultation with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and aviation authorities and its customers around the world, Boeing has determined - out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraftâs safety - to recommend to the FAA the temporary suspension of operations of the entire global fleet of 371 737 MAX aircraft.  Barred from the US Donald Trump's announcement on the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 jets in the US comes after intense political and international pressure. On Tuesday Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said: ""Today, immediately, the FAA needs to get these planes out of the sky,"" Aviation authorities in Europe, China, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Oman, Singapore and more, have barred the plane from their airspace. On Wednesday at the White House President Trump told reporters: ""We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition regarding all 
flights of the 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 9,"" President Trump has said the US Federal Aviation Administration is to ground the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 aircraft following the crash of one of the jets in Ethiopia which killed 157 people on Sunday. Boeing shares fell some 2% on the news The fate of Interserve, and its 45,000 UK workers, is expected to be decidedon Friday at a shareholder vote. Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: âInterserve workers and those in its supply chain are facing an uncertain and difficult future. âWhatever the outcome of Fridayâs vote, the government as Interserveâs largest client most step in to ensure that the workforce and the supply chain is fully protected and do not become the innocent victims of the companyâs epic mismanagement. âThe predicament of the workforce has been made far worse by the government failing to learn the lessons of Carillion and bringing in new rules to better protect the workforce when companies collapse. âWhat is unequivocally clear is that the current flawed outsourcing model is broken.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Most imports tariff-free under no-deal plan,"The government has announced that most imports into the UK would not attract a tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Under a temporary scheme 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. What are tariffs and how do they work? Government sets out plans for Irish border in a no-deal Brexit No-deal NI plan disastrous, say businesses A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. In the great majority of cases, tariffs are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. The new tariff regime would mark a shift in favour of products from non-EU countries. It would mean 82% of imports from the EU would be tariff-free, down from 100% now. 92% percent of imports from the rest of the world would pay no border duty, up from 56%. Under the plan, the UK car industry will receive some protection, with some imported cars attracting tariffs. But car parts from the EU would be tariff free, which will help car plants in the UK. Also, the ceramics industry would receive some protection from cheap imports. Industry bodies and businesses are still poring overthe 1,477-page document,externalwhich outlines the new plan. Imports of cars from the EU will have a tariff of 10% applied, which would add Â£1,500 to a typical family car. Volkswagen has already said the cost would be passed on to the buyer. Car parts such as engines would have no new tax applied to avoid disruption to the movement of components. A spokesman for Ford UK warned that the tariffs would ""deal a devastating blow to much of the complex and integrated automotive industry, and would damage the competitiveness of Ford's engine manufacturing in the UK"". While some tariffs will protect farmers producing meat, other sectors of farming will have low or no tarrifs. The National Farmers' Union President, Minette Batters, said that eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables would not receive any protection under the plans. The plans would see the current tariff rate on oranges cut from 16% to 0%, the rate for onions down from 9.6% to 0% and the tariff on imported televisions down from 14% to 0%. Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing Steve Turner described the potential no-deal as ""economic vandalism which is threatening jobs and livelihoods"" and  called for tariffs to be dropped on EU imports. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI described the changes as a ""sledgehammer to our economy"" as companies spend more on stockpiling. She said: ""These are being imposed on this country with no consultation with business with no time to prepare."" Trade minister Liam Fox will speak to business leaders at 15:00 GMT to discuss the tariffs, Reuters reported. Trade Policy Minister George Hollingbery said: ""Our priority is securing a deal with the EU as this will avoid disruption to our global trading relationships. However, we must prepare for all eventualities."" He said: ""This balanced approach will help to support British jobs and avoid potential price spikes that would hit the poorest households the hardest."" ""The new tariff seems a reasonable compromise between protecting vulnerable (and politically important) sectors and keeping prices down for consumers,"" said Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""For producers, there will be relief in some sectors and nasty surprises for others,"" he said. The government also announced thatit will not introduce any new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for nearly all goods moving from across the border from Ireland to Northern Irelandin the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The move, to avoid friction at the UK's land border with the EU, will be temporary while a long solution is found. The government said tariffs will be payable on goods moving from the EU into the rest of the UK via Northern Ireland. It insisted that this would create no border down the Irish sea because there would be no checks on goods moved between Northern Ireland and Britain. But Prof Winters said it ""almost certainly"" violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules that demand equal treatment for all trading partners, he said. ""Leaving the Irish border open also opens up the possibility of some EU goods being shipped to the UK via Ireland and so avoiding UK tariffs.""

What could happen next?10 ways you could be affected by no-deal BrexitBrexit: A really simple guide,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

10 ways you could be affected by no-deal BrexitBrexit: A really simple guide,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external. The process could take up to four months. Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,the government has warned that it may become more expensive.,external Full government travel advice,external How will it affect my holidays to Europe? While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU. The government has announced a further Â£434m of funding and other measures, including: extra warehouse space for medicines securing additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone building buffer stocks booking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment making changes to regulatory requirements strengthening processes to deal with shortages However, the National Audit Office has said there are still""significant"" gapsin the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes. Government advice on medicine supply,external Should NHS patients be worried? About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries. The UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now. In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"". The government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing Â£138m. It advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevantcountry advice pages.,external Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country. However, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority. Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries. These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights. Full government advice for UK nationals living in the EU,external How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Drivers UK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK. There are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world.

As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal.

Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system.

"Hammond calls for compromise on BrexitThe chancellor asks for cross-party consensus, despite the PM still appearing to back her own deal.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Philip Hammond on Brexit vote: ""Last night's events mean we are not where I hoped we would be today."" Chancellor Philip Hammond has signalled his backing for a cross-party consensus over Brexit, despite the PM still appearing to support her own deal. He told MPs they had ""a solemn duty in the days ahead to put aside our differences and seek a compromise"". It came after Theresa May said the UK could still leave the EU with a ""good deal"", despite MPs rejecting her plan. MPs are now voting on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal or not. Battling a sore throat at prime minister's questions earlier, the prime minister said: ""I may not have my own voice but I understand the voice of the country."" Jeremy Corbyn has called on the PM to change course after her deal was ""decisively rejected"" by 149 votes on Tuesday. The Labour leader repeated his calls for Mrs May to ""move on from her red lines"" and suggested his alternative plan to remain in a customs union was ""the only show in town"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the chancellor's comments are likely to be seen as support for moves by senior cross-party MPs to forge an alternative Brexit agreement. This could include holding a series of indicative votes on different options, which would show what next steps MPs would be prepared to back. LIVE: Reaction as MPs prepare for no-deal vote PM: 'I understand voice of the country' Adler: EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Hammond's comments showed the government was being forced to ""look seriously"" at his party's proposals - which also include closer ties to the single market. After Tuesday's defeat, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the bloc ""cannot go any further"" in trying to persuade MPs to back the agreed terms of exit and it was down to the UK to sort out. MPs are voting on whether to block the UK from leaving the EU without an agreement later this month. If the government motion passes, the block on no-deal would only apply to the 29 March deadline. It wouldn't rule out the prospect of a no-deal exit later this year, if Parliament is ultimately unable to agree a way forward. Two amendments were also chosen by the Speaker John Bercow to be put to the Commons: Amendment (a) - put forward by Tory Caroline Spelman and Labour's Jack Dromey, which would remove the reference to 29 March and make the motion a straightforward rejection of no-deal Amendment (f) - known as the Malthouse Compromise, which includes terms for a ""managed"" no-deal, an extension of Brexit until 22 May and gives protection to citizens' rights Dame Caroline then told the Commons she wanted to withdraw the amendment, because the government motion would do the same job. But she was told by Mr Bercow that she could not withdraw it because other supporters of the amendment could ""persist with it"". Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit amendments: What will MPs vote on? The prime minister has said she will vote to rule out a no-deal, as per her own motion, but she has promised a ""free vote"" - meaning party bosses will not tell MPs which way to vote. There will also be a free vote allowed on the Malthouse Compromise, which was tabled by a group of both Remain and Leave-backing Tory MPs. Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, has already said she will vote in the opposite way, telling BBC Two's Politics Live that a no-deal Brexit was not the ""optimal scenario"", but it had to be left on the table. Delivering his Spring Statement to the Commons, Mr Hammond called on MPs across the Commons to ""remove the threat of an imminent no-deal exit hanging over our economy"" in the vote. He said the uncertainty that the possibility of a no-deal Brexit brought was damaging the UK economy, and the country's ""standing and reputation in the world"". But the chancellor then moved on to talk about a further vote that could take place on Thursday. If MPs vote against a no deal, the prime minister has said a motion would be tabled the following day allowing MPs to vote for an extension to Article 50 - the legal mechanism that sees the UK leaving the EU on 29 March. Mr Hammond said: ""Tomorrow [Thursday], we will have the opportunity to start to map out a way forward towards building a consensus across this House for a deal we can collectively support to exit the EU in an orderly way, to a future relationship that will allow Britain to flourish, protecting jobs and businesses."" He added that, while he had hoped MPs would reach a consensus during Tuesday's vote on Mrs May's deal, he was ""confident that we, as a House, will do it over the coming weeks"". The PM could compromise to get a hypothetical softer Brexit through the Commons - but days later find out that she could no longer govern. In this febrile atmosphere when the chancellor makes a call, as he has just done, for a ""consensus"" across Parliament to find a way out of this hole, he is also hinting very publicly to the prime minister that it might be time now to think about making that sacrifice. It's important to remember that Mr Hammond's preferred option all along has been to back the prime minister's deal, to try to get it through. But a mild-sounding call for compromise just now, is not necessarily politically mild at all. Read more from Laura Asked after the statement if the chancellor was setting out an alternative way forward from the prime minister, his spokeswoman insisted he ""wasn't indicating directionality"". But when pushed, she added: ""He's backed the deal up to now, the way forward will involve compromise. ""He believes compromise is the spirit in which we all have to try to find a way forward."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told reporters that the government was ""coming up to our agenda"". He added: ""All the way along we have been there with our proposals and now they are being forced to look at it seriously. ""I think the Cabinet and the Tory party are fracturing over where to go next and some of them may well now look seriously at our proposal."" He also said Mrs May should meet Mr Corbyn again, saying: ""I think the onus is upon the government now to start talking to people."" Jonathan Reynolds, Labour's shadow economic secretary, told Politics Live Mr Hammond ""can come and talk to us anytime"". But Liz Truss denied the chancellor had given up on the prime minister's deal and was instead seeking a consensus with Labour on a softer Brexit. ""Philip Hammond doesn't give up,"" she said. ""I don't believe he has given up on that."" A No 10 source told the Press Association said Mr Hammond was ""consistent"" with what the prime minister has said, adding: ""He clearly believes, as she does, that the best outcome for the country is to leave with a deal.""

Deadly shooting at Brazilian school,"People gathered outside the school in Suzano after the shooting The two gunmen who opened fire at a school in south-eastern Brazil and killed at least five teenagers were former pupils, officials say. The shooting happened at about 09:30 local time (12:30 GMT) when the students were on a break at the state school in Suzano, near SÃ£o Paulo. Two school employees and the owner of a nearby shop - from whom the attackers stole a car - also died. The gunmen, aged 17 and 25, both killed themselves after the attack. Police say they found a revolver, a bow and arrow, and items that appeared to be explosives. Why are there so many murders in Brazil? Country profile It is not yet known why the former pupils attacked the school - and while gun crime is common in Brazil, shootings of this nature are not. Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in January, has signed a decree making it easier for law-abiding citizens to own a gun, a key campaign promise, even though many restrictions remain in place. Raul Brasil school has some 1,000 primary and secondary students, aged between six and 18, and a language centre. It is located in downtown Suzano, some 50km (31 miles) from SÃ£o Paulo. Policemen secured the area around the school in Suzano The gunmen entered the school and shot dead co-ordinator Marilena Ferreira Umezo, 59, before killing another employee, said Marcelo Salles, commander of police forces in SÃ£o Paulo. They then killed and fatally wounded five students and injured several others before killing themselves in a hallway. Speaking to reporters outside the school, Mr Salles said that in his three decades with the police force he had ""never seen anything like this"". Shootings of this nature are not common in Brazil Only secondary students were at the school at the time of the shooting. Police arrived eight minutes after being called and did not confront the gunmen. ""I was in the classroom during our break.,externalI thought [the sound] was from bombs. When I realized they were gunshots, I stayed there. I only left when the police arrived,"" teacher Sandra Perez told O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper (in Portuguese). ""It's a very sad scene, the saddest thing I've seen in my entire life. The teenagers were brutally murdered,"" SÃ£o Paulo state governor JoÃ£o Doria said after visiting the school. A man was injured in another shooting near the school earlier, but police say they are still investigating if both cases are connected.

PM: 'I understand voice of the country',"This video can not be played MPs laugh after Theresa May accuses Jeremy Corbyn of asking a question without reading her deal Theresa May says she understands ""the voice of the country"" on Brexit, despite her own vocals wavering. Battling a sore throat at Prime Minister's Questions, she insisted the UK can still leave the EU with a ""good deal"" and said she would vote later to rule out a no-deal exit on 29 March. But Mrs May warned MPs they faced ""hard choices"" having rejected her deal for a second time. Jeremy Corbyn called on the PM to change course after the defeat. He said the deal had been ""decisively rejected"" and it was time for the prime minister to change her red lines. After the Commons rejected Mrs May's Brexit deal by 149 votes on Tuesday, the EU has warned the risk of a ""disorderly"" Brexit has never been higher. Its chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU ""cannot go any further"" in trying to persuade MPs to back the agreed terms of exit and the UK had to break the impasse. LIVE: Reaction as MPs prepare for no-deal vote Brexit: What could happen next? Adler: EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat MPs will vote at 19.00 GMT on whether to block the UK from leaving the EU without an agreement later this month. Wednesday's vote only applies to the 29 March deadline and would not rule out the prospect of a no-deal exit later this year, if Parliament is ultimately unable to agree a way forward. The Labour leader said the prime minister was in denial about her own deal's lack of support after MPs rejected it by a margin of 149 votes. He suggested his alternative plan to remain in a customs union was ""the only show in town"". ""Isn't it time she moved on from her red lines and faced the reality of the situation she has got herself, her party, this parliament and this country into?"" he said. But dismissing calls from Tory MPs to embrace a no-deal exit now, Mrs May said her deal remained the best way to honour the 2016 referendum result. ""I may not have my own voice but I understand the voice of the country,"" she said. ""I believe we have a good deal. No deal is better than a bad deal but I have been working for us to leave on 29 March and leave with a good deal."" This video can not be played Theresa May says businesses worry about Brexit uncertainty, but are more worried about a ""Corbyn government"" The EU has urged the UK to take ""responsibility"" for its actions. ""Again the House of Commons says what it doesn't want,"" Mr Barnier told the European Parliament. ""Now this impasse can only be solved in the UK. The EU, he suggested, had gone ""as far as it possibly can"" to satisfy MPs' concerns over the agreement, particularly in relation to the backstop, an insurance policy to stop a hard border on the island of Ireland. ""If the UK still wants to leave the EU in an orderly manner, this treaty is, and will remain, the only treaty possible,"" he said.

Mrs May has said Tory MPs will get a free vote. That means ministers and MPs can make their own mind up rather than following the orders of party managers - an unusual move for a vote on a major policy. The no-deal debate will begin after Chancellor Philip Hammond's Spring Statement economic update. Leaving the EU in 16 days' time remains the UK's default position under the law, unless talks are extended. If a no-deal exit is rejected, MPs will vote on Thursday on delaying Brexit by extending Article 50 - the legal mechanism that takes the UK out of the EU. The EU has said it would need ""a credible justification"" before agreeing to any extension. Such a move would have to be agreed by every member state. Although the PM managed to convince about 40 Tory MPs to change their mind, it was not nearly enough to overturn the historic 230 vote defeat she suffered on the same deal in January. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Despite Tuesday's defeat, the BBC News political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, there were ministers who believed it could still ultimately prevail as other options gradually fell by the wayside due to lack of parliamentary support. Labour wants no-deal to be ""taken off the table"" and is likely to back an amendment - a legislative tool - tabled by MPs Jack Dromey and Caroline Spelman ruling out the UK leaving without an agreement at any stage in the process. Disgraced MP back to vote on Brexit deal The papers: Brexit 'mayhem' and 'the house of fools' Sturgeon: 'People must decide' Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBC that Parliament would increasingly ""set the agenda"" if the government was not in control of events. She said No 10 should consider giving MPs a free vote on the full range of options for the UK's relationship with the EU - including Labour's own plans for a customs union. What isn't clear is how the prime minister actually intends to dig herself out of this dreadful political hole. Some of her colleagues around the Cabinet table think it shows she has to tack to a closer deal with the EU. Some of them believe it's time now to go hell-for-leather to leave without an overarching deal but move to make as much preparation as possible, and fast. Other ministers believe genuinely, still with around two weeks to go, and an EU summit next week, there is still time to try to manoeuvre her deal through - somehow. Read more from Laura Among other proposals which could be discussed on Wednesday is a plan for the UK to leave without a formal agreement but with a number of safeguards to minimise economic disruption. Disgraced MP back to vote on Brexit deal The papers: Brexit 'mayhem' and 'the house of fools' Sturgeon: 'People must decide' The plan, known as the Malthouse compromise, is backed by Brexiteer members of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, as well as the DUP and former Remain ministers like Nicky Morgan and Damian Green. It would see the controversial backstop replaced by alternative arrangements, an extended pay-as-you-go transition period and a series of ""standstill"" arrangements for various industries until the end of 2021. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM's Brexit plan ""is dead"" Amid reports Brexiteer ministers have been granted a free vote on this proposal, Tory MP Steve Baker told BBC News the plan - which would see Brexit delayed until 22 May - was ""eminently reasonable"".

Cliff collapse shuts 'Broadchurch' beach,"An estimated 1,000 tonnes of rock and debris has cut off the beach between West Bay and Freshwater A section of beach that featured in the ITV crime drama Broadchurch has been shut after a large cliff fall. About 1,000 tonnes of rock and debris fell at East Beach in West Bay, Dorset, at about 17:30 GMT on Tuesday, the coastguard said. Following searches by coastguard teams, fire crews and rescue dogs, no-one is believed to be trapped in the rubble. The Jurassic Coast path and beach between West Bay and Freshwater were closed for a time. The ITV drama Broadchurch is set in a fictional town in Dorset The Jurassic Coast path between West Bay and Freshwater was closed following the rockfall and has since reopened Engineers and a geologist are inspecting the area. A West Bay Coastguard spokesman said: ""Please stay well away from the cliff fall and surrounding area as further cliff falls could happen at any time and without warning."" The Jurassic Coast Trust said the fall had left ""potentially dangerous overhangs"" and repeated warnings to stay clear from the base and top of the cliffs. ""This type of fall happens suddenly and normally without warning, and is part of the process of natural erosion that makes our World Heritage coastline so beautiful and important for understanding the history of our planet,"" a statement said. In 2012, touristCharlotte Blackman died at nearby Hive Beachwhen she was buried under a rockfall. West Bay featured in ITV series which starred Oscar winner Olivia Colman and David Tennant.

Michael Jackson bus ads 'perpetuate fear',"Transport for London says it will be removing advertisements that proclaim Michael Jackson is innocent. The decision comes after a sexual assault victims' charity said it was ""concerned"" about the adverts that have appeared on buses and bus stops. Posters were put up in response to a documentary in which the singer is accused of child sex abuse. The adverts have been financed through a crowdfunding campaign and feature the slogan: ""Facts don't lie. People do."" The Survivors Trust said the message could discourage victims of sexual assault from coming forward. In a statement to BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat, TfL says: ""We have reviewed our position and will be removing these advertisements. ""They have been rejected due to the public sensitivity and concern around their content."" The person who took this photo, who wants to remain anonymous, said: ""A blanket statement to say that people lie is damaging to victims of sexual assault"" The Leaving Neverland documentary, broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 last week, featured claims bytwo men who say they were sexually abused by Michael Jacksonwhen they were young. Wade Robson and James Safechuck claim they were molested and described the alleged incidents in graphic detail. The singer died in 2009 so cannot defend himself, but his family and fans have been protesting his innocence since the film was broadcast. Michael Jackson's nephew Taj told Radio 1 Newsbeat the allegations in Leaving Neverland felt like""the ultimate betrayal""but he believes they won't have a lasting effect on his uncle's legacy. Leaving Neverland: Is Michael Jackson's legacy ruined? This video can not be played ""Every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me"" The poster campaign appeared after a ""Michael Jackson Innocent"" crowdfunding page hit its Â£20,000 target. The page says: ""Like countless others within the MJ Community and society in general, we would not think twice in turning our backs on his legacy, if we for one second felt that there was any truth at all in these heinous events... There is a huge group in society that believe and know he is innocent."" It is reportedly being led by former Big Brother UK contestant and Jackson fanatic Seany O'Kane. However the Survivors Trust said the adverts were inappropriate. ""We have been particularly concerned by the recent news that TfL has chosen to run an advertising campaign... that endorses Jackson's innocence,"" a statement from the charity said. ""The decision to prioritise advertising revenue over the option of remaining neutral on such an emotive topic is disappointing."" Neverland - Michael Jackson's home The charity said victims of sexual assault often did not come forward because they thought that they would not be believed.

Duckenfield 'will not be giving evidence',"Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield will not testify in his trial for the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 football fans. Starting the defence case, Benjamin Myers QC, told the jury at Preston Crown Court: ""We don't call Mr Duckenfield to give evidence."" The 74-year-old is on trial alongside Graham Mackrell, 69, the former club secretary at Sheffield Wednesday, who is accused of a safety offence. Both men deny the charges. The trial follows a crush in the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace during the 1989 Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final. Benjamin Myers QC called statements from Bernard Murray, who was the retired chief superintendent's deputy on the day and has since died. In a statement made on 2 May 1989, Mr Murray said the plan for policing the match was the same one adopted in 1988 when the same teams met at the same venue. At that game the match commander was Chief Superintendent Brian Mole, but he had been moved just weeks before the 1989 game and replaced by Mr Duckenfield. A reduction by 10% in the numbers of officers on duty at the game was agreed during a series of pre-match meetings attended by senior ranks. At a meeting with Mr Mole, a request to switch ends of the ground, so Liverpool fans were given the Kop end, was rejected. On the day of the disaster, Mr Duckenfield gave all those on duty a briefing before they went to the control room ahead of the game. By 14:30, Mr Murray's statement said there was a ""large crowd"" outside the Leppings Lane turnstile but he ""remarked"" to his boss that they still had time to ""get them in"". They agreed kick-off would only be delayed if there was an ""identifiable problem"" such as congestion on the motorway approach to the city or bad weather. Mr Murray's statement said officers became ""exasperated"" at the poor communications as the radios were not working properly, and at 14:45 the first request came in to ""open the gates"" to relieve crush pressure at the turnstiles. As more requests came in to open the gates, Mr Murray's statement continued: ""I turned around to Chief Supt Duckenfield and said, 'Mr Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates?' ""He replied, 'Open the gates.""' Graham Mackrell denies failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act The jury was then told of Mr Murray's evidence to the 1989 Taylor Inquiry into the disaster. At that time he was asked where he thought all the fans being let in were going to go. He replied: ""I never considered where they were all going to go."" Mr Murray told the inquiry he never checked the readily available turnstile numbers, to see how many fans still had to enter the Leppings Lane terrace, and he did not appreciate they would go down the tunnel leading directly to the central pens. The defence case for Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield concluded, one hour and 14 minutes after it began. Co-defendant Graham Mackrell was also not called to give evidence as the court heard his defence case. Jurors were earlier told they would be directed to return a not guilty verdict for Mr Mackrell on a charge of contravening the stadium's safety certificate due to ""insufficient evidence"". The 69-year-old remains on trial charged with failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The jury heard eight character references for Mr Mackrell, including statements from Roy Hattersley, the Sheffield-born former Labour MP and former manager of Sheffield Wednesday, Howard Wilkinson, who worked with Mr Mackrell between 1983 and 1988. His statement read: ""In relation to administrative matters, Graham's work was always of a high standard. ""He worked hard, was self-motivated and brought a professional quality to his role. ""I found him to be entirely dependable, highly regarded by the board of directors. ""In all respects I found Graham to be competent, proficient and trustworthy."" Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster. The trial continues.

Children killed in Lagos school collapse,"This video can not be played Deaths confirmed in Lagos school collapse At least 10 people have died and many more are feared trapped after a building containing a school collapsed in the Nigerian city of Lagos. The school, which was on the top floor of the four-storey building in Ita Faji on Lagos Island, had more than 100 pupils, a rescue official told the BBC. About 40 pupils had been pulled out alive, the official said. The building had been identified as ""distressed"" and listed for demolition, Lagos building officials told the BBC. The collapse happened at about 10:00 local time (09:00 GMT). There were frantic scenes at the site as rescuers and local men searched for survivors, and family members crowded the area in the hope of finding their loved ones alive. This video can not be played Eyewitness says ""everybody had to run for their lives"" The collapsed building was a residential block containing a number of apartments as well as the school, residents and rescue officials at the scene told the BBC. Emergency teams pulled several injured pupils from the rubble, but many worried parents at the scene were unable to find their children, while others went to a local hospital to look for theirs. It Is not clear how many children remain trapped Men from the local area were assisting rescuers but large crowds of people were hindering the rescue operation. Mohammed Muftau, a local resident who witnessed the collapse, told the BBC that the building had been cracking for long time and that complaints had been raised about it. The Lagos State Building Control Agency confirmed to the BBC that the building had been marked and listed for demolition. It is not unusual for buildings to collapse in Nigeria; materials are often sub-standard and the enforcement of regulations is lax. In September 2014, 116 people died when a six-storey building collapsed in Lagos during a service given by a celebrity televangelist. And in 2016, more than 100 people died when the roof of a church in Uyo, in the south of Nigeria, caved in. Rescuers were working frantically to free those trapped under the rubble At the Lagos Island General Hospital, there was a scene of chaos as parents and family members scrambled after every ambulance that arrived to see if it contained a loved one. Many of the victims brought in were children in school uniforms. Visiting the hospital, the Lagos state deputy governor, Idiat Oluranti Adebule, offered condolences to the families of the victims and called for calm. ""We plead for their understanding to allow the rescue team to do their work... so that the medical team can take prompt and immediate action as soon as the patients are brought in,"" she told the BBC. President Muhammadu Buhari offered his condolences to the families of the victims. ""It touches one to lose precious lives in any kind of mishap, particularly those so young and tender,"" he said. ""May God grant everyone affected by this sad incident fortitude and succour."" Are you in the area? If it is safe to do so please contact us by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

K-pop industry sex scandal grows,"A second K-pop star has dramatically quit the music business, in a growing industry sex scandal. Jung Joon-young, 30, admitted to secretly filming himself having sex with women and sharing the footage. ""I admit to all my crimes,"" said Jung in a statement. He also promised to drop all his TV and music work. It comes a day aftersuperstar Seungri from the group Big Bang quit the industryafter he was charged with sex bribery. Jung, who is accused of taping 10 or more women, is due to be questioned by Seoul Metropolitan Police on Thursday. ""I filmed women without their consent and shared it in a chatroom, and while I was doing so I didn't feel a great sense of guilt,"" said Jung in the statement released late on Tuesday. It came after South Korean broadcaster SBS reported allegations that he had filmed his own sex videos without his partners' permission, and shared them with friends in a mobile chat group during 2015-16. S Korea women protest at hidden sex cams South Korea's spy cam porn epidemic #MeToo takes hold in South Korea He apologised to the fans he had ""outraged"", and to the women whose privacy he violated. ""Throughout the rest of my life, I will repent on my immoral and illegal acts that constitute crimes,"" he said. ""I will faithfully cooperate with an investigation by police that will start on Thursday and I will readily accept whatever punishment is in store for me."" This is not the first time Jung has been accused of filming a sexual encounter without consent. An ex-girlfriend made an allegation against him in 2016, but ultimately withdrew it. The singer-songwriter, best known for his part in a variety show, claimed she had agreed to the filming. South Korea has been fighting an epidemic of ""spy cam porn"" in recent years. Hidden cameras are sometimes placed in toilets and changing rooms, then uploaded online without the knowledge of victims. The country saw more than 6,000 cases reported in 2017 alone. This video can not be played The use of hidden and up-skirt cameras is a huge problem in South Korea The case against Jung was discovered during a separate police investigation into K-pop superstar Seungri - who was reportedly a member of Jung's group chat. Seungri, whose boyband Big-bang have sold more than 140 million records, has been charged with supplying prostitutes to potential business investors - and police reportedly found Jung's videos while investigating that case.

Brexit amendments: What MPs will vote on?,"MPs will vote later on whether or not the UK should leave the EU without a deal. Backbench MPs and opposition parties put forward eight amendments to show which direction they want the government to take on Brexit. Speaker John Bercow has selected two of them to be put to the vote in the Commons later. LIVE: MPs prepare to vote on no-deal Brexit EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat The government motion for debate is: That this House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship on 29 March 2019; and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this House and the EU ratify an agreement. Jack Dromey and Caroline Spelman are working across party lines The amendment (a) from Labour MP Jack Dromey and Conservative Dame Caroline Spelman changes the wording of the government motion to ""this House rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship"". Dame Caroline told MPs she wanted to withdraw the amendment, because Theresa May's government motion would do the same job. But she was told by Commons Speaker John Bercow that she could not withdraw it because other signatories could ""persist with it"". The 'Alternative Arrangements Working Group' is formed of Tory leavers and remainers working on the 'Malthouse Compromise' This amendment (f) sets out the process for a ""managed no-deal"". It requests: The government publish tariff schedules An extension of leaving to 22 May 2019 'Mutual standstill agreements' between the UK and EU until the end of 2021, including payments to the EU A unilateral guarantee of citizens' rights It is called the Malthouse compromise because it was put together by Conservative minister Kit Malthouse, but it has been tabled in the name of former Conservative minister Damian Green. It is supported by members of the Brexiteer European Research Group of Conservative MPs and former Remain supporters such as Mr Green and Nicky Morgan. Some members of the Independent Group left their parties over Brexit Amendment (d) states that ""under no circumstances"" should the UK leave without a deal, listing the alternatives as revocation of the UK's intention to leave, extension of the Article 50 period or a second referendum. Amendment (e) scraps the second half of the government motion, shortening it to: ""that this House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship on 29 March 2019"" It was tabled by the Independent Group, which is consists of eight former Labour MPs and three former Tories, who are all supporters of another EU referendum, and who quit their parties in protest at their Brexit policies. Amendment (c) calls for an extension to the Article 50 leaving process to 2021, or until a future relationship is agreed. The amendment also requests a second referendum to take place, on whether or not the UK should leave with the agreed deal, or remain in the EU. Ken Clarke One final amendment - (b) was tabled by former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke, Labour's Keith Vaz and the SNP's Angus MacNeil. It simply calls for the revocation of Article 50 to cancel Brexit. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford expresses his concern at a no-deal Brexit Amendment (h), tabled by the SNP, calls for the UK to not leave the EU without a deal ""under any circumstances"", regardless of the exit date. It further gives MPs the option to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh wants no-deal to remain on the table Amendment (g) was tabled by Tory Brexiteer Sir Edward Leigh. The amendment calls for the option of no-deal to be kept on the table during the government's continued negotiations with the EU.

Free sanitary products promised for schoolsCampaigners say the chancellor's announcement is an huge step towards tackling period poverty.UK,"Amika George started campaigning on period poverty when she was 17 years old Government funding for free sanitary products in all English secondary schools and colleges has been welcomed as a ""huge step"" by campaigners. Amika George, 19, who started campaigning on period poverty two years ago, said the move would make a ""massive difference"" to girls who struggled to afford tampons and pads. But campaigners said it should also include primary schools. Chancellor Philip Hammond made the announcement in hisSpring Statement. He said the government was responding to concerns from head teachers that some girls were missing school because they could not afford sanitary products. One in 10 girls between the ages of 14 and 21 in the UK have been unable to afford sanitary products, while 49% have missed an entire day of school because of their period,according to research by Plan International,external. Last year the Scottish government announced a Â£5.2m scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities. The Treasury said the Department for Education would now develop a similar scheme for England. Is there period poverty in the UK? Surviving period poverty with 'socks and tissues' Ms George, now a student at Cambridge University, was inspired to start campaigning on the issue after reading about period poverty in the news. She said she was ""shocked"" to find out girls were missing school because of not having sanitary products. ""I was still at school myself at the time and I couldn't imagine having to deal with that,"" she said. In 2017 she started a petition calling for the government to fund free sanitary products in schools, using social media to build support for her campaign. Just a few months later she organised a protest outside Downing Street which attracted around 2,000 people. In January this year she launched alegal campaign,externalalongsidethe Red Box Project,externalandThe Pink Protest,external, arguing that period poverty was denying some girls their right to an education. Reacting to the funding announcement Ms George said it was an ""amazing first step"" and the government had ""finally taken action against period poverty"". However she said the scheme should also be available in primary schools, as some children can start menstruating as young as eight, and it should be enshrined in law to ensure future governments had a legal obligation to maintain the commitment. Amika George helped organise a protest of 2,000 people against period poverty Gemma Abbott, from the Red Box Project, which provides free sanitary products to schools across the country, agreed the announcement was a ""huge step forward"" and ""long overdue"". Ms Abbott said her organisation had been contacted by hundreds of schools asking for help to provide products for their students. Many schools relied on individual teachers to provide tampons and sanitary pads or even charged pupils because they did not have the funds to give them out for free, she said. ""Schools do their best but it's really important we relieve them of this burden,"" she added. She said some girls were forced to use toilet roll, newspaper or socks because they could not pay for sanitary products. ""The experience of being unable to access these products can affect a child's ability to reach their potential,"" she said. ""Who is going to be able to concentrate properly in lessons if you are worrying about leaking or spending your lunch money on sanitary products?"" Gemma Abbot said the announcement was ""long overdue"" Ms George said she hoped her campaign had also helped tackle the stigma around periods. ""Part of the reason period poverty hasn't been addressed is because of the taboo around the subject,"" she said. ""But now so many more people are talking about it - it's almost like there's a period revolution happening at the moment."" She said the campaign also showed the impact young people could have. ""I was literally 17 years old, doing it from my laptop in my bedroom,"" she said. ""I think it's testament to the fact that politics is really changing at the moment. ""Young people don't have to rely on MPs to start campaigns, they can do it themselves using social media.""

Three years for mum who let baby drownSarah Morris is convicted of the gross negligence manslaughter of her one-year-old daughter Rosie.Wales,"Sarah Morris said she left her children alone for no longer than three minutes A mother has been jailed for three years after leaving her baby girl to drown in the bath. Sarah Morris, 35, was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter of one-year-old Rosie on Wednesday. Rosie drowned in waist-deep bath water at Morris's flat in Greenfield near Holywell, Flintshire, on 29 July 2015. Mold Crown Court heardMorris spent 47 minutes talking to her partner while Rosie and her twin were left.alone in the bath. The conversation only ended when Sarah Swindells suggested Morris should go and check on the children. Morris had been given help from Flintshire council and received a leaflet detailing the dangers of leaving children unattended in the bath just two weeks before Rosie died. She had also been in regular contact with social workers and it was their view she was ""doing an OK job"". A former partner said she was in the habit of putting herself before her children and prosecutor Oliver Saxby said after the verdict there was evidence of her ""drinking to excess and taking drugs"". Traces of amphetamine was found in a bag in her bedroom. Defence barrister Patrick Harrington QC said: ""The culpability of the death of your own child is massive and it's a burden she's going to have to carry for the rest of her life."" Defence barrister Patrick Harrington QC said Morris's future was ""now bleak"" Morris claimed she left her children alone for no longer than ""two or three"" minutes, with the court hearing she had to be stopped from banging her head on a wall when she realised Rosie was dead. The defence claimed it was a ""tragic accident"" for which a loving mother, doing her best, bore no criminal responsibility. Mr Justice Picken told Morris he recognised the ""profound effect"" the death of her daughter had on her. He said there was no evidence she neglected her children in the same way before but it meant the loss of ""a young girl rich in promise"" and left her twin brother without his sister. The judge also said it would be wrong to bear in mind, in sentencing, issues raised after the verdict regarding her character as these had been untested during the trial. Mr Justice Picken said he recognised she was remorseful and said Mr Harrington was ""sadly right"" when he described her future prospects as bleak. Nicola Rees of the Crown Prosecution Service said Morris left her two young children ""in an extremely vulnerable position for a prolonged period"". ""The CPS presented evidence showing that Sarah Morris had been made aware, on a number of occasions, of the dangers involved in bathing young children, but nevertheless, on this particular day, she chose to put her own needs above those of her children, resulting in Rosie's tragic death from drowning,"" she added. In a victim impact statement, Rosie's grandmother said: ""On 29 July 2015, my life changed forever. ""I received the worst phone call of my life from paramedics, telling me there'd been an accident and I needed to go to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd. ""The image of what I saw there will be with me forever. She was lying dead in a crib in the hospital. I never thought that my beautiful granddaughter would lose her life.""

Kuenssberg: Hammond's message to May,"I know the idea that cabinet ministers stick to a script is deeply old fashioned. But for a chancellor to stand right in front of a prime minister and, even obliquely, tell them to change course, as Chancellor Philip Hammond has just done in his Spring Statement, is quite something. Mr Hammond's remarks might, in fact, be a step towards so-called indicative votes in the Commons, where a range of potential plans are presented to MPs - and maybe soon. Some ministers have argued privately for that for some time, although it's been frowned on by Number 10. LIVE: MPs debate no-deal Brexit ahead of vote Hammond calls for compromise on Brexit His remarks may delight some of his colleagues, who believe ""reasonable Remainer"" MPs have been locked out of the process for too long. Mr Hammond's team are already insisting there is no difference between him and Number 10. But for weeks a debate has raged at Westminster about what to do if the prime minister's deal can't get through the House of Commons. And for weeks it's been clear that there is a contingent in cabinet who think the solution to the gridlock is to move to a closer Brexit relationship with the EU, a compromise that could get a wider form of cross-party consensus. That has not, though, been Number 10's view. The prime minister has been trying to hold on to her negotiated deal, whatever happens, and to resist - at almost all costs - softening up her Brexit offer in any way, scrubbing out any more of her red lines. Because, while it is easy to say - and sounds eminently reasonable - to call for compromise, there's a huge political risk. The PM could compromise to get a hypothetical softer Brexit through the Commons - but days later find out that she could no longer govern. In this febrile atmosphere when the chancellor makes a call, as he has just done, for a ""consensus"" across Parliament to find a way out of this hole, he is also hinting very publicly to the prime minister that it might be time now to think about making that sacrifice. It's important to remember that Mr Hammond's preferred option all along has been to back the prime minister's deal, to try to get it through. But a mild-sounding call for compromise just now, is not necessarily politically mild at all.

Six things to know about the Spring Statement,"Chancellor Philip Hammond delivers his Spring Statement on Wednesday. While it will not be an occasion for announcements on tax and spending - that's for the Budget - there are likely to be new forecasts for economic growth. And coming amid a crucial series of Brexit votes, Mr Hammond may indicate that a no-deal could thwart his intention to end austerity. He has, after all, been one of the Cabinet's vocal soft Brexit backers. That is to say, don't expect any significant announcements on tax and spending. The chancellor himself has dubbed it a fiscal ""non-event"". Why bother then? Since 1975, the government has been legally obliged to produce its projections for the economy and the public finances twice a year. Chancellors have interpreted this in different ways, with most opting for a main annual Budget and then a mini version. In 2016, however, Mr Hammond said that he'd be focussing on an autumn budget - and he seems determined to uphold this. UK economy stalls despite strong January What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy? As anyone who has to complete tax returns will know, January is a bumper month for payments. Even so, an unprecedented Â£21bn was collected via income tax and corporation tax in January. This means the government is on track to have a smaller deficit (the amount it has to borrow to fund spending) this financial year. It expected that shortfall to be Â£25.5bn. Now it's likely to be only about half the Â£40bn or so the government was predicting about a year ago. The chancellor may have more money to play with, more wiggle room - and his boss, the prime minister hailed the end of austerity last autumn. Public services - from policing to education and local government - have felt the squeeze on budgets. Many have seen their funds plummet once inflation is taken into account since 2010, and services cut as a result. But Mr Hammond won't be splashing the cash just yet. While the uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit remains, he can't afford to. He may need extra funds if say, a no-deal, hampers activity - and that might damage tax take too. Even with a deal, the Bank of England predicts that the economy is set to expand at its slowest rate this year since the crisis. The chancellor's forecasts, prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, are likely to show the same. Part of the downgrade will be down to disappointing business investment in the wake of the referendum, and part reflecting an unexpected slowdown elsewhere, particularly in the likes of Germany and Italy. Two big questions remain. Will there be the ""deal dividend"" that the chancellor has touted before, that is, a rebound in corporate and consumer spending if and when the uncertainty lifts? (The Bank of England is less confident). And how could the loss of momentum and confidence impact our impressive track record on employment? These statements are often marked by what isn't explicitly announced, and this one will be no different. Benefits, for example, are scheduled to be frozen again, as is the income level at which parents stop being eligible for child benefit. It's not all bad news: the income tax personal allowance is destined to rise to Â£12,500. The fuel duty freeze is scheduled to continue. The chancellor may also take the opportunity to update on reviews and initiatives. For example, he commissioned a report on competition in the digital sector last summer. Few chancellors can resist the temptation to pull the traditional rabbit out of the hat at fiscal events - that is, provide a few sweeteners. For all his protestations that this spring statement is a non-event, Mr Hammond may not be that different. UK economy stalls despite strong January What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy?

"Deadly shooting at Brazilian schoolAt least five students and an adult are killed at the school in Suzano, SÃ£o Paulo state, police say.Latin America & Caribbean","People gathered outside the school in Suzano after the shooting The two gunmen who opened fire at a school in south-eastern Brazil and killed at least five teenagers were former pupils, officials say. The shooting happened at about 09:30 local time (12:30 GMT) when the students were on a break at the state school in Suzano, near SÃ£o Paulo. Two school employees and the owner of a nearby shop - from whom the attackers stole a car - also died. The gunmen, aged 17 and 25, both killed themselves after the attack. Police say they found a revolver, a bow and arrow, and items that appeared to be explosives. Why are there so many murders in Brazil? Country profile It is not yet known why the former pupils attacked the school - and while gun crime is common in Brazil, shootings of this nature are not. Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in January, has signed a decree making it easier for law-abiding citizens to own a gun, a key campaign promise, even though many restrictions remain in place. Raul Brasil school has some 1,000 primary and secondary students, aged between six and 18, and a language centre. It is located in downtown Suzano, some 50km (31 miles) from SÃ£o Paulo. Policemen secured the area around the school in Suzano The gunmen entered the school and shot dead co-ordinator Marilena Ferreira Umezo, 59, before killing another employee, said Marcelo Salles, commander of police forces in SÃ£o Paulo. They then killed and fatally wounded five students and injured several others before killing themselves in a hallway. Speaking to reporters outside the school, Mr Salles said that in his three decades with the police force he had ""never seen anything like this"". Shootings of this nature are not common in Brazil Only secondary students were at the school at the time of the shooting. Police arrived eight minutes after being called and did not confront the gunmen. ""I was in the classroom during our break.,externalI thought [the sound] was from bombs. When I realized they were gunshots, I stayed there. I only left when the police arrived,"" teacher Sandra Perez told O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper (in Portuguese). ""It's a very sad scene, the saddest thing I've seen in my entire life. The teenagers were brutally murdered,"" SÃ£o Paulo state governor JoÃ£o Doria said after visiting the school. A man was injured in another shooting near the school earlier, but police say they are still investigating if both cases are connected. The last major school shooting in Brazil happened in 2011,when 12 students were shot dead by a gunman in Rio de Janeiro. Why are there so many murders in Brazil?

Swiss and French climbers died in avalancheThree climbers died and fourth is seriously injured in hospital following Tuesday's incident.Highlands & Islands,"Police at the scene of Ben Nevis rescue effort Two of three climbers who died in an avalanche on Ben Nevis on Tuesday were from France and the other from Switzerland, police have confirmed. Swiss authorities had earlier confirmed the death of one Swiss national and that another was injured. The Frenchmen were aged 41 and 32 and the Swiss man who died was 43. Mathieu Biselx, the 30-year-old survivor of the avalanche in Number 5 Gully, has been receiving treatment in hospital in Glasgow. His condition was described as ""stable"". Mr Biselx is the president of the Sion section of the Swiss Alpine Club. His companions were also club members. Third person dead after Ben Nevis avalanche A Swiss embassy spokeswoman told the BBC Scotland news website: ""Swiss authorities are in contact with the Scottish authorities as well as with the families in Switzerland."" According to the Swiss newspaper, Le Nouvelliste,external, all four men lived in Valais in the Swiss Alps and had left for Scotland on Sunday. Mr Biselx told the newspaper: ""It's terrible, they're not here anymore. They won't see their families again."" He added: ""We weren't very high up and suddenly we heard a noise. ""We looked round and two seconds later we were carried away by heavy, compact snow. When I regained consciousness only my head and an arm were sticking out of the snow."" Donald Paterson, of Lochaber MRT, said the avalanche in Number 5 Gully was seen by other climbers The avalanche on the mountain, near Fort William, is one of the worst Scottish climbing accidents in recent years. Twenty-nine volunteer mountain rescuers were involved in the rescue operation as well as a group of military personnel from the Joint Services Mountain Training Centre. Lochaber MRT said conditions on the mountain were ""very difficult with very high winds, snow and thunder and lightning"". A Coastguard helicopter involved in the rescue effort The weather hampered the efforts of Coastguard helicopter crews, despite ""some excellent flying"", the team said. The alarm was raised by a Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) forecaster and a guide climbing who were in the area. SAIS assesses potential avalanche risk for Lochaber, where Ben Nevis is located, and five other mountain areas,external. Donald Paterson, Lochaber MRT deputy team leader, told BBC Scotland the avalanche occurred above where the party of climbers were. He said the SAIS forecaster had seen a ""plume"" coming out of the gully, but could not see if anyone was in the path of the snow slide from their position. Mr Paterson said: ""The second confirmation (of the avalanche) came from a guide, who was on the opposite side of the coire and witnessed the slide coming down and the people below. ""Initially it was thought there were two people, but when we reached them it was confirmed there were four in the party."" Mountain rescue teams, the coastguard, police and ambulance service were involved in the rescue effort Insp Isla Campbell, of Police Scotland, said: ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those involved in the avalanche on Ben Nevis yesterday. ""Formal identification will take place in due course and the next of kin of those involved have now all been informed. ""I would again like to thank the volunteers from Lochaber and Glencoe mountain rescue teams and the members of the public who assisted with this incident, in what was extremely challenging conditions."" Insp Campbell urged walkers and climbers to carefully plan their trips into the hills, and to check weather and avalanche forecasts. She added: ""We do not want to put anyone off enjoying the great outdoors activities we have here in Scotland but we would ask that people plan their routes, take sensible precautions and consider whether it is safe to climb a particular route. ""The environment of the Scottish mountains is by its very nature an unpredictable one and it is important that people take as many precautions and plan ahead as much as possible if they are going to go climbing, especially at this time of year."" Brian Tregaskis, secretary of the Lochaber MRT, added: ""The members of the Lochaber and Glencoe Mountain Rescue teams did an incredible job in very difficult conditions. ""We'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of those who lost their lives and we hope the surviving casualty makes a full and speedy recovery."" Lochaber MRT said the incident was the third avalanche in Number 5 Gully since Saturday. On Saturday evening, a party of four climbers were ""avalanched"".

"Duckenfield 'will not be giving evidence'The Hillsborough match commander will not be giving evidence in his defence, the court hears.Liverpool","Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield will not testify in his trial for the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 football fans. Starting the defence case, Benjamin Myers QC, told the jury at Preston Crown Court: ""We don't call Mr Duckenfield to give evidence."" The 74-year-old is on trial alongside Graham Mackrell, 69, the former club secretary at Sheffield Wednesday, who is accused of a safety offence. Both men deny the charges. The trial follows a crush in the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace during the 1989 Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final. Benjamin Myers QC called statements from Bernard Murray, who was the retired chief superintendent's deputy on the day and has since died. In a statement made on 2 May 1989, Mr Murray said the plan for policing the match was the same one adopted in 1988 when the same teams met at the same venue. At that game the match commander was Chief Superintendent Brian Mole, but he had been moved just weeks before the 1989 game and replaced by Mr Duckenfield. A reduction by 10% in the numbers of officers on duty at the game was agreed during a series of pre-match meetings attended by senior ranks. At a meeting with Mr Mole, a request to switch ends of the ground, so Liverpool fans were given the Kop end, was rejected. On the day of the disaster, Mr Duckenfield gave all those on duty a briefing before they went to the control room ahead of the game. By 14:30, Mr Murray's statement said there was a ""large crowd"" outside the Leppings Lane turnstile but he ""remarked"" to his boss that they still had time to ""get them in"". They agreed kick-off would only be delayed if there was an ""identifiable problem"" such as congestion on the motorway approach to the city or bad weather. Mr Murray's statement said officers became ""exasperated"" at the poor communications as the radios were not working properly, and at 14:45 the first request came in to ""open the gates"" to relieve crush pressure at the turnstiles. As more requests came in to open the gates, Mr Murray's statement continued: ""I turned around to Chief Supt Duckenfield and said, 'Mr Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates?' ""He replied, 'Open the gates.""' Graham Mackrell denies failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act The jury was then told of Mr Murray's evidence to the 1989 Taylor Inquiry into the disaster. At that time he was asked where he thought all the fans being let in were going to go. He replied: ""I never considered where they were all going to go."" Mr Murray told the inquiry he never checked the readily available turnstile numbers, to see how many fans still had to enter the Leppings Lane terrace, and he did not appreciate they would go down the tunnel leading directly to the central pens. The defence case for Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield concluded, one hour and 14 minutes after it began. Co-defendant Graham Mackrell was also not called to give evidence as the court heard his defence case. Jurors were earlier told they would be directed to return a not guilty verdict for Mr Mackrell on a charge of contravening the stadium's safety certificate due to ""insufficient evidence"". The 69-year-old remains on trial charged with failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The jury heard eight character references for Mr Mackrell, including statements from Roy Hattersley, the Sheffield-born former Labour MP and former manager of Sheffield Wednesday, Howard Wilkinson, who worked with Mr Mackrell between 1983 and 1988. His statement read: ""In relation to administrative matters, Graham's work was always of a high standard. ""He worked hard, was self-motivated and brought a professional quality to his role. ""I found him to be entirely dependable, highly regarded by the board of directors. ""In all respects I found Graham to be competent, proficient and trustworthy.""

10 ways you could be affected by no-deal Brexit,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external. The process could take up to four months. Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,the government has warned that it may become more expensive.,external Full government travel advice,external How will it affect my holidays to Europe? While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU. The government has announced a further Â£434m of funding and other measures, including: extra warehouse space for medicines securing additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone building buffer stocks booking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment making changes to regulatory requirements strengthening processes to deal with shortages However, the National Audit Office has said there are still""significant"" gapsin the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes. Government advice on medicine supply,external Should NHS patients be worried? About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries. The UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now. In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"". The government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing Â£138m. It advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevantcountry advice pages.,external Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country. However, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority. Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries. These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights. Full government advice for UK nationals living in the EU,external How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Drivers UK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK. There are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum. Statisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline. If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has atool to find out what you need to do and when.,external Government advice on applying for settled and pre-settled status,external Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has warned thatthe UK will deport EU citizensafter Brexit if they do not apply for the right to remain in time. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure. As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal. But bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder. Will the value of your home change in 2019? Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The government has also announced Â£344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations. Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17. UK universities say they would expecta similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.,external The government and the EU have agreed thatpeople who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them,external. This is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK. The government has also issued a ""guarantee"" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun.

EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat,"EU politicians are united whereas British ones are not Once again - just as the last time the Brexit deal was rejected in parliament - reaction by EU leaders was prompt, co-ordinated and on message. It was a result they'd been dreading but expecting. European politician after European politician tweeted to say how disappointed they were, how businesses and citizens across the EU and UK now faced more agonising uncertainty and that the vote in the House of Commons brought everyone much closer to a no-deal Brexit. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier best summed up the European mood when he insisted the EU had done everything it could and that the deadlock could only be solved in the UK. There would be no more negotiations. Brexit: A really simple guide What just happened with Brexit? Brexit deal: What do the documents say? Notable on Tuesday night was the complete absence of any self-recrimination. Even in private, there was no discernible European soul-searching that more could have or should have been offered. Quite the opposite. The EU finger of blame points directly at the UK and the fact that parliament did not decide, or rather was never consulted about, what kind of Brexit it wanted before negotiations began - even when everyone knew MPs would have the final say on any resulting deal. Continuing disarray in the House of Commons just makes the EU wonder what the point could now be in delaying Brexit by just a few weeks - if the prime minister does request a short extension of the leaving process. Under EU law, Theresa May needs to formally ask for an extension and the 27 EU leaders need to be unanimous in their agreement. This should be interesting. Theresa May (L) with the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier European leaders have never formally debated how long an extension they would favour and what conditions - if any - they would lay down. That discussion will only start at ambassador level on Wednesday. Up until now, public EU statements about an extension have been part and parcel of negotiations. Threats to force the departing UK to field candidates in the upcoming European parliamentary elections or to make the UK extend by a whacking 21 months were partly designed to put pressure on MPs and (it was hoped) to help focus minds on voting in favour of the prime minister's Brexit deal. Business âexasperatedâ after Brexit vote EU sticks to Brexit script in final sprint EU in bleak mood in 'crunch' Brexit week But that didn't work and by this stage of the Brexit process, Germany, France, Ireland and others have slightly differing priorities. Not that you can speak of real rifts in the EU position (though Germany is so keen to keep the UK close, its politicians keep saying the government should take the time it needs to solve its political crisis, while France, for example, is impatient to get Brexit done and over with). Theresa May (r) would need to formally ask the EU's 27 leaders for an extension However, if Theresa May were tempted to use next week's EU leaders' summit in Brussels to ask for new concessions, opinion would be divided, even if leaders managed, as they mostly have until now, to keep differences behind closed doors. Clearly on a technical, civil servant-level the EU believes that EU-UK negotiations can't go any further. If the EU were to move at all on its Brexit position now, that would be a political decision which can only be taken by the leaders of the 27 EU member countries. This video can not be played MPs voted by 391 to 242 against Theresa May's Brexit plan And they are already worrying about the next round of ""magical thinking"" in the UK. Moments after the deal was rejected by parliament on Tuesday, Mr Barnier took to Twitter to express concern that there seemed to be what he called a ""dangerous illusion"" amongst some MPs that the UK can have a transition period after Brexit even if no formal EU-UK divorce deal is agreed. Brussels has always ruled that option out as impossible - a case of cherry-picking extraordinaire. As much as EU leaders want to avoid an acrimonious no-deal Brexit, they are not willing to pay just any price. MPs reject PM's Brexit deal by 149 votes.

Most imports tariff-free under no-deal planThe government announces that most imports into the UK would not attract a tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit.BusinessComments,"The government has announced that most imports into the UK would not attract a tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Under a temporary scheme 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. What are tariffs and how do they work? Government sets out plans for Irish border in a no-deal Brexit No-deal NI plan disastrous, say businesses A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. In the great majority of cases, tariffs are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. The new tariff regime would mark a shift in favour of products from non-EU countries. It would mean 82% of imports from the EU would be tariff-free, down from 100% now. 92% percent of imports from the rest of the world would pay no border duty, up from 56%. Under the plan, the UK car industry will receive some protection, with some imported cars attracting tariffs. But car parts from the EU would be tariff free, which will help car plants in the UK. Also, the ceramics industry would receive some protection from cheap imports. Industry bodies and businesses are still poring overthe 1,477-page document,externalwhich outlines the new plan. Imports of cars from the EU will have a tariff of 10% applied, which would add Â£1,500 to a typical family car. Volkswagen has already said the cost would be passed on to the buyer. Car parts such as engines would have no new tax applied to avoid disruption to the movement of components. A spokesman for Ford UK warned that the tariffs would ""deal a devastating blow to much of the complex and integrated automotive industry, and would damage the competitiveness of Ford's engine manufacturing in the UK"". While some tariffs will protect farmers producing meat, other sectors of farming will have low or no tarrifs. The National Farmers' Union President, Minette Batters, said that eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables would not receive any protection under the plans. The plans would see the current tariff rate on oranges cut from 16% to 0%, the rate for onions down from 9.6% to 0% and the tariff on imported televisions down from 14% to 0%. Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing Steve Turner described the potential no-deal as ""economic vandalism which is threatening jobs and livelihoods"" and  called for tariffs to be dropped on EU imports. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI described the changes as a ""sledgehammer to our economy"" as companies spend more on stockpiling. She said: ""These are being imposed on this country with no consultation with business with no time to prepare."" Trade minister Liam Fox will speak to business leaders at 15:00 GMT to discuss the tariffs, Reuters reported. Trade Policy Minister George Hollingbery said: ""Our priority is securing a deal with the EU as this will avoid disruption to our global trading relationships. However, we must prepare for all eventualities."" He said: ""This balanced approach will help to support British jobs and avoid potential price spikes that would hit the poorest households the hardest."" ""The new tariff seems a reasonable compromise between protecting vulnerable (and politically important) sectors and keeping prices down for consumers,"" said Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""For producers, there will be relief in some sectors and nasty surprises for others,"" he said. The government also announced thatit will not introduce any new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for nearly all goods moving from across the border from Ireland to Northern Irelandin the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The move, to avoid friction at the UK's land border with the EU, will be temporary while a long solution is found. The government said tariffs will be payable on goods moving from the EU into the rest of the UK via Northern Ireland. It insisted that this would create no border down the Irish sea because there would be no checks on goods moved between Northern Ireland and Britain. But Prof Winters said it ""almost certainly"" violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules that demand equal treatment for all trading partners, he said. ""Leaving the Irish border open also opens up the possibility of some EU goods being shipped to the UK via Ireland and so avoiding UK tariffs.""

John Samuelsen, international president of the Transport
Workers Union of America, which represent aviation workers and
flight attendants, said the grounding of the fleet was right
""both for air travellers and aviation workers."" The Dow has closed up by 0.6%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq by 0.7% each. Shares in Boeing experienced a volatile time after President Trump's decision to ground all 
of the 737 MAX aircraft. But the share price ended the day 0.5% up to $377.12, putting it ahead for the first time in three days but still 
down nearly 11% since before Sunday's deadly crash in Ethiopia. The Nikkei press agency is reporting that South Korean Airlines will be banned by the authorities from accepting delivery of Boeing jets if the US aircraft maker does nod satisfy questions over their safety. IBM has been accused of using Flickr photos for a facial-recognition project, without the full consent of people in the images. The company extracted nearly one million photos from a dataset of Flickr images originally compiled by Yahoo. Many people pictured were probably unaware of how their data had been used,according to an NBC News report,external. IBM said in a statement that it had taken great care to comply with privacy principles. MPs have voted to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement. Theresa May said there was a ""clear majority"" against a no-deal Brexit but the ""legal default"" was that the UK would leave without a deal on 29 March if no deal is reached. MPs will now get a vote on delaying Brexit, said the prime minister. That vote will take place on Thursday, and if it is passed - and the EU agrees to it - the UK will not leave the EU as planned on 29 March. The government tabled a motion to prevent the UK from exiting the EU on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement. But before MPs voted on that, they backed an amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances - by just four votes. This dramatic development led to the government ordering Conservative MPs to vote against its own motion. But the government motion, as amended, was passed by 321 votes to 278, reinforcing the message that MPs do not want to leave without a deal. MPs also voted by 374 to 164 to reject a plan to delay the UK's departure from the EU until 22 May, 2019 so that there can be what its supporters call a ""managed no-deal"" Brexit. The US decision comes afterCanada earlier in the day decided to ban the Boeing Max planes from its airspace. Announcing the decision, Canadian transport minister Marc Garneau said he made his decision after reviewing ""validated satellite 
tracking data suggesting a possible, although unproven, similarity in the 
flight profile of the Lion Air aircraft."" Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent Legal border issues There
has been some learned debate among legal academics on Twitter over whether the
UK no-deal tariff proposals are compatible with World Trade Organization rules.
One issue is the plan for special treatment â no tariffs - for goods crossing
coming into the UK over the land border in Ireland. Similar goods entering
elsewhere â Dover or Felixstowe for example â would be subject to any
applicable tariffs. Does that violate the non-discrimination principle in WTO
rules (known somewhat confusingly as Most Favoured Nation)? It might do,
although there is some dispute among the lawyers. And then there is the
plan to continue some EU actions against goods that are (allegedly) dumped or
subsidised. A former WTO appeal judge says that would violate the requirement
that these actions are taken only after the country concerned has done an
investigation and shown that its own industry has been harmed. It wonât do if

high on Wednesday after MPs rejected a no-deal Brexit. The pound hit $1.3270 and was up 1.5% against the

the jets earlier on Wednesday, it said in a statement. Boeing continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX.  However, after consultation with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and aviation authorities and its customers around the world, Boeing has determined - out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraftâs safety - to recommend to the FAA the temporary suspension of operations of the entire global fleet of 371 737 MAX aircraft.

Economy 'to grow at slowest pace since 2009',"The chancellor has pledged to spend a Â£26.6bn Brexit war chest to boost the economy, if MPs vote to leave the European Union with a deal. Philip Hammond vowed to free up more money to help end austerity in a ""deal dividend"". However, he said tax cuts and spending risesdepended on a smooth Brexit. Mr Hammond used hisSpring Statementto warn that a disorderly Brexit would deal a ""significant"" blow to economic activity in the short term. He said the decision by MPs to reject Theresa May's Brexit deal for a second time had left a ""cloud of uncertainty hanging over our economy"". The latest figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that the UK economy will grow at the slowest pace since the financial crisis this year. The OBR cut its 2019 growth forecast to 1.2%, the weakest growth rate since 2009. That is a significant cut from the 1.6% expansion predicted by the government's economic watchdog last October. After that growth is expected to rebound. Mr Hammond said the economy had ""defied expectations"" as wages were expected to keep growing at rates of above 3% over the next five years. He hinted that the government would have up to an extra Â£26.6 billion to spend if MPs voted to leave the EU with a deal, while still meeting self-imposed limits on government borrowing. This is almost double the Â£15.4bn estimated by the OBR in October. The statement left the forecast for GDP growth in 2020 at 1.4% and now expects the UK economy to expand by 1.6% a year in the following three years. The government is expected to borrow Â£22.8bn this financial year to plug the gap between the money it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. This is almost Â£3 billion lower than the Â£25.5bn predicted by the OBR in the October Budget. The watchdog expects the improvement in the public finances to continue in future years, helped by stronger tax receipts and lower spending on debt interest. While borrowing is expected to rise to Â£29.3bn next year, it is then predicted to fall over the next four years. Mr Hammond announced a Â£800m increase in non-NHS spending by the middle of the next decade to keep pace with inflation In January the government announced it would pump a similar amount into the NHS to maintain real-terms spending. The chancellor also said he was making an additional Â£100m available over the course of the next year to help deal with the surge in knife crime. The cash is to be used for police overtime and to fund new 'Violent Crime Reduction Units' to help respond to the increase. The NHS was the main beneficiary of planned spending increases announced in the October budget Mr Hammond is expected to set out detailed plans about how money will be allocated to different government departments beyond 2020 in a spending review starting this summer. However, changes to the way student loans are treated on the government's books will eat away at the Brexit war chest that Mr Hammond has set aside. The changes, which reflect the fact that many students will never fully repay their loans, are expected to reduce the pot of available cash by around Â£12bn this autumn. The watchdog said this would also make an ongoing aspiration of eliminating the deficit ""harder to achieve"". Robert Chote, the chairman of the OBR, said the Chancellor could respond to the statistical shake up by changing his borrowing targets, or by tweaking other tax and spending measures. Changes to the way the Office for National Statistics treats student loans in the autumn will reduce the cash Hammond has to spend The government's fiscal rules state that it must keep borrowing, adjusted for the ups and downs of the economy, below 2% of GDP in 2020-21. The OBR said there was a 40% chance that the government would eliminate borrowing entirely by 2023/24. Mr Chote also highlighted that the OBR's forecasts were based on a smooth Brexit, with employment expected to remain steady and business investment predicted to rise. He said the economic outlook remained uncertain, with the Spring Statement sandwiched between crucial votes that will determine the UK's exit from the EU. Mr Chote said no deal would probably lead to a ""short-term shock to the economy"" which would have implications for taxes and spending. However, he said the hit to the country's longer term growth prospects and UK living standards would be a bigger concern. While Mr Chote said the government was likely to spend more money to support the economy, he said the direct effects of this on the economy were ""presently unknowable"".

Brexit amendments: What could MPs vote on?,"MPs will vote later on whether or not the UK should leave the EU without a deal. Backbench MPs and opposition parties put forward eight amendments to show which direction they want the government to take on Brexit. Speaker John Bercow has selected two of them to be put to the vote in the Commons later. LIVE: MPs prepare to vote on no-deal Brexit EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat The government motion for debate is: That this House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship on 29 March 2019; and notes that leaving without a deal remains the default in UK and EU law unless this House and the EU ratify an agreement. Jack Dromey and Caroline Spelman are working across party lines The amendment (a) from Labour MP Jack Dromey and Conservative Dame Caroline Spelman changes the wording of the government motion to ""this House rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship"". Dame Caroline told MPs she wanted to withdraw the amendment, because Theresa May's government motion would do the same job. But she was told by Commons Speaker John Bercow that she could not withdraw it because other signatories could ""persist with it"". The 'Alternative Arrangements Working Group' is formed of Tory leavers and remainers working on the 'Malthouse Compromise' This amendment (f) sets out the process for a ""managed no-deal"". It requests: The government publish tariff schedules An extension of leaving to 22 May 2019 'Mutual standstill agreements' between the UK and EU until the end of 2021, including payments to the EU A unilateral guarantee of citizens' rights It is called the Malthouse compromise because it was put together by Conservative minister Kit Malthouse, but it has been tabled in the name of former Conservative minister Damian Green. It is supported by members of the Brexiteer European Research Group of Conservative MPs and former Remain supporters such as Mr Green and Nicky Morgan. Some members of the Independent Group left their parties over Brexit Amendment (d) states that ""under no circumstances"" should the UK leave without a deal, listing the alternatives as revocation of the UK's intention to leave, extension of the Article 50 period or a second referendum. Amendment (e) scraps the second half of the government motion, shortening it to: ""that this House declines to approve leaving the European Union without a Withdrawal Agreement and a Framework for the Future Relationship on 29 March 2019"" It was tabled by the Independent Group, which is consists of eight former Labour MPs and three former Tories, who are all supporters of another EU referendum, and who quit their parties in protest at their Brexit policies. Amendment (c) calls for an extension to the Article 50 leaving process to 2021, or until a future relationship is agreed. The amendment also requests a second referendum to take place, on whether or not the UK should leave with the agreed deal, or remain in the EU. Ken Clarke One final amendment - (b) was tabled by former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke, Labour's Keith Vaz and the SNP's Angus MacNeil. It simply calls for the revocation of Article 50 to cancel Brexit. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford expresses his concern at a no-deal Brexit Amendment (h), tabled by the SNP, calls for the UK to not leave the EU without a deal ""under any circumstances"", regardless of the exit date. It further gives MPs the option to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh wants no-deal to remain on the table Amendment (g) was tabled by Tory Brexiteer Sir Edward Leigh. The amendment calls for the option of no-deal to be kept on the table during the government's continued negotiations with the EU.

MPs to vote on no-deal Brexit,"This video can not be played MPs laugh after Theresa May accuses Jeremy Corbyn of asking a question without reading her deal Theresa May says she understands ""the voice of the country"" on Brexit, despite her own vocals wavering. Battling a sore throat at Prime Minister's Questions, she insisted the UK can still leave the EU with a ""good deal"" and said she would vote later to rule out a no-deal exit on 29 March. But Mrs May warned MPs they faced ""hard choices"" having rejected her deal for a second time. Jeremy Corbyn called on the PM to change course after the defeat. He said the deal had been ""decisively rejected"" and it was time for the prime minister to change her red lines. After the Commons rejected Mrs May's Brexit deal by 149 votes on Tuesday, the EU has warned the risk of a ""disorderly"" Brexit has never been higher. Its chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU ""cannot go any further"" in trying to persuade MPs to back the agreed terms of exit and the UK had to break the impasse. LIVE: Reaction as MPs prepare for no-deal vote Brexit: What could happen next? Adler: EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat MPs will vote at 19.00 GMT on whether to block the UK from leaving the EU without an agreement later this month. Wednesday's vote only applies to the 29 March deadline and would not rule out the prospect of a no-deal exit later this year, if Parliament is ultimately unable to agree a way forward. The Labour leader said the prime minister was in denial about her own deal's lack of support after MPs rejected it by a margin of 149 votes. He suggested his alternative plan to remain in a customs union was ""the only show in town"". ""Isn't it time she moved on from her red lines and faced the reality of the situation she has got herself, her party, this parliament and this country into?"" he said. But dismissing calls from Tory MPs to embrace a no-deal exit now, Mrs May said her deal remained the best way to honour the 2016 referendum result. ""I may not have my own voice but I understand the voice of the country,"" she said. ""I believe we have a good deal. No deal is better than a bad deal but I have been working for us to leave on 29 March and leave with a good deal."" This video can not be played Theresa May says businesses worry about Brexit uncertainty, but are more worried about a ""Corbyn government"" The EU has urged the UK to take ""responsibility"" for its actions. ""Again the House of Commons says what it doesn't want,"" Mr Barnier told the European Parliament. ""Now this impasse can only be solved in the UK. The EU, he suggested, had gone ""as far as it possibly can"" to satisfy MPs' concerns over the agreement, particularly in relation to the backstop, an insurance policy to stop a hard border on the island of Ireland. ""If the UK still wants to leave the EU in an orderly manner, this treaty is, and will remain, the only treaty possible,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Members of the cabinet will get a free vote on whether to leave without an agreement on 29 March MPs will vote on a government motion, which says the Commons ""declines to approve leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework on the future relationship on 29 March"". Mrs May has said Tory MPs will get a free vote. That means ministers and MPs can make their own mind up rather than following the orders of party managers - an unusual move for a vote on a major policy. The no-deal debate will begin after Chancellor Philip Hammond's Spring Statement economic update. Leaving the EU in 16 days' time remains the UK's default position under the law, unless talks are extended. If a no-deal exit is rejected, MPs will vote on Thursday on delaying Brexit by extending Article 50 - the legal mechanism that takes the UK out of the EU. The EU has said it would need ""a credible justification"" before agreeing to any extension. Such a move would have to be agreed by every member state. Although the PM managed to convince about 40 Tory MPs to change their mind, it was not nearly enough to overturn the historic 230 vote defeat she suffered on the same deal in January. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Despite Tuesday's defeat, the BBC News political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, there were ministers who believed it could still ultimately prevail as other options gradually fell by the wayside due to lack of parliamentary support. Labour wants no-deal to be ""taken off the table"" and is likely to back an amendment - a legislative tool - tabled by MPs Jack Dromey and Caroline Spelman ruling out the UK leaving without an agreement at any stage in the process. Disgraced MP back to vote on Brexit deal The papers: Brexit 'mayhem' and 'the house of fools' Sturgeon: 'People must decide' Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBC that Parliament would increasingly ""set the agenda"" if the government was not in control of events. She said No 10 should consider giving MPs a free vote on the full range of options for the UK's relationship with the EU - including Labour's own plans for a customs union. What isn't clear is how the prime minister actually intends to dig herself out of this dreadful political hole. Some of her colleagues around the Cabinet table think it shows she has to tack to a closer deal with the EU. Some of them believe it's time now to go hell-for-leather to leave without an overarching deal but move to make as much preparation as possible, and fast. Other ministers believe genuinely, still with around two weeks to go, and an EU summit next week, there is still time to try to manoeuvre her deal through - somehow. Read more from Laura Among other proposals which could be discussed on Wednesday is a plan for the UK to leave without a formal agreement but with a number of safeguards to minimise economic disruption. Disgraced MP back to vote on Brexit deal The papers: Brexit 'mayhem' and 'the house of fools' Sturgeon: 'People must decide' The plan, known as the Malthouse compromise, is backed by Brexiteer members of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, as well as the DUP and former Remain ministers like Nicky Morgan and Damian Green. It would see the controversial backstop replaced by alternative arrangements, an extended pay-as-you-go transition period and a series of ""standstill"" arrangements for various industries until the end of 2021. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM's Brexit plan ""is dead"" Amid reports Brexiteer ministers have been granted a free vote on this proposal, Tory MP Steve Baker told BBC News the plan - which would see Brexit delayed until 22 May - was ""eminently reasonable"". But Tory former minister Nick Boles said this would amount to a no-deal exit and the EU would not agree to it. Ahead of the no-deal Commons vote, the government announced thatmost imports into the UKwould not attract a tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Under a temporary scheme 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access - up from 80% at present. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. The government also announcedit will not introduce any new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving across the border from Ireland to Northern Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The decision to drop all checks to avoid friction at the UK's land border with the EU will be temporary while longer term solutions are negotiated.

Pupils feared dead in Lagos school collapse,"This video can not be played Deaths confirmed in Lagos school collapse At least 10 people have died and many more are feared trapped after a building containing a school collapsed in the Nigerian city of Lagos. The school, which was on the top floor of the four-storey building in Ita Faji on Lagos Island, had more than 100 pupils, a rescue official told the BBC. About 40 pupils had been pulled out alive, the official said. The building had been identified as ""distressed"" and listed for demolition, Lagos building officials told the BBC. The collapse happened at about 10:00 local time (09:00 GMT). There were frantic scenes at the site as rescuers and local men searched for survivors, and family members crowded the area in the hope of finding their loved ones alive. This video can not be played Eyewitness says ""everybody had to run for their lives"" The collapsed building was a residential block containing a number of apartments as well as the school, residents and rescue officials at the scene told the BBC. Emergency teams pulled several injured pupils from the rubble, but many worried parents at the scene were unable to find their children, while others went to a local hospital to look for theirs. It Is not clear how many children remain trapped Men from the local area were assisting rescuers but large crowds of people were hindering the rescue operation. Mohammed Muftau, a local resident who witnessed the collapse, told the BBC that the building had been cracking for long time and that complaints had been raised about it. The Lagos State Building Control Agency confirmed to the BBC that the building had been marked and listed for demolition. It is not unusual for buildings to collapse in Nigeria; materials are often sub-standard and the enforcement of regulations is lax. In September 2014, 116 people died when a six-storey building collapsed in Lagos during a service given by a celebrity televangelist. And in 2016, more than 100 people died when the roof of a church in Uyo, in the south of Nigeria, caved in. Rescuers were working frantically to free those trapped under the rubble At the Lagos Island General Hospital, there was a scene of chaos as parents and family members scrambled after every ambulance that arrived to see if it contained a loved one. Many of the victims brought in were children in school uniforms. Visiting the hospital, the Lagos state deputy governor, Idiat Oluranti Adebule, offered condolences to the families of the victims and called for calm. ""We plead for their understanding to allow the rescue team to do their work... so that the medical team can take prompt and immediate action as soon as the patients are brought in,"" she told the BBC. President Muhammadu Buhari offered his condolences to the families of the victims. ""It touches one to lose precious lives in any kind of mishap, particularly those so young and tender,"" he said.

Mum guilty of letting baby drown in bath,"Sarah Morris said she left her children alone for no longer than three minutes A mother has been jailed for three years after leaving her baby girl to drown in the bath. Sarah Morris, 35, was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter of one-year-old Rosie on Wednesday. Rosie drowned in waist-deep bath water at Morris's flat in Greenfield near Holywell, Flintshire, on 29 July 2015. Mold Crown Court heardMorris spent 47 minutes talking to her partner while Rosie and her twin were left.alone in the bath. The conversation only ended when Sarah Swindells suggested Morris should go and check on the children. Morris had been given help from Flintshire council and received a leaflet detailing the dangers of leaving children unattended in the bath just two weeks before Rosie died. She had also been in regular contact with social workers and it was their view she was ""doing an OK job"". A former partner said she was in the habit of putting herself before her children and prosecutor Oliver Saxby said after the verdict there was evidence of her ""drinking to excess and taking drugs"". Traces of amphetamine was found in a bag in her bedroom. Defence barrister Patrick Harrington QC said: ""The culpability of the death of your own child is massive and it's a burden she's going to have to carry for the rest of her life."" Defence barrister Patrick Harrington QC said Morris's future was ""now bleak"" Morris claimed she left her children alone for no longer than ""two or three"" minutes, with the court hearing she had to be stopped from banging her head on a wall when she realised Rosie was dead. The defence claimed it was a ""tragic accident"" for which a loving mother, doing her best, bore no criminal responsibility. Mr Justice Picken told Morris he recognised the ""profound effect"" the death of her daughter had on her. He said there was no evidence she neglected her children in the same way before but it meant the loss of ""a young girl rich in promise"" and left her twin brother without his sister. The judge also said it would be wrong to bear in mind, in sentencing, issues raised after the verdict regarding her character as these had been untested during the trial. Mr Justice Picken said he recognised she was remorseful and said Mr Harrington was ""sadly right"" when he described her future prospects as bleak. Nicola Rees of the Crown Prosecution Service said Morris left her two young children ""in an extremely vulnerable position for a prolonged period"". ""The CPS presented evidence showing that Sarah Morris had been made aware, on a number of occasions, of the dangers involved in bathing young children, but nevertheless, on this particular day, she chose to put her own needs above those of her children, resulting in Rosie's tragic death from drowning,"" she added. In a victim impact statement, Rosie's grandmother said: ""On 29 July 2015, my life changed forever. ""I received the worst phone call of my life from paramedics, telling me there'd been an accident and I needed to go to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd. ""The image of what I saw there will be with me forever.

Online safety cartoons for four-year-olds,"In the cartoons, Jessie and her friends encounter negative experiences online Children aged four to seven are being targeted in a new online video campaign from the National Crime Agency (NCA). The series of videos called Jessie & Friends,externalis intended to teach children how to keep themselves safe online, with a view to protecting them from sexual abuse and other threats. Children will be directed to Jessie & Friends via ""video clips and a catchy song"" on social media sites. The NSPCC described the move as ""a positive step"". Jessie & Friends features three animated children who explore online videos and social media - but they soon realise that dangers are lurking there. In the first episode, Jessie watches a seemingly innocuous video of a happy crocodile that suddenly changes to feature an angry version of the reptile instead. Such videos, which can disturb young children, have beenknown to proliferate on YouTube and other sites. Most British three- to four-year-olds use the internet now,according to research by Ofcom,external. In 2018, 25% of their parents said they were worried about children giving out details to inappropriate people online - a rise from 18% the previous year. In another episode, the children are joined in an online game by a seemingly helpful stranger who then tricks them into losing. ""Investigators are seeing a very disturbing change in offender behaviour, with the increasing contact abuse of pre-verbal and very young children,"" the NCA said in a statement. Parents, carers and teachers needed to be able to discuss online safety with children in a sensitive and positive way, said NCA director Rob Jones. Jessie & Friends made it easier for parents to raise the subject of online safety with children, said Will Gardner, chief executive of Childnet. ""It is a very useful way for parents to get that conversation started,"" he told BBC News. ""It's really aimed at parents - this is a tool for you to use to get that conversation going with your children."" Childnet was increasingly working with children as young as three to teach them how they could protect themselves on the web, he said. The videos were ""a positive step"", the NSPCC's associate head of child safety online, Andy Burrows, said. ""However, tech giants also need to take responsibly for protecting children,"" he said. The NSPCC is calling for the government to appoint an independent regulator that can levy ""tough consequences"" on social networks and online services that fail to keep children safe.

Here's our basic guide. Check how your MP voted in the latest Brexit vote. The grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft by the FAA has been welcomed by air workers in the US. John Samuelsen, international president of the Transport
Workers Union of America, which represent aviation workers and
flight attendants, said the grounding of the fleet was right
""both for air travellers and aviation workers."" The Dow has closed up by 0.6%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq by 0.7% each. Shares in Boeing experienced a volatile time after President Trump's decision to ground all 
of the 737 MAX aircraft. But the share price ended the day 0.5% up to $377.12, putting it ahead for the first time in three days but still 
down nearly 11% since before Sunday's deadly crash in Ethiopia. The Nikkei press agency is reporting that South Korean Airlines will be banned by the authorities from accepting delivery of Boeing jets if the US aircraft maker does nod satisfy questions over their safety. IBM has been accused of using Flickr photos for a facial-recognition project, without the full consent of people in the images. The company extracted nearly one million photos from a dataset of Flickr images originally compiled by Yahoo. Many people pictured were probably unaware of how their data had been used,according to an NBC News report,external. IBM said in a statement that it had taken great care to comply with privacy principles. MPs have voted to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement. Theresa May said there was a ""clear majority"" against a no-deal Brexit but the ""legal default"" was that the UK would leave without a deal on 29 March if no deal is reached. MPs will now get a vote on delaying Brexit, said the prime minister. That vote will take place on Thursday, and if it is passed - and the EU agrees to it - the UK will not leave the EU as planned on 29 March. The government tabled a motion to prevent the UK from exiting the EU on 29 March without a withdrawal agreement. But before MPs voted on that, they backed an amendment rejecting a no-deal Brexit under any circumstances - by just four votes. This dramatic development led to the government ordering Conservative MPs to vote against its own motion. But the government motion, as amended, was passed by 321 votes to 278, reinforcing the message that MPs do not want to leave without a deal. MPs also voted by 374 to 164 to reject a plan to delay the UK's departure from the EU until 22 May, 2019 so that there can be what its supporters call a ""managed no-deal"" Brexit. The US decision comes afterCanada earlier in the day decided to ban the Boeing Max planes from its airspace. Announcing the decision, Canadian transport minister Marc Garneau said he made his decision after reviewing ""validated satellite 
tracking data suggesting a possible, although unproven, similarity in the 
flight profile of the Lion Air aircraft."" Andrew WalkerWorld Service economics correspondent Legal border issues There
has been some learned debate among legal academics on Twitter over whether the
UK no-deal tariff proposals are compatible with World Trade Organization rules.
One issue is the plan for special treatment â no tariffs - for goods crossing
coming into the UK over the land border in Ireland. Similar goods entering
elsewhere â Dover or Felixstowe for example â would be subject to any
applicable tariffs. Does that violate the non-discrimination principle in WTO
rules (known somewhat confusingly as Most Favoured Nation)? It might do,
although there is some dispute among the lawyers. And then there is the
plan to continue some EU actions against goods that are (allegedly) dumped or
subsidised. A former WTO appeal judge says that would violate the requirement
that these actions are taken only after the country concerned has done an
investigation and shown that its own industry has been harmed. It wonât do if
you just adopt the EU investigation. So WTO challenges in the pipeline on these
points and potentially others? Could be.  But also worth bearing in mind
that the WTOâs dispute settlement system is currently on track to seize up
completely in December. Unless some more appeal judges are selected it wonât
have enough to hear cases and the US has blocked the recruitment process. Southwest Airlines is immediately complying with today's FAA requirement for all U.S. airlines to ground the Boeing 737 MAX 8. As a result, we have removed our 34 MAX 8 aircraft from scheduled service. Southwest operates a fleet of more than 750 Boeing 737s, and the 34 MAX 8 aircraft account for less than 5% of our daily flights. To support our customers, Southwest is offering flexible rebooking policies. Any Customer booked on a cancelled MAX 8 flight can rebook on alternate flights without any additional fees or fare differences within 14 days of their original date of travel between the original city pairs  Allow Twitter content?

high on Wednesday after MPs rejected a no-deal Brexit. The pound hit $1.3270 and was up 1.5% against the
dollar after the 312-308 vote, having traded at $1.3240 before the vote. The pound was also up 0.9% against the euro.  Dennis Muilenburg, chief executive of Boeing says: ""We are supporting this pro-active step out of an abundance of caution. ""Safety is a core value at Boeing for as long as we have been building airplanes; and it always will be. There is no greater priority for our company and our industry. ""We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again."" The House of Commons has voted by 312 to 308 to reject a no-deal Brexit, in a non-binding vote American Airlines is working to rebook
customers due to fly on Boeing 737 Max planes as quickly as
possible after the US banned the aircraft, which has
suffered two crashes in five months. American, which has 24 of the 737 Max aircraft, was notified by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of its decision to ground
the jets earlier on Wednesday, it said in a statement. Boeing continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX.  However, after consultation with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and aviation authorities and its customers around the world, Boeing has determined - out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraftâs safety - to recommend to the FAA the temporary suspension of operations of the entire global fleet of 371 737 MAX aircraft.  Barred from the US Donald Trump's announcement on the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 jets in the US comes after intense political and international pressure. On Tuesday Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said: ""Today, immediately, the FAA needs to get these planes out of the sky,"" Aviation authorities in Europe, China, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Oman, Singapore and more, have barred the plane from their airspace. On Wednesday at the White House President Trump told reporters: ""We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition regarding all 
flights of the 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 9,"" President Trump has said the US Federal Aviation Administration is to ground the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 aircraft following the crash of one of the jets in Ethiopia which killed 157 people on Sunday. Boeing shares fell some 2% on the news The fate of Interserve, and its 45,000 UK workers, is expected to be decidedon Friday at a shareholder vote. Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: âInterserve workers and those in its supply chain are facing an uncertain and difficult future. âWhatever the outcome of Fridayâs vote, the government as Interserveâs largest client most step in to ensure that the workforce and the supply chain is fully protected and do not become the innocent victims of the companyâs epic mismanagement. âThe predicament of the workforce has been made far worse by the government failing to learn the lessons of Carillion and bringing in new rules to better protect the workforce when companies collapse. âWhat is unequivocally clear is that the current flawed outsourcing model is broken.â Â© 2025 BBC.

Fears for pupils in Nigeria school collapse,"This video can not be played Deaths confirmed in Lagos school collapse At least 10 people have died and many more are feared trapped after a building containing a school collapsed in the Nigerian city of Lagos. The school, which was on the top floor of the four-storey building in Ita Faji on Lagos Island, had more than 100 pupils, a rescue official told the BBC. About 40 pupils had been pulled out alive, the official said. The building had been identified as ""distressed"" and listed for demolition, Lagos building officials told the BBC. The collapse happened at about 10:00 local time (09:00 GMT). There were frantic scenes at the site as rescuers and local men searched for survivors, and family members crowded the area in the hope of finding their loved ones alive. This video can not be played Eyewitness says ""everybody had to run for their lives"" The collapsed building was a residential block containing a number of apartments as well as the school, residents and rescue officials at the scene told the BBC. Emergency teams pulled several injured pupils from the rubble, but many worried parents at the scene were unable to find their children, while others went to a local hospital to look for theirs. It Is not clear how many children remain trapped Men from the local area were assisting rescuers but large crowds of people were hindering the rescue operation. Mohammed Muftau, a local resident who witnessed the collapse, told the BBC that the building had been cracking for long time and that complaints had been raised about it. The Lagos State Building Control Agency confirmed to the BBC that the building had been marked and listed for demolition. It is not unusual for buildings to collapse in Nigeria; materials are often sub-standard and the enforcement of regulations is lax. In September 2014, 116 people died when a six-storey building collapsed in Lagos during a service given by a celebrity televangelist. And in 2016, more than 100 people died when the roof of a church in Uyo, in the south of Nigeria, caved in. Rescuers were working frantically to free those trapped under the rubble At the Lagos Island General Hospital, there was a scene of chaos as parents and family members scrambled after every ambulance that arrived to see if it contained a loved one. Many of the victims brought in were children in school uniforms. Visiting the hospital, the Lagos state deputy governor, Idiat Oluranti Adebule, offered condolences to the families of the victims and called for calm. ""We plead for their understanding to allow the rescue team to do their work... so that the medical team can take prompt and immediate action as soon as the patients are brought in,"" she told the BBC. President Muhammadu Buhari offered his condolences to the families of the victims. ""It touches one to lose precious lives in any kind of mishap, particularly those so young and tender,"" he said.

"Many students 'without running water'A third of UK students have gone without heating or running water, a survey suggests.BusinessComments","A third of UK students have gone without heating or running water in their properties, a survey has suggested. The state of accommodation is among a list of 10 biggest concerns among young tenants, the survey of 2,196 students by website Save the Student suggests. But noisy housemates remains the biggest gripe in the annual survey. It also highlights concerns about the cost of living away from home for the first time. Student rents jump as accommodation goes upmarket The findings suggested that typical upfront costs, including fees, the deposit, and a month's rent in advance, totalled Â£970. Average rent stood at about Â£125 a week, of which parents contribute an average of Â£44. One in five students receive more than Â£100 a week from parents to help cover the cost. Two in five turned to overdrafts, loans, and credit cards to pay the rental bill, Save the Student said. Previous research by student housing charity Unipol and the National Union of Students suggested that the average price of student accommodation in the UK had risen by nearly a third in six years. Student finance: What you need to know,external, from the independent Money Advice Service Save The Student,externalwebsite Maintenance loans and grants information inEngland,external,Wales,external,Scotland,external, andNorthern Ireland,external Money and funding,external, from the National Union of Students Join the conversation in the BBC NewsAffordable Living,externalFacebook group About 30% of those asked had started to look for the following academic year's lodgings by November in an attempt to find a decent deal and to spread the cost over time. In addition to the cost, poor conditions in student accommodation were a major concern. One student in Portsmouth said that on the day she moved in there was no front door on the property and there was no heating for two months. Another in Newcastle said she had no hot water for the entire year. ""I had to boil the kettle and fill up the sink that way to wash my face,"" she said. Jake Butler wants it to be easier for students to resolve issues Damp, a lack of water or heating, disruptive building work, and rodents and pests all featured in the top 10 list of complaints, according to the Save the Student survey. Jake Butler, from Save the Student, said: ""Too many people - including students - seem to believe that poor living conditions are just a part of student life. ""While the laws around renting are constantly improving there needs to be a much easier way for students to report and resolve problems with their accommodation."" Updated legislation, which takes effect on 20 March, is designed to ensure that all rented accommodation is fit for human habitation and strengthens tenants' means of redress against landlords who fail to keep their properties safe.

The 35-year-old, who was elected as a Labour MP, served her sentence at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey and was released on 26 February.

"Cliff collapse shuts 'Broadchurch' beachHundreds of tonnes of rock fell onto the beach at West Bay, made famous by the ITV crime drama.","An estimated 1,000 tonnes of rock and debris has cut off the beach between West Bay and Freshwater A section of beach that featured in the ITV crime drama Broadchurch has been shut after a large cliff fall. About 1,000 tonnes of rock and debris fell at East Beach in West Bay, Dorset, at about 17:30 GMT on Tuesday, the coastguard said. Following searches by coastguard teams, fire crews and rescue dogs, no-one is believed to be trapped in the rubble. The Jurassic Coast path and beach between West Bay and Freshwater were closed for a time. The ITV drama Broadchurch is set in a fictional town in Dorset The Jurassic Coast path between West Bay and Freshwater was closed following the rockfall and has since reopened Engineers and a geologist are inspecting the area. A West Bay Coastguard spokesman said: ""Please stay well away from the cliff fall and surrounding area as further cliff falls could happen at any time and without warning."" The Jurassic Coast Trust said the fall had left ""potentially dangerous overhangs"" and repeated warnings to stay clear from the base and top of the cliffs. ""This type of fall happens suddenly and normally without warning, and is part of the process of natural erosion that makes our World Heritage coastline so beautiful and important for understanding the history of our planet,"" a statement said.

"Only UK can solve Brexit impasse, says EUThe EU says it ""cannot go any further"" to meet the UK's concerns as MPs prepare to vote on no-deal exit this month.","This video can not be played MPs laugh after Theresa May accuses Jeremy Corbyn of asking a question without reading her deal Theresa May says she understands ""the voice of the country"" on Brexit, despite her own vocals wavering. Battling a sore throat at Prime Minister's Questions, she insisted the UK can still leave the EU with a ""good deal"" and said she would vote later to rule out a no-deal exit on 29 March. But Mrs May warned MPs they faced ""hard choices"" having rejected her deal for a second time. Jeremy Corbyn called on the PM to change course after the defeat. He said the deal had been ""decisively rejected"" and it was time for the prime minister to change her red lines. After the Commons rejected Mrs May's Brexit deal by 149 votes on Tuesday, the EU has warned the risk of a ""disorderly"" Brexit has never been higher. Its chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU ""cannot go any further"" in trying to persuade MPs to back the agreed terms of exit and the UK had to break the impasse. LIVE: Reaction as MPs prepare for no-deal vote Brexit: What could happen next? Adler: EU points finger for Brexit deal defeat MPs will vote at 19.00 GMT on whether to block the UK from leaving the EU without an agreement later this month. Wednesday's vote only applies to the 29 March deadline and would not rule out the prospect of a no-deal exit later this year, if Parliament is ultimately unable to agree a way forward. The Labour leader said the prime minister was in denial about her own deal's lack of support after MPs rejected it by a margin of 149 votes. He suggested his alternative plan to remain in a customs union was ""the only show in town"". ""Isn't it time she moved on from her red lines and faced the reality of the situation she has got herself, her party, this parliament and this country into?"" he said. But dismissing calls from Tory MPs to embrace a no-deal exit now, Mrs May said her deal remained the best way to honour the 2016 referendum result. ""I may not have my own voice but I understand the voice of the country,"" she said. ""I believe we have a good deal. No deal is better than a bad deal but I have been working for us to leave on 29 March and leave with a good deal."" This video can not be played Theresa May says businesses worry about Brexit uncertainty, but are more worried about a ""Corbyn government"" The EU has urged the UK to take ""responsibility"" for its actions. ""Again the House of Commons says what it doesn't want,"" Mr Barnier told the European Parliament. ""Now this impasse can only be solved in the UK. The EU, he suggested, had gone ""as far as it possibly can"" to satisfy MPs' concerns over the agreement, particularly in relation to the backstop, an insurance policy to stop a hard border on the island of Ireland. ""If the UK still wants to leave the EU in an orderly manner, this treaty is, and will remain, the only treaty possible,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Members of the cabinet will get a free vote on whether to leave without an agreement on 29 March MPs will vote on a government motion, which says the Commons ""declines to approve leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement and a framework on the future relationship on 29 March"". Mrs May has said Tory MPs will get a free vote. That means ministers and MPs can make their own mind up rather than following the orders of party managers - an unusual move for a vote on a major policy. The no-deal debate will begin after Chancellor Philip Hammond's Spring Statement economic update. Leaving the EU in 16 days' time remains the UK's default position under the law, unless talks are extended. If a no-deal exit is rejected, MPs will vote on Thursday on delaying Brexit by extending Article 50 - the legal mechanism that takes the UK out of the EU. The EU has said it would need ""a credible justification"" before agreeing to any extension. Such a move would have to be agreed by every member state. Although the PM managed to convince about 40 Tory MPs to change their mind, it was not nearly enough to overturn the historic 230 vote defeat she suffered on the same deal in January.

Labour wants no-deal to be ""taken off the table"" and is likely to back an amendment - a legislative tool - tabled by MPs Jack Dromey and Caroline Spelman ruling out the UK leaving without an agreement at any stage in the process. Disgraced MP back to vote on Brexit deal The papers: Brexit 'mayhem' and 'the house of fools' Sturgeon: 'People must decide' Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBC that Parliament would increasingly ""set the agenda"" if the government was not in control of events. She said No 10 should consider giving MPs a free vote on the full range of options for the UK's relationship with the EU - including Labour's own plans for a customs union. What isn't clear is how the prime minister actually intends to dig herself out of this dreadful political hole. Some of her colleagues around the Cabinet table think it shows she has to tack to a closer deal with the EU. Some of them believe it's time now to go hell-for-leather to leave without an overarching deal but move to make as much preparation as possible, and fast. Other ministers believe genuinely, still with around two weeks to go, and an EU summit next week, there is still time to try to manoeuvre her deal through - somehow. Read more from Laura Among other proposals which could be discussed on Wednesday is a plan for the UK to leave without a formal agreement but with a number of safeguards to minimise economic disruption. Disgraced MP back to vote on Brexit deal The papers: Brexit 'mayhem' and 'the house of fools' Sturgeon: 'People must decide' The plan, known as the Malthouse compromise, is backed by Brexiteer members of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, as well as the DUP and former Remain ministers like Nicky Morgan and Damian Green. It would see the controversial backstop replaced by alternative arrangements, an extended pay-as-you-go transition period and a series of ""standstill"" arrangements for various industries until the end of 2021. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM's Brexit plan ""is dead"" Amid reports Brexiteer ministers have been granted a free vote on this proposal, Tory MP Steve Baker told BBC News the plan - which would see Brexit delayed until 22 May - was ""eminently reasonable"". But Tory former minister Nick Boles said this would amount to a no-deal exit and the EU would not agree to it. Ahead of the no-deal Commons vote, the government announced thatmost imports into the UKwould not attract a tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Under a temporary scheme 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access - up from 80% at present. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. The government also announcedit will not introduce any new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving across the border from Ireland to Northern Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The decision to drop all checks to avoid friction at the UK's land border with the EU will be temporary while longer term solutions are negotiated.

What could happen next?10 ways you could be affected by no-deal BrexitEU points finger for Brexit deal defeatAudio,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

10 ways you could be affected by no-deal BrexitEU points finger for Brexit deal defeatAudio,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external. The process could take up to four months. Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,the government has warned that it may become more expensive.,external Full government travel advice,external How will it affect my holidays to Europe? While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU. The government has announced a further Â£434m of funding and other measures, including: extra warehouse space for medicines securing additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone building buffer stocks booking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment making changes to regulatory requirements strengthening processes to deal with shortages However, the National Audit Office has said there are still""significant"" gapsin the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes. Government advice on medicine supply,external Should NHS patients be worried? About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries. The UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now. In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"". The government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing Â£138m. It advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevantcountry advice pages.,external Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country. However, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority. Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries. These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights. Full government advice for UK nationals living in the EU,external How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Drivers UK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK. There are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum. Statisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline. If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has atool to find out what you need to do and when.,external Government advice on applying for settled and pre-settled status,external Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has warned thatthe UK will deport EU citizensafter Brexit if they do not apply for the right to remain in time. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure. As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal. But bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder. Will the value of your home change in 2019? Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The government has also announced Â£344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations. Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17. UK universities say they would expecta similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.,external The government and the EU have agreed thatpeople who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them,external. This is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK. The government has also issued a ""guarantee"" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun.

EU points finger for Brexit deal defeatAudio,"EU politicians are united whereas British ones are not Once again - just as the last time the Brexit deal was rejected in parliament - reaction by EU leaders was prompt, co-ordinated and on message. It was a result they'd been dreading but expecting. European politician after European politician tweeted to say how disappointed they were, how businesses and citizens across the EU and UK now faced more agonising uncertainty and that the vote in the House of Commons brought everyone much closer to a no-deal Brexit. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier best summed up the European mood when he insisted the EU had done everything it could and that the deadlock could only be solved in the UK. There would be no more negotiations. Brexit: A really simple guide What just happened with Brexit? Brexit deal: What do the documents say? Notable on Tuesday night was the complete absence of any self-recrimination. Even in private, there was no discernible European soul-searching that more could have or should have been offered. Quite the opposite. The EU finger of blame points directly at the UK and the fact that parliament did not decide, or rather was never consulted about, what kind of Brexit it wanted before negotiations began - even when everyone knew MPs would have the final say on any resulting deal. Continuing disarray in the House of Commons just makes the EU wonder what the point could now be in delaying Brexit by just a few weeks - if the prime minister does request a short extension of the leaving process. Under EU law, Theresa May needs to formally ask for an extension and the 27 EU leaders need to be unanimous in their agreement. This should be interesting. Theresa May (L) with the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier European leaders have never formally debated how long an extension they would favour and what conditions - if any - they would lay down. That discussion will only start at ambassador level on Wednesday. Up until now, public EU statements about an extension have been part and parcel of negotiations. Threats to force the departing UK to field candidates in the upcoming European parliamentary elections or to make the UK extend by a whacking 21 months were partly designed to put pressure on MPs and (it was hoped) to help focus minds on voting in favour of the prime minister's Brexit deal. Business âexasperatedâ after Brexit vote EU sticks to Brexit script in final sprint EU in bleak mood in 'crunch' Brexit week But that didn't work and by this stage of the Brexit process, Germany, France, Ireland and others have slightly differing priorities. Not that you can speak of real rifts in the EU position (though Germany is so keen to keep the UK close, its politicians keep saying the government should take the time it needs to solve its political crisis, while France, for example, is impatient to get Brexit done and over with). Theresa May (r) would need to formally ask the EU's 27 leaders for an extension However, if Theresa May were tempted to use next week's EU leaders' summit in Brussels to ask for new concessions, opinion would be divided, even if leaders managed, as they mostly have until now, to keep differences behind closed doors. Clearly on a technical, civil servant-level the EU believes that EU-UK negotiations can't go any further. If the EU were to move at all on its Brexit position now, that would be a political decision which can only be taken by the leaders of the 27 EU member countries. This video can not be played MPs voted by 391 to 242 against Theresa May's Brexit plan And they are already worrying about the next round of ""magical thinking"" in the UK. Moments after the deal was rejected by parliament on Tuesday, Mr Barnier took to Twitter to express concern that there seemed to be what he called a ""dangerous illusion"" amongst some MPs that the UK can have a transition period after Brexit even if no formal EU-UK divorce deal is agreed. Brussels has always ruled that option out as impossible - a case of cherry-picking extraordinaire. As much as EU leaders want to avoid an acrimonious no-deal Brexit, they are not willing to pay just any price. MPs reject PM's Brexit deal by 149 votes.

'Swiss climbers' died in Ben Nevis avalancheThree climbers died and fourth is seriously injured in hospital following Tuesday's incident.Highlands & Islands,"Police at the scene of Ben Nevis rescue effort Two of three climbers who died in an avalanche on Ben Nevis on Tuesday were from France and the other from Switzerland, police have confirmed. Swiss authorities had earlier confirmed the death of one Swiss national and that another was injured. The Frenchmen were aged 41 and 32 and the Swiss man who died was 43. Mathieu Biselx, the 30-year-old survivor of the avalanche in Number 5 Gully, has been receiving treatment in hospital in Glasgow. His condition was described as ""stable"". Mr Biselx is the president of the Sion section of the Swiss Alpine Club. His companions were also club members. Third person dead after Ben Nevis avalanche A Swiss embassy spokeswoman told the BBC Scotland news website: ""Swiss authorities are in contact with the Scottish authorities as well as with the families in Switzerland."" According to the Swiss newspaper, Le Nouvelliste,external, all four men lived in Valais in the Swiss Alps and had left for Scotland on Sunday. Mr Biselx told the newspaper: ""It's terrible, they're not here anymore. They won't see their families again."" He added: ""We weren't very high up and suddenly we heard a noise. ""We looked round and two seconds later we were carried away by heavy, compact snow. When I regained consciousness only my head and an arm were sticking out of the snow."" Donald Paterson, of Lochaber MRT, said the avalanche in Number 5 Gully was seen by other climbers The avalanche on the mountain, near Fort William, is one of the worst Scottish climbing accidents in recent years. Twenty-nine volunteer mountain rescuers were involved in the rescue operation as well as a group of military personnel from the Joint Services Mountain Training Centre. Lochaber MRT said conditions on the mountain were ""very difficult with very high winds, snow and thunder and lightning"". A Coastguard helicopter involved in the rescue effort The weather hampered the efforts of Coastguard helicopter crews, despite ""some excellent flying"", the team said. The alarm was raised by a Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) forecaster and a guide climbing who were in the area. SAIS assesses potential avalanche risk for Lochaber, where Ben Nevis is located, and five other mountain areas,external. Donald Paterson, Lochaber MRT deputy team leader, told BBC Scotland the avalanche occurred above where the party of climbers were. He said the SAIS forecaster had seen a ""plume"" coming out of the gully, but could not see if anyone was in the path of the snow slide from their position. Mr Paterson said: ""The second confirmation (of the avalanche) came from a guide, who was on the opposite side of the coire and witnessed the slide coming down and the people below. ""Initially it was thought there were two people, but when we reached them it was confirmed there were four in the party."" Mountain rescue teams, the coastguard, police and ambulance service were involved in the rescue effort Insp Isla Campbell, of Police Scotland, said: ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those involved in the avalanche on Ben Nevis yesterday. ""Formal identification will take place in due course and the next of kin of those involved have now all been informed. ""I would again like to thank the volunteers from Lochaber and Glencoe mountain rescue teams and the members of the public who assisted with this incident, in what was extremely challenging conditions."" Insp Campbell urged walkers and climbers to carefully plan their trips into the hills, and to check weather and avalanche forecasts. She added: ""We do not want to put anyone off enjoying the great outdoors activities we have here in Scotland but we would ask that people plan their routes, take sensible precautions and consider whether it is safe to climb a particular route. ""The environment of the Scottish mountains is by its very nature an unpredictable one and it is important that people take as many precautions and plan ahead as much as possible if they are going to go climbing, especially at this time of year."" Brian Tregaskis, secretary of the Lochaber MRT, added: ""The members of the Lochaber and Glencoe Mountain Rescue teams did an incredible job in very difficult conditions. ""We'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of those who lost their lives and we hope the surviving casualty makes a full and speedy recovery."" Lochaber MRT said the incident was the third avalanche in Number 5 Gully since Saturday. On Saturday evening, a party of four climbers were ""avalanched"". One of the group was swept down the gully but was not injured. Are you in the area? Have you been affected by what's happened?

Katie Price fails to appear at court,"Katie Price was out of the country when she was due before magistrates in Crawley TV star Katie Price has been criticised by a judge for not ""bothering"" to turn up at court. The 40-year-old, from West Sussex, was due to appear before magistrates in Crawley accused of two charges of using threatening and abusive words or behaviour in Shipley last September. District judge Amanda Kelly said Ms Price's failure to appear showed a lack of respect for the court system. The court heard Ms Price, of Dial Post, near Horsham, was out of the country. At the hearing, which was adjourned to 20 March, the judge said: ""She hasn't bothered to turn up today. ""Apparently she has something more important to do."" The court heard Ms Price would have been notified of the need to attend in a postal requisition sent in February and would have known about the case. Ms Kelly said: ""This shows a lack of respect for the whole court system."" She said it would be ""tempting"" to consider an arrest, but she would ""reluctantly"" adjourn the hearing. The court heard Ms Price was due back in the country on 18 March. The ups and downs of Katie Price's life.

Geek Squad fine over insurance mis-selling,"es The UK's financial regulator has fined Carphone Warehouse more than Â£29m for insurance mis-selling. TheFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) found,externalthe firm failed to train staff properly to advise customers buying Geek Squad mobile phone insurance The FCA was tipped off by a whistleblower. Carphone Warehouse's boss said the firm was ""disappointed"" it had fallen short in the past but that it was a ""very different business today"". Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: ""The Carphone Warehouse and its staff persuaded customers to purchase the Geek Squad product which in some cases had little to no value because the customer already had insurance cover. The high level of cancellations should have been a clear indicator to the management of mis-selling. ""Without whistleblowers coming forward, these practices may never have come to light.  In the past few years, whistleblowers have contributed critical intelligence to the enforcement actions we have taken against firms and individuals."" Alex Baldock, Carphone Warehouse chief executive, said: ""As the FCA acknowledges, we've made significant improvements since 2015. We're committed to stay on that trajectory, and to make sure all customers enjoy the right technology products and services for them."" Dixons Carphone shares fall on huge loss Nine million more hit by Dixons data breach Carphone Warehouse fined over cyber-attack The FCA said the company had failed to give its sales consultants the right training to give ""suitable advice"" to Geek Squad customers. For example, it found that staff were trained to recommend Geek Squad to customers who already had cover, for example through their home insurance or bank accounts. Customers who said they might have a similar product or wanted to think about it were advised to purchase Geek Squad and cancel in 14 days. ""This created a risk that customers would purchase insurance that they did not need and would be exposed to the risk of paying for it if they did not cancel in time,"" the FCA said. During the period under investigation, between 1 December 2008 and 30 June 2015, Carphone Warehouse sold Geek Squad policies worth more than Â£444.7m. The FCA said a high proportion of these policies were subsequently cancelled early. In January 2014, 35% of policies were cancelled within the first three months. ""High cancellation rates are an indicator of a risk of mis-selling which The Carphone Warehouse failed to properly consider,"" according to the FCA. Carphone Warehouse did not contest the FCA's findings. As a result it qualified for a 30% discount on the fine, without that it would have had to pay more than Â£41m.

California governor to halt executions,"The last execution in California was carried out in 2006 California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a moratorium on executions and a temporary reprieve for all 737 inmates on death row in the state. The order issued on Wednesday afternoon described the death penalty as ""inconsistent with our bedrock values"". California has not carried out any executions since 2006, as a series of court battles over execution methods have been waged. No death row inmates will be released under the state-wide moratorium. Governor Newsom took office in January and a death penalty moratorium was one of his campaign pledges. ""I do not believe that a civilised society can claim to be a leader in the world as long as its government continues to sanction the premeditated and discriminatory execution of its people,"" he said in a statement issued with the executive order.

Online safety cartoons for four-year-oldsThe UK's National Crime Agency launches a series of animations aimed at children aged four to seven.Technology,"In the cartoons, Jessie and her friends encounter negative experiences online Children aged four to seven are being targeted in a new online video campaign from the National Crime Agency (NCA). The series of videos called Jessie & Friends,externalis intended to teach children how to keep themselves safe online, with a view to protecting them from sexual abuse and other threats. Children will be directed to Jessie & Friends via ""video clips and a catchy song"" on social media sites. The NSPCC described the move as ""a positive step"". Jessie & Friends features three animated children who explore online videos and social media - but they soon realise that dangers are lurking there. In the first episode, Jessie watches a seemingly innocuous video of a happy crocodile that suddenly changes to feature an angry version of the reptile instead. Such videos, which can disturb young children, have beenknown to proliferate on YouTube and other sites. Most British three- to four-year-olds use the internet now,according to research by Ofcom,external. In 2018, 25% of their parents said they were worried about children giving out details to inappropriate people online - a rise from 18% the previous year. In another episode, the children are joined in an online game by a seemingly helpful stranger who then tricks them into losing. ""Investigators are seeing a very disturbing change in offender behaviour, with the increasing contact abuse of pre-verbal and very young children,"" the NCA said in a statement. Parents, carers and teachers needed to be able to discuss online safety with children in a sensitive and positive way, said NCA director Rob Jones. Jessie & Friends made it easier for parents to raise the subject of online safety with children, said Will Gardner, chief executive of Childnet. ""It is a very useful way for parents to get that conversation started,"" he told BBC News. ""It's really aimed at parents - this is a tool for you to use to get that conversation going with your children."" Childnet was increasingly working with children as young as three to teach them how they could protect themselves on the web, he said. The videos were ""a positive step"", the NSPCC's associate head of child safety online, Andy Burrows, said. ""However, tech giants also need to take responsibly for protecting children,"" he said. The NSPCC is calling for the government to appoint an independent regulator that can levy ""tough consequences"" on social networks and online services that fail to keep children safe.

Most imports tariff-free under no-deal planThe government announces that most imports into the UK would not attract a tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Business,"The government has announced that most imports into the UK would not attract a tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Under a temporary scheme 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. What are tariffs and how do they work? Government sets out plans for Irish border in a no-deal Brexit No-deal NI plan disastrous, say businesses A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. In the great majority of cases, tariffs are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. The new tariff regime would mark a shift in favour of products from non-EU countries. It would mean 82% of imports from the EU would be tariff-free, down from 100% now. 92% percent of imports from the rest of the world would pay no border duty, up from 56%. Under the plan, the UK car industry will receive some protection, with some imported cars attracting tariffs. But car parts from the EU would be tariff free, which will help car plants in the UK. Also, the ceramics industry would receive some protection from cheap imports. Industry bodies and businesses are still poring overthe 1,477-page document,externalwhich outlines the new plan. Imports of cars from the EU will have a tariff of 10% applied, which would add Â£1,500 to a typical family car. Volkswagen has already said the cost would be passed on to the buyer. Car parts such as engines would have no new tax applied to avoid disruption to the movement of components. A spokesman for Ford UK warned that the tariffs would ""deal a devastating blow to much of the complex and integrated automotive industry, and would damage the competitiveness of Ford's engine manufacturing in the UK"". While some tariffs will protect farmers producing meat, other sectors of farming will have low or no tarrifs. The National Farmers' Union President, Minette Batters, said that eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables would not receive any protection under the plans. The plans would see the current tariff rate on oranges cut from 16% to 0%, the rate for onions down from 9.6% to 0% and the tariff on imported televisions down from 14% to 0%. Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing Steve Turner described the potential no-deal as ""economic vandalism which is threatening jobs and livelihoods"" and  called for tariffs to be dropped on EU imports. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI described the changes as a ""sledgehammer to our economy"" as companies spend more on stockpiling. She said: ""These are being imposed on this country with no consultation with business with no time to prepare."" Trade minister Liam Fox will speak to business leaders at 15:00 GMT to discuss the tariffs, Reuters reported. Trade Policy Minister George Hollingbery said: ""Our priority is securing a deal with the EU as this will avoid disruption to our global trading relationships. However, we must prepare for all eventualities."" He said: ""This balanced approach will help to support British jobs and avoid potential price spikes that would hit the poorest households the hardest."" ""The new tariff seems a reasonable compromise between protecting vulnerable (and politically important) sectors and keeping prices down for consumers,"" said Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""For producers, there will be relief in some sectors and nasty surprises for others,"" he said. The government also announced thatit will not introduce any new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for nearly all goods moving from across the border from Ireland to Northern Irelandin the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The move, to avoid friction at the UK's land border with the EU, will be temporary while a long solution is found. The government said tariffs will be payable on goods moving from the EU into the rest of the UK via Northern Ireland. It insisted that this would create no border down the Irish sea because there would be no checks on goods moved between Northern Ireland and Britain. But Prof Winters said it ""almost certainly"" violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules that demand equal treatment for all trading partners, he said. ""Leaving the Irish border open also opens up the possibility of some EU goods being shipped to the UK via Ireland and so avoiding UK tariffs.""

'Swiss climbers' died in Ben Nevis avalanche,"Police at the scene of Ben Nevis rescue effort Two of three climbers who died in an avalanche on Ben Nevis on Tuesday were from France and the other from Switzerland, police have confirmed. Swiss authorities had earlier confirmed the death of one Swiss national and that another was injured. The Frenchmen were aged 41 and 32 and the Swiss man who died was 43. Mathieu Biselx, the 30-year-old survivor of the avalanche in Number 5 Gully, has been receiving treatment in hospital in Glasgow. His condition was described as ""stable"". Mr Biselx is the president of the Sion section of the Swiss Alpine Club. His companions were also club members. Third person dead after Ben Nevis avalanche A Swiss embassy spokeswoman told the BBC Scotland news website: ""Swiss authorities are in contact with the Scottish authorities as well as with the families in Switzerland."" According to the Swiss newspaper, Le Nouvelliste,external, all four men lived in Valais in the Swiss Alps and had left for Scotland on Sunday. Mr Biselx told the newspaper: ""It's terrible, they're not here anymore. They won't see their families again."" He added: ""We weren't very high up and suddenly we heard a noise. ""We looked round and two seconds later we were carried away by heavy, compact snow. When I regained consciousness only my head and an arm were sticking out of the snow."" Donald Paterson, of Lochaber MRT, said the avalanche in Number 5 Gully was seen by other climbers The avalanche on the mountain, near Fort William, is one of the worst Scottish climbing accidents in recent years. Twenty-nine volunteer mountain rescuers were involved in the rescue operation as well as a group of military personnel from the Joint Services Mountain Training Centre. Lochaber MRT said conditions on the mountain were ""very difficult with very high winds, snow and thunder and lightning"". A Coastguard helicopter involved in the rescue effort The weather hampered the efforts of Coastguard helicopter crews, despite ""some excellent flying"", the team said. The alarm was raised by a Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) forecaster and a guide climbing who were in the area. SAIS assesses potential avalanche risk for Lochaber, where Ben Nevis is located, and five other mountain areas,external. Donald Paterson, Lochaber MRT deputy team leader, told BBC Scotland the avalanche occurred above where the party of climbers were. He said the SAIS forecaster had seen a ""plume"" coming out of the gully, but could not see if anyone was in the path of the snow slide from their position. Mr Paterson said: ""The second confirmation (of the avalanche) came from a guide, who was on the opposite side of the coire and witnessed the slide coming down and the people below. ""Initially it was thought there were two people, but when we reached them it was confirmed there were four in the party."" Mountain rescue teams, the coastguard, police and ambulance service were involved in the rescue effort Insp Isla Campbell, of Police Scotland, said: ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those involved in the avalanche on Ben Nevis yesterday. ""Formal identification will take place in due course and the next of kin of those involved have now all been informed. ""I would again like to thank the volunteers from Lochaber and Glencoe mountain rescue teams and the members of the public who assisted with this incident, in what was extremely challenging conditions."" Insp Campbell urged walkers and climbers to carefully plan their trips into the hills, and to check weather and avalanche forecasts. She added: ""We do not want to put anyone off enjoying the great outdoors activities we have here in Scotland but we would ask that people plan their routes, take sensible precautions and consider whether it is safe to climb a particular route. ""The environment of the Scottish mountains is by its very nature an unpredictable one and it is important that people take as many precautions and plan ahead as much as possible if they are going to go climbing, especially at this time of year."" Brian Tregaskis, secretary of the Lochaber MRT, added: ""The members of the Lochaber and Glencoe Mountain Rescue teams did an incredible job in very difficult conditions. ""We'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of those who lost their lives and we hope the surviving casualty makes a full and speedy recovery."" Lochaber MRT said the incident was the third avalanche in Number 5 Gully since Saturday. On Saturday evening, a party of four climbers were ""avalanched"". One of the group was swept down the gully but was not injured. Are you in the area? Have you been affected by what's happened?

"Bowie's Starman demo sells for ÃÂ£51,000","This video can not be played A demo of David Bowie's hit song Starman - and a snippet of Hang Onto Yourself A tape that is believed to be the first recording of David Bowie's Starman has fetched more than Â£50,000 at auction. The 1971 tape, which had a pre-sale guide price of Â£10,000, had gathered dust in a loft for almost 50 years. Bowie can be heard on the demo telling guitarist Mick Ronson he had not finished the song when he tried to end the recording. Ronson gave the demo to his friend Kevin Hutchinson, an aspiring musician, to help him learn the song in 1971. But after listening to the song, Mr Hutchinson labelled it ""David Bowie rehearsal tape"" and packed it away in his loft. David Bowie: The artistic chameleon who changed music The demo also contains recordings of Bowie songs Moonage Daydream and Hang Onto Yourself. It sold for Â£50,430 including buyer's premium. David Bowie on stage on his Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane tour in London, 1973 Mr Hutchinson said: ""I remember listening to it and thinking, 'This is OK.' I didn't think, 'This is fantastic.' ""At 16, you're not totally impressed. Nothing impresses you."" He kept the tape despite moving house several times and now Mr Hutchinson thinks it's ""phenomenal... obviously"". Starman, about an alien who'd ""like to come and meet us but he thinks he'd blow our minds"" was released as a single in 1972, reaching number 10 in the UK chart.  It also featured on the Ziggy Stardust concept album. Bowie died on 10 January 2016 The demo was auctioned on Tuesday at Omega Auctions in Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside. Mr Hutchinson retrieved the tape from his loft after watching a documentary about Bowie, who died at the age of 69 in 2016. Mr Hutchinson said of his decision to sell the demo: ""I'm 65... It's not used in my life...  so I've started what they call on TV 'decluttering.'"" This video can not be played The many faces of David Bowie Dan Hampson, assistant auction manager at Omega Auctions, said the tape was ""possibly the first ever demo version of Starman"". He added: ""There's a lot of Bowie mythology around the writing of this timeless classic, and the raw and truly beautiful version heard here helps to provide a fascinating insight into the creative process of a bona fide genius.""

FBI uncovers celebrity exam cheat plotDesperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman is among at least 40 people charged in a cheating conspiracy.US & Canada,"Felicity Huffman (left) and Lori Loughlin (right) were among those charged Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman is among more than 40 people charged in a US college cheating scam, according to unsealed court records. The alleged scheme involved helping students cheat on entrance exams, as well as getting non-athletic students admitted on fake athletic scholarships. Elite schools Yale, Stanford and Georgetown were among the destination universities. There was no suggestion that the schools were involved in wrongdoing. Lori Loughlin's daughters in spotlight The extreme lengths parents go to for college admissions The defendants are largely wealthy and also include CEOs of major companies. ""These parents are a catalogue of wealth and privilege,"" said US Attorney Andrew Lelling at a news conference about the investigation known as Operation Varsity Blues on Tuesday. According to the charging documents,external, Ms Huffman made a ""charitable contribution"" of $15,000 (Â£11,500) to participate in the scheme on behalf of her eldest daughter. She allegedly arranged to use the scheme a second time, for her younger daughter, before deciding not to do so. Ms Huffman was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. She was secretly recorded discussing the scheme with a co-operating witness. Felicity Huffman was photographed inside the US Courthouse in Los Angeles The papers said the co-operating witness met Ms Huffman and her husband, the actor William H Macy, at their Los Angeles home and explained the scam to them. The witness said the pair ""agreed to the plan"". Mr Macy was not indicted. Ms Huffman appeared in a Los Angeles court later on Tuesday and was released on $250,000 bail. The judge ordered the actress to restrict her travel to the continental US. Mr Macy also attended court. This video can not be played The scheme involved creating fake sporting photographs, said US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew Lelling The actress Lori Loughlin, best known for starring in the US sitcom Full House, was also among those indicted. Ms Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli - who was also indicted - ""agreed to pay bribes totalling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits"" to the University of Southern California (USC) rowing team, the documents said. Both their daughters are currently studying at USC. Federal prosecutors in Boston charged William ""Rick"" Singer, 58, with running the alleged scheme through his company Edge College & Career Network. Mr Singer pleaded guilty on Tuesday in Boston federal court to charges including racketeering, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. He could receive a maximum of 65 years in prison and more than $1m in fines. He told the court: ""I am responsible. I put all the people in place,""local news site Mass Live reported,external. Mr Singer will be sentenced in June. William H Macy, Felicity Huffman and the couple's two daughters at a 2014 movie premiere. According to the FBI, athletics coaches at various institutions were also involved in the scheme - recommending the fraudulent applicants internally and pocketing bribes in return. The head women's football coach at Yale University was allegedly paid $400,000 to accept a student who did not even play the sport - and those parents gave Mr Singer $1.2m for arranging the bribe. ""This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth, combined with fraud,"" Mr Lelling said. ""There can be no separate college admission for wealthy, and I will add there will not be a separate criminal justice system either."" In all, 33 parents were charged as well as 13 athletics coaches and associates of Mr Singer's business. Lori Loughlin has two daughters attending USC The documents detailed two alleged scams run by Mr Singer's firm, Edge College & Career Network: cheating on college entrance exams and using connections with coaches at top schools to organise bribes while faking athletic credentials for students. ""Some parents took advantage of one... some took advantage of the other, and some took advantage of both,"" Mr Lelling said. Parents including Ms Huffman and Ms Loughlin paid somewhere between several thousand dollars and $6.5m to Edge for its services, authorities said, earning Singer about $25m between roughly 2011 and 2018. The firm reportedly instructed parents to claim their child had a disability which required that they be given extra time to complete exams. The FBI said parents were then told to invent an excuse - such as a family wedding - for their students to sit the entrance exams at specific facilities, where staff had been bribed to turn a blind eye to cheating. Someone working for the firm involved in the scandal either sat the exam for the students, gave students the answers, or corrected their answer papers, the FBI said. The Edge staff member who assisted in the cheating was briefed on exactly how well to perform, in order not to raise suspicion that a child's scores had improved too much, the FBI said. Trump 'to scrap' college racial bias policy Wealthy students tighten university grip Fake US university exposes visa scheme In most cases, the students did not know their admissions had been paid for with bribes, but in several the students were involved, officials added. The firm also allegedly created detailed fake athletics profiles for students - including photo-shopping the faces of potential students on to pictures of athletes found online - allowing students to be recruited on athletic scholarships. Mr Lelling said the case arose after authorities were tipped off by the ""target of an entirely different investigation"". Georgetown University was targeted by the scam USC said it had fired two employees who were indicted in the alleged bribery case: senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and water polo coach Jovan Vavic. Court documents say Mr Vavic placed two students on his water polo team to help them get into the university, and was paid $250,000. Ms Heinel also allegedly accepted bribes to facilitate admissions. ""USC is in the process of identifying any funds received by the university in connection with this alleged scheme. Additionally, the university is reviewing its admissions processes broadly to ensure that such actions do not occur going forward."" Georgetown, Yale, UCLA, Wake Forest and the University of Texas released similar statements acknowledging the investigation. On social media, many have expressed outrage over the alleged scam, pointing out that the US college system is already biased in favour of wealthier, white Americans. And others have noted that for the mega-rich, it's easy to legally donate money to a school in order to receive admission. People were photographed climbing school walls to pass on answers to Indian students in 2015 In China, 2,440 pharmacists were accused of cheatingby using earpieces in a national licensing test in 2014, according to China's state TV. Exam cheating is widespread in India. In 2015, several hundred people were arrested in connection with mass school exam cheating in the state of Bihar. A year laterstudent Ruby Rai, who'd been ranked first in state exams, was arrestedand her results cancelled after video of a college interview she'd flunked went viral.

Cardinal jailed for child sexual abuse,"This video can not be played Cardinal guilty of sexual abuse âacted with staggering arrogance' Cardinal George Pell has been jailed for six years after being convicted of sexually abusing two boys in Australia. The former Vatican treasurer is the most senior Catholic figure ever to be found guilty of sexual offences against children. Pell abused the 13-year-old choir boys in a Melbourne cathedral in 1996, a jury ruled last year. The cardinal, 77, maintains his innocence and has lodged an appeal. In sentencing Pell on Wednesday, a judge said the cleric had committed ""a brazen and forcible sexual attack on the two victims"". ""Your conduct was permeated by staggering arrogance,"" said Judge Peter Kidd. In December, a jury unanimously convicted Pell of one charge of sexually penetrating a child under 16, and four counts of committing an indecent act on a child under 16. His conviction has rocked the Catholic Church, where he had been one of the Pope's closest advisers. Pell: Poisoned power at the top Why his conviction was kept a secret Inside a strictly controlled trial The backlash to the verdict in Australia Pell will be eligible for parole after three years and eight months. His appeal will be heard in June. One of Pell's victims said it was hard ""to take comfort in this outcome"" with the cleric's appeal looming. Prosecutors said that Pell had abused the boys following a mass in St Patrick's Cathedral in 1996, when he was archbishop of Melbourne. After telling them they were in trouble for drinking communion wine, Pell forced each boy into indecent acts, the court heard. He abused one of the boys again in 1997. The trial heard testimony from one of the victims. The other died of a drug overdose in 2014. Pell has been a close adviser to Pope Francis in recent years The verdict was kept secret from the public until February, when additional charges of sexual offences against Pell were withdrawn by prosecutors. Judge Kidd said Pell's crimes were particularly callous because of a ""stark"" power imbalance. ""You were the archbishop of St Patrick's Cathedral - no less - and you sexually abused two choir boys within that cathedral,"" he told the County Court of Victoria. ""You even told your victims to be quiet because they were crying."" The judge said he had considered Pell's age and health in determining the sentence. Each of the five charges had carried a maximum 10-year jail term. Judge Kidd added that Pell should not ""be made a scapegoat"" for wider failings within the Catholic Church. How will the Pope tackle abuse in the Catholic Church? Abuse and the Church: What you need to know He took more than an hour to deliver his remarks. Unusually for local courts, they were broadcast live - in what officials said was a commitment to ""open justice"". Hywel Griffith, BBC News Australia correspondent Leaning on his walking stick and dressed without his clerical collar, George Pell arrived in the courtroom knowing he faced a significant prison sentence. He nodded towards a few supporters, but they were significantly outnumbered by the many campaigners and abuse survivors who had come to witness his downfall. When his sentence was handed down, many in the court turned to look at Pell, searching for any flicker of emotion. But Pell remained impassive throughout, staring straight ahead, and then bowing towards the judge before being led away. His lawyers argue that the jury's verdict was ""unreasonable"" because it relied too heavily on the testimony of one victim. This video can not be played Pell called the abuse allegations 'disgraceful rubbish' in his first police interview in 2016 They have also asserted that Pell was wrongly prevented from entering his plea before a jury, and that a defence animation should have been allowed as evidence at the trial. A court will begin considering the appeal on 5 June. Pell argues 'irregularity' in abuse verdict Pell's surviving victim - who cannot be named - welcomed the sentence but said it was difficult ""to feel the gravity of this moment"". ""There is no rest for me. Everything is overshadowed by the forthcoming appeal,"" he said in a statement read by his lawyer. The father of the deceased victim said he was disappointed in the sentence, but was glad to see Pell jailed. ""I watched him walking out of that court and I thought to myself: 'Well, I'm going to sleep in my bed tonight, where are you sleeping?'"" he told reporters. Many people travelled to the court to hear the sentence Last month, the Vatican described Pell's conviction as ""painful news"" that had ""shocked many"", and confirmed he was prohibited from public ministry. He was removed from the Pope's inner circle in December. The Church noted, however, that the cleric had a right to ""defend himself to the last degree"". The cardinal has also retained the support of some high-profile figures in Australia. The sexual abuse of children was rarely discussed in public before the 1970s, and it was not until the 1980s that the first cases of molestation by priests came to light, in the US and Canada. In the decades since, evidence of widespread abuse has emerged globally. In Australia,an inquiry heard that 7% of the nation's Catholic priests had abused children. Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' US Cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations Pope Francis has established a committee to tackle sexual abuses. At a landmark Church summit on paedophilia last month, he said clergy guilty of abuse were ""tools of Satan"". But critics say he could do more to combat paedophiles and those who conceal abuse.

US refuses to ground Boeing crash aircraft,"Investigators examine wreckage from the Ethiopian Airlines plane crash The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said it will not ground the Boeing 737 Max aircraft despite mounting pressure. The US regulator said a review showed ""no systemic performance issues"" with the aircraft. An Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday killing all 157 people on board, in the second fatal accident involving the 737 Max 8 model in five months. Numerous countries have banned the plane from their airspace. On Wednesday Hong Kong, Vietnam and New Zealand joined the list of countries that had banned 737 Max models. The UK, China, the European Union and Australia had previously done so. Which airlines use the 737 Max 8? Ethiopian Airlines: Who are the victims? Ethiopian Airlines: Flight recorders recovered from crash site Ted Cruz, a Republican senator who chairs a subcommittee on aviation and space, said: ""I believe it would be prudent for the US likewise to temporarily ground 737 Max aircraft until the FAA confirms the safety of these aircraft and their passengers."" Democratic senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal have written to the FAA - which they referred to as ""our aviation safety cop on the beat"" - asking that the Boeing 737 Max should be grounded ""until the agency can conclusively determine that the aircraft can be operated safely"". Democrat presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren said that the FAA should follow other nations' lead ""immediately"" and ""get these planes out of the sky"". Senator Ted Cruz says it would be ""prudent"" for the Boeing 737 Max aircraft to be temporarily grounded And Republican senator Mitt Romney said: ""Out of an abundance of caution for the flying public, the FAA should ground the 737 Max 8 until we investigate the causes of recent crashes and ensure the plane's airworthiness."" But the FAA said that other civil aviation authorities had not ""provided data to us that would warrant action"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Boeing has confirmed that for the past few months it has been developing a ""flight control software enhancement"" for the aircraft, but says it is confident they are safe to fly. Airline workers also want the FAA to ground the Boeing 737 Max. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union said it is calling on the FAA ""to temporarily ground the 737 MAX fleet in the US out of an abundance of caution"". Its president Sara Nelson, said: ""The US has the safest aviation system in the world, but Americans are looking for leadership in this time of uncertainty. ""The FAA must act decisively to restore the public faith in the system. The Allied Pilots Association told its members: ""It is important for you to know that if you feel it is unsafe to work the 737 Max, you will not be forced to fly it."" Southwest Airlines and American Airlines - both major operators of the Boeing 737 Max - are continuing to use the planes. Southwest Airlines is offering passengers scheduled to fly on one of the Boeing planes the chance to change their bookings. American Airlines said its ""standard policies for changes still apply"". The Boeing 737 Max fleet of aircraft are the latest in the company's successful 737 line. The group includes the Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 models. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered 350 of the Max 8 model out of 5,011 orders. A small number of Max 9s are also operating. The Max 7 and 10 models, not yet delivered, are due for roll-out in the next few years. The Max 8 that crashed on Sunday was one of 30 ordered as part of Ethiopian Airlines' expansion.It underwent a ""rigorous first check maintenance"",externalon 4 February, the airline said. Followinglast October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia, investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling, a new feature of the jet. It is not yet clear whether the anti-stall system was the cause of Sunday's crash. Aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted.

Many students 'without running water',"A third of UK students have gone without heating or running water in their properties, a survey has suggested. The state of accommodation is among a list of 10 biggest concerns among young tenants, the survey of 2,196 students by website Save the Student suggests. But noisy housemates remains the biggest gripe in the annual survey. It also highlights concerns about the cost of living away from home for the first time. Student rents jump as accommodation goes upmarket The findings suggested that typical upfront costs, including fees, the deposit, and a month's rent in advance, totalled Â£970. Average rent stood at about Â£125 a week, of which parents contribute an average of Â£44. One in five students receive more than Â£100 a week from parents to help cover the cost. Two in five turned to overdrafts, loans, and credit cards to pay the rental bill, Save the Student said. Previous research by student housing charity Unipol and the National Union of Students suggested that the average price of student accommodation in the UK had risen by nearly a third in six years. Student finance: What you need to know,external, from the independent Money Advice Service Save The Student,externalwebsite Maintenance loans and grants information inEngland,external,Wales,external,Scotland,external, andNorthern Ireland,external Money and funding,external, from the National Union of Students Join the conversation in the BBC NewsAffordable Living,externalFacebook group About 30% of those asked had started to look for the following academic year's lodgings by November in an attempt to find a decent deal and to spread the cost over time. In addition to the cost, poor conditions in student accommodation were a major concern. One student in Portsmouth said that on the day she moved in there was no front door on the property and there was no heating for two months. Another in Newcastle said she had no hot water for the entire year. ""I had to boil the kettle and fill up the sink that way to wash my face,"" she said. Jake Butler wants it to be easier for students to resolve issues Damp, a lack of water or heating, disruptive building work, and rodents and pests all featured in the top 10 list of complaints, according to the Save the Student survey. Jake Butler, from Save the Student, said: ""Too many people - including students - seem to believe that poor living conditions are just a part of student life. ""While the laws around renting are constantly improving there needs to be a much easier way for students to report and resolve problems with their accommodation."" Updated legislation, which takes effect on 20 March, is designed to ensure that all rented accommodation is fit for human habitation and strengthens tenants' means of redress against landlords who fail to keep their properties safe.

"Bowie's Starman demo sells for Â£51,000","This video can not be played A demo of David Bowie's hit song Starman - and a snippet of Hang Onto Yourself A tape that is believed to be the first recording of David Bowie's Starman has fetched more than Â£50,000 at auction. The 1971 tape, which had a pre-sale guide price of Â£10,000, had gathered dust in a loft for almost 50 years. Bowie can be heard on the demo telling guitarist Mick Ronson he had not finished the song when he tried to end the recording. Ronson gave the demo to his friend Kevin Hutchinson, an aspiring musician, to help him learn the song in 1971. But after listening to the song, Mr Hutchinson labelled it ""David Bowie rehearsal tape"" and packed it away in his loft. David Bowie: The artistic chameleon who changed music The demo also contains recordings of Bowie songs Moonage Daydream and Hang Onto Yourself. It sold for Â£50,430 including buyer's premium. David Bowie on stage on his Ziggy Stardust/Aladdin Sane tour in London, 1973 Mr Hutchinson said: ""I remember listening to it and thinking, 'This is OK.' I didn't think, 'This is fantastic.' ""At 16, you're not totally impressed. Nothing impresses you."" He kept the tape despite moving house several times and now Mr Hutchinson thinks it's ""phenomenal... obviously"". Starman, about an alien who'd ""like to come and meet us but he thinks he'd blow our minds"" was released as a single in 1972, reaching number 10 in the UK chart.  It also featured on the Ziggy Stardust concept album. Bowie died on 10 January 2016 The demo was auctioned on Tuesday at Omega Auctions in Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside. Mr Hutchinson retrieved the tape from his loft after watching a documentary about Bowie, who died at the age of 69 in 2016. Mr Hutchinson said of his decision to sell the demo: ""I'm 65... It's not used in my life...  so I've started what they call on TV 'decluttering.'"" This video can not be played The many faces of David Bowie Dan Hampson, assistant auction manager at Omega Auctions, said the tape was ""possibly the first ever demo version of Starman"". He added: ""There's a lot of Bowie mythology around the writing of this timeless classic, and the raw and truly beautiful version heard here helps to provide a fascinating insight into the creative process of a bona fide genius.""

Death metal inspires joy not violence,"I've had one desire since I was born; to see my body ripped and torn. The lyrics of death metal band Bloodbath's cannibalism-themed track, Eaten, do not leave much to the imagination. But neither this song - nor the gruesome lyrics of others of the genre - inspire violence. That is the conclusion ofMacquarie University's music lab,external, which used the track in a psychological test. It revealed that death metal fans are not ""desensitised"" to violent imagery. The findings are published in the Royal Society journal Open Science,,external ""[Death metal] fans are nice people,"" said Prof Bill Thompson, from the Australian university, which is based in Sydney. ""They're not going to go out and hurt someone."" This latest study is part of a decades-longinvestigation by Prof Thompson and his colleagues into the emotional effects of music,external. These effects, he explained, are complex. ""Many people enjoy sad music, and that's a bit of a paradox - why would we want to make ourselves sad?"" he asked. ""The same can be said of music with aggressive or violent themes. For us, it's a psychological paradox - so [as scientists] we're curious, and at the same time we recognise that violence in the media is a socially significant issue."" With a classic psychological experiment that probes people's subconscious responses; and by recruiting death metal fans to take part. The test involved asking 32 fans and 48 non-fans listen to death metal or to pop whilst looking at some pretty unpleasant images. Lead researcher Yanan Sun explained that the aim of the experiment was to measure how much participants' brains noticed violent scenes, and to compare how their sensitivity was affected by the musical accompaniment. To test the impact of different types of music, they also used a track they deemed to be the opposite of Eaten. Lead singer of Bloodbath, Nick Holmes, described his band's lyrical content as 'an aural version of an 80's horror film' ""We used 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams as a [comparison],"" said Dr Sun. Each participant was playedHappyorEatenthrough headphones, while they were shown a pair of images - one to each eye. One image showed a violent scene, such as someone being attacked in a street. The other showed something innocuous - a group of people walking down that same street, for example. ""It's called binocular rivalry,"" explained Dr Sun. The basis of this psychological test is that when most people are presented with a neutral image to one eye and a violent image to the other - they see the violent image more. How music helps the brain Turning a telescope into an art installation ""The brain will try to take it in - presumably there's a biological reason for that, because it's a threat,"" Prof Thompson explained. ""If fans of violent music were desensitised to violence, which is what a lot of parent groups, religious groups and censorship boards are worried about, then they wouldn't show this same bias.  ""But the fans showed the very same bias towards processing these violent images as those who were not fans of this music."" ""We don't have any issue with it,"" Bloodbath's lead singer Nick Holmes told BBC News. ""The lyrics are harmless fun, as the study proved."" He added that Bloodbath's lyrical content was ""basically an aural version of an 80s horror film"". ""The majority of death metal fans are intelligent, thoughtful people who just have a passion for the music,"" he said. ""It's the equivalent of people who are obsessed with horror movies or even battle re-enactments."" Prof Thompson said the findings should be ""reassuring to parents or religious groups"" concerned about violent music. More broadly, there is still concern that violence in media leads to social problems. ""If you're desensitised to violence, perhaps you wouldn't care if you saw someone on the street getting hurt - you wouldn't help."" But while research has found some evidence of such desensitisation in people who play a lot of violent video games, music, it seems, is different. ""The dominant emotional response to this music is joy and empowerment,"" said Prof Thompson. ""And I think that to listen to this music and to transform it into an empowering, beautiful experience - that's an amazing thing."" Nick Holmes identified with that, saying that most of the music he enjoyed was ""melancholic, dramatic, sad or aggressive and not much in-between"". ""I take joy and empowerment from those styles,"" he told BBC News. On the topic of the Eaten's lyrics, he added: ""I didn't personally write them, but I would be frankly astounded if anyone listened to that song and then felt a desire to be eaten by a cannibal.""

Carphone Warehouse fined for mis-selling,"es The UK's financial regulator has fined Carphone Warehouse more than Â£29m for insurance mis-selling. TheFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) found,externalthe firm failed to train staff properly to advise customers buying Geek Squad mobile phone insurance The FCA was tipped off by a whistleblower. Carphone Warehouse's boss said the firm was ""disappointed"" it had fallen short in the past but that it was a ""very different business today"". Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: ""The Carphone Warehouse and its staff persuaded customers to purchase the Geek Squad product which in some cases had little to no value because the customer already had insurance cover. The high level of cancellations should have been a clear indicator to the management of mis-selling. ""Without whistleblowers coming forward, these practices may never have come to light.  In the past few years, whistleblowers have contributed critical intelligence to the enforcement actions we have taken against firms and individuals."" Alex Baldock, Carphone Warehouse chief executive, said: ""As the FCA acknowledges, we've made significant improvements since 2015. We're committed to stay on that trajectory, and to make sure all customers enjoy the right technology products and services for them."" Dixons Carphone shares fall on huge loss Nine million more hit by Dixons data breach Carphone Warehouse fined over cyber-attack The FCA said the company had failed to give its sales consultants the right training to give ""suitable advice"" to Geek Squad customers. For example, it found that staff were trained to recommend Geek Squad to customers who already had cover, for example through their home insurance or bank accounts. Customers who said they might have a similar product or wanted to think about it were advised to purchase Geek Squad and cancel in 14 days. ""This created a risk that customers would purchase insurance that they did not need and would be exposed to the risk of paying for it if they did not cancel in time,"" the FCA said. During the period under investigation, between 1 December 2008 and 30 June 2015, Carphone Warehouse sold Geek Squad policies worth more than Â£444.7m. The FCA said a high proportion of these policies were subsequently cancelled early. In January 2014, 35% of policies were cancelled within the first three months. ""High cancellation rates are an indicator of a risk of mis-selling which The Carphone Warehouse failed to properly consider,"" according to the FCA. Carphone Warehouse did not contest the FCA's findings. As a result it qualified for a 30% discount on the fine, without that it would have had to pay more than Â£41m.

Nissan cuts two models from Sunderland plant,"Nissan plans to end the production of two of its Infiniti cars at Sunderland. It's part of a bigger plan that involves pulling the Infiniti brand out of Western Europe. As a result the Q30 car and QX30 sports-utility vehicle will no longer be made in the UK. About 250 staff could be affected by the move and Nissan intends to discuss the impact with those employees. The move follow's Nissan's recent decision to build its new X-Trail model in Japan, instead of Sunderland. The Infiniti brand has struggled to make a mark in Western Europe- last year sales halved to 5,800. About 70,000 of Infiniti cars have been made in Sunderland since production began in 2015. Nissan chooses Japan over UK for new car ""Western Europe remains the most challenging and competitive region for premium cars,"" Infiniti's chief spokesman, Trevor Hale, said. Instead, Nissan plans to promote the Infiniti brand in the US and Chinese markets. In the US it plans to focus Infiniti on sports-utility vehicles and in China it plans to launch five new vehicles. The Infiniti line-up of cars will be electric from 2021 and diesel versions will be discontinued, the company said. Labour's Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said: ""This is yet another blow to Sunderland, only a few weeks after Nissan decided to take planned production of the X-Trail out of the city. ""When we look at what is happening to the car industry, from Swindon right through to Sunderland, it is clear the UK car industry has been undermined by this government. ""The Tories' mishandling of Brexit has created prolonged uncertainty, and they have refused to support the industry while it faces enormous challenges, like electrification.

Cardinal jailed for child sexual abuseAustralian Cardinal George Pell is the most senior Catholic ever convicted of such crimes.Australia,"This video can not be played Cardinal guilty of sexual abuse âacted with staggering arrogance' Cardinal George Pell has been jailed for six years after being convicted of sexually abusing two boys in Australia. The former Vatican treasurer is the most senior Catholic figure ever to be found guilty of sexual offences against children. Pell abused the 13-year-old choir boys in a Melbourne cathedral in 1996, a jury ruled last year. The cardinal, 77, maintains his innocence and has lodged an appeal. In sentencing Pell on Wednesday, a judge said the cleric had committed ""a brazen and forcible sexual attack on the two victims"". ""Your conduct was permeated by staggering arrogance,"" said Judge Peter Kidd. In December, a jury unanimously convicted Pell of one charge of sexually penetrating a child under 16, and four counts of committing an indecent act on a child under 16. His conviction has rocked the Catholic Church, where he had been one of the Pope's closest advisers. Pell: Poisoned power at the top Why his conviction was kept a secret Inside a strictly controlled trial The backlash to the verdict in Australia Pell will be eligible for parole after three years and eight months. His appeal will be heard in June. One of Pell's victims said it was hard ""to take comfort in this outcome"" with the cleric's appeal looming. Prosecutors said that Pell had abused the boys following a mass in St Patrick's Cathedral in 1996, when he was archbishop of Melbourne. After telling them they were in trouble for drinking communion wine, Pell forced each boy into indecent acts, the court heard. He abused one of the boys again in 1997. The trial heard testimony from one of the victims. The other died of a drug overdose in 2014. Pell has been a close adviser to Pope Francis in recent years The verdict was kept secret from the public until February, when additional charges of sexual offences against Pell were withdrawn by prosecutors. Judge Kidd said Pell's crimes were particularly callous because of a ""stark"" power imbalance. ""You were the archbishop of St Patrick's Cathedral - no less - and you sexually abused two choir boys within that cathedral,"" he told the County Court of Victoria. ""You even told your victims to be quiet because they were crying."" The judge said he had considered Pell's age and health in determining the sentence. Each of the five charges had carried a maximum 10-year jail term. Judge Kidd added that Pell should not ""be made a scapegoat"" for wider failings within the Catholic Church. How will the Pope tackle abuse in the Catholic Church? Abuse and the Church: What you need to know He took more than an hour to deliver his remarks. Unusually for local courts, they were broadcast live - in what officials said was a commitment to ""open justice"". Hywel Griffith, BBC News Australia correspondent Leaning on his walking stick and dressed without his clerical collar, George Pell arrived in the courtroom knowing he faced a significant prison sentence. He nodded towards a few supporters, but they were significantly outnumbered by the many campaigners and abuse survivors who had come to witness his downfall. When his sentence was handed down, many in the court turned to look at Pell, searching for any flicker of emotion. But Pell remained impassive throughout, staring straight ahead, and then bowing towards the judge before being led away. His lawyers argue that the jury's verdict was ""unreasonable"" because it relied too heavily on the testimony of one victim. This video can not be played Pell called the abuse allegations 'disgraceful rubbish' in his first police interview in 2016 They have also asserted that Pell was wrongly prevented from entering his plea before a jury, and that a defence animation should have been allowed as evidence at the trial. A court will begin considering the appeal on 5 June. Pell argues 'irregularity' in abuse verdict Pell's surviving victim - who cannot be named - welcomed the sentence but said it was difficult ""to feel the gravity of this moment"". ""There is no rest for me. Everything is overshadowed by the forthcoming appeal,"" he said in a statement read by his lawyer. The father of the deceased victim said he was disappointed in the sentence, but was glad to see Pell jailed. ""I watched him walking out of that court and I thought to myself: 'Well, I'm going to sleep in my bed tonight, where are you sleeping?'"" he told reporters. Many people travelled to the court to hear the sentence Last month, the Vatican described Pell's conviction as ""painful news"" that had ""shocked many"", and confirmed he was prohibited from public ministry. He was removed from the Pope's inner circle in December. The Church noted, however, that the cleric had a right to ""defend himself to the last degree"". The cardinal has also retained the support of some high-profile figures in Australia. The sexual abuse of children was rarely discussed in public before the 1970s, and it was not until the 1980s that the first cases of molestation by priests came to light, in the US and Canada. In the decades since, evidence of widespread abuse has emerged globally. In Australia,an inquiry heard that 7% of the nation's Catholic priests had abused children. Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' US Cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations Pope Francis has established a committee to tackle sexual abuses. At a landmark Church summit on paedophilia last month, he said clergy guilty of abuse were ""tools of Satan"". But critics say he could do more to combat paedophiles and those who conceal abuse.

"Third person dead after Ben Nevis avalancheA rescue operation took place in ""extremely difficult conditions"" on Britain's highest mountain.Highlands & Islands","A Coastguard helicopter involved in the rescue effort A third person has died following an avalanche on Ben Nevis, police have confirmed. Two climbers died at the scene and a fourth person was injured in the incident, which took place in an area known as Number 5 Gully. The alarm was raised at 11:50 and a Coastguard helicopter, air ambulance, three road ambulances and a trauma team were sent to the scene. Mountain rescue teams from Lochaber and Glencoe also joined the rescue effort. And a group of military personnel training in the area offered assistance to the rescuers. Police initially said two people died in the avalanche and two people were injured. One of the injured climbers later died and the second was airlifted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow for treatment. Officers said they were working to establish the identity of the climbers and were following a ""positive line of inquiry"" in relation to their identity. Insp Isla Campbell said: ""This has been a challenging operation and I want to pass on my thanks to the mountain rescue teams, colleagues at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Scottish Ambulance Service for their assistance in extremely difficult conditions. ""I would also like to praise members of the public and staff from the Scottish Avalanche Information Service who were on scene at the time and provided immediate assistance."" On Monday, the avalanche risk on the mountain was assessed to be 'high' Earlier Insp Campbell told BBC Scotland that the weather in the area was atrocious. ""The rescuers have been working through some really difficult conditions there, high winds preventing the use of the helicopter,"" she said. ""So although I wasn't up there personally I can just imagine, from the weather on the ground today, it's been very, very challenging for them. ""I would really like to thank those volunteers from the mountain rescue team and those people who were in the area who came into action and assisted so ably."" The Scottish Ambulance Service said it had dispatched three ambulances, a helimed resource and a trauma team to the scene after being alerted at 12:22. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her thoughts were with the bereaved and injured following the ""absolutely tragic news"". Local SNP MSP Kate Forbes added: ""I'm sure that the hearts of everybody in the local area go out to those who are grieving. I sincerely hope that there are no further casualties."" She also expressed gratitude to the mountain rescue team volunteers who were ""ready and willing to go out in all weathers whenever the call comes"". Mountain rescue teams, the coastguard, police and ambulance service were involved in the rescue effort Ben Nevis has been the scene of other fatal accidents this winter. A 21-year-old German woman, who was studying at Bristol University, diedafter she fell from a ridge she had been climbing with three other peopleon New Year's Day. In December,Patrick Boothroyd, 21, from West Yorkshiredied after a fall on the mountain. Elsewhere in the Highlands, a 57-year-old man died after he and a companion werereported missing in Glen Coe on Saturday. The pair had travelled to the area from Nottinghamshire as part of a larger group. Last month,Aberdeen-born Andy Nisbet and Inverness-based Steve Perry died after getting into difficulty on Ben Hope.

"Many students 'without running water'A third of UK students have gone without heating or running water, a survey suggests.Business","A third of UK students have gone without heating or running water in their properties, a survey has suggested. The state of accommodation is among a list of 10 biggest concerns among young tenants, the survey of 2,196 students by website Save the Student suggests. But noisy housemates remains the biggest gripe in the annual survey. It also highlights concerns about the cost of living away from home for the first time. Student rents jump as accommodation goes upmarket The findings suggested that typical upfront costs, including fees, the deposit, and a month's rent in advance, totalled Â£970. Average rent stood at about Â£125 a week, of which parents contribute an average of Â£44. One in five students receive more than Â£100 a week from parents to help cover the cost. Two in five turned to overdrafts, loans, and credit cards to pay the rental bill, Save the Student said. Previous research by student housing charity Unipol and the National Union of Students suggested that the average price of student accommodation in the UK had risen by nearly a third in six years. Student finance: What you need to know,external, from the independent Money Advice Service Save The Student,externalwebsite Maintenance loans and grants information inEngland,external,Wales,external,Scotland,external, andNorthern Ireland,external Money and funding,external, from the National Union of Students Join the conversation in the BBC NewsAffordable Living,externalFacebook group About 30% of those asked had started to look for the following academic year's lodgings by November in an attempt to find a decent deal and to spread the cost over time. In addition to the cost, poor conditions in student accommodation were a major concern. One student in Portsmouth said that on the day she moved in there was no front door on the property and there was no heating for two months. Another in Newcastle said she had no hot water for the entire year. ""I had to boil the kettle and fill up the sink that way to wash my face,"" she said. Jake Butler wants it to be easier for students to resolve issues Damp, a lack of water or heating, disruptive building work, and rodents and pests all featured in the top 10 list of complaints, according to the Save the Student survey. Jake Butler, from Save the Student, said: ""Too many people - including students - seem to believe that poor living conditions are just a part of student life. ""While the laws around renting are constantly improving there needs to be a much easier way for students to report and resolve problems with their accommodation."" Updated legislation, which takes effect on 20 March, is designed to ensure that all rented accommodation is fit for human habitation and strengthens tenants' means of redress against landlords who fail to keep their properties safe.

K-pop industry sex scandal growsA second K-pop star quits the music business admitting he filmed women in sex acts without consent.Asia,"A second K-pop star has dramatically quit the music business, in a growing industry sex scandal. Jung Joon-young, 30, admitted to secretly filming himself having sex with women and sharing the footage. ""I admit to all my crimes,"" said Jung in a statement. He also promised to drop all his TV and music work. It comes a day aftersuperstar Seungri from the group Big Bang quit the industryafter he was charged with sex bribery. Jung, who is accused of taping 10 or more women, is due to be questioned by Seoul Metropolitan Police on Thursday. ""I filmed women without their consent and shared it in a chatroom, and while I was doing so I didn't feel a great sense of guilt,"" said Jung in the statement released late on Tuesday. It came after South Korean broadcaster SBS reported allegations that he had filmed his own sex videos without his partners' permission, and shared them with friends in a mobile chat group during 2015-16. S Korea women protest at hidden sex cams South Korea's spy cam porn epidemic #MeToo takes hold in South Korea He apologised to the fans he had ""outraged"", and to the women whose privacy he violated. ""Throughout the rest of my life, I will repent on my immoral and illegal acts that constitute crimes,"" he said. ""I will faithfully cooperate with an investigation by police that will start on Thursday and I will readily accept whatever punishment is in store for me."" This is not the first time Jung has been accused of filming a sexual encounter without consent. An ex-girlfriend made an allegation against him in 2016, but ultimately withdrew it. The singer-songwriter, best known for his part in a variety show, claimed she had agreed to the filming. South Korea has been fighting an epidemic of ""spy cam porn"" in recent years. Hidden cameras are sometimes placed in toilets and changing rooms, then uploaded online without the knowledge of victims. The country saw more than 6,000 cases reported in 2017 alone. This video can not be played The use of hidden and up-skirt cameras is a huge problem in South Korea The case against Jung was discovered during a separate police investigation into K-pop superstar Seungri - who was reportedly a member of Jung's group chat. Seungri, whose boyband Big-bang have sold more than 140 million records, has been charged with supplying prostitutes to potential business investors - and police reportedly found Jung's videos while investigating that case. Seungri, 28, retired from the entertainment industry on Monday and promised to co-operate with police. He denies procuring sex workers.

UK announces no-deal tariff planThe government announces that most imports into the UK would not attract a tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Business,"The government has announced that most imports into the UK would not attract a tariff in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Under a temporary scheme 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. What are tariffs and how do they work? Government sets out plans for Irish border in a no-deal Brexit No-deal NI plan disastrous, say businesses A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. In the great majority of cases, tariffs are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. The new tariff regime would mark a shift in favour of products from non-EU countries. It would mean 82% of imports from the EU would be tariff-free, down from 100% now. 92% percent of imports from the rest of the world would pay no border duty, up from 56%. Under the plan, the UK car industry will receive some protection, with some imported cars attracting tariffs. But car parts from the EU would be tariff free, which will help car plants in the UK. Also, the ceramics industry would receive some protection from cheap imports. Industry bodies and businesses are still poring overthe 1,477-page document,externalwhich outlines the new plan. Imports of cars from the EU will have a tariff of 10% applied, which would add Â£1,500 to a typical family car. Volkswagen has already said the cost would be passed on to the buyer. Car parts such as engines would have no new tax applied to avoid disruption to the movement of components. A spokesman for Ford UK warned that the tariffs would ""deal a devastating blow to much of the complex and integrated automotive industry, and would damage the competitiveness of Ford's engine manufacturing in the UK"". While some tariffs will protect farmers producing meat, other sectors of farming will have low or no tarrifs. The National Farmers' Union President, Minette Batters, said that eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables would not receive any protection under the plans. The plans would see the current tariff rate on oranges cut from 16% to 0%, the rate for onions down from 9.6% to 0% and the tariff on imported televisions down from 14% to 0%. Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing Steve Turner described the potential no-deal as ""economic vandalism which is threatening jobs and livelihoods"" and  called for tariffs to be dropped on EU imports. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI described the changes as a ""sledgehammer to our economy"" as companies spend more on stockpiling. She said: ""These are being imposed on this country with no consultation with business with no time to prepare."" Trade minister Liam Fox will speak to business leaders at 15:00 GMT to discuss the tariffs, Reuters reported. Trade Policy Minister George Hollingbery said: ""Our priority is securing a deal with the EU as this will avoid disruption to our global trading relationships. However, we must prepare for all eventualities."" He said: ""This balanced approach will help to support British jobs and avoid potential price spikes that would hit the poorest households the hardest."" ""The new tariff seems a reasonable compromise between protecting vulnerable (and politically important) sectors and keeping prices down for consumers,"" said Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""For producers, there will be relief in some sectors and nasty surprises for others,"" he said. The government also announced thatit will not introduce any new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for nearly all goods moving from across the border from Ireland to Northern Irelandin the event the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The move, to avoid friction at the UK's land border with the EU, will be temporary while a long solution is found. The government said tariffs will be payable on goods moving from the EU into the rest of the UK via Northern Ireland. It insisted that this would create no border down the Irish sea because there would be no checks on goods moved between Northern Ireland and Britain. But Prof Winters said it ""almost certainly"" violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules that demand equal treatment for all trading partners, he said. ""Leaving the Irish border open also opens up the possibility of some EU goods being shipped to the UK via Ireland and so avoiding UK tariffs.""

IMF: Greece among Europe's best performersThe International Monetary Fund says Greece is still vulnerable but has made great progress.Business,"Greece has entered a period of economic growth that puts it ""among the best performers in the eurozone"". That rather striking judgement comes from the International Monetary Fund in anew report on the Greek economy,external. A senior IMF official said there were a lot of positive developments to point to. That said, the IMF said the economy remains vulnerable, further reforms are needed and unemployment remains unacceptably high. Greece was where the eurozone financial crisis started back in 2009, and it was the economy hardest hit. It is also the economy that has received most by way of bailout loans, some from the IMF. But most of the money came from the eurozone to total more than a quarter of a trillion euros. Those loans came with conditions. Greece had to take action to reduce the government's unsustainable borrowing needs, and to reform the economy to support growth. There were changes to labour regulation, more competition in the business world and privatisation among many other elements. Both strands encountered resistance in Greece, and the bailout terms led to political crises. But the IMF and the European Union both say the country has made progress. Growth resumed in 2013, but it was erratic at first. Last year, however, Greece managed growth of slightly more than 2% for the first time in more than decade. This year, the IMF forecasts somewhat better. Peter Dohlman, the IMF's mission chief for Greece, says that's enough to put Greece ""in the upper tier of the eurozone growth table"". It is certainly progress, indeed a striking change in performance, though the favourable comparison does partly reflect the slowdown that has hit the eurozone as a whole in the last year. It is also important to recall how much damage the Greek economy has suffered. It is still about 24% smaller than before the crisis. Unemployment has come down markedly, including for young people. But it stillvery high,external: 18.5% for the adult population as a whole and close to 40% for the young. The IMF says the reform work is incomplete and the economy remains vulnerable. A particular concern is the banks which still have high levels of loans where payments are not up to date. Mr Dohlman describes the banks as ""crippled"" by this problem. That is reflected in the fact that private sector credit continues to decline. He also says more work is needed on labour market reform so that employers can respond more easily to changing conditions. Reforms on competition also continue to lag, he says. A meeting of eurozone finance ministers this week agreed that Greece needs to do more. They discussed whether to go ahead with some debt relief measures that had already been agreed in principle but subject to the Greek government completing agreed reforms. They decided to wait until Greece had made more progress, though the European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici expressed confidence that the debt relief measures, worth almost a billion euros, could be decided by the next meeting in April at the latest.

Prosecutions 'not Bloody Sunday report aim'Lord Saville has said that an inquiry into the Parachute Regiment killings was not about charges.,"Lord Saville chaired the Bloody Sunday inquiry, which looked into the events of 30 January 1972 A public inquiry into Bloody Sunday was not ""a question of prosecutions"", the judge who led it has said. Thirteen people were shot dead in Londonderry when members of the Parachute Regiment opened fire on civilians in 1972. On Thursday a decision will be made on whether or not 17 former paratroopers will be prosecuted for the killings. Lord Saville told the BBC the purpose of the inquiry he led was ""to try to find out what happened"". What happened on Bloody Sunday? Bloody Sunday victim awarded thousands The victims of Bloody Sunday Key findings of Saville Report The events of 30 January 1972 became one of the most infamous incidents in the history of The Troubles. Thirteen people were killed and 15 injured on January 30, 1972, when troops fired more than 100 times as trouble broke out at a civil rights march. One of the injured died five months later, but the Saville Inquiry said it was ""not the result of any of the wounds he sustained on Bloody Sunday"". The Saville Inquiry was set up in April 1998 and lasted for 12 years. It cost about Â£200m, making it the longest and most expensive public inquiry in British legal history, and led to then Prime Minister David Cameronapologising to the Bloody Sunday families. He said the killings were ""unjustified and unjustifiable"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010 after the Saville Report said those who were killed or injured on Bloody Sunday were innocent. Eighteen former paratroopers were reported to Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service over the killings. Thirteen people were shot dead on Bloody Sunday One of those soldiers died in 2018, and a decision on whether or not to prosecute the other 17 for criminal offences is due on Thursday. Lord Saville is aware of this and the sensitivities around it, but he is keen to stress the difference between his inquiry and any criminal investigation by police. ""We were not there for that purpose - we were there simply to try to find out what happened,"" Lord Saville told the BBC. When asked if he accepted that without the Saville Report the prospect of former soldiers being prosecuted may not have happened, he said: ""I simply don't have the answer. The campaign by the families was for a new inquiry. ""Some thought that those soldiers who were found responsible should be prosecuted but overall the campaign for Bloody Sunday originally was for an inquiry to find out what happened and why, rather than a question of prosecutions."" Former soldiers were granted anonymity and assured that their evidence to the Saville Inquiry wouldn't be used in any subsequent criminal proceedings. ""If we had not given those assurances, backed by the director of public prosecutions, people could quite legitimately have refused to answer questions on the grounds that answering might incriminate them,"" said Lord Saville. ""We were there simply to try to find out what happened,"" said Lord Saville of his Â£200m inquiry ""So, we were there to find out what happened rather than investigating criminal offences. We sought assurance and gave it to those people, which is protected in law."" When asked if he, like many, took the view that the Saville Report would draw a line under Bloody Sunday, he replied: ""I didn't know what was likely to happen. We hoped the inquiry would help the situation in Ireland and I think and hope it did to a degree. ""The question as to whether it draws a line under events or whether there should be prosecutions is not one for me, it's one for politicians and prosecuting authorities. ""If people want more and feel that justice can only be served by prosecutions against those that they believe to be responsible, then that is a matter again on which I can't really comment."" ""I think we did a pretty thorough job and I was satisfied we had done a fair job at finding out what happened that day as was realistically possible."" He says the prospect of prosecutions hasn't changed his view in any way. Lord Saville said that a decision on prosecutions ""is not a matter for me and I have no particularly strong views about it"". He added: ""Our job was to do as thorough and fair a report as we could as to what happened on that day."" What happened on Bloody Sunday?

MPs reject MayÃ¢ÂÂs EU withdrawal deal again,"This video can not be played Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn address MPs after her Brexit deal is voted down again Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal has been rejected by MPs by an overwhelming majority for a second time, with just 17 days to go to Brexit. MPs voted down the prime minister's deal by 149 - a smaller margin than when they rejected it in January. Mrs May said MPs will now get a vote on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal and, if that fails, on whether Brexit should be delayed. She said Tory MPs will get a free vote on a no-deal Brexit. LIVE: Reaction as May's deal is voted down 'People must decide' Brexit - Sturgeon Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide That means they can vote with their conscience rather than following the orders of party managers - an unusual move for a vote on a major policy, with Labour saying it showed she had ""given up any pretence of leading the country"". The PM had made a last minute plea to MPs to back her deal after she had secured legal assurances on the Irish backstop from the EU. But although she managed to convince about 40 Tory MPs to change their mind, it was not nearly enough to overturn the historic 230 vote defeat she suffered in January, throwing her Brexit strategy into fresh disarray. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  In a statement after the defeat, Mrs May said: ""I continue to believe that by far the best outcome is the UK leaves the European Union in an orderly fashion with a deal. ""And that the deal we have negotiated is the best and indeed only deal available."" Setting out the next steps, she said MPs will vote on Wednesday on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal or not. If they vote against a no-deal Brexit, they will vote the following day on whether Article 50 - the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March - should be extended. Mrs May said MPs would have to decide whether they want to delay Brexit, hold another referendum, or whether they ""want to leave with a deal but not this deal"". She said that the choices facing the UK were ""unenviable"", but because of the rejection of her deal, ""they are choices that must be faced"". Mrs May also told MPsthe government would announce detailsof how the UK will manage its border with Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday. 'Avoid no-deal Brexit own goal,' say business groups Disgraced MP back to vote on Brexit deal Brexit deal: What do the documents say? Mrs May said leaving without a deal remained the UK's default position but Downing Street said she will tell MPs whether she will vote for no-deal when she opens Wednesday's Commons debate on it. The prime minister did not discuss resigning after her latest defeat because a government led by her had recently won a confidence vote in the Commons, added the PM's spokesman. She has no plans to return to Brussels to ask for more concessions because, as she told MPs, she still thinks her deal is the best and only one on offer, he added. What isn't clear is how the prime minister actually intends to dig herself out of this dreadful political hole. Some of her colleagues around the Cabinet table think it shows she has to tack to a closer deal with the EU. Some of them believe it's time now to go hell-for-leather to leave without an overarching deal but move to make as much preparation as possible, and fast. Other ministers believe genuinely, still with around two weeks to go, and an EU summit next week, there is still time to try to manoeuvre her deal through - somehow. Read more from Laura Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister should now call a general election. ""The government has been defeated again by an enormous majority and it must accept its deal is clearly dead and does not have the support of this House,"" he told MPs. He said a no-deal Brexit had to be ""taken off the table"" - and Labour would continue to push its alternative Brexit proposals. He did not mention the party's commitment to back another referendum. Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer MPs, said ""the problem with the deal was that it didn't deliver on the commitment to leave the EU cleanly and that the backstop would have kept us in the customs union and de facto in the single market"". This video can not be played Chris Mason: ""A huge defeat for the tweaked Brexit deal"" The Tory MP, who voted against Mrs May's deal, told BBC News: ""The moral authority of 17.4 million people who voted to leave means that very few people are actually standing up and saying they want to reverse Brexit. They're calling for a second referendum, they're calling for delay. ""But actually very few politicians are brave enough to go out and say they want to overturn the referendum result."" Leading Conservative Remainer Dominic Grieve, who backs another referendum, said Mrs May's deal was now ""finished"". The Tory MP, who voted against the prime minister's plan, said he was confident the majority of MPs would now vote against a no-deal Brexit - and he hoped they would then vote to ask for an extension to Article 50. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM's Brexit plan ""is dead"" The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said in a tweet: ""The EU has done everything it can to help get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. The impasse can only be solved in the UK. Our 'no-deal' preparations are now more important than ever before."" EU points finger at UK for Theresa May's deal defeat A spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk echoed that message, saying it was ""difficult to see what more we can do"". ""With only 17 days left to 29 March, today's vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit,"" added the spokesman. The EU would consider an extension to Brexit if the UK asked for one, he added, but the 27 other EU member states would expect ""a credible justification"" for it. This video can not be played MPs voted by 391 to 242 against Theresa May's Brexit plan The PM's deal was defeated by 391 to 242. Some 75 Conservative MPs voted against it, compared with 118 who voted against it in January. The Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs also voted against the deal, as did the Labour Party, SNP and other opposition parties. Three Labour MPs - Kevin Barron, Caroline Flint and John Mann - voted for the prime minister's deal.

EU points finger for Brexit deal defeatWhat do deal documents say?Business Ã¢ÂÂexasperatedÃ¢ÂÂ after vote,"EU politicians are united whereas British ones are not Once again - just as the last time the Brexit deal was rejected in parliament - reaction by EU leaders was prompt, co-ordinated and on message. It was a result they'd been dreading but expecting. European politician after European politician tweeted to say how disappointed they were, how businesses and citizens across the EU and UK now faced more agonising uncertainty and that the vote in the House of Commons brought everyone much closer to a no-deal Brexit. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier best summed up the European mood when he insisted the EU had done everything it could and that the deadlock could only be solved in the UK. There would be no more negotiations. Brexit: A really simple guide What just happened with Brexit? Brexit deal: What do the documents say? Notable on Tuesday night was the complete absence of any self-recrimination. Even in private, there was no discernible European soul-searching that more could have or should have been offered. Quite the opposite. The EU finger of blame points directly at the UK and the fact that parliament did not decide, or rather was never consulted about, what kind of Brexit it wanted before negotiations began - even when everyone knew MPs would have the final say on any resulting deal. Continuing disarray in the House of Commons just makes the EU wonder what the point could now be in delaying Brexit by just a few weeks - if the prime minister does request a short extension of the leaving process. Under EU law, Theresa May needs to formally ask for an extension and the 27 EU leaders need to be unanimous in their agreement. This should be interesting. Theresa May (L) with the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier European leaders have never formally debated how long an extension they would favour and what conditions - if any - they would lay down. That discussion will only start at ambassador level on Wednesday. Up until now, public EU statements about an extension have been part and parcel of negotiations. Threats to force the departing UK to field candidates in the upcoming European parliamentary elections or to make the UK extend by a whacking 21 months were partly designed to put pressure on MPs and (it was hoped) to help focus minds on voting in favour of the prime minister's Brexit deal. Business âexasperatedâ after Brexit vote EU sticks to Brexit script in final sprint EU in bleak mood in 'crunch' Brexit week But that didn't work and by this stage of the Brexit process, Germany, France, Ireland and others have slightly differing priorities. Not that you can speak of real rifts in the EU position (though Germany is so keen to keep the UK close, its politicians keep saying the government should take the time it needs to solve its political crisis, while France, for example, is impatient to get Brexit done and over with). Theresa May (r) would need to formally ask the EU's 27 leaders for an extension However, if Theresa May were tempted to use next week's EU leaders' summit in Brussels to ask for new concessions, opinion would be divided, even if leaders managed, as they mostly have until now, to keep differences behind closed doors. Clearly on a technical, civil servant-level the EU believes that EU-UK negotiations can't go any further. If the EU were to move at all on its Brexit position now, that would be a political decision which can only be taken by the leaders of the 27 EU member countries. This video can not be played MPs voted by 391 to 242 against Theresa May's Brexit plan And they are already worrying about the next round of ""magical thinking"" in the UK. Moments after the deal was rejected by parliament on Tuesday, Mr Barnier took to Twitter to express concern that there seemed to be what he called a ""dangerous illusion"" amongst some MPs that the UK can have a transition period after Brexit even if no formal EU-UK divorce deal is agreed. Brussels has always ruled that option out as impossible - a case of cherry-picking extraordinaire. As much as EU leaders want to avoid an acrimonious no-deal Brexit, they are not willing to pay just any price. MPs reject PM's Brexit deal by 149 votes.

The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans on Wednesday, including trade tariffs and Irish border proposals. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said the extension of the Brexit process ""should be as short as realistically possible and backed by a clear plan"". ""It's time for Parliament to stop this circus,"" she added. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers' group Make UK, said: ""It is now essential that Parliament brings the curtain down on this farce and removes the risk of no deal. ""That outcome would be disastrous for the UK manufacturing, jeopardising many thousands of jobs in every constituency in the land."" The government is set to publish more details of its no-deal plans, including tariff rates, on Wednesday. Last week, reports suggested that should the UK leave the EU with no deal in place, the UK governmentmight cut trade tariffs on between 80% and 90% of goods. And on Tuesday, Theresa May said thatno-deal plans for the Irish borderwould be released on Wednesday. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said the public would be hit by no-deal Brexit in the form of tariffs, non-tariff barriers and currency depreciation. These would ""all push up costs and reduce the choice on the shelves we currently enjoy,"" she said. She added that businesses are ""exasperated by the lack of clarity over their future trading arrangements"". ""Hundreds of ships are currently sailing towards Britain without a clear understanding of the tariffs, checks, or documentation requirements, they will face when they arrive,"" she said. Mike Hawes, chief executive of car industry body the SMMT, said the vote to reject Mrs May's deal ""leaves us perilously close to the 'cliff edge'."" ""No-deal would be catastrophic for the automotive industry,"" he said. ""It would end frictionless trade, add billions to the cost of manufacturing and cost jobs. ""UK automotive businesses will be put at immediate risk. Parliament must reject no-deal and take it permanently off the table,"" he added. The pound was volatile ahead of the Commons vote on Tuesday, sinking after the government's senior law officer said the legal risk of the UK being tied to EU rules after Brexit remained unchanged. It regained some ground after the vote, but settled lower. Andrew Wilson, Europe, Middle East and Africa chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said: ""We expect the British pound, which has reversed last night's strength over the course of the day, to weaken further amid prolonged uncertainty. ""That said, ruling out of a 'no-deal' Brexit could provide some support for the currency,"" he added. MPs reject Mayâs EU withdrawal deal again How does Brexit affect the pound?

What could happen next?EU points finger for Brexit deal defeatAudioAudioMore drama and Keir StarmerVideoVideoAre we any the wiser?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

EU points finger for Brexit deal defeatAudioAudioMore drama and Keir StarmerVideoVideoAre we any the wiser?,"EU politicians are united whereas British ones are not Once again - just as the last time the Brexit deal was rejected in parliament - reaction by EU leaders was prompt, co-ordinated and on message. It was a result they'd been dreading but expecting. European politician after European politician tweeted to say how disappointed they were, how businesses and citizens across the EU and UK now faced more agonising uncertainty and that the vote in the House of Commons brought everyone much closer to a no-deal Brexit. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier best summed up the European mood when he insisted the EU had done everything it could and that the deadlock could only be solved in the UK. There would be no more negotiations. Brexit: A really simple guide What just happened with Brexit? Brexit deal: What do the documents say? Notable on Tuesday night was the complete absence of any self-recrimination. Even in private, there was no discernible European soul-searching that more could have or should have been offered. Quite the opposite. The EU finger of blame points directly at the UK and the fact that parliament did not decide, or rather was never consulted about, what kind of Brexit it wanted before negotiations began - even when everyone knew MPs would have the final say on any resulting deal. Continuing disarray in the House of Commons just makes the EU wonder what the point could now be in delaying Brexit by just a few weeks - if the prime minister does request a short extension of the leaving process. Under EU law, Theresa May needs to formally ask for an extension and the 27 EU leaders need to be unanimous in their agreement. This should be interesting. Theresa May (L) with the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier European leaders have never formally debated how long an extension they would favour and what conditions - if any - they would lay down. That discussion will only start at ambassador level on Wednesday. Up until now, public EU statements about an extension have been part and parcel of negotiations. Threats to force the departing UK to field candidates in the upcoming European parliamentary elections or to make the UK extend by a whacking 21 months were partly designed to put pressure on MPs and (it was hoped) to help focus minds on voting in favour of the prime minister's Brexit deal. Business âexasperatedâ after Brexit vote EU sticks to Brexit script in final sprint EU in bleak mood in 'crunch' Brexit week But that didn't work and by this stage of the Brexit process, Germany, France, Ireland and others have slightly differing priorities. Not that you can speak of real rifts in the EU position (though Germany is so keen to keep the UK close, its politicians keep saying the government should take the time it needs to solve its political crisis, while France, for example, is impatient to get Brexit done and over with). Theresa May (r) would need to formally ask the EU's 27 leaders for an extension However, if Theresa May were tempted to use next week's EU leaders' summit in Brussels to ask for new concessions, opinion would be divided, even if leaders managed, as they mostly have until now, to keep differences behind closed doors. Clearly on a technical, civil servant-level the EU believes that EU-UK negotiations can't go any further. If the EU were to move at all on its Brexit position now, that would be a political decision which can only be taken by the leaders of the 27 EU member countries. This video can not be played MPs voted by 391 to 242 against Theresa May's Brexit plan And they are already worrying about the next round of ""magical thinking"" in the UK. Moments after the deal was rejected by parliament on Tuesday, Mr Barnier took to Twitter to express concern that there seemed to be what he called a ""dangerous illusion"" amongst some MPs that the UK can have a transition period after Brexit even if no formal EU-UK divorce deal is agreed. Brussels has always ruled that option out as impossible - a case of cherry-picking extraordinaire. As much as EU leaders want to avoid an acrimonious no-deal Brexit, they are not willing to pay just any price. MPs reject PM's Brexit deal by 149 votes.

Hawking's nurse struck off over his carePatricia Dowdy was accused of financial misconduct and failing to properly care for the scientist.Suffolk,"Stephen Hawking died in March last year Professor Stephen Hawking's nurse has been struck off for failures over his care and financial misconduct. Patricia Dowdy, 61, who worked for the renowned scientist for 15 years, was handed an interim suspension in 2016,it emerged at the weekend. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) has now found she did not ""provide the standards of good, professional care we expect and Professor Hawking deserved"". Mrs Dowdy told The Mail on Sunday,externalshe was upset and did not want to comment. The NMC made its decision to remove Mrs Dowdy, from Ipswich, from the nursing register at a private hearing in London. This video can not be played A look back at the life of famous scientist Stephen Hawking A fitness to practise panel said Mrs Dowdy's behaviour amounted to financial misconduct, dishonesty, not providing appropriate care, failing to cooperate with the NMC and not having the correct qualifications. Matthew McClelland, director of fitness to practise, said: ""As the public rightly expects, in serious cases such as this - where a nurse has failed in their duty of care and has not been able to give evidence to the panel that they have learned from their mistakes and be fit to practise - we will take action. ""We have remained in close contact with the Hawking family throughout this case and I am grateful to them - as they approach the anniversary of Professor Hawking's death - and others for sharing their concerns with us. Hawking treasures auctioned for Â£1.8m Hawking's PhD expected to sell for Â£100k Stars turn out for Hawking memorial A family spokesman said Prof Hawking's family was ""relieved this traumatic ordeal has now concluded and that as a result of the verdict, others will not have to go through what they suffered from this individual"".

'Gross failures' in toddler sepsis death,"Marcie could have survived if doctors followed national guidelines on treating severely ill children A two-year-old girl died from sepsis because of major failings in the way she was cared for by medics, an inquest has found. Marcie Tadman suffered a fatal cardiac arrest at the Royal United Hospital in Bath on 5 December 2017, a day after being admitted with pneumonia. The inquest heard seven doctors who treated her had not considered sepsis. Avon Coroner Maria Voisin concluded Marcie died from natural causes contributed to by neglect. Ms Voisin said there had been a range of failings by the hospital: ""I consider that putting these basic failures together led to the gross failure to provide or perform any effective medical treatment. ""The gross failures to follow proper or routine procedures and protocols included standard monitoring. ""There was a serious deterioration in Marcie's condition and staff caring for her should have realised the need for action in all the circumstances. ""I find that the gross failure has caused or significantly contributed to Marcie's death."" Marcie's father James Tadman had taken her to the hospital's emergency department the previous day because she had a cough, a temperature and had been vomiting - but the sepsis screening tool was not completed. Three days before her death, Marcie had been seen by an out-of-hours GP who had diagnosed a viral infection said she should have Calpol. During the hearing, expert Dr Nelly Ninis said: ""There was such a systemic failure here to manage a child with a serious illness. ""Children with serious illnesses show you where all the failings are because they fall ill so quickly. ""The hospital policies are well written and had they been used they would have been enough and there were Nice (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines that were not followed."" Speaking afterwards, Mr Tadman spoke of the ""hell"" his family has gone through since her death. Marcie died just a few months after her mother Lindsay passed away, having been diagnosed with cancer. ""My family and I have been through hell and no words can adequately describe how we are feeling,"" Mr Tadman said. ""We put our trust in the Royal United Hospital, assuming our little girl would get the very best care but tragically that was not the case. ""The hospital's own internal investigation has identified a number of failings and these have been described by one expert as 'systemic'."" He continued: ""We can only hope that... every child that receives treatment at the hospital in the future will be better protected. ""The only crumb of comfort I can take from the impossible situation I find myself facing is that Marcie has been reunited with her Mummy, my wife, who sadly lost her fight against cancer in July 2017."" The hospital trust's medical director has apologised to Marcie's family.

"Great Escape veteran dies, aged 101The inmates' tunnel below Stalag Luft III was uncovered as Jack Lyon tried to make his own escape.Sussex","Jack Lyon, who was caught when the escape tunnel was uncovered, described the Hollywood film of the wartime escape as ""absolute rubbish"" One of the last veterans of World War Two's Great Escape has died at the age of 101 - just days before the 75th anniversary of the audacious getaway. Jack Lyon, a former RAF navigator, died at his home in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, on Friday. He was lookout during the breakout bid from Stalag Luft III in 1944, but the escape tunnel was uncovered before he had the chance to get out himself. Ironically, he said the plot being rumbled probably saved his life. According to the RAF Benevolent Fund, he had been one of the last known living veterans of the escape attempt, which became the subject of a Hollywood film in 1963. None of the 76 who escaped from the Nazi camp is now alive - 73 were recaptured, of whom 50 were executed on the orders of Adolf Hitler. Jack Lyon was captured after his plane crash-landed near Dusseldorf In an interview with the BBC on his 100th birthday in 2017, Mr Lyon said: ""Had I got out, I probably wouldn't be talking to you because my chances of getting home were virtually nil. I was under no illusions about that."" And he described the Hollywood portrayal of the escape bid, which starred Steve McQueen and a motorcycle, as ""absolute rubbish"". He said: ""Not one American took part in it, and as for the motorbike, it never existed."" RAFBF chief executive Air Vice Marshal David Murray, said: ""Jack belonged to a generation of servicemen we are sadly losing as time goes on. ""His legacy and those of his brave comrades who planned and took part in the audacious Great Escape breakout, are the freedoms we enjoy today. ""To truly pay tribute to his memory and all this who have gone before him, we must never forget.

I was under no illusions about that."" And he described the Hollywood portrayal of the escape bid, which starred Steve McQueen and a motorcycle, as ""absolute rubbish"". He said: ""Not one American took part in it, and as for the motorbike, it never existed."" RAFBF chief executive Air Vice Marshal David Murray, said: ""Jack belonged to a generation of servicemen we are sadly losing as time goes on. ""His legacy and those of his brave comrades who planned and took part in the audacious Great Escape breakout, are the freedoms we enjoy today. ""To truly pay tribute to his memory and all this who have gone before him, we must never forget. ""Jack's death is especially poignant as it comes just two weeks before the 75th anniversary of the Great Escape, on March 24.""
