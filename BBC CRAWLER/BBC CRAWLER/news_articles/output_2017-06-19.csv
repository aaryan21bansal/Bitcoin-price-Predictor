Terror attack suspect's family 'in shock',"This video can not be played Footage shows the suspected attacker being tackled before police arrive The family of a man arrested after a terror attack near a London mosque say they are ""shocked"" and ""devastated"". Father-of-four Darren Osborne, 47, was held on suspicion of attempted murder and alleged terror offences after a van hit Muslims in Finsbury Park. They had been helping a man who had collapsed. He later died but it is not clear if it was because of the attack. Met Police chief Cressida Dick and faith leaders were among hundreds who took part in a vigil on Monday night. Ms Dick said the incident was ""quite clearly an attack on Muslims"", and the community would now see more police, including armed officers, in the area, ""particularly around religious establishments"". Mr Osborne's mother, sister and nephew said in a statement: ""We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in."" They added that their ""hearts go out to those who've been injured"". Police have carried out searches at an address in the Cardiff area. Security Minister Ben Wallace said the suspect was not known to the security services, and was believed to have acted alone. The BBC understands Mr Osborne grew up in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and has lived at more than one property in Cardiff. He is also believed to have lived in Swindon. Officers are carrying out searches at a property in the Cardiff area The Metropolitan Police said he was being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism including murder and attempted murder. The attack took place shortly after midnight close to Muslim Welfare House on Seven Sisters Road, which is also a community centre. Police say 11 other people were injured - including nine taken to hospital and two treated at the scene. Several of the injured are believed to be seriously hurt.

After a short silence, chairman of the mosque Mohammed Kozbar told those gathered that the attack was ""on our families, on our freedom, on our dignity"". He said the man who died was a father of six children. The Bishop of Stepney, Rt Rev Adrian Newman, said ""an attack on one faith is an attack on us all"". Police have been gathering evidence at the scene of the attack A vigil was held outside Finsbury Park Mosque It is the fourth terror attack in the UK in three months, after incidents in Westminster, Manchester and on London Bridge. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack was ""every bit as sickening"" as the others. ""It was an attack that once again targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives - this time British Muslims as they left a mosque having broken their fast and prayed together at this sacred time of year,"" she said. After speaking outside Downing Street, the prime minister visited Finsbury Park Mosque, where she held talks with faith leaders. Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn also visited the area, telling the BBC that ""an attack on a mosque, an attack on a synagogue, an attack on a church is actually an attack on all of us"". By Cherry Wilson, BBC News Locals say this is a proudly multicultural area, where the biggest rivalry is whether you support Arsenal or their north London rivals, Tottenham. Now the mood here is one of shock, as residents stand by the police cordon seeing the aftermath of yet another attack in London. Mother-of-four Nicola Senior, 43, is walking back from taking her children to school when she stops to take in the scene. She said: ""I'm frightened. Is there going to be retaliation? ""I am fearful for my kids. Can we go to the park? Can we go to the church? It feels like this is happening all the time."" 'Everyone is on edge' after attack The driver of the van was detained by bystanders before police arrived. People at the scene said he had told them he wanted to kill Muslims. The imam of Muslim Welfare House said a passing police van was flagged down. Mohammed Mahmoud told reporters: ""We told them the situation - there's a man, he's restrained, he mowed down a group of people with his van and there is a mob attempting to hurt him and if you don't take him then, God forbid, he might be seriously hurt. ""We pushed people away from him until he was safely taken by police."" Toufik Kacimi, chief executive of Muslim Welfare House, said the suspect had told those holding him ""you deserve it"" and was also saying ""I did my bit"". By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This incident risks playing right into the hands of those planning further attacks on vulnerable citizens in the UK. Online followers of the so-called Islamic State have been quick to seize on the Finsbury Park attack as proof of what they see as widespread hostility towards Muslims who live in the West. Inevitably, it will be used by recruiters and propagandists to incite further attacks - extremism breeds extremism. The one thing that far right anti-Muslim extremists and violent jihadists have in common is the belief that peaceful coexistence between Muslim and non-Muslim is impossible. The unified prayers and solidarity across communities that followed recent terror attacks are anathema to them. Extremists of both types want instead to divide society and will keep trying to bring this about by criminal acts of provocation such as this.

US student sent home from N Korea dies,"Otto Warmbier's parents say they went 15 months without hearing from or about their son The US student held in captivity for more than 15 months in North Korea has died a week after returning home. Otto Warmbier, 22, was serving 15 years hard labour, accused of attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. He was returned to the US last Tuesday, with North Korea saying it was on humanitarian grounds. North Korea said he had been in a coma for a year after contracting botulism but his family say he was subjected to ""awful torturous mistreatment"". A team of US doctors have also disputed North Korea's version of events. This video can not be played Donald Trump says the US will 'handle' North Korea Mr Warmbier had suffered severe brain damage, and was medically evacuated from North Korea on 13 June to a hospital in his home city of Cincinnati, Ohio. It is unclear how he fell ill. How harsh is prison in North Korea? How did Otto Warmbier's holiday end in his death? A statement from the family on Monday said: ""It is our sad duty to report that our son, Otto Warmbier, has completed his journey home. Surrounded by his loving family, Otto died today at 2:20pm."" They said the student had been ""unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands"". Otto appeared in a news conference in 2016 confessing to stealing the sign ""The awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today."" 30 Dec 2015 - Mr Warmbier travels from Beijing to Pyongyang with a tour group. 2 Jan 2016 - He is arrested at Pyongyang International Airport as he tries to leave the country. Later that month, North Korea announces it is holding Mr Warmbier for a ""hostile act"". 16 March 2016 - Mr Warmbiergoes on trial in Pyongyangwhere he confesses to stealing a propaganda poster, and is sentenced to 15 years of hard labour. He is believed to have slipped into a coma shortly after his trial. Early June 2017 - US officials and Mr Warmbier's parents are told about his condition 13 June 2017 -He is released from North Korea and medically evacuated to the US. Doctors say he has suffered a severe brain injury. 19 June 2017 - Mr Warmbier dies. The economics student from the University of Virginia had travelled to North Korea as a tourist. A month after his arrest, he appeared at a news conference tearfully confessing to trying to take a sign from his hotel as a ""trophy"" for a US church. ""The aim of my task was to harm the motivation and work ethic of the Korean people,"" he said. Foreign detainees in North Korea have previously recanted confessions, saying they were made under pressure. The company Mr Warmbier travelled with, China-based company Young Pioneer Tours, has announced it will no longer take visitors from the US to the country. ""The way his detention was handled was appalling and a tragedy like this must never be repeated,"" it said in a statement. ""Despite constant requests, we were denied any opportunity to meet him or anyone in contact with him in Pyongyang, only receiving assurances that he was fine."" North Korea said last week that it had released Mr Warmbier ""on humanitarian grounds"". Shortly before he was freed, his parents told the Washington Post newspaper they had been informed by the North Korean authorities that their son had contracted botulism, a rare illness that causes paralysis, soon after his trial. He was given a sleeping pill and had been in a coma ever since, the newspaper said. This video can not be played Otto Warmbier's father, wearing his son's jacket, told reporters last week his son had been treated ""brutally"" But a team of doctors assessing him in Cincinnati said they had found ""no sign of botulism"". Doctors confirmed that there was no sign he had been physically abused during his detention, based on scans. They believe respiratory arrest led to his condition, which is caused by a lack of oxygen and blood in the brain. President Donald Trump said Mr Warmbier's death had deepened his administration's resolve ""to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency"". ""The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim,"" the presidential statement added. How harsh is prison in North Korea?

"No, the Daily Mail did not tell May to 'GO NOW'","A fake Daily Mail front cover went viral after fooling thousands of people, including journalists and politicians. Perhaps it's a sign of the political times we live in that so many people were willing to believe that a crudely Photoshopped Daily Mail front cover calling for Prime Minister Theresa May to resign was genuine. The image appeared under the hashtag #TomorrowsPapersToday, which Twitter users routinely use for sneak peeks at newspaper front pages. It was posted by a user going by the name ""Lying Tory Media,external"", which gives you an idea of their political perspective: The fake Daily Mail front cover calling for the Prime Minister to ""GO NOW"" The font is totally different from that used by the newspaper, and the layout of the fake page is based on a real and much-discussed Daily Mail cover published just after the prime minister called the snap election: A real Daily Mail front cover from 19 April The fake cover was picked up by others and in total was retweeted and liked thousands of times. Several journalists were taken in, as was the former MP George Galloway and other political observers, many of whom took the image as a sign of May's weakness following Conservative losses in the snap election. Others quickly saw through the fake, however: BBC Trending contacted the person behind the ""Lying Tory Media"" account, but they haven't yet responded.

Four ministers 'were warned of fire risk',"This video can not be played New footage reveals the moment firefighters first saw Grenfell Tower Four separate government ministers were warned that fire regulations were not keeping people safe, in letters that have subsequently been seen by the BBC. In the leaked letters, experts warn that those living in tower blocks like Grenfell Tower were ""at risk"". At least 79 people are dead or missing presumed dead after the fire at the London high-rise last week. The department that received the letters said work to improve regulation and safety had already been under way. The letters show experts have been worried about fire safety in tower blocks for years. Following a fatal fire in Lakanal House in south London in 2009, a series of recommendations were made to keep people safe. They were ignored. The government promised a review of fire regulations in 2013, but it still has not happened. BBC One's Panoramahas obtained a dozen letters sent by the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety and Rescue Group. Informed by experts, it warned the government it ""could not afford to wait for another tragedy"". Four ministers - all from the Department for Communities and Local Government - received letters but did not strengthen the regulations. Ronnie King, a former chief fire officer who sits on the group, says the government has ignored repeated warnings about tower block safety. ""We have spent four years saying 'Listen, we have got the evidence, we've provided you with the evidence, there is clear public opinion towards this, you ought to move on this',"" said Mr King. Firefighters joined a minute's silence at Grenfell Tower on Monday After six people were killed at Lakanal House in 2009, the coroner made a series of safety recommendations for the government to consider. The government department promised a review in 2013, but it was soon delayed. In March 2014,the parliamentary group wrote:,external""Surelyâ¦ when you already have credible evidence to justify updatingâ¦ the guidanceâ¦ which will lead to saving of lives, you don't need to wait another three years in addition to the two already spent since the research findings were updated, in order to take action? ""As there are estimated to be another 4,000 older tower blocks in the UK, without automatic sprinkler protection, can we really afford to wait for another tragedy to occur before we amend this weakness?"" After further correspondence, Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams - who was then a minister in the department - replied: ""I have neither seen nor heard anything that would suggest that consideration of these specific potential changes is urgent and I am not willing to disrupt the work of this department by asking that these matters are brought forward."" The group replied to say they ""were at a loss to understand, how you had concluded that credible and independent evidence, which had life safety implications, was NOT considered to be urgent"". ""As a consequence the group wishes to point out to you that should a major fire tragedy, with loss of life, occur between now and 2017 in, for example, a residential care facility or a purpose built block of flats, where the matters which had been raised here, were found to be contributory to the outcome, then the group would be bound to bring this to others' attention."" The letters were written before the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower. One went to the-then Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles, who received a letter about fire regulations from the parliamentary group in February 2014. He had also been asked to look at fire safety in February 2013 and March 2013 by two separate coroners, investigating two tower block fires. What we know so far Who are the victims? Visual guide to what happened In December 2015, the all-party group wrote to Conservative MP James Wharton, another minister in the department at the time, and warned about the risk of fires spreading on the outside of buildings with cladding. ""Today's buildings have a much higher content of readily available combustible material. Examples are timber and polystyrene mixes in structure, cladding and insulation. ""This fire hazard results in many fires because adequate recommendations to developers simply do not exist. There is little or no requirement to mitigate external fire spread."" The last of the four ministers in the department to receive a letter was Gavin Barwell, who has since moved on to become Theresa May's top aide. He received his letter from the parliamentary group in September last year. In November, Mr Barwell replied to say his department had been looking at the regulations, and would make a statement ""in due course"". In April this year, Mr Barwell wrote to say he did ""acknowledge that producing a statement on building regulations has taken longer than I had envisaged"". The fire safety group pointed out that it had been ""given a similar response by three successive ministers since 2010"" and it ""is now time to listen to what the Fire Sector is saying"". The government has said there is still no timetable for a review. The Department for Communities and Local Government said that a police investigation into the Grenfell Fire is already under way ""but it will be some time before it is fully understood how the fire started or why it took hold in the way it did."" In a statement, it added: ""The government has acted to improve fire regulation and safety, including the recommendations made by the Coroner following the Lakanal House Fire. ""The final recommendation concerned simplification of fire safety guidance, and this work was under way, with a consultation due to be published this summer. ""Fire safety requirements are complex issues and our priority has been that we have high standards. A great deal of work has been completed, including commissioning and undertaking research to support the planned consultation. Clearly, in light of this tragic event, we need to reflect on whether this consultation is the correct next step to take. We will confirm our approach shortly."" Well-wishers have been leaving tributes at Grenfell Tower In a separate development, Panorama has discovered that firefighters put out the first fire at Grenfell Tower. They were called to a fridge fire, and within minutes told residents the fire was out in the flat. The crew was leaving the building when firefighters outside spotted flames rising up the side of the building. The Fire Brigades Union say firefighters were left facing an unprecedented fire, and officers broke their own safety protocol to rescue people.

He added: ""I want to assure Londoners that this attack will in no way distract from other urgent work the police and emergency services are currently dealing with â including the vital recovery work at Grenfell Tower."" It is more important now than ever that we focus on those things that unite us, that make our city so great â our values of tolerance and respect, our belief that our diversity makes us stronger. We must remind ourselves of these things, as they are the reasons why we can be sure that we will never allow terrorists to fuel division and we will never be defeated by those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life.

Bear kills Alaska teen during running race,"Black bears can be found throughout much of North America A ""large black bear"" has killed a 16-year-old boy who was participating in a popular trail running race in Alaska on Sunday, police say. Patrick Cooper of Anchorage texted his family to say he was being chased by a bear while descending the extremely steep terrain. The race director, who had been handing out awards, organised a search party of runners after he was shown the message. Officials shot the bear in the face, but it survived and ran off. ""It did definitely take a slug strike to the face when the ranger fired on it,"" said Tom Crockett, a park ranger with Chugach State Park, near to the city of Anchorage. ""We know he struck it,"" he added. Cyclist in northern US killed by grizzly bear Wildlife and law enforcement officials are still searching for the bear, which they intend to kill if found. Patrick was running in the juniors' division of the 29th annual Robert Spurr Memorial Hill Climb race between Anchorage and Girdwood, the Alaska Dispatch News reported. He reached the halfway point - about 1.5 miles from the start - and texted his mother at 12:37 local time after turning back. Race director Brad Precosky mobilised runners to head back up the trail in search of the boy after a runner returned shouting about a bear attack. The searchers, who were unarmed, discovered the boy's remains about 500 yards from the trail. The 250lb (113kg)-bear was nearby, according to local reports. Patrick's remains were airlifted from the scene. ""I've been running in the mountains for 30 years,"" Mr Precosky told KTUU News, adding that there were multiple sightings that day of black and brown bears. ""People come down off the trail and say they've run into a bear. Sometimes that means nothing; other times, it's really serious. Like this.""

Play School presenter Brian Cant dies,"Children's presenter Brian Cant has died at the age of 83. He was best known for presenting BBC's Play School for 21 years from 1964, and Play Away from 1971 to 1984. His agent said he had been living with Parkinson's disease and died at Denville Hall, a retirement home often used by those in the entertainment industry. A statement from the family said: ""He lived courageously with Parkinson's disease for a long time."" Cant was also a guest presenter on Jackanory and appeared on ITV's Dappledown Farm, which ran from 1990 to 2003. He got his big break when he auditioned for Play School, when part of the audition required him to climb into a cardboard box. His voice was known to millions in shows such as Trumpton, his most famous line being the fire brigade call-out: ""Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Grub."" Floella Benjamin, who also performed in Play School, said Cant was ""comedy genius"". She told BBC News: ""He was totally devoted to making children happy - he introduced children to comedy with zany jokes and his funny sketches."" Baroness Benjamin, who joined Play School in 1976, said she loved working with Cant. ""We bounced off one another, we thought of new ideas of things to do,"" she said. Brian Cant with Humpty and Chloe Ashcroft with Jemima. two of the Play School presenters For millions his voice immediately evokes childhood. In the early '60s - an audition in which he was asked to sit in a cardboard box led to a job on a new programme called Play School. Born in Ipswich, he trained as a printer before having a go at acting. The warm, friendly voice was perfect for another children's venture - Trumpton, Camberwick Green  - and the slightly more industrial Chigley. If it sounds as though it was recorded in a cupboard, it's because it was. Along with Play Away, Bric a Brac and other programmes he was part of children's TV for more than 20 years. He wrote and appeared on stage, but more than anything he was - for many - a much loved part of childhood. Johnny Ball, who starred on Play Away, told BBC Radio 5 live that Cant was ""the kingpin"" of the programme, adding: ""Brian was a mainstay. He did Trumpton and all the other voice-overs - and it was an absolutely wonderful age, wonderful period. And Brian was absolutely right for all of that work - it was lovely."" He revealed Cant was as nice as he appeared on television: ""He was like Blackpool rock - break him anywhere, and you've got Brian Cant right through the middle. He was just lovely."" Cant's Play School co-presenter and former Coronation Street star Derek Griffiths paid tribute on Twitter,posting a reunion picture,externalof the team. Former Blackadder star Sir Tony Robinsonalso tweeted,external: ""Brian Cant was my mentor and friend on Play Away. We wrote and performed together for two years. Always patient, courteous and funny P-L-A-Y R-I-P."" Cant was honoured with a special Children's Bafta award in 2010. In a BBC interview, he explained that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1999. He said the one thing he wanted children to take away from his work was ""that I made them laugh, I made them feel happy"". On receiving his Bafta, Cant said: ""One of the main rules of those Play School days was that we should play to the camera as though we were talking to one child, in whatever circumstance. ""It could be somebody in a tower block, a nice semi-detached somewhere, or a Royal palace. You had to phrase everything so, whoever was watching it, they felt you were talking to them.""

Khadija Khalloufi - a 52-year-old woman - was also identified as one of the victims. A total of 79 people are either dead or missing presumed dead, police said. Commander Stuart Cundy confirmed the figure in a statement on Monday, adding it may still change. Mohammad Alhajali, 23, was the first victim to be formally identified. Of those who were injured, 18 people remain in hospital, with nine in critical care. Khadija Khalloufi has also been formally identified by police What we know so far Who are the victims? Visual guide to what happened Mr Disson was a retired lorry driver who lived on the 22nd floor of the tower. He lived in the property for eight years and phoned his son at 03:30, saying he was being told to stay in his flat. His family released a statement saying they were ""devastated"" at the news. ""Tony leaves behind a large family, his wife, sons and grandchildren, including one grandchild he will never get to meet,"" they said.

But he warned that not everyone would be identifiable and the operation would take ""many, many weeks"". ""This is an incredibly distressing time for families,"" he said. ""It is really hard to describe the devastation the fire caused. ""What is important for me is to find answers for those families who have been directly affected."" Cdr Cundy said there may have been people inside the building that they did not know were there, but there also could be people who were reported missing and managed to escape. He urged those people to make themselves known to the authorities.

""I would like to reassure everybody that we will be looking at all criminal offences that might have been committed by any individual or any organisation,"" said Cdr Cundy. ""Where offences have been committed, I will do everything in my gift to make sure they are brought to justice.""

Council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said he understood residents' anger and that the authority itself wanted to know why the fire had started and spread so quickly - but it was too big for one council to handle alone.

Croatia captain faces perjury inquiry,"Croatia and Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric is accused of lying during his former manager's trial Croatian authorities have launched an investigation into the captain of the national football team, Luka Modric. The midfielder, who also plays for Real Madrid, is suspected of making false statements at the tax fraud trial of Zdravko Mamic, his former manager. He could not immediately be reached for comment, Reuters news agency reports. Mr Mamic, a powerful figure in Croatian football, was Mr Modric's boss at leading club Dinamo Zagreb. Mr Mamic, his brother Zoran Mamic, and two others are accused of corruption that reportedly cost Dinamo Zagreb more than 15m euros (Â£13.1m; $16.7m), and the state 1.5m euros. Cash is said to have been embezzled via phoney deals where they took a cut from the sales of players. If found guilty of perjury, Mr Modric could face between six months and five years in prison. How hooligans exposed the ugly rift in Croatian football Croatia football officials arrested Mr Modric was asked to testify about his multi-million pound transfer from Dinamo to the English club Tottenham Hotspur in 2008. The perjury allegation hinges on exactly when he signed an annex to his contract with Dinamo, setting out the terms for future transfer fees. According to prosecutors, at a tribunal on 13 June, Mr Modric falsely said he had signed it in July 2004. Prosecutors say the annex - which allowed Mr Modric to receive half the transfer fee - was actually signed in 2008 when he had already left the club. Prosecutors say Modric changed his testimony to favour Dinamo Zagreb, a powerful figure in Croatian football Prosecutors also say Mr Modric told investigators in 2015 that the annex had been signed when he had already been sold to Tottenham. The state attorney's office believes the player changed his testimony in his former manager's favour. The 31-year-old looked visibly uncomfortable while giving evidence to the trial, which has attracted huge media interest in Croatia.

EU: No plans for Brexit concessions,"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary David Davis ""determined optimist"" after day one The EU's chief negotiator said there would be ""substantial"" consequences from Brexit after the first round of talks with the UK. Michel Barnier said he was ""not in the frame of mind to make concessions or ask for concessions"". UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a ""promising start"". The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately. Brexit: Everything you need to know The key issues in EU/UK talks Business call for market access after Brexit Mr Davis and Mr Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels. The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and ""other separation issues"". Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Mr Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled. The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Mr Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided ""sufficient progress has been made"" on the other issues. Mr Davis - who had predicted this would be the ""row of the summer"" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's ""weakness"" and insisted it was ""completely consistent"" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks. ""It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters,"" he said. This video can not be played The clock counts down on Brexit negotiations Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Mr Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to ""assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions"". ""I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions,"" he said. ""It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. ""Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations. ""I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind."" Laura Kuennsberg, BBC political editor It's often compared to a divorce - the UK wanted to talk about who gets the house and the CD collection at the same time as settling who pays for the kids' weddings in 20 years' time. The EU on the other hand have been firm all along that the future arrangements could only be discussed once the terms of the initial split have been agreed. The debate was called ""parallelism versus sequentialism"" and from this afternoon's press conference and the announcement of the procedure it is clear that the UK has lost. Ministers believed they would be able to persuade the EU - the failure to do so has been described as a ""total cave-in"". The discussion was even predicted by Mr Davis as likely to be the ""row of the summer"". The row won't happen because it seems the UK has already given in. Read more from Laura Mr Barnier said a ""fair deal"" was possible ""and far better than no deal"". He promised to work with, not against, the UK. ""We must lift the uncertainty caused by Brexit,"" he said. The two men - who exchanged gifts at the start of the talks - set out the structure for the initial negotiations. There will be one week of negotiations every month. Working groups of ""senior experts"" will be set up to focus on the three main areas. On citizens' rights, which the UK has said should be an immediate priority, Mr Davis said there was ""much common ground"". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Prior to the start of talks, Mr Davis gave his counterpart a first edition of a mountaineering book - a French-language version of Regards vers Annapurna - while Mr Barnier reciprocated with a traditional, hand-carved walking stick from Savoie, complete with leather wrist strap. Who's who in the UK delegation? David Davis: Secretary of State for Exiting The EU Tim Barrow: UK permanent representative to the EU Oliver Robbins: permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting The EU Glynn Williams: director general at the Home Office Mark Bowman: director general, international finance at HM Treasury Simon Case: director general, UK-EU partnership team Alex Ellis: director general at the Department for Exiting the EU Christian Jones: press officer to David Davis The chief negotiators exchanged gifts reflecting their shared passion for hill walking and mountaineering The people who will negotiate Brexit What are the different Brexit options? Scots should be at EU talks says Tory MEP This video can not be played Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson on Brexit negotiation deals This video can not be played Michael Gove tells Today there is support across the Conservative Party for Theresa May After holding talks with Theresa May in Downing Street, new Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said there must be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and economic borders must be ""invisible"". While he said he regretted Mrs May's decision to leave the single market and customs union, he said the two had a shared objective to minimise disruption to trade after the UK's exit. Earlier former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose, who chaired the Stronger In campaign last year, toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethat he was reassured that economic considerations were ""top of the pile"" but ministers needed to be realistic with the public. Speaking on the same programme, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin - one of the leading pro-Leave business voices - said negotiators had to be open to possible compromises but also prepared to walk away and to default to World Trade Organization rules if necessary. ""I don't think many people feel that staying in the single market and customs union and being subject to EU laws is Brexit. ""I think Brexit is parliamentary sovereignty and an assertion of democracy. Outside that, I think there is a quite a lot of scope,"" Mr Martin said. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""real confusion"" about the government's mandate after the general election result.

But investigators could not determine what impact the cocaine and other drugs had on her death. The findings were based on toxicology samples taken when Fisher arrived at a Los Angeles hospital. Investigators could not say when the actress had taken the MDMA or heroin. The star, who played Princess Leia in the film series, died on 27 December. Fisher had 'battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life' On Friday, a statement fromthe Los Angeles coroner said the exact cause of death was unknownbut cited factors including sleep apnoea, heart disease and drug use. Sleep apnoea is a common condition in which a person stops breathing during sleep, either for a few seconds or minutes. In a statement released to People magazine after the coroner's ruling,external, Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd said: ""My mum battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life. She ultimately died of it. ""She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases."" Her manner of death will be listed as undetermined, the coroner's statement said. Fisher's death certificate, issued in January, stated that the cause of death was ""cardiac arrest/deferred"".

Holden's 'topless dress' escapes probe,"Holden uploaded pictures of herself wearing the dress on Instagram Complaints about a revealing dress worn by Amanda Holden on Britain's Got Talent will not be investigated by Ofcom.

Ofcom said it recognised the dresses ""had potential to offend some viewers during what is a family show"". But it ruled they ""would not have exceeded most viewers' expectations"". More than 650 complained to the regulator about the low cut Julien McDonald dress Holden wore on 1 June, with many complaining on social media it was inappropriate.

Attack suspect 'troubled but not racist',"This video can not be played Footage shows the suspected attacker being tackled before police arrive The family of a man arrested after a terror attack near a London mosque say they are ""shocked"" and ""devastated"". Father-of-four Darren Osborne, 47, was held on suspicion of attempted murder and alleged terror offences after a van hit Muslims in Finsbury Park. They had been helping a man who had collapsed. He later died but it is not clear if it was because of the attack. Met Police chief Cressida Dick and faith leaders were among hundreds who took part in a vigil on Monday night. Ms Dick said the incident was ""quite clearly an attack on Muslims"", and the community would now see more police, including armed officers, in the area, ""particularly around religious establishments"". Mr Osborne's mother, sister and nephew said in a statement: ""We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in."" They added that their ""hearts go out to those who've been injured"". Police have carried out searches at an address in the Cardiff area. Security Minister Ben Wallace said the suspect was not known to the security services, and was believed to have acted alone. The BBC understands Mr Osborne grew up in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and has lived at more than one property in Cardiff. He is also believed to have lived in Swindon. Officers are carrying out searches at a property in the Cardiff area The Metropolitan Police said he was being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism including murder and attempted murder. The attack took place shortly after midnight close to Muslim Welfare House on Seven Sisters Road, which is also a community centre. Police say 11 other people were injured - including nine taken to hospital and two treated at the scene. Several of the injured are believed to be seriously hurt.

Police have been gathering evidence at the scene of the attack A vigil was held outside Finsbury Park Mosque It is the fourth terror attack in the UK in three months, after incidents in Westminster, Manchester and on London Bridge.

""It was an attack that once again targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives - this time British Muslims as they left a mosque having broken their fast and prayed together at this sacred time of year,"" she said. After speaking outside Downing Street, the prime minister visited Finsbury Park Mosque, where she held talks with faith leaders.

The driver, who was on a security watchlist, died in the incident. Police found a Kalashnikov rifle, handguns and gas bottles in the car. ""Security forces have been targeted in France once again,"" Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb said, calling it an ""attempted attack"". No-one else was hurt in the incident. France is under a state of emergency after being hit by a wave of deadly terrorist attacks in recent years. A policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded inan attack on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es in April, just days before the first round of the presidential election. Monday's incident occurred a day after the end of France's parliamentary elections, which saw President Emmanuel Macron's partywin a majority. A white car could be seen standing in the middle of the empty avenue with one door open and sniffer dogs were sent in, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris. Our correspondent says there are always many police and gendarme vehicles near the spot, as it is next to the local police station. A police officer runs past the car on the Avenue des Champs-ÃlysÃ©es A bomb disposal unit is checking the vehicle Traffic caused by the security cordon is seen backed up the avenue Bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene to inspect the vehicle, a Renault MÃ©gane. Mr Collomb, who visited the site, said weapons and explosives found inside ""could potentially blow this car up"". Reports say officers had to smash the car windows to pull the driver out. Sources close to the investigation said the driver of the car had been on a security watchlist since 2015 for membership of a ""radical Islamist movement"". Police were reported to be searching the man's home in the Essonne area south of Paris. Police earlier warned people to respect a security cordon around the area. The anti-terrorist section of the prosecutor's office has opened up an investigation into the incident, which happened close to the ÃlysÃ©e Palace, the president's official residence, and the US embassy.

Court orders Charlie Gard life support,"Charlie Gard's rare disease has left him unable to cry Terminally-ill baby Charlie Gard must continue to receive life support until judges make a ruling on whether he should undergo a trial treatment. Parents Chris Gard and Connie Yates have launched a final legal challenge at the European Court of Human Rights aftera Supreme Court challenge failed. European judges said doctors were required to keep the 10-month-old alive until they had passed judgement. Specialists at Great Ormond Street believe he has no chance of survival. Connie Yates and Chris Gard have raised more than Â£1.3m for treatment in the US Charlie has been in intensive care in hospital since October last year. His doctors said he cannot hear, move, cry or swallow and that his lungs only go up and down because he is on a machine that does it for him. Judges in Strasbourg, France, had previously ruled an interim measure to keep him alive should remain in place until midnight on 19 June. The new extension lasts until a final ruling is made. A spokesperson said the court ""will treat the application with the utmost urgency"" but have not indicated when the final judgement will be made. Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October last year Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, have raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for an experimental treatment in the US. In April a High Court judge ruled against the trip to America and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. Three Court of Appeal judges upheld the ruling in May and three Supreme Court justices have dismissed a further challenge by the parents. Charlie is thought to be one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage.

'Promising start' to UK-EU negotiations,"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary David Davis ""determined optimist"" after day one The EU's chief negotiator said there would be ""substantial"" consequences from Brexit after the first round of talks with the UK. Michel Barnier said he was ""not in the frame of mind to make concessions or ask for concessions"". UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a ""promising start"". The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately. Brexit: Everything you need to know The key issues in EU/UK talks Business call for market access after Brexit Mr Davis and Mr Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels. The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and ""other separation issues"". Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Mr Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled. The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Mr Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided ""sufficient progress has been made"" on the other issues. Mr Davis - who had predicted this would be the ""row of the summer"" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's ""weakness"" and insisted it was ""completely consistent"" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks. ""It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters,"" he said. This video can not be played The clock counts down on Brexit negotiations Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Mr Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to ""assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions"". ""I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions,"" he said. ""It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. ""Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations. ""I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind."" Laura Kuennsberg, BBC political editor It's often compared to a divorce - the UK wanted to talk about who gets the house and the CD collection at the same time as settling who pays for the kids' weddings in 20 years' time. The EU on the other hand have been firm all along that the future arrangements could only be discussed once the terms of the initial split have been agreed. The debate was called ""parallelism versus sequentialism"" and from this afternoon's press conference and the announcement of the procedure it is clear that the UK has lost. Ministers believed they would be able to persuade the EU - the failure to do so has been described as a ""total cave-in"". The discussion was even predicted by Mr Davis as likely to be the ""row of the summer"". The row won't happen because it seems the UK has already given in. Read more from Laura Mr Barnier said a ""fair deal"" was possible ""and far better than no deal"". He promised to work with, not against, the UK. ""We must lift the uncertainty caused by Brexit,"" he said. The two men - who exchanged gifts at the start of the talks - set out the structure for the initial negotiations. There will be one week of negotiations every month. Working groups of ""senior experts"" will be set up to focus on the three main areas. On citizens' rights, which the UK has said should be an immediate priority, Mr Davis said there was ""much common ground"". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Prior to the start of talks, Mr Davis gave his counterpart a first edition of a mountaineering book - a French-language version of Regards vers Annapurna - while Mr Barnier reciprocated with a traditional, hand-carved walking stick from Savoie, complete with leather wrist strap. Who's who in the UK delegation? David Davis: Secretary of State for Exiting The EU Tim Barrow: UK permanent representative to the EU Oliver Robbins: permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting The EU Glynn Williams: director general at the Home Office Mark Bowman: director general, international finance at HM Treasury Simon Case: director general, UK-EU partnership team Alex Ellis: director general at the Department for Exiting the EU Christian Jones: press officer to David Davis The chief negotiators exchanged gifts reflecting their shared passion for hill walking and mountaineering The people who will negotiate Brexit What are the different Brexit options? Scots should be at EU talks says Tory MEP This video can not be played Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson on Brexit negotiation deals This video can not be played Michael Gove tells Today there is support across the Conservative Party for Theresa May After holding talks with Theresa May in Downing Street, new Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said there must be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and economic borders must be ""invisible"". While he said he regretted Mrs May's decision to leave the single market and customs union, he said the two had a shared objective to minimise disruption to trade after the UK's exit. Earlier former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose, who chaired the Stronger In campaign last year, toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethat he was reassured that economic considerations were ""top of the pile"" but ministers needed to be realistic with the public. Speaking on the same programme, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin - one of the leading pro-Leave business voices - said negotiators had to be open to possible compromises but also prepared to walk away and to default to World Trade Organization rules if necessary. ""I don't think many people feel that staying in the single market and customs union and being subject to EU laws is Brexit. ""I think Brexit is parliamentary sovereignty and an assertion of democracy. Outside that, I think there is a quite a lot of scope,"" Mr Martin said. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""real confusion"" about the government's mandate after the general election result.

M&S laser-tags to make avocados greener,"Marks and Spencer is paring back its fruit and veg labelling to be more environmentally friendly, replacing stickers with laser-markings. From Thursday, M&S will sell avocados bearing what look like pale tattoos, showing a best-before date and origin. Peeling away the traditional labelling will save 10 tonnes of paper and five tonnes of glue a year, says M&S. More of its fruit and vegetables may be laser-branded in future, the retailer says. ""The laser just takes off one layer of skin and instead of inking it or burning it, the skin retracts and leaves a mark,"" says Charlie Curtis, senior produce agronomist at Marks and Spencer. ""What we're putting onto the fruit is country of origin, best before date and there's a short code so you can put it through quickly at the [checkout] till."" This video can not be played Charlie Curtis from M&S showed the BBC's Science in Action programme how lasering works While the printed sticker is an effective way to label most groceries, they are sometimes prone to coming unstuck, particularly when applied to very dry, wrinkly or shiny surfaces. Alongside avocados, sweet potatoes and coconuts are among the more challenging products for the supermarket sticker-gun. It's taken M&S six months to perfect the laser process for avocados, but if the trial rolling out this week goes well they expect laser-labelling to be extended to more products. Previous experiments with citrus fruits proved disappointing, since the laser penetrated too far into the very soft, porous skin and made the fruit deteriorate faster. But Miss Curtis says they have high hopes for many other fruits and vegetables, possibly including lasering pumpkins with ""cut here"" scarey faces for Halloween. M&S has also experimented with lasering a complete barcode onto the avocado, but the skin was too uneven. However, it may work for other products, Miss Curtis said. Avocados have become a very fashionable ingredient in recent years M&S said the avocado was first introduced in its UK stores in 1968 as an ""avocado pear"" and some customers consumed it ""as a dessert with custard"". These days its more likely to be served ""smashed"" on toast, as guacamole or even in a smoothie. UK consumption of avocado has soared as it has become increasingly fashionable, and M&S said sales at its stores rose 29% last year.

Russian warning after US downs Syrian jet,"An F/A-18E Super Hornet (similar to the one pictured) shot down the Syrian plane Russia has warned the US-led coalition fighting in Syria that it will view its aircraft as targets, after the US shot down a Syrian military plane on Sunday. The coalition said the Syrian Su-22 had bombed US-backed fighters battling so-called Islamic State in Raqqa province. Russia, the Syrian government's main ally, also said it was halting communications with the US aimed at preventing such incidents. The White House says it retains the right to self-defence in Syria. Spokesman Sean Spicer said it was important to keep lines of communication open with Russia. It comes at a time when the US-led coalition and the fighters it is supporting on the ground attempt to oust IS militants from the city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the ""caliphate"" they proclaimed in 2014. ""Any aircraft, including planes and drones belonging to the international coalition operating west of the River Euphrates, will be tracked by Russian anti-aircraft forces in the sky and on the ground and treated as targets,"" the Russian defence ministrysaid,external. However, it stopped short of openly saying it would shoot down coalition aircraft. Reuters news agency quoted a US military spokesman as saying it was repositioning aircraft over Syria in the wake of the incident, to ensure the safety of American crew members. Russia also denied the US had used a communications channel before the Su-22 fighter bomber was shot down, and said it was ending a memorandum of co-operation with the coalition aimed at preventing air incidents and guaranteeing flight safety. But the chairman of US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen Joe Dunford, said it was seeking to re-establish the ""deconfliction"" communications line with Russia, adding that it had remained in use ""over the last few hours"". The US says the Syrian jet was targeting SDF fighters battling IS in Raqqa province, but Syria and Russia deny this. File photo of female SDF members It is not the first time communications have been suspended between the two sides - in April, the hotline was shut down after the USlaunched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbasein response to a suspected chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town in Idlib province. The US and Russia had agreed to resume communications last month. UK Prime Minister Theresa May called on Russia to continue using available measures to ""reduce the chance of misunderstandings over what is a crowded airspace"", Reuters reported. Why are air combat kills so rare? Russia's ministry of defence has responded sharply. In addition to the usual rhetoric - the charge that the US is violating Syrian sovereignty and breaking international law - there is a practical step - the immediate suspension of the co-ordination channel set up to avoid clashes between US and Russian forces. There is a threat too, namely that in areas where Russian aircraft are operating, coalition drones and aircraft west of the Euphrates river will be tracked and ""treated as targets"". It should be noted that the co-ordination mechanism has generally worked well and its operation is as much in Moscow's as Washington's interest. A previous ""suspension"" of the mechanism by Russia seems to have been by word only - behind-the-scenes contacts continued. But as the battle for eastern Syria steps up, Russia and its Syrian government ally seem intent on drawing a line in the sky. Read more from Jonathan Marcus here The Su-22 fighter bomber was engaged by an F/A-18E Super Hornet after it dropped bombs near the town of Tabqa in Raqqa province on Sunday afternoon, the Pentagon said. It is believed to be the first air-to-air kill of a manned aircraft by a US military jet since the Kosovo campaign in 1999. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters who are leading the offensive on Raqqa, were operating in the Tabqa area. Why is there a war in Syria? A statement from the coalition's Operation Inherent Resolve said pro-government militiamen had attacked SDF units, driving them from the town of Ja'Din. The coalition conducted what it said was a ""show of force"" - a reported buzzing of the pro-government troops by jets - to stop the attack and then called Russia to try to ""de-escalate the situation and stop the firing"". However, the Su-22 dropped bombs on SDF positions a few hours later, the coalition said, and ""in accordance with rules of engagement and in collective self-defence of coalition-partnered forces [the plane] was immediately shot down"". Attempts to warn the plane away using an emergency radio frequency failed, the US military's Central Command said. The fierce battle for Raqqa Inside 'Islamic State': A Raqqa diary This video can not be played Tens of thousands have left Raqqa as fighting intensifies Both Russia and Syria say the warplane was on a mission against IS about 40km (25 miles) south-west of Raqqa, when it came under fire. Russia said in its statement that the Syrian pilot had ejected over IS-controlled territory and ""his fate remains unknown"". Syria's army said the ""flagrant attack"" would have ""dangerous repercussions"". Despite Hollywood blockbusters showcasing close-range aerial battles, they have almost vanished from modern warfare. ""The era of dogfighting is largely over,"" says Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, specialising in combat airpower. ""After the totally lopsided kill-to-loss ratio attained by the US Air Force and US Navy during the First Gulf War, it is a very rare thing for regimes under attack by the US and its allies to send fighters up in defence - since they know how it will end."" Read more Although this is the first time the coalition has shot down a Syrian jet, there have been an increasing number of incidents between the two sides: Earlier this month, theUS shot down a pro-Syrian government armed droneafter it fired at coalition forces near the al-Tanf border crossing, between Syria and Iraq InMay, US-led coalition aircraftbombed a convoy of pro-Syrian government forceswho were reportedly moving towards a base at al-Tanf being used by rebel fighters and Western special forces InSeptember 2016,US-led coalition planes targeting IS positions instead killed Syrian troops. The US expressed ""regret"" for the incident, which Russia said left 62 Syrian troops dead Separately on Sunday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had launched several missiles into eastern Syria, killing a ""large number"" of IS fighters.

Children's presenter Brian Cant dies,"Children's presenter Brian Cant has died at the age of 83. He was best known for presenting BBC's Play School for 21 years from 1964, and Play Away from 1971 to 1984. His agent said he had been living with Parkinson's disease and died at Denville Hall, a retirement home often used by those in the entertainment industry. A statement from the family said: ""He lived courageously with Parkinson's disease for a long time."" Cant was also a guest presenter on Jackanory and appeared on ITV's Dappledown Farm, which ran from 1990 to 2003. He got his big break when he auditioned for Play School, when part of the audition required him to climb into a cardboard box. His voice was known to millions in shows such as Trumpton, his most famous line being the fire brigade call-out: ""Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble, Grub."" Floella Benjamin, who also performed in Play School, said Cant was ""comedy genius"". She told BBC News: ""He was totally devoted to making children happy - he introduced children to comedy with zany jokes and his funny sketches."" Baroness Benjamin, who joined Play School in 1976, said she loved working with Cant. ""We bounced off one another, we thought of new ideas of things to do,"" she said. Brian Cant with Humpty and Chloe Ashcroft with Jemima. two of the Play School presenters For millions his voice immediately evokes childhood. In the early '60s - an audition in which he was asked to sit in a cardboard box led to a job on a new programme called Play School. Born in Ipswich, he trained as a printer before having a go at acting. The warm, friendly voice was perfect for another children's venture - Trumpton, Camberwick Green  - and the slightly more industrial Chigley. If it sounds as though it was recorded in a cupboard, it's because it was. Along with Play Away, Bric a Brac and other programmes he was part of children's TV for more than 20 years. He wrote and appeared on stage, but more than anything he was - for many - a much loved part of childhood. Johnny Ball, who starred on Play Away, told BBC Radio 5 live that Cant was ""the kingpin"" of the programme, adding: ""Brian was a mainstay. He did Trumpton and all the other voice-overs - and it was an absolutely wonderful age, wonderful period. And Brian was absolutely right for all of that work - it was lovely."" He revealed Cant was as nice as he appeared on television: ""He was like Blackpool rock - break him anywhere, and you've got Brian Cant right through the middle. He was just lovely."" Cant's Play School co-presenter and former Coronation Street star Derek Griffiths paid tribute on Twitter,posting a reunion picture,externalof the team. Former Blackadder star Sir Tony Robinsonalso tweeted,external: ""Brian Cant was my mentor and friend on Play Away. We wrote and performed together for two years. Always patient, courteous and funny P-L-A-Y R-I-P."" Cant was honoured with a special Children's Bafta award in 2010. In a BBC interview, he explained that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1999. He said the one thing he wanted children to take away from his work was ""that I made them laugh, I made them feel happy"". On receiving his Bafta, Cant said: ""One of the main rules of those Play School days was that we should play to the camera as though we were talking to one child, in whatever circumstance. ""It could be somebody in a tower block, a nice semi-detached somewhere, or a Royal palace. You had to phrase everything so, whoever was watching it, they felt you were talking to them.""

Finsbury Park attack: What we know so far,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of terror offences after he drove a van into a group of worshippers close to a mosque in north London. One man, who had taken ill before the attack began, died and nine others were taken to hospital, some of whom were critically injured. The terror attack happened shortly before 00:20 BST on Monday, 19 June, when the vehicle mounted the pavement outside Muslim Welfare House - which is also a community centre - on Seven Sisters Road. Here is what we know so far. A number of worshippers from Muslim Welfare House and nearby Finsbury Park Mosque were on the streets at the time, having just taken part in evening prayers after breaking the Ramadan fast. A group were helping an elderly man who had fallen down in Whadcoat Street - a short road off Seven Sisters Road - as they waited for their next set of prayers. It was then that a white van came down the street, mounted the pavement and drove into people. The scene in Finsbury Park Calls were made to the emergency services at about 00:20 BST. A police van arrived within one minute and a cordon was raised around the area within 10 minutes. The man who was driving the van was restrained by people at the scene, and an imam stopped some of the crowd from attacking the suspect. More than 60 medics went to help the injured, including ambulance crews, advance paramedics, specialist response teams, and a trauma team from London's Air Ambulance. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack was ""declared a terrorist incident within eight minutes"" of the first emergency call being received. As a result, officers from the local borough are being supported by armed police and the Territorial Support Group, which is deployed to events that may involve public disorder. The Counter Terrorism Command is leading the investigation. Police confirmed early on Monday that the elderly man who was receiving first aid before the attack had later died. He has not yet been named, and police said they were still investigating whether he died as a result of the attack or something else. The London Ambulance Service said nine people were being treated in three hospitals in the capital, with some in a serious condition. Two other people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. People prayed on the street after the attack The police confirmed that all the victims were Muslims. Witnesses reported seeing one man giving CPR to a victim in the street, while another man's head injury was treated with a makeshift dressing.

He grew up in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset and has four children. He was later also arrested for the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism. Immediately after the attack he was detained by members of the public as they waited for police to arrive on the scene. Eyewitness Abdul Rahman told the BBC: ""When the guy came out from his van he wanted to escape, run away, and he was saying 'I want to kill Muslims. 'I want to kill Muslims.'"" Police said he was taken to hospital as a precaution. Security minister Ben Wallace said the man was not known to the police or security services, and it is thought he acted alone. Some witnesses said there was more than one person involved in the attack, but a statement from the police said there were no other suspects. Forensics officers are now examining the white van, which has Pontyclun Van Hire -a firm from Rhondda Cynon Taff in Wales- written on it. A residential address in the Cardiff area is being searched in relation to the terror attack. Mr Osborne's family released a statement, which said: ""We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in. ""We're devastated for the families, our hearts go out to those who've been injured. ""It's madness, it must just be complete madness."" Mrs Maysaid the incident was a terror attack. She said the man arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack ""targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives"". She reiterated remarks that were made after an attack near London Bridge, saying ""there has been far too much tolerance of extremism over many years.""

He has also asked people to ""remain calm and vigilant"". ""We don't yet know the full details, but this was clearly a deliberate attack on innocent Londoners, many of whom were finishing prayers during the holy month of Ramadan,"" he said.

PM condemns 'sickening' terror attack,"This video can not be played Footage shows the suspected attacker being tackled to the ground before the police arrive A terror attack near a London mosque is ""every bit as sickening"" as others in recent weeks, Theresa May says. A man drove a van into worshippers close to Muslim Welfare House in Finsbury Park as they were gathered to help an elderly man who had collapsed. He later died, but it is not clear if this was a result of the attack. Nine other people were taken to hospital. A 47-year-old man was held on suspicion of attempted murder and later further arrested over alleged terror offences. Scotland Yard said he was being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism including murder and attempted murder. Searches are also being carried out at an address in the Cardiff area. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the incident in north London was ""quite clearly an attack on Muslims"", and the community would now see more police, including armed officers, in the area, ""particularly around religious establishments"". It is the fourth terror attack in the UK in three months, after incidents in Westminster, Manchester and on London Bridge. Police said all the victims of the attack shortly after midnight were Muslim and many were believed to have just left evening prayers after breaking the Ramadan fast. Several of the injured are believed to be seriously hurt. London Ambulance Service said a number of other people were treated at the scene for minor injuries.

The prime minister said police declared it a terrorist incident within eight minutes and a white man in his 40s was now in custody. Mrs May was speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. The prime minister and the Met Police commissioner met faith leaders at Finsbury Park Mosque ""It was an attack that once again targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives - this time British Muslims as they left a mosque having broken their fast and prayed together at this sacred time of year,"" she said. She added that ""there has been far too much tolerance of extremism over many years"". ""It is a reminder that terrorism, extremism and hatred take many forms; and our determination to tackle them must be the same whoever is responsible."" After making her statement outside Downing Street, the prime minister visited Finsbury Park Mosque, which is also close to the scene of the incident, where she held talks with faith leaders. Eyewitness Abdul Rahman told the BBC: ""When the guy came out from his van he wanted to escape, run away, and he was saying 'I want to kill Muslims. 'I want to kill Muslims.' ""I hit him on his stomach... and then me and the other guys... we held him to the ground until he couldn't move. We stopped him until the police came."" Adil Rana, 24, said ""people were punching him and beating him, which was reasonable because of what he's done"". The imam of Muslim Welfare House - which is also a community centre - said a passing police van was flagged down after the attack. Mohammed Mahmoud told reporters: ""We told them the situation - there's a man, he's restrained, he mowed down a group of people with his van and there is a mob attempting to hurt him and if you don't take him then, God forbid, he might be seriously hurt.

BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said it was not the first time that Muslims - and specifically visible Muslim targets, namely mosques - had been targeted in an act of terrorism in the UK. The threat from extreme right-wing groups has been growing in recent years, he said, noting that 16% of all terror arrests in the year to March were classed as ""domestic extremism"". By Cherry Wilson, BBC News Locals say this is a proudly multicultural area, where the biggest rivalry is whether you support Arsenal or their north London rivals, Tottenham. Now the mood here is one of shock, as residents stand by the police cordon seeing the aftermath of yet another attack in London. Mother-of-four Nicola Senior, 43, is walking back from taking her children to school when she stops to take in the scene. She said: ""I'm frightened. Is there going to be retaliation? ""I am fearful for my kids. Can we go to the park? Can we go to the church? It feels like this is happening all the time."" 'Everyone is on edge' after attack Forensics officers are examining a white van which has Pontyclun Van Hire on it -a firm from Rhondda Cynon Taff in south Wales. The firm said in a statement that it was ""shocked and saddened"" and co-operating with the police. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This incident risks playing right into the hands of those planning further attacks on vulnerable citizens in the UK. Online followers of the so-called Islamic State have been quick to seize on the Finsbury Park attack as proof of what they see as widespread hostility towards Muslims who live in the West. Inevitably, it will be used by recruiters and propagandists to incite further attacks - extremism breeds extremism. The one thing that far right anti-Muslim extremists and violent jihadists have in common is the belief that peaceful coexistence between Muslim and non-Muslim is impossible. The unified prayers and solidarity across communities that followed recent terror attacks are anathema to them. Extremists of both types want instead to divide society and will keep trying to bring this about by criminal acts of provocation such as this. The Muslim Council of Britain said this was the ""most violent manifestation to date"" of recent Islamophobic incidents. ""We expect the authorities to increase security outside mosques as a matter of urgency."" Mohammed Kozbar, general secretary of Finsbury Park Mosque, gave a statement on behalf of a joint faiths group. He said that ""an attack on one faith is an attack on all faith and communities"". The group has appealed for calm, adding that ""all of our efforts should be towards getting justice for the victims and ensuring our community stays the diverse, tolerant and welcome place we know it to be"".

""We will make sure that we do all we can to reduce these sort of attacks,"" she added. Labour's shadow home secretary and Hackney North and Stoke Newington MPDiane Abbott said on Twitter,externalthat police ""must urgently review security for all mosques"". Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn has also visited the area, telling the BBC that ""an attack on a mosque, an attack on a synagogue, an attack on a church is actually an attack on all of us"". ""We have to protect each other's faith, each other's way of life, and that's what makes us a strong society and community."" This video can not be played Corbyn: People must be free to practise their faith Mr Corbyn attended prayers at Finsbury Park Mosque with Islington Council Leader Richard Watts. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has also been to the area, where he met residents and community leaders.

UK 'positive' as Brexit discussions begin,"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary David Davis ""determined optimist"" after day one The EU's chief negotiator said there would be ""substantial"" consequences from Brexit after the first round of talks with the UK. Michel Barnier said he was ""not in the frame of mind to make concessions or ask for concessions"". UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a ""promising start"". The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately. Brexit: Everything you need to know The key issues in EU/UK talks Business call for market access after Brexit Mr Davis and Mr Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels. The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and ""other separation issues"". Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Mr Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled. The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Mr Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided ""sufficient progress has been made"" on the other issues. Mr Davis - who had predicted this would be the ""row of the summer"" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's ""weakness"" and insisted it was ""completely consistent"" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks. ""It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters,"" he said. This video can not be played The clock counts down on Brexit negotiations Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Mr Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to ""assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions"". ""I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions,"" he said. ""It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. ""Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations. ""I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind."" Laura Kuennsberg, BBC political editor It's often compared to a divorce - the UK wanted to talk about who gets the house and the CD collection at the same time as settling who pays for the kids' weddings in 20 years' time. The EU on the other hand have been firm all along that the future arrangements could only be discussed once the terms of the initial split have been agreed. The debate was called ""parallelism versus sequentialism"" and from this afternoon's press conference and the announcement of the procedure it is clear that the UK has lost. Ministers believed they would be able to persuade the EU - the failure to do so has been described as a ""total cave-in"". The discussion was even predicted by Mr Davis as likely to be the ""row of the summer"". The row won't happen because it seems the UK has already given in. Read more from Laura Mr Barnier said a ""fair deal"" was possible ""and far better than no deal"". He promised to work with, not against, the UK. ""We must lift the uncertainty caused by Brexit,"" he said. The two men - who exchanged gifts at the start of the talks - set out the structure for the initial negotiations. There will be one week of negotiations every month. Working groups of ""senior experts"" will be set up to focus on the three main areas. On citizens' rights, which the UK has said should be an immediate priority, Mr Davis said there was ""much common ground"". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Prior to the start of talks, Mr Davis gave his counterpart a first edition of a mountaineering book - a French-language version of Regards vers Annapurna - while Mr Barnier reciprocated with a traditional, hand-carved walking stick from Savoie, complete with leather wrist strap. Who's who in the UK delegation? David Davis: Secretary of State for Exiting The EU Tim Barrow: UK permanent representative to the EU Oliver Robbins: permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting The EU Glynn Williams: director general at the Home Office Mark Bowman: director general, international finance at HM Treasury Simon Case: director general, UK-EU partnership team Alex Ellis: director general at the Department for Exiting the EU Christian Jones: press officer to David Davis The chief negotiators exchanged gifts reflecting their shared passion for hill walking and mountaineering The people who will negotiate Brexit What are the different Brexit options? Scots should be at EU talks says Tory MEP This video can not be played Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson on Brexit negotiation deals This video can not be played Michael Gove tells Today there is support across the Conservative Party for Theresa May After holding talks with Theresa May in Downing Street, new Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said there must be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and economic borders must be ""invisible"". While he said he regretted Mrs May's decision to leave the single market and customs union, he said the two had a shared objective to minimise disruption to trade after the UK's exit. Earlier former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose, who chaired the Stronger In campaign last year, toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethat he was reassured that economic considerations were ""top of the pile"" but ministers needed to be realistic with the public. Speaking on the same programme, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin - one of the leading pro-Leave business voices - said negotiators had to be open to possible compromises but also prepared to walk away and to default to World Trade Organization rules if necessary. ""I don't think many people feel that staying in the single market and customs union and being subject to EU laws is Brexit. ""I think Brexit is parliamentary sovereignty and an assertion of democracy. Outside that, I think there is a quite a lot of scope,"" Mr Martin said. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""real confusion"" about the government's mandate after the general election result.

Water tank saves 12 from Portugal fire,"This video can not be played Drone footage shows burnt-out cars in the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area Twelve people survived one of Portugal's deadliest fires by seeking refuge in a water tank after access to their village was cut off by the blaze. The residents, including a disabled 95-year-old woman, spent more than six hours in the tank as the fire prevented them from being rescued. ""If it wasn't for this, we would all have died,"" one of the survivors said. The fires, which police believe were started by lightning, killed 63 people, many of them dying in their cars. The latest of the victims was identified as a 40-year-old firefighter who died in hospital. Residents in some areas of central Portugal were still being evacuated as more than 1,000 firefighters tackled the blaze, which continued to rage on several fronts on Monday despite light rain. 'I could have died - I should have died' In pictures: Portugal forest fire Maria do CÃ©u Silva was hailed as a hero after using her house's water tank to rescue the residents of Nodeirinho, next to the IC8 motorway, which was badly hit by the fire. The idea, Ms Silva said, came while she tried to save her disabled mother. ""My husband told me to put her in the van but she couldn't get in by herself so she told me: 'Let me die on the floor',""she told Correio da ManhÃ£ newspaper.,external ""With the help of my son we managed to take her here."" Her 81-year-old father also survived by hiding in the tank. The winds were so strong, she said, that roofs of the houses were blown out. ""It was like a horror movie."" This video can not be played BBC Weather's Jay Wynne reports on the devastating wildfires in Portugal. We found ourselves stranded in a village called MÃ³ Grande, just off of the IC8 motorway; ourselves and others were directed there by an officer from the IC8. As we drove up the mountain road you could see the flames jumping across from one side of the valley to the other. The accompanying wind threw branches at the car but you couldn't stop, you could feel the heat. Eventually we reached the small village at a crossroads surrounded by fire. Locals and ourselves were crying, overwhelmed by the heat and speed of the fire. It was dark, so dark, among the flames. The devastation was indescribable. People, bewildered, remains of homes burning uncontrollably, concrete posts exploding over roads. Read on This video can not be played Gareth Roberts: 'You could hear the roar of the fire coming... we just sat and waited to die' Next to the village, 30 bodies were found inside cars, with another 17 next to the vehicles, on the N-236 road, which leads on to the IC8 motorway. The N-236 was being described as the ""road of death"" in Portuguese media. A few kilometres north of Nodeirinho, 11 people died in the village of Pobrais. Local reports said a third of the population had lost their lives, many as they tried to escape the fire. A survivor spoke of the roads being blocked and of no-one coming to their aid. Maria de FÃ¡tima Nunes and her husband were driving on the motorway when their car was hit by the fire. ""My husband was burned on the arm,"" she told SIC NotÃ­cias. ""I got burned too, on the chest.""

The fire was coming from all sides. The cars crashed into each other trying to escape."" The couple who were in the car behind them, she said, did not manage to escape and died. ""I shouted for the woman to get out of the car, but she didn't. Her husband did, but died there."" Officials said on Monday that 135 people had been injured by the fires, including more than a dozen firefighters. Three days of mourning in Portugal The fire hit the central forested region of PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande The fires began on Saturday in the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande region during an intense heatwave and rainless thunderstorms, with temperatures of more than 40C (104F) in some areas. Meanwhile, outbreaks were reported in two more central regions, Castelo Branco and Coimbra. There was some rain on Monday and temperatures dropped slightly, but the situation was described by civil protection officials as worrying. Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa visited some of the affected areas and urged people to follow the evacuation calls. Wildfires rage in Portugal.

Jaguar Land Rover and Gorillaz team up,"Gorillaz female guitarist, Noodle, is already Jaguar's Formula E Racing's ambassador Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has teamed up with virtual band Gorillaz to find 5,000 staff to enhance its expertise in autonomous and electric technology. The firm says it will use a two-stage recruitment challenge, to be found on the Gorillaz mixed reality app, as an ""innovative recruitment tool"". The first part involves virtually assembling the Jaguar I-PACE Concept, an all-electric five-seater sports car. The second part involves a series of code breaking puzzles. ""As the automotive industry transforms over the next decade, fuelled by software innovation, we have to attract the best talent and that requires a radical rethink of how we recruit,"" said Alex Heslop, head of electrical engineering at the car firm. ""Here we've found an engaging way to recruit a diverse talent pool in software systems, cyber systems, app development and graphics performance. It will be the first of its kind."" Gorrilaz female guitarist, Noodle, is already Jaguar's Formula E Racing's ambassador. The firm said it would hire 1,000 electronic and software engineers and 4,000 workers across other sectors, including manufacturing. Most of the jobs will be based in the UK, with recruitment taking place over the coming year. The firm has five sites in the West Midlands, and one on Merseyside. The carmaker, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, employs more than 40,000 people globally, The company will build the I-PACE, in Austria. But it has indicated it would like to make such models in the UK if conditions such as support from government are met.

Seventy-nine feared dead in tower fire,"Anthony Disson and Ya-Haddy Sisi Saye are among five people to be formally identified by the police Four more victims of the Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington have been named by the Metropolitan Police. Anthony Disson, 65, Ya-Haddy Sisi Saye, 24, also known as Khadija Saye, and Abufars Ibrahim, 39, all died when the 24-storey high rise caught fire shortly before 01:00 BST on 13 June. Khadija Khalloufi - a 52-year-old woman - was also identified as one of the victims. A total of 79 people are either dead or missing presumed dead, police said. Commander Stuart Cundy confirmed the figure in a statement on Monday, adding it may still change. Mohammad Alhajali, 23, was the first victim to be formally identified. Of those who were injured, 18 people remain in hospital, with nine in critical care. Khadija Khalloufi has also been formally identified by police What we know so far Who are the victims? Visual guide to what happened Mr Disson was a retired lorry driver who lived on the 22nd floor of the tower. He lived in the property for eight years and phoned his son at 03:30, saying he was being told to stay in his flat. His family released a statement saying they were ""devastated"" at the news. ""Tony leaves behind a large family, his wife, sons and grandchildren, including one grandchild he will never get to meet,"" they said. ""We miss him terribly, and are pulling together as a family and trying to stay strong under these tragic circumstances. We ask at this time that our family are left to grieve in private."" This video can not be played New footage reveals the moment firefighters first saw Grenfell Tower Ms Saye's death was first talked about after Labour MP David Lammy posted a tribute on Twitter, but this is the first time the police have confirmed it. The artist and photographer lived on the 20th floor with her mother, Mary Mendy, who is missing. Mr Lammy's wife was Ms Saye's employer and mentor and she had been filmed for a BBC documentary. Many of the families that were affected lost more than one relative, said Cdr Cundy, adding that his ""heart went out to them"". Police have released images of the inside of flats where the occupants have been accounted for Cdr Cundy said his priority was to identify the people who died in the building and to remove them as quickly as possible. But he warned that not everyone would be identifiable and the operation would take ""many, many weeks"". ""This is an incredibly distressing time for families,"" he said. ""It is really hard to describe the devastation the fire caused. ""What is important for me is to find answers for those families who have been directly affected.""

Historic violin lent to Syrian refugee,"This video can not be played Syrian refugee lent 19th century violin after being spotted playing in a Lebanon monastery A 19th Century violin has been taken out of a collection of historic instruments held by Oxford University and sent to a young Syrian musician living as a refugee. Aboud Kaplo, 14, was forced out of his home in Aleppo and is now living in Lebanon. Film-maker Susie Attwood came across Aboud and saw his passion for music, but also his lack of an instrument. Oxford University has now lent the teenager the restored violin. The German-made violin is part of the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, which has more than 2,000 examples of historic and modern instruments, tracing their development since the Middle Ages. They can be used by academics, students and researchers, but for the first time an instrument from the collection is going to be lent to a young aspiring refugee musician. Curator Andy Lamb said that ""the moment I read about this lad's situation"" he thought the collection ""could make some kind of positive contribution"". ""I immediately had an instrument in mind. It belonged to a former curator, Dr Helene Larue, a very generous person, and I knew that if she had been confronted with this situation, she would have donated an instrument instantly."" The 19th Century violin has a new life outside of the university collection Oxford University found about Aboud from film-maker and former student of the music faculty Susie Attwood. She had met Aboud and his family at a Syriac Orthodox monastery, where she wasmaking a film about Syrian Christian refugees in Lebanon,external, stuck in an ""in-between existence"", unable to find work or to provide an education for their children. Aboud had a great interest in music and was trying to teach himself using YouTube videos and a ""rattly"" toy violin. ""Life is very difficult for Syrians living in Lebanon, but seeing how music provides such hope for someone like Aboud is very moving. I couldn't just let it go,"" said Attwood. She contacted the university, and the Bate Collection immediately offered to help. Global education Rubbish collector builds library from discarded books Trying to be a distance learner in Aleppo Education aid 'stagnates' despite pledges University of Birmingham to open campus in Dubai Apple runs its own school to tackle digital skills gap Get in touch with theGlobal education series. ""The violin is not rare or ancient enough to be regarded as a precious resource, but it's significantly better than a cheap modern factory instrument, and it's entirely the kind of instrument we would lend to a student here at Oxford,"" said collection curator Mr Lamb. Aboud said he ""cannot express by words how I feel - I'm so happy, so excited"". ""Playing the violin helps me express my feelings. I want to go on to study music and play on a big stage and travel the world."" âHe loves the violin like no otherâ Video, 00:01:21âHe loves the violin like no otherâ The long-distance learners of Aleppo Syrian refugee students rebuild from Beirut Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan Who really paid up to help Syria?

Muslim girl killed near US mosque,"Friends have released this picture of Nabra Hassanen Police in the US state of Virginia have found the remains believed to be of a 17-year-old Muslim girl who was assaulted near a mosque before disappearing. The teenager, identified as Nabra Hassanen, was walking with friends when they got into a dispute with a driver in Herndon, police said. The man left the car and assaulted the girl, they said. She then disappeared. A 22-year-old suspect has been arrested and charged with murder. The reason for the attack was still unknown, but police said it ""appears to be the result of a road rage incident"".

America's 'invisible' Muslims TheWashington Post reported,externalthat a group of four or five teenagers including Nabra had visited a fast-food restaurant to have a late-night meal - Muslims are currently observing the holy month of Ramadan, when they fast from dawn to sunset. At about 04:00 (08:00 GMT), the group was confronted by the driver as they walked and rode bicycles along the street.

Mohammed Kozbar, the mosque's chairman, praised the ""great response"" from the community following the attack.

""And especially in the last couple of weeks and months especially we find that there's a backlash against Muslims. But it's important for Muslims to come out and show what the true Islam is. ""We as a community as Londoners we have to stand together as before and try to eradicate these misconceptions that have fallen within our society.""  The family of Darren Osborne - the 47-year-old believed to be he suspect in the Finsbury Park attack - have released a statement. It read: ""We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in. We're devastated for the families, our hearts go out to those who've been injured.""

He added: ""I want to assure Londoners that this attack will in no way distract from other urgent work the police and emergency services are currently dealing with â including the vital recovery work at Grenfell Tower."" It is more important now than ever that we focus on those things that unite us, that make our city so great â our values of tolerance and respect, our belief that our diversity makes us stronger. We must remind ourselves of these things, as they are the reasons why we can be sure that we will never allow terrorists to fuel division and we will never be defeated by those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life.

"Jaguar Land Rover to create 5,000 jobs","Gorillaz female guitarist, Noodle, is already Jaguar's Formula E Racing's ambassador Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has teamed up with virtual band Gorillaz to find 5,000 staff to enhance its expertise in autonomous and electric technology. The firm says it will use a two-stage recruitment challenge, to be found on the Gorillaz mixed reality app, as an ""innovative recruitment tool"". The first part involves virtually assembling the Jaguar I-PACE Concept, an all-electric five-seater sports car. The second part involves a series of code breaking puzzles. ""As the automotive industry transforms over the next decade, fuelled by software innovation, we have to attract the best talent and that requires a radical rethink of how we recruit,"" said Alex Heslop, head of electrical engineering at the car firm. ""Here we've found an engaging way to recruit a diverse talent pool in software systems, cyber systems, app development and graphics performance. It will be the first of its kind."" Gorrilaz female guitarist, Noodle, is already Jaguar's Formula E Racing's ambassador. The firm said it would hire 1,000 electronic and software engineers and 4,000 workers across other sectors, including manufacturing. Most of the jobs will be based in the UK, with recruitment taking place over the coming year. The firm has five sites in the West Midlands, and one on Merseyside. The carmaker, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, employs more than 40,000 people globally, The company will build the I-PACE, in Austria. But it has indicated it would like to make such models in the UK if conditions such as support from government are met.

US coalition downs first Syrian plane,"An F/A-18E Super Hornet (similar to the one pictured) shot down the Syrian army plane A US-led coalition fighter jet has shot down a Syrian military plane in Raqqa province, the US has confirmed. The SU-22 fighter bomber was engaged by an F/A-18E Super Hornet after it had dropped bombs near the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the Pentagon said. It is the first time in the Syrian conflict that the US-led coalition has shot down a Syrian jet. Syria condemned what it called a ""flagrant attack"" that would have ""dangerous repercussions"". In a separate incident, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had launched several missiles from Iran into eastern Syria on Sunday, targeting IS fighters. The downing of a Syrian warplane by a US jet threatens to draw Washington further into the Syrian fighting. The US has already attacked pro-government forces on the ground after they entered an exclusion zone designed to protect US personnel training and advising anti-government rebels near Syria's border with Iraq. Now, Washington is extending this protection to forces that it backs who are engaged in the offensive against Raqqa. These local, tactical steps inevitably could have strategic implications creating a further source of friction between Washington and Tehran. Iran's focus is increasingly on the border region between Syria and Iraq. The struggle for control of this crucial territory is becoming ever more dangerous. Iran's own missile strikes against what it says are IS targets underscores Tehran's willingness to act in defence of its own interests in Syria. The SU-22 incident took place on Sunday afternoon near the town of Tabqa, where the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been fighting Islamic State militants as part of a drive to retake the city of Raqqa, the IS stronghold further to the east. It is believed to be the first air-to-air kill of a manned aircraft by a US military jet since the Kosovo campaign in 1999. Why is there a war in Syria? The Pentagon said that pro-government militiamen had attacked SDF units, driving them from the town of Ja'Din. The pro-government forces are not fighting the battle for Raqqa but they have been making ground against IS in the surrounding area, south-west of the city. The US-led coalition conducted what the Pentagon said was a ""show of force""  - a reported buzzing of the pro-government troops by jets - to stop the attack and then called the Syrian government's ally, Russia, to try to ""de-escalate the situation and stop the firing"". However, the SU-22 dropped bombs on SDF positions a few hours later, the Pentagon said, and ""in accordance with rules of engagement and in collective self-defence of Coalition-partnered forces [the plane] was immediately shot down"". Attempts to warn the plane away using an emergency radio frequency failed, the US Central Command said. The Pentagon statement added: ""The demonstrated hostile intent and actions of pro-regime forces toward Coalition and partner forces in Syria conducting legitimate counter-Isis [IS] operations will not be tolerated."" The coalition, it added, did ""not seek to fight the Syrian regime, Russian or pro-regime forces partnered with them, but will not hesitate to defend coalition or partner forces from any threat"". The fierce battle for Raqqa Inside 'Islamic State': A Raqqa diary This video can not be played Tens of thousands have left Raqqa as fighting intensifies The Syrian army said its warplane had been on a mission against IS when it came under fire, according to state television. It said the incident would have ""dangerous repercussions"" on efforts to fight terrorism. An army statement said the pilot of the plane was missing. The ""flagrant attack was an attempt to undermine the efforts of the army as the only effective force capable with its allies... in fighting terrorism across its territory,"" it said. In a muted statement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose government backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said ""all countries must fully respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria"". His deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, called it ""an act of aggression"" that violated international law. Although this is the first time the coalition has shot down a Syrian jet, there has been an increasing number of incidents between the two sides: Earlier this month, theUS shot down a pro-Syrian government armed droneafter it fired at coalition forces near the al-Tanf border crossing, between Syria and Iraq InMay, US-led coalition aircraftbombed a convoy of pro-Syrian government forceswho were reportedly moving towards a base at al-Tanf being used by rebel fighters and Western special forces InApril, the USlaunched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbasein response to a suspected chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town in Idlib province InSeptember 2016,US-led coalition planes targeting IS positions instead killed Syrian troops. The US expressed ""regret"" for the incident, which Russia said left 62 Syrian troops dead On Sunday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had fired mid-range ground-to-ground missiles from western Iran targeting ""the headquarters and meeting place and suicide car assembly line"" of ""IS terrorists"" in Deir al-Zour province. The Guards said a ""large number"" of militants had been killed and equipment and weapons were destroyed. This video can not be played CCTV footage of the IS attack on Tehran's parliament building The missiles were apparently in response to an IS-claimedattack on the Iranian parliamentearlier this month which killed more than a dozen people. ""The spilling of any pure blood will not go unanswered,"" a Guards statement said. Iran has been a key ally of President Assad, sending military advisers and thousands of ""volunteer"" troops.

One dead after 'terror attack' near mosque,"This video can not be played Footage shows the suspected attacker being tackled to the ground before the police arrive A terror attack near a London mosque is ""every bit as sickening"" as others in recent weeks, Theresa May says. A man drove a van into worshippers close to Muslim Welfare House in Finsbury Park as they were gathered to help an elderly man who had collapsed. He later died, but it is not clear if this was a result of the attack. Nine other people were taken to hospital. A 47-year-old man was held on suspicion of attempted murder and later further arrested over alleged terror offences. Scotland Yard said he was being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism including murder and attempted murder. Searches are also being carried out at an address in the Cardiff area. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the incident in north London was ""quite clearly an attack on Muslims"", and the community would now see more police, including armed officers, in the area, ""particularly around religious establishments"". It is the fourth terror attack in the UK in three months, after incidents in Westminster, Manchester and on London Bridge. Police said all the victims of the attack shortly after midnight were Muslim and many were believed to have just left evening prayers after breaking the Ramadan fast. Several of the injured are believed to be seriously hurt. London Ambulance Service said a number of other people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Follow live updates here What we know so far In pictures: Finsbury Park attack Welsh hire van in mosque terror attack Theresa May's statement in full Security Minister Ben Wallace said the suspect was not known to the security services, and was believed to have acted alone. The prime minister said police declared it a terrorist incident within eight minutes and a white man in his 40s was now in custody. Mrs May was speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. The prime minister and the Met Police commissioner met faith leaders at Finsbury Park Mosque ""It was an attack that once again targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives - this time British Muslims as they left a mosque having broken their fast and prayed together at this sacred time of year,"" she said. She added that ""there has been far too much tolerance of extremism over many years"". ""It is a reminder that terrorism, extremism and hatred take many forms; and our determination to tackle them must be the same whoever is responsible."" After making her statement outside Downing Street, the prime minister visited Finsbury Park Mosque, which is also close to the scene of the incident, where she held talks with faith leaders. Eyewitness Abdul Rahman told the BBC: ""When the guy came out from his van he wanted to escape, run away, and he was saying 'I want to kill Muslims. 'I want to kill Muslims.' ""I hit him on his stomach... and then me and the other guys... we held him to the ground until he couldn't move. We stopped him until the police came."" Adil Rana, 24, said ""people were punching him and beating him, which was reasonable because of what he's done"". The imam of Muslim Welfare House - which is also a community centre - said a passing police van was flagged down after the attack. Mohammed Mahmoud told reporters: ""We told them the situation - there's a man, he's restrained, he mowed down a group of people with his van and there is a mob attempting to hurt him and if you don't take him then, God forbid, he might be seriously hurt. ""We pushed people away from him until he was safely taken by police."" Toufik Kacimi, chief executive of Muslim Welfare House, said the suspect had told those holding him ""you deserve it"" and was also saying ""I did my bit"". This video can not be played Finsbury Park Imam Mohamed Mahmoud says the community in Finsbury Park is ""mild-mannered, calm"" Another witness, who gave his name as Abdul, told the BBC the suspect was shouting ""kill me, I've done my job"". Earlier, police also said the arrested man would be the ""subject of a mental health assessment in due course"". Police forensic experts have been at the scene of the attack Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""While this appears to be an attack on a particular community, like the terrible attacks in Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge it is also an assault on all our shared values of tolerance, freedom and respect."" Thee mayor has also reiterated his calls for the government to provide more funding to the Met Police. BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said it was not the first time that Muslims - and specifically visible Muslim targets, namely mosques - had been targeted in an act of terrorism in the UK. The threat from extreme right-wing groups has been growing in recent years, he said, noting that 16% of all terror arrests in the year to March were classed as ""domestic extremism"". By Cherry Wilson, BBC News Locals say this is a proudly multicultural area, where the biggest rivalry is whether you support Arsenal or their north London rivals, Tottenham. Now the mood here is one of shock, as residents stand by the police cordon seeing the aftermath of yet another attack in London. Mother-of-four Nicola Senior, 43, is walking back from taking her children to school when she stops to take in the scene. She said: ""I'm frightened. Is there going to be retaliation? ""I am fearful for my kids. Can we go to the park? Can we go to the church? It feels like this is happening all the time."" 'Everyone is on edge' after attack Forensics officers are examining a white van which has Pontyclun Van Hire on it -a firm from Rhondda Cynon Taff in south Wales. The firm said in a statement that it was ""shocked and saddened"" and co-operating with the police. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This incident risks playing right into the hands of those planning further attacks on vulnerable citizens in the UK. Online followers of the so-called Islamic State have been quick to seize on the Finsbury Park attack as proof of what they see as widespread hostility towards Muslims who live in the West. Inevitably, it will be used by recruiters and propagandists to incite further attacks - extremism breeds extremism. The one thing that far right anti-Muslim extremists and violent jihadists have in common is the belief that peaceful coexistence between Muslim and non-Muslim is impossible. The unified prayers and solidarity across communities that followed recent terror attacks are anathema to them. Extremists of both types want instead to divide society and will keep trying to bring this about by criminal acts of provocation such as this. The Muslim Council of Britain said this was the ""most violent manifestation to date"" of recent Islamophobic incidents. ""We expect the authorities to increase security outside mosques as a matter of urgency."" Mohammed Kozbar, general secretary of Finsbury Park Mosque, gave a statement on behalf of a joint faiths group. He said that ""an attack on one faith is an attack on all faith and communities"". The group has appealed for calm, adding that ""all of our efforts should be towards getting justice for the victims and ensuring our community stays the diverse, tolerant and welcome place we know it to be"". This video can not be played Abdulrahman Aidroos describes how he and others detained the suspected attacker This video can not be played Theresa May said ""hatred and evil"" will never succeed Home Secretary Amber Rudd described it as an appalling incident, and said new funding for security at religious sites had recently been arranged.

Labour's shadow home secretary and Hackney North and Stoke Newington MPDiane Abbott said on Twitter,externalthat police ""must urgently review security for all mosques"". Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn has also visited the area, telling the BBC that ""an attack on a mosque, an attack on a synagogue, an attack on a church is actually an attack on all of us"".

Mr Javid also said he wanted to reassure Muslims around the UK that the government would ""always take a zero tolerance approach to hate crime"".

Police expect tower death toll to rise,"The number of people believed to have been killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in west London is expected to increase from 58, the Met police has said. Commander Stuart Cundy said an updated figure for those presumed dead would be released on Monday. But he said the process of identifying victims was likely to take weeks due to the conditions in the tower, which ""verge on the indescribable"". A minute's silence is to be held later in memory of the victims. The BBC understands about 70 may have died. Eighteen people remain in hospital, nine in critical care. But Cdr Cundy warned of the potential ""terrible reality"" that some people may never be identified due to the intensity of the fire. ""I must consider the fact that there may be others in the building who, for whatever reason have not been reported to us. ""There is also a real possibility that there may be people in the building that no-one knows are missing,"" he said. Police have released new images of properties where everyone has been accounted for Police have released images from inside the 24-storey building to show the scale of the challenge they face. The building was gutted after the fire ripped through the block in North Kensington in the early hours of Wednesday. Cdr Cundy said: ""It is really important that we are clear about the scale of the challenge facing us as our teams search Grenfell Tower to recover those people still inside and return them to their loved ones. ""Whilst our teams have been from the bottom to the top of the tower, we must now carry out a full forensic and systematic search. ""The conditions due to the fire damage verge on indescribable, which is why this will be such a lengthy operation taking weeks to complete."" A minute's silence is to be held at 11:00 BST across all government buildings to remember the people who lost their lives and all those affected by the fire. Kensington and Chelsea Council has faced widespread criticism for its handling of the disaster, with residents complaining that officials had provided little support or information. Prime Minister Theresa May has also come in for criticism over her response to the disaster. She was jeered on a visit to the North Kensington estate on Friday, and protesters marching on Friday and Saturday called for her resignation. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the fire was a ""preventable accident"" caused by ""years of neglect"" by the local council and successive governments. What we know so far Who are the victims? Visual guide to what happened A police photo shows a burned-out corridor in Grenfell Tower Kensington and Chelsea Council leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said he understood residents' anger and that the authority itself wanted to know why the fire had started and spread so quickly. He added that the disaster was too big for one authority to handle alone and it was inaccurate to suggest his council was not present on the ground or working with other authorities. The government has sent in a team of civil servants to bolster the relief effort. They were spotted in high-visibility jackets in the area on Sunday afternoon. The government has also pledged to give Â£5,500 to all of those who lost their homes. Each household will receive at least Â£500 in cash and Â£5,000 paid into an account as part of a Â£5m emergency fund first announced on Friday.

The new team is made up of local and central government, the Red Cross, the Metropolitan Police and the London Fire Brigade.

On Sunday Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC's Andrew Marr Show that a criminal investigation would examine whether building regulations had been breached when the block was refurbished. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the council had seemed to ""lack the resources to deal with a crisis of this magnitude"", despite being the country's ""wealthiest borough"".

France's Macron wins absolute majority,"Emmanuel Macron was seen voting earlier in Le Touquet French President Emmanuel Macron's party has won a clear parliamentary majority, results show, weeks after his own presidential victory. With nearly all votes counted, his La RÃ©publique en Marche, alongside its MoDem allies, won more than 300 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly. The winning margin is lower than some expected, with turnout down from 2012. The party was formed just over a year ago, and half of its candidates have little or no political experience. The result has swept aside all of the mainstream parties and gives the 39-year-old president a strong mandate in parliament to pursue his pro-EU, business-friendly reform plans. How dominant will Macron's party be? Macron's meteoric rise What are Macron's new policies? The second round of the parliamentary election was marked by weak voter turnout, estimated to be a record low of about 42%, down sharply on five years ago. Correspondents say opponents of Mr Macron may simply have not bothered to turn out. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe acknowledged the low turnout, promising his party would act for France as a whole. The comfortable majority of La RÃ©publique en Marche (Republic on the Move or LREM) and MoDem - surpassing the 289-seat threshold required to control the National Assembly - will be a big blow to traditional parties on both the left and right. The conservative Republicans and their allies could form a large opposition block, with 137 seats. But this figure is down from 200 seats in the last parliament. The Socialists, who were in power for the past five years, alongside their partners, looked set to get only 41-49 seats - their lowest tally ever. Socialist leader Jean-Claude CambadÃ©lis announced his retirement from the post, and urged the left ""to change everything, its form and its substance, its ideas and its organisation"". FN leader Marine Le Pen won a seat for the first time, but her party performed worse than expected The far-right National Front (FN) party won eight seats, but it had set its sights on 15. FN leader Marine Le Pen, 48, has won a seat in parliament for the first time, representing Henin-Beaumont, a depressed former mining town in the north. But two of her top aides, including her deputy leader, were eliminated. Ms Le Pen said President Macron may have got a large parliamentary majority, but ""he must know that his ideas are not of the majority in the country and that the French will not support a project that weakens our nation"". It has all happened so quickly that the country feels slightly dazed. People are looking at their new leader, and many more than voted for him are honestly impressed by his calibre. But many are also wondering: where do we go from here? There is an unknown aspect to the coming mandate that sets it apart from all that went before. President Macron's party didn't exist until he dreamed it up, and half of the new parliamentarians will need lessons (literally) in how to do their jobs. And never before - at least not since Charles de Gaulle in 1958 - has a head of state had such a powerful majority, made up of men and women who depend on him so personally for their new careers. Macron's conquest is complete - what now? Based on provisional results: National Front MP Gilbert Collard narrowly beat ex-bullfighter LREM candidate Marie Sara, with just 50.16% of the vote FN deputy leader Florian Philippot lost his seat in the 6th district of Moselle to LREM's Christophe Arend Ex-Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem was turfed out of her RhÃ´ne seat by Bruno Bonnell from LREM Far-left ex-presidential candidate Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon announced his victory in Marseille over LREM first-timer, Corinne Versini Manuel Valls, the unpopular Socialist ex-prime minister rejected as a candidate by both LREM and the Socialists, won a tight race for his Essonne seat, but his far-left opponent Farida Amrani is contesting the results Leading centre-right figure Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet conceded to LREM novice Gilles Le Gendre The new French president needed a majority to push through the changes that he promised in his campaign, which include: Budget savings of â¬60bn (Â£51bn; $65bn) in the next five years Cutting the number of public servants by 120,000 Reforming the labour market and generous state pension schemes, bringing them into line with private schemes The interim LREM leader, Catherine Barbaroux, said the party could now start work towards changing France: ""Far from postures, our members of parliament, through their multiple experiences, will vote for laws to unlock our economy, free up our energies, create new solidarities and protect the French,"" she said. The LREM win is big enough to give the new president a good chance of weathering the inexperience and diversity of his new political army, and to push forward with bold and controversial labour reforms, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris. Macron's economic plans At least half of LREM candidates are unknown,drawn from a range of backgrounds. Mr Macron sought gender equality in candidate selection, which resulted in a 50:50 male to female ratio. LREM candidates (from left to right): Retired bullfighter Marie Sara lost, but Rwandan refugee HervÃ© Berville and mathematician CÃ©dric Villani look set to win their seats What are Macron's policies?

'Several hurt' as van hits mosque crowd,"This video can not be played Footage shows the suspected attacker being tackled to the ground before the police arrive A terror attack near a London mosque is ""every bit as sickening"" as others in recent weeks, Theresa May says. A man drove a van into worshippers close to Muslim Welfare House in Finsbury Park as they were gathered to help an elderly man who had collapsed. He later died, but it is not clear if this was a result of the attack. Nine other people were taken to hospital. A 47-year-old man was held on suspicion of attempted murder and later further arrested over alleged terror offences. Scotland Yard said he was being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism including murder and attempted murder. Searches are also being carried out at an address in the Cardiff area. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the incident in north London was ""quite clearly an attack on Muslims"", and the community would now see more police, including armed officers, in the area, ""particularly around religious establishments"". It is the fourth terror attack in the UK in three months, after incidents in Westminster, Manchester and on London Bridge. Police said all the victims of the attack shortly after midnight were Muslim and many were believed to have just left evening prayers after breaking the Ramadan fast. Several of the injured are believed to be seriously hurt. London Ambulance Service said a number of other people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Follow live updates here What we know so far In pictures: Finsbury Park attack Welsh hire van in mosque terror attack Theresa May's statement in full Security Minister Ben Wallace said the suspect was not known to the security services, and was believed to have acted alone. The prime minister said police declared it a terrorist incident within eight minutes and a white man in his 40s was now in custody. Mrs May was speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. The prime minister and the Met Police commissioner met faith leaders at Finsbury Park Mosque ""It was an attack that once again targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives - this time British Muslims as they left a mosque having broken their fast and prayed together at this sacred time of year,"" she said. She added that ""there has been far too much tolerance of extremism over many years"". ""It is a reminder that terrorism, extremism and hatred take many forms; and our determination to tackle them must be the same whoever is responsible."" After making her statement outside Downing Street, the prime minister visited Finsbury Park Mosque, which is also close to the scene of the incident, where she held talks with faith leaders. Eyewitness Abdul Rahman told the BBC: ""When the guy came out from his van he wanted to escape, run away, and he was saying 'I want to kill Muslims. 'I want to kill Muslims.' ""I hit him on his stomach... and then me and the other guys... we held him to the ground until he couldn't move. We stopped him until the police came."" Adil Rana, 24, said ""people were punching him and beating him, which was reasonable because of what he's done"". The imam of Muslim Welfare House - which is also a community centre - said a passing police van was flagged down after the attack. Mohammed Mahmoud told reporters: ""We told them the situation - there's a man, he's restrained, he mowed down a group of people with his van and there is a mob attempting to hurt him and if you don't take him then, God forbid, he might be seriously hurt. ""We pushed people away from him until he was safely taken by police."" Toufik Kacimi, chief executive of Muslim Welfare House, said the suspect had told those holding him ""you deserve it"" and was also saying ""I did my bit"". This video can not be played Finsbury Park Imam Mohamed Mahmoud says the community in Finsbury Park is ""mild-mannered, calm"" Another witness, who gave his name as Abdul, told the BBC the suspect was shouting ""kill me, I've done my job"". Earlier, police also said the arrested man would be the ""subject of a mental health assessment in due course"". Police forensic experts have been at the scene of the attack Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""While this appears to be an attack on a particular community, like the terrible attacks in Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge it is also an assault on all our shared values of tolerance, freedom and respect."" Thee mayor has also reiterated his calls for the government to provide more funding to the Met Police. BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said it was not the first time that Muslims - and specifically visible Muslim targets, namely mosques - had been targeted in an act of terrorism in the UK. The threat from extreme right-wing groups has been growing in recent years, he said, noting that 16% of all terror arrests in the year to March were classed as ""domestic extremism"". By Cherry Wilson, BBC News Locals say this is a proudly multicultural area, where the biggest rivalry is whether you support Arsenal or their north London rivals, Tottenham. Now the mood here is one of shock, as residents stand by the police cordon seeing the aftermath of yet another attack in London. Mother-of-four Nicola Senior, 43, is walking back from taking her children to school when she stops to take in the scene. She said: ""I'm frightened. Is there going to be retaliation? ""I am fearful for my kids. Can we go to the park? Can we go to the church? It feels like this is happening all the time."" 'Everyone is on edge' after attack Forensics officers are examining a white van which has Pontyclun Van Hire on it -a firm from Rhondda Cynon Taff in south Wales. The firm said in a statement that it was ""shocked and saddened"" and co-operating with the police. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This incident risks playing right into the hands of those planning further attacks on vulnerable citizens in the UK. Online followers of the so-called Islamic State have been quick to seize on the Finsbury Park attack as proof of what they see as widespread hostility towards Muslims who live in the West. Inevitably, it will be used by recruiters and propagandists to incite further attacks - extremism breeds extremism. The one thing that far right anti-Muslim extremists and violent jihadists have in common is the belief that peaceful coexistence between Muslim and non-Muslim is impossible. The unified prayers and solidarity across communities that followed recent terror attacks are anathema to them. Extremists of both types want instead to divide society and will keep trying to bring this about by criminal acts of provocation such as this. The Muslim Council of Britain said this was the ""most violent manifestation to date"" of recent Islamophobic incidents. ""We expect the authorities to increase security outside mosques as a matter of urgency."" Mohammed Kozbar, general secretary of Finsbury Park Mosque, gave a statement on behalf of a joint faiths group. He said that ""an attack on one faith is an attack on all faith and communities"". The group has appealed for calm, adding that ""all of our efforts should be towards getting justice for the victims and ensuring our community stays the diverse, tolerant and welcome place we know it to be"". This video can not be played Abdulrahman Aidroos describes how he and others detained the suspected attacker This video can not be played Theresa May said ""hatred and evil"" will never succeed Home Secretary Amber Rudd described it as an appalling incident, and said new funding for security at religious sites had recently been arranged. ""We will make sure that we do all we can to reduce these sort of attacks,"" she added. Labour's shadow home secretary and Hackney North and Stoke Newington MPDiane Abbott said on Twitter,externalthat police ""must urgently review security for all mosques"". Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn has also visited the area, telling the BBC that ""an attack on a mosque, an attack on a synagogue, an attack on a church is actually an attack on all of us"". ""We have to protect each other's faith, each other's way of life, and that's what makes us a strong society and community."" This video can not be played Corbyn: People must be free to practise their faith Mr Corbyn attended prayers at Finsbury Park Mosque with Islington Council Leader Richard Watts. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has also been to the area, where he met residents and community leaders. Speaking to the BBC, he said it was a ""despicable attack"" which was intended to divide society, but added: ""That will fail. These perpetrators will never succeed."" Mr Javid also said he wanted to reassure Muslims around the UK that the government would ""always take a zero tolerance approach to hate crime"".

By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This incident risks playing right into the hands of those planning further attacks on vulnerable citizens in the UK. Online followers of the so-called Islamic State have been quick to seize on the Finsbury Park attack as proof of what they see as widespread hostility towards Muslims who live in the West. Inevitably, it will be used by recruiters and propagandists to incite further attacks - extremism breeds extremism. The one thing that far right anti-Muslim extremists and violent jihadists have in common is the belief that peaceful coexistence between Muslim and non-Muslim is impossible. The unified prayers and solidarity across communities that followed recent terror attacks are anathema to them. Extremists of both types want instead to divide society and will keep trying to bring this about by criminal acts of provocation such as this. The Muslim Council of Britain said this was the ""most violent manifestation to date"" of recent Islamophobic incidents.

'Several hurt' as vehicle hits pedestrians,"This video can not be played Footage shows the suspected attacker being tackled to the ground before the police arrive A terror attack near a London mosque is ""every bit as sickening"" as others in recent weeks, Theresa May says. A man drove a van into worshippers close to Muslim Welfare House in Finsbury Park as they were gathered to help an elderly man who had collapsed. He later died, but it is not clear if this was a result of the attack. Nine other people were taken to hospital. A 47-year-old man was held on suspicion of attempted murder and later further arrested over alleged terror offences. Scotland Yard said he was being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism including murder and attempted murder. Searches are also being carried out at an address in the Cardiff area. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the incident in north London was ""quite clearly an attack on Muslims"", and the community would now see more police, including armed officers, in the area, ""particularly around religious establishments"". It is the fourth terror attack in the UK in three months, after incidents in Westminster, Manchester and on London Bridge. Police said all the victims of the attack shortly after midnight were Muslim and many were believed to have just left evening prayers after breaking the Ramadan fast. Several of the injured are believed to be seriously hurt. London Ambulance Service said a number of other people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Follow live updates here What we know so far In pictures: Finsbury Park attack Welsh hire van in mosque terror attack Theresa May's statement in full Security Minister Ben Wallace said the suspect was not known to the security services, and was believed to have acted alone. The prime minister said police declared it a terrorist incident within eight minutes and a white man in his 40s was now in custody. Mrs May was speaking after chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee. The prime minister and the Met Police commissioner met faith leaders at Finsbury Park Mosque ""It was an attack that once again targeted the ordinary and the innocent going about their daily lives - this time British Muslims as they left a mosque having broken their fast and prayed together at this sacred time of year,"" she said. She added that ""there has been far too much tolerance of extremism over many years"". ""It is a reminder that terrorism, extremism and hatred take many forms; and our determination to tackle them must be the same whoever is responsible."" After making her statement outside Downing Street, the prime minister visited Finsbury Park Mosque, which is also close to the scene of the incident, where she held talks with faith leaders. Eyewitness Abdul Rahman told the BBC: ""When the guy came out from his van he wanted to escape, run away, and he was saying 'I want to kill Muslims. 'I want to kill Muslims.' ""I hit him on his stomach... and then me and the other guys... we held him to the ground until he couldn't move. We stopped him until the police came."" Adil Rana, 24, said ""people were punching him and beating him, which was reasonable because of what he's done"". The imam of Muslim Welfare House - which is also a community centre - said a passing police van was flagged down after the attack. Mohammed Mahmoud told reporters: ""We told them the situation - there's a man, he's restrained, he mowed down a group of people with his van and there is a mob attempting to hurt him and if you don't take him then, God forbid, he might be seriously hurt. ""We pushed people away from him until he was safely taken by police.""
