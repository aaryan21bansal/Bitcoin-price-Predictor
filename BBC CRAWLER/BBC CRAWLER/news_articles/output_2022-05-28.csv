Champions League agony for Liverpool as Real win,"Real Madrid are champions of Europe for a record 14th time Liverpool's bid to claim the Champions League trophy for the seventh time ended in bitter disappointment as Vinicius Jr's second-half winner gave Real Madrid victory in Paris. Jurgen Klopp's side ran into a one-man wall of defiance as Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois produced one of the great individual performances to thwart Liverpool time and again. Mohamed Salah, seeking revenge for his early departure through injury in the 2018 final against Real, was denied six times by Courtois who was simply unbeatable. The victory also sees Carlo Ancelotti make history by becoming the first coach to win a fourth Champions League title. Real were always a threat and the decisive moment came after 59 minutes when Vinicius stole in unmarked at the far post to score. This was also a final marred by chaotic scenes outside Stade de France with thousands of Liverpool fans, some targeted with pepper spray by French police, unable to get into the stadium, forcing the kick-off to be delayed by more than 30 minutes. 'A miserable night on every level imaginable' Liverpool want investigation into final scenes From embarrassment to glory - 'remarkable' Real Organisation of final 'a shambles' - Robertson This video can not be played Champions League: Liverpool will 'go again' says Jurgen Klopp Liverpool's magnificent season brought them the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup - both won on penalties against Chelsea - but ended in a double disappointment in the final week of a stellar campaign. The Champions League might have eased the agony of just missing out on the Premier League to Manchester City by one point, only for Liverpool to find themselves on the wrong end of a goalkeeping masterclass from Courtois. The Belgian was simply perfect as he was a constant thorn in Salah's side, turned Sadio Mane's shot on to the post brilliantly and commanded his penalty area with faultless handling. Salah held his head in disbelief on many occasions as Courtois manned the barricade for Real, leaving the Egyptian to nurse the pain of another Champions League final defeat by the Spanish giants. Liverpool will come again after final loss - Klopp I don't get enough respect says Real's Courtois Champions League final: Real Madrid beat Liverpool - recap Go straight to all the best Liverpool content Mohamed Salah was denied several times by Thibaut Courtois Liverpool were not quite at their best and eventually paid the price for not taking chances as Real pounced in trademark fashion to win this tournament for a record-extending 14th time. Klopp's side could not have given any more as they pushed to the final whistle but looked jaded towards the end - no surprise given the demands made of them this season. Liverpool will still take huge credit by maintaining a push for an historic quadruple until the final week of the season but the conclusion will sting. The occasion left even more of a sour taste given the events outside Stade de France. Liverpool are demanding a full investigation into how thousands of their fans could not get into the stadium, with dangerous numbers packed into small areas as kick-off approached. Real Madrid have been living by the skin of their teeth in the Champions League this season, but any side that beats Paris St- Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool to reach their goal answers every question. This is a side that knows how to get the job done, no matter how late they leave it, no matter how much the odds seem stacked against them. Real are bolstered by years of experience and quality that gives them concrete-clad self-belief that has seen them navigate their way out of so many tight situations. And what a moment for their legendary coach Ancelotti, who was brought back to the Bernabeu from Everton a year ago and has won La Liga and the Champions League on his return. Ancelotti can now lay claim to history with that fourth triumph, once again showing his mastery of managing egos and high-class players who respond to the vastly experienced Italian's promptings. He was the most relaxed man in Paris at his pre-match press conference, oozing confidence, and can now look back at two Champions League wins over Liverpool, here and for AC Milan in 2007, after losing in the so-called miracle of Istanbul in 2005. Ancelotti is one of the greats and has proved it again.

"In 30 years, I've seen too many cases like Star Hobson","Star Hobson's family have many questions about her death ""Why didn't they listen to us?"" Nearly two years after Star Hobson was murdered by her mother's girlfriend, the toddler's aunt and step-great grandfather still have so many questions. Sitting on their sofa, I look up at the photos of Star - with her large blue eyes - on the walls and the mantelpiece. The grief at her loss is so near the surface and runs so deep. They are a close-knit family who have spent most of their lives living in the same few streets. They point to the house a short distance away in West Yorkshire where Star spent some of her last months. In their search for sense, they want to know if people will learn from the mistakes made in Star's case. Sadly this is not the first time I have sat with a family as they try to understand why a child they loved was not better protected. As a journalist working for the BBC, I have spent 30 years covering such tragedies. This week, a review examined how social workers, police, health staff and others handled both Star's case and that of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, who was murdered by his stepmother in Solihull. In both cases, the review concluded that concerns raised by their wider families had been""too often disregarded"". Star's family say they tried to tell professionals they felt cut out of the toddler's life by the woman who would eventually murder her. They believed Star's mother was being abused and manipulated, and that Star had become a shadow of herself. The report concluded their worries had been labelled as malicious and not investigated properly. As I read the review, the jigsaw of each child's life is set out neatly in one place. Hindsight makes the warnings look obvious, but that is rarely the case. Child protection is a difficult, complex job and most of the time professionals do keep children safe. Also, responsibility for what happened to Star and Arthur has to lie with the people who murdered them and the parents who didn't stop the abuse. Social workers and police saw Arthur Labinjo-Hughes before his death and decided there were no safeguarding concerns But as I turn the report's pages, what I find frustrating is that the failings in the child protection system outlined are the same failings I have seen in report after report. Over the decades, poor information-sharing between agencies, manipulative parents, professionals who didn't challenge enough, and too little weight given to the concerns of wider family have all been common themes. Each time, change is promised and we are told ""lessons will be learned"". I remember the first child death I reported on in the early 1990s. The family had been ""known to social services"" for some time, as the jargon goes. The owner let us into the rented flat where the baby girl spent her short life. I can see myself standing in the empty box room where her cot had been - the sun streaming in through the window on to the white woodchip wallpaper. Her dad named her after the model of car he loved. Later, in a fit of rage, he would slam her against the wall of that tiny bedroom. Victoria Climbie's murder in 2000 led to a shake-up of the child protection system The names stay with you; somehow that feels right. Victoria Climbie was the seven-year-old whose murder in 2000 led to a complete shake-up of the child protection system. I sat through the court case. The cruelty was horrifying. Each night, I went home to my baby son and held him that bit tighter, finding it impossible to comprehend how anyone could harm a child like that. It's a reminder of how much time has passed since then that he is now grown up. I later covered the public inquiry into Victoria's death. It found the authorities involved missed 12 opportunities to protect her. Then there was the Old Bailey trial of the killers of Peter Connelly - who was also known as Baby P. A case which also led to a national outcry and major reform. And Khyra Ishaq in Birmingham in 2008 and Daniel Pelka in Coventry in 2012. Sadly, I could go on. On average, at least one child is killed or murdered each week in the UK, the NSPCC says, often at the hands of a parent or carer. That figure has changed little for decades. Not all can be protected, but when these stories make headlines, it is usually because chances to keep a child safe were missed by the authorities, whether that was social workers, police, health staff or schools. There is an important backdrop to this. In England, children's social care has been at best struggling, at worst in crisis for a long time. As far back as the Victoria Climbie case, staff shortages and high caseloads were causing problems. During the decade of austerity, council budgets were squeezed, but the number of families and children needing help increased. Now, as the cost of living crisis intensifies, more families are likely to come under pressure. And there's strong evidence that poverty and deprivationincrease the chance of a child being taken into care or put on a child protection plan. When I speak to social workers they often talk about juggling high caseloads, the complex needs of the families they see, and feeling burnt out. They also talk about how unsupported they feel, not necessarily by those they work with, but by wider society. Early help for families urged in social care reset Family worries ignored, says Arthur and Star review The turnover of social workers is significant and the latest government statistics showthe number of vacancies is at a five-year high,external. Yet on the front line, where difficult decisions are being made about the risk a child faces, you need experienced people who feel confident to challenge and investigate. The review into Star and Arthur's cases proposes new specialist child protection teams, bringing together people with a range of expertise so they can investigate and oversee cases. Also, this week the MacAlister report into children's social care called for children's services toshift their focus from crisis intervention to helping families early. The government says it will put forward its plan for change soon. So, when Star's family ask whether her death will make a difference for other children, I can't give them an answer. It really should, but that will take investment in services and determination from politicians right through to the front line of child protection over time.  And that has been promised many times before. Follow Alison onTwitter,external.

Harris calls for assault weapons ban,"This video can not be played Kamala Harris: ""An assault weapon is a weapon of war, with no place in a civil society"" US Vice-President Kamala Harris has made an impassioned plea for a ban on assault weapons in the wake of two deadly mass shootings in the US. Ms Harris was attending the funeral of Ruth Whitfield, 86, killed in a supermarket in Buffalo on 14 May. That shooting came just 10 days before an attack on a Texas primary school left 19 children and two teachers dead. Ms Harris, listing these and other attacks, said it was time to say ""enough is enough"" to gun violence. ""Everybody's got to stand up and agree that this should not be happening in our country and that we should have the courage to do something about it,"" she told the congregants at the funeral. She added that the solution was clear - and included things like background checks and an assault weapons ban. ""Do you know what an assault weapon is?"" she asked, continuing: ""It was designed for a specific purpose: to kill a lot of human beings quickly. An assault weapon is a weapon of war, with no place, no place in a civil society."" The 18-year-old gunman in Tuesday's shooting in Uvalde had two AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles, at least one of which he is reported to have bought soon after his birthday. After he was shot dead, police found as many as 1,657 rounds of ammunition and 60 magazines in his possession. A memorial to those killed in Uvalde, Texas The Buffalo, New York, shooter, also 18, had previously come into contact with authorities, but no red flags came up when he legally bought his own AR-15-style weapon. ""Why should anyone be able to buy a weapon that can kill other human beings without at least knowing, 'Hey, has that person committed a violent crime before? Are they a threat against themselves or others? That's just reasonable,"" Ms Harris said on Saturday. However, attempts to bring in universal background checks and bans on assault weapons have hit roadblocks. The issue is divisive in the US, with almost all Democrats backing stronger controls, compared to just 24% of Republicans. UVALDE REELS:Consumed by grief, a Texas town turns to prayer BUFFALO:Black Americans describe grief and fear NRA:Why is it so powerful? FACT CHECK:US gun control claims The powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby uses its substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. On Friday, former Republican PresidentDonald Trump called not for tighter gun controls, but for better protected schools. Speaking at the NRA's meeting, he said that decent Americans should be allowed firearms to defend themselves against ""evil"". The same day, it emergedpolice did not enter the classroom in Uvalde, Texas,because of the active shooter inside. Instead - as children called the emergency services begging for help - they waited 40 minutes, a decision police have now admitted was ""wrong"". US President Joe Biden is expected to make his own call for tighter gun controls during a visit to Uvalde on Sunday. On Saturday he urged Americans to ""make their voices heard"" against gun violence. By Will Grant, BBC News, Uvalde President Biden faces a challenge in striking the right balance in Uvalde. Primarily, he will be there to offer his condolences and sympathy to the victims' families. As someone who has lost children himself, he will be deeply empathetic to their loss. However, some mourning relatives do not want to see him, or any politician, amid fears their grief may be co-opted into the wider political debate on gun control. Before travelling to Uvalde, Mr Biden told students in Delaware that it was still possible to ""make America safer"" but as he seeks cross-party support for tighter gun regulations, he's in direct conflict with leading Republicans who blame the problem on issues of school security and mental health, rather than guns. As such, meaningful bipartisan co-operation looks very unlikely. Such questions, however, may well be paused for a few hours in Uvalde while he mourns the 21 victims of one of the worst school shootings in US history. Where does US gun control go from here? US gun control claims fact-checked The numbers behind the rise in US mass shootings Texas shooting response was wrong, says official Trump: US should fund safe schools before Ukraine Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs Red Sea dive-boat survivors accuse authorities of cover up Chris Mason: Political heat map flashes red over Treasury They hired Banksy for Â£50 then painted over his mural 'We sing to them': LA stables turn Noah's Ark for fire rescue animals Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution Gaza 'humanitarian zone' struck almost 100 times since May, BBC Verify finds LA fire victims fear new housing crisis Trapped in the dark for 35 hours - Red Sea dive-boat survivors tell of terrifying escapes 'Your husband's being tortured, and it's your fault' Lily and Miquita answer your questions about respect Join lifelong friends as they discuss the world around them Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

How Ukrainian refugees and their UK hosts are coping,"Tanya Sazanova and her daughter's hosts met them at the airport with a Ukrainian flag Tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees have fled the Russian invasion and are now living in the UK. But two months on, how has it been working out and are there areas of concern? More than 60,000 people fleeing Ukraine have arrived in the UK - some with family visas and others under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, which enables members of the public to host an individual or group. Latest figures show 115,000 visas have been issued. But the experience of settling into life in the UK has differed wildly for many Ukrainians. While there are many positive stories, charities have also warned of overcrowding, a lack of financial support and the risk of homelessness - particularly for people arriving on the family visa scheme that enables Ukrainians to join relatives who were already in the UK. There is a ""lot of pressure"" among Ukrainians living in the UK to bring as many relatives over as possible, according to Kate Smart, CEO of the advice charity Settled. She says this can lead to people saying yes to ""more than they can cope with"", and is something we are ""most concerned"" about. ""So people are ending up at the doors of local authorities needing homeless accommodation,"" Kate adds. She says part of the problem is that those hosting their own relatives need more financial support. Under the sponsorship scheme, hosts are entitled to a monthly Â£350 tax free payment - but people hosting family members are not. ""It's been the hardest time of our lives,"" says Natalia Korchevska, a Ukrainian woman in the UK who has opened her home to relatives fleeing the war. For the past two months she has been living in a house of nine people. Natalia and her husband welcomed her sister and family, as well as her husband's sister, to their five-bedroom house in Staffordshire. ""I know it's my family and I want to help,"" she says. ""But I want the government to help a bit more."" ""We've had no support at all,"" she says, from financial support to government guidance, since her relatives arrived on family visas. A bunkbed was donated by a local group after Natalia Korchevska's family came to the UK The communities department says people on both family and sponsorship visas have access to the same services as UK nationals, and councils are receiving Â£10,500 in funding for each arrival under the sponsorship scheme. Natalia, who works for the NHS, explains that a change allowing people who have travelled on a family visa to switch to the sponsorship scheme would really help. ""I'm frustrated and not happy, but it's my family so I will support them."" While many relationships between hosts and refugees are positive, some Ukrainians have ended up needing homeless accommodation as a result of relationships breaking down. Kate Smart from the Settled charity says she is ""getting quite a few calls about it"". And councils are ""already seeing a concerning increase in homelessness"" among those who have arrived from Ukraine, says Cllr James Jamieson, chair of the Local Government Association. In those cases, it would be best if families were ""re-matched"" with a new sponsor so they ""can rebuild their lives in their new communities,"" he says. One Ukrainian refugee who recently arrived in north-east England says she and her teenage son wereleft homeless after being manipulated by their hosts. ""I am fleeing the war and all of a sudden I am on the street,"" says the woman, 45 who fled Bucha, north of Kyiv. The mother and her 13-year-old son - whose identities are being protected - told the BBC she thought her hosts would be kind and caring, but within weeks she ""did not feel safe or secure"". More than 60,000 people have arrived in the UK from Ukraine If there is a breakdown in relationships, re-matching should be the priority, rather than temporary homeless accommodation, agrees Sara Nathan from Refugees at Home. More briefing before arrival, financial support to relatives hosting family members, and an awareness that hosts are not wholly responsible for their guests' wellbeing, are also among Sara's proposals. ""The hosts are doing a great thing by providing shelter, warmth, food and a listening ear, but they can't be 100% responsible."" The government says ""very few"" of these sponsorships are breaking down, and when they do local authorities have provided support or found a more suitable sponsor. Choosing a location in the UK can be ""tricky"" for Ukrainian refugees, according to Sara Nathan, who has hosted refugees in the past. People coming often want to live in cities or towns to avoid feeling ""isolated and lonely,"" she says. Some 93% of Ukrainian refugees are living in England and more than a third live in London,research from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows.,external. The figures, collected in April, also show that 69% would prefer to live in an urban area and 36% said London was the place in the UK they most wanted to live. Anastasia Salnikova, who is from Ukraine and volunteers helping refugees in the UK, says she would encourage people not to go to London because it can be ""a hectic and busy place"" and difficult without language skills. But people feel frightened and want a community so they ""gravitate to London"" she says. Tanya Sazanova and her daughter Sonya visited Henley with their hosts Tanya, a translator from Sumy in Ukraine - one of the first places targeted by the Russians, was in Kyiv for work on the day that war broke out, and ended up trapped there for a month. She reconnected with her daughter Sonya and they travelled to Poland where she volunteered to help refugees - before applying to come to the UK through the sponsorship scheme. Upon arrival they received lots of donations from the local community, including clothes, food parcels and a bike - and their hosts used flags to decorate their room. ""People are really lovely and kind here,"" says Tanya, adding they have received lots of welcoming messages from people on Facebook. Tanya urged people coming from eastern Ukraine, ""don't be afraid"". ""It was really scary in the first few days, but nothing like the first few days when the war started. ""I would say thank you to all the British people - from human to human, thank you."" Anastasia Salnikova says it is getting more ""difficult"" for those wanting to come to the UK to find sponsors. ""The good thing is a lot of peopleâ¦ are very willing,"" she says, adding that Facebook posts get ""lots of responses"". The first wave of people who came to the UK were generally those who escaped early and had a bit of money, but those who are only recently free from places like Bucha and Mariupol are ""in a disadvantaged situation"". More than100,000 Britons signed up as potential hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme on its first day, but since then the momentum has slowed down, Anastasia says. People are planning holidays so are less available, and others have been deterred by recent ""negative publicity"" about relationship breakdowns with hosts, she adds. Oleg Nedava and his wife were visiting their children in the UK when the war broke out Oleg Nedava, who fled from Donetsk to Kyiv in 2014 and is now a refugee in the UK, has called for more support to create hubs ""where we can all gather together to talk"". Oleg, a former Ukrainian MP, and his wife Irina were visiting their children in the UK when Russia invaded Ukraine, and have been living with one daughter in Surrey under a family visa. He describes the welcome he has received as ""beautiful"". ""It's been amazing that we've been really welcomed,"" he says. With Ukrainians searching for work in the UK, the issue of obtaining safeguarding checks for certain jobs has arisen. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, former MP Edwina Currie says a Ukrainian woman she is hosting applied for a job at her children's school. ""[She] was promptly told that because they couldn't check her [Disclosure and Barring Service] statusâ¦ she couldn't be considered for the job."" Edwina says it ""needs sorting out"" so those arriving can take work opportunities in places like schools. ""Many of the people looking for work are mothers with young children, it will suit them for example to be working in school kitchens."" Some 82% of Ukrainians arriving in the UK were female and 48% reported that they had at least one dependent child to the ONS survey conducted in April. Ukrainian refugees are able to apply for criminal records checks and guidance is offered to make the process ""more accessible"", the Home Office says. Work coaches, training programmes specialising in the hospitality and agriculture sector and language courses are among the support being offered to Ukrainian refugees, the Department for Work and Pensions adds.

Germany's Scholz wobbles on tanks for Ukraine,"The German chancellor was barracked earlier this month for sending weapons, but most criticism has focused on his hesitant response ""Liar! Warmonger!"" cried the crowd angrily as Chancellor Olaf Scholz took to the stage. Grey-haired trade unionists held signs that read ""no weapons, no war"". Usually a workers' rights demonstration in DÃ¼sseldorf would be a cosy affair for a chancellor from the centre-left Social Democrats. But these left-wing activists were outraged that his government was sending weapons to Ukraine. ""It's cynical to tell Ukrainians they should defend themselves against Putin's aggression without weapons,"" he shouted back, battling to make himself heard over the booing. However vocal, these German unionists are in a minority. Home and abroad, Mr Scholz has come under attack for not sending Ukraine enough weapons. Leading politicians from across Germany's political spectrum accuse Mr Scholz of acting as a brake on arms deliveries. Poland's President Andrzej Duda has accused Berlin of breaking its word, saying that modern German Leopard tanks, promised by Berlin to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent to Ukraine, have not arrived. Internationally there is a perception that Germany does not want to arm Ukraine. ""I don't understand why it's so complicated,"" said a frustrated Ukrainian foreign minister this week. President Volodymyr Zelensky's adviser went on social media to plead for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In reality Berlin is supplying large amounts of weapons; not as much as the US, but comparable to other European countries. Experts say Germany ranks somewhere in the middle. The German parliament has voted overwhelmingly in favour of supplying heavy weapons. Most mainstream politicians and almost all parties support the move, including Olaf Scholz's own Social Democrat SPD, his coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal FDP, as well as the conservative opposition. The far-right AfD and radical left-wing Die Linke are the only parties to object to arming Ukraine. Both are struggling in the polls and are fractured by internal spats. There have been objections to weapons deliveries in the media debate, such as a public letter written by some academics and media personalities. But none of the signatories have political influence, and few have any expertise on Russia or Ukraine. And yet, despite the consensus in the political mainstream, Mr Scholz still appears hesitant. In speeches he repeats set phrases like ""Putin must not win, Ukraine must exist"". Inexplicably he never talks about Ukraine winning the war. It isn't a tank but Germany's military is training Ukrainian soldiers on the Panzerhaubitze 2000 Unlike many leading German politicians, he still hasn't visited Kyiv since Russia's invasion, saying that going for a ""photo-op"" is pointless. This has sparked outrage in Germany, with photos shared on social media of Mr Scholz shaking hands with various dignitaries all over the world, clearly for photo-ops. On the one hand Mr Scholz pledges full support for Ukraine. On the other, the security council that he chairs hasn't signed off requests for modern Leopard or Marder tanks which suppliers say they could send and which Ukraine wants. This week Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the parliament's defence committee and defence expert for the liberal FDP, a party in Scholz's own governing coalition, said it was unacceptable that Germany was seen in the world as putting the brakes on military help for Ukraine ""simply because we're not able to communicate properly and organise ourselves"". She wants a transparent list of what Germany is delivering and better coordination, saying the chancellor ""can pull all the strings"" when it comes to arms deliveries. ""I'm trying to understand why he doesn't. Is out of conviction or because of his party?"" Certainly in polls, Social Democrat voters are some of the most likely to oppose arming Ukraine. The SPD traditionally believes peace in Europe can only be achieved by working with, not against Moscow. Some influential party figures would rather focus on a peace deal with Vladimir Putin and believe sending weapons to Ukraine might escalate the conflict. These protesters on Friday urged Mr Scholz to arm Ukraine immediately Overall the public mood is divided, febrile and changeable: A poll in March showed 63% against heavy weapons for Ukraine and only 31% in favour The same poll in April showed the reverse, with 56% supporting heavy weapons for Ukraine and 39% against At the beginning of May, in a different survey, only 46% were in favour. Either way people are confused. Until recently Mr Scholz said sending tanks would mean escalation and that Germany didn't have enough tanks to send anyway. Then he said tanks could be sent to Poland, but those don't seem to have arrived and it's not clear what the agreement was anyway. Now the message is that Berlin is sending Gepard defensive tanks directly to Ukraine, but not Leopard or Marder offensive tanks, because of a supposed informal agreement with Nato. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock (R) has visited Ukraine but the chancellor is yet to travel there Other countries don't seem to have such fraught public rows about the details of arms deliveries. But the lack of clarity is making people increasingly nervous and undermining trust in Mr Scholz's leadership. His ratings are falling and his SPD party has lost two major state elections in the last month. His aim appears to be a conciliatory middle ground of compromise to avoid escalation, understandable given Germany's traumatic war-torn 20th Century. But the danger is that by trying to keep everyone happy, Mr Scholz satisfies no-one - least of all Ukraine.

US tycoon 'in talks' with relegated Norwich City,"Mark Attanasio attended Norwich City's last match of the season at Carrow Road An American multi-millionaire businessman is understood to be in talks with Norwich City about a potential investment in the club. Mark Attanasio, the owner of Major League Baseball franchise Milwaukee Brewers, attended Sunday's season finale at Carrow Road, as reported in thePink Un,external. The Canaries have been relegated from the Premier League to the Championship. They lost5-0 to Tottenham Hotspur in their last match of the season. Mark Attanasio is the owner of Major League Baseball franchise Milwaukee Brewers In a recent interview with the club's media team, sporting director Stuart Webber hinted at some ""exciting news"" that supporters would be hearing about soon. The club's majority shareholders are chef Delia Smith and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones. Analysis by Rob Butler, BBC Radio Norfolk Norwich City supporters have long debated if new financial investment would end the yo-yo existence of a club that just cannot seem to establish itself in the Premier League. They might soon be able to find out. The fact that Mark Attanasio and his entourage travelled to Carrow Road to watch their final top flight game for some time indicates that this is much more than a passing interest. Current majority shareholders Delia Smith and Michael Wynn-Jones are now both in their 80s and it is clear a succession plan is required as a potential new era arrives at the club. In a recent interview recorded with the club's in-house media team, sporting director Stuart Webber hinted at exciting news coming for fans who had to endure a tough campaign for the Canaries. It is fair to guess a cash injection could be that tonic that lifts spirits around Carrow Road. Norwich have tried hard to stay in the so-called best league in the world with a ""self-funding"" model, is this set to be abandoned in favour of more traditional approach with a wealthier backer? Time will tell. About 200 fans showed theirfrustration at another relegation after just one seasonin the top flight by gathering outside the ground on Sunday. The defeat was the Canaries' 26th from 38 games. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

Grimsby end Wrexham's play-off dreams in thriller,"Paul Mullin's early penalty for Wrexham kick-started a play-off thriller against Grimsby Grimsby Town secured another dramatic extra-time win to shatter Wrexham's dreams of National League promotion. Paul Mullin's penalty gave Wrexham the lead but John McAtee levelled, with Luke Waterfall putting Grimsby ahead. Ben Tozer and Mullin made it 3-2 and although Ryan Taylor and Mani Dieseruvwe restored Grimsby's advantage, Jordan Davies equalised. Waterfall scored a 119th-winner for Grimsby, who had beaten Notts County in extra-time in the play-off eliminator. Grimsby will now face Solihull Moors or Chesterfield in the final at West Ham's London Stadium on Sunday, 5 June. The Mariners are now 90 minutes away from a swift return to League Two, while Wrexham's absence from the EFL will now extend to a 15th season. Wrexham boss Parkinson slams 'poor' refereeing Wrexham went into the game on the back of two defeats - being beaten at Dagenham and Redbridge on the final day of the regular National League season as they lost out to Stockport County for the title, and then losing the FA Trophy final to Bromley. Manager Phil Parkinson wanted his players to use their Wembley disappointment to inspire them against a Grimsby side buoyed by a dramatic comeback in the eliminator at Notts County, in which Dieseruvwe's goal deep in extra time secured victory. Mariners boss Paul Hurst said his side arrived at the Racecourse as underdogs, with Wrexham having finished the regular season 11 points ahead of them and losing only once at the Racecourse during the campaign. Wrexham co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney were at the Racecourse for a nail-biting afternoon Grimsby made the better start and had the ball in the back of the net after four minutes through McAtee's strike but the goal was ruled out for offside, while another attack led to a corner from which Ryan Taylor headed over the crossbar. Within a minute the home side's first meaningful attack resulted in a penalty after Mullin was brought down by former Dragons defender Waterfall. Wrexham's top scorer - who hit 26 league goals during the regular campaign - blasted his kick info the roof of the net past Max Crocombe. But amid home fans' celebrations, Grimsby responded immediately as out of nowhere McAtee's stunning 25-yard shot levelled the scores. There was no let-up in the game as a shot from Dragons full-back Bryce Hosannah was turned away by Crocombe, while Mullin had a goal disallowed during a good spell for the home side. Crocombe also made a fine save when the ball deflected off the head of his own defender, Andy Smith, while Wrexham appeals for another penalty for a foul on Hosannah fell on deaf ears. Grimsby came out at the start of the second half in a similar vein to how they had begun the game, as McAtee forced Christian Dibble into saving with his legs before the keeper had to be at full stretch to deny Harry Clifton. The visitors continued to press and a cross from the right was met by Waterfall at the far post for his eighth goal of the season. Hurst's men had looked far more composed than their hosts and the more likely to score with chances for Clifton, Ben Fox and Danny Amos. The game was to turn on its head with two goals in a space of a minute which saw Wrexham regain the lead. From Luke Young's corner, Tozer headed home at the far post to bring the home side level and two minutes later Mullin netted following Ollie Palmer's flick-on. Just at it seemed Wrexham were on top, Grimsby once again hit back with Taylor's diving header making it 3-3, before substitute semi-final hero Dieseruvwe's header put them in front. But another twist in the tale saw Davies head home Young's corner for the home side and despite chances for Palmer and Callum McFadzean, the game went into extra time. Both teams toiled during a tense extra time, which saw Grimsby substitute Tristan Abrahams firing into the side netting before Waterfall's header from Jordan Cropper's throw-in won it for Hurst's men. Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson said: ""Myself and the staff and the players are hurting because we've conceded goals we shouldn't have conceded. ""It was always going to be a battle in terms of Waterfall and the set plays, we know how strong he is. That cost us today. ""I felt we'd we'd win today and I felt few things have gone against us to stop that.""

Can teaching black history help curb racism?,"Onyx Uwandulu says often schools are not able to provide a catered approach because they do not understand the experience of minorities A generation could be changed with the right education and representation in schools, a woman who felt ""traumatised"" by her school days has said. Onyx Uwandulu, 21, said schools were not equipped to deal with incidents of racism and focused only on violent black history. In September,Wales' new curriculumwill come into play, which includes mandatory diverse teaching. A Welsh government spokesman said Wales was ""leading the way"". Last week, Raheem Bailey, 11,lost a finger after reportedly running from bullies, who his mother said were racially and physically abusing him. Onyx, an actress and performer from south Wales who grew up in the next county over from Raheem, said an inclusive education would ""save lives"" and create an environment where people of colour could achieve more. Schools told to improve BAME history teaching Schools told to tackle racism and bullying Announced in 2021,the changes to the curriculummean Wales is the first UK nation to have compulsory education about racism and the contributions of figures from Black, Asian and other ethnic minorities. Launching in September in primary schools before being rolled out in secondary schools in 2023, it is based on six ""areas of learning and experience"" and does not set out exactly what schools should be teaching. However, the changes mean all areas will need to reflect the diverse experiences and contributions in history. Afterthe murder of George Floyd by a US police officer in 2020, there were calls for greater recognition of Wales' role in colonialism and slavery to be taught in schools. Onyx says she did not realise the micro-aggressive racism she faced in school until she had left Onyx makes no secret how her school days were ""the worst of my life"". ""I entered a very confident, outgoing child and then my first week I was assaulted and called a racial slur and that set the tone for my entire school run and it was kind of one of those situations where I didn't realise how bad it was until I left."" She said not only were some students overtly racist, she also experienced racist micro-aggressions - indirect, subtle or unintentional discrimination - which she said she, and many teachers, did not have the vocabulary to deal with. ""Just little things like walking into a classroom and people wanting to pet your hair like a dog and I kind of had to sit there and take it and I didn't see it as a problem, but it also made me feel icky."" More formally, she said in her experience and that of others she has spoken to, the only black history taught to her was slavery and then the civil rights movement for her GCSEs. This video can not be played Natalie Jones says teaching did not seem like a possible career choice because she ânever saw a black teacherâ She said on some occasions she was shown the programme Roots, which is violent and uses graphic racist language, with no context and that students and teachers were uncomfortable and some laughed. ""Of course, they're things that are absolutely valuable to learn,"" she said. ""Everybody needs to know the awful things black people have gone through through history that should never be erased. ""However, what we learn is a very sanitised version and that being the only thing is completely detrimental. It's how bias and stereotypes are perpetuated."" She said diverse historical figures ""shouldn't be tokenised"" in education and time should be spent exploring how society has developed. Now 21, Onyx says she can reflect on school experiences differently While young people now have more access to resources online, it does not mean their experience is different and meant they could be more at risk, she said, particularly to the response of the Black Lives Matter movement online. As well as a diverse curriculum, Onyx said it was equally important that children see themselves reflected in authority figures to prevent children from ethnic minorities becoming demotivated and underachieving compared to their peers. ""My whole entire education right from nursery up to college I've never had a black teacher. ""Being in a classroom full of people that don't look like you - the people that you're supposed to look up to - you don't believe that those things are possible for you and you don't see yourself in all of these different careers."" Donna Ali says the curriculum could make a big difference but young people need support to deal with the pushback Quite a lot, according to Donna Ali, who last year co-founded BE.Xcellence, which identifies opportunities to support the aims of the Welsh government'santi-racism action plan,external. The businesswoman and campaigner from Cardiff said the organisation had been working to build tools for schools to try and support children in early education. She said more UK and Welsh focus on diverse histories would mean that, when children are forming their own opinions, any negative home or societal influence can be counteracted with education. She added the Welsh government have consulted and developed tools with people from black, Asian and other ethnic groups not just ""taken from off the shelf"". ""We need to prepare our young people pupils for global citizenship, not a local citizenship. ""It's so important because, even if you don't have any diversity within the community, you still need to be prepared for the wider world."" This video can not be played Raheem lost a finger running from bullies after racial abuse, says his mother Ms Ali, who has one parent from Bangladesh and one from Africa, ""struggled with identity for many years"". She said Black Lives Matter was a turning point for prominent black figures and conversations around racism and ""a moment to stop and listen"". She added it gave people confidence to have conversations about racism but children from diverse backgrounds were unprepared to answer questions directed at them in the aftermath so there needed to be support for young people ""to deal with pushback"". This video can not be played Natera Morris says some of the comments on social media have made her question how her friends feel about her The Welsh government said: ""The curriculum is designed to inspire learners to become ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world, including helping young people to understand and respect their own and each other's cultures and traditions. ""It is vital that we increase the diversity of our teaching workforce to better support our learners."" They said a recentaction plan,externalaimed to improve the diversity of the workforce, including financial incentives to recruit more diverse teachers.

Travel disruption as half-term getaway begins,"This video can not be played WATCH: Lengthy queues fill London St Pancras station Airlines have cancelled dozens of flights as travel disruption affects the half-term getaway for many. EasyJet and Tui apologised and blamed a number of issues including air traffic restrictions and runway works for axing the flights. Meanwhile, people were urged to check the latest advice before travelling to the Port of Dover due to ""extremely busy"" roads. Long queues have also been seen at London's St Pancras station. The station - home to Eurostar services - was exceptionally busy on Saturday with slow-moving queues stretching outside the building. Families heading to Disneyland Paris and football fans going to Paris for the Champions League final were among those travelling on train services across the Channel on Saturday. The coastguard has been handing out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue at the port of Dover Earlier this week, EasyJet confirmed its plans to cancel 240 flights at airports across the UK over the next 10 days. The airline said about 24 flights a day from London's Gatwick airport would be cancelled between 28 May and 6 June. 'We were on the plane when our flight was cancelled' One passenger who spoke to the BBC said his EasyJet flight on Tuesday had been cancelled - but the earliest alternative flight offered by the airline was almost a week later on 6 June. And Tui passengers in Manchester and Birmingham said they were still waiting to fly to Dalaman, in Turkey, on Saturday - a day after their flight was due to depart. Tracey and her two sons had to watch the funeral on a Zoom call A woman has described how her family missed her father's funeral because their flight was cancelled by EasyJet minutes before departure. Tracey was booked to fly from Geneva to Bristol with her two sons to attend her father David Dane's funeral. Their flight was one of about 200the airline cancelledat short notice on 26 May. ""My problem isn't that the flight was cancelled,"" she said. ""It was the fact that there was no one to deal with the situation, this meant I had to watch my dad's funeral from a hotel room."" Read Tracey's story here On Thursday, a software failureforced EasyJet to cancel about 200 flights. The issue affected airports across the UK. EasyJet said the latest cancellations were unrelated to the IT issue, which is now resolved. It said a range of issues affected its operations and contributed to the cancellations, including air traffic control restrictions, runway works and airport handling delays. The airline will still be operating around 1,700 flights per day over the next week, it said. When a flight is cancelled fewer than seven days before the scheduled departure, airlines are obliged to inform those affected of their rights, and: offer to place them on an alternative flight - including on other airlines - to fly as soon as possible provide a full refund for parts of the ticket not used If a flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, passengers may be entitled to additional compensation payments depending on the timings of any alternative flights: Â£220 for flights under 1,500km such as Glasgow to Amsterdam Â£350 for flights 1,500km to 3,500km such as East Midlands to Marrakesh Passengers who receive little or no notice about their cancelled flight, and ultimately arrive much later at their destination, may be entitled to extra compensation payments. Airlines are also expected to provide refreshments and accommodation as required while their customers await their new flight - or reimburse reasonable costs later on. People on affected package holidays booked throughmembers of Abta,externalhave the right to alternative arrangements at no extra cost or a full refund without delay. Full details of the Civil Aviation Authority rules arehere,external. A helpful guide from Which? consumer magazine ishere,external. Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? magazine, urged holidaymakers to take out travel insurance when they book, rather than before they travel to best protect themselves.""The problems that airlines are suffering are not easy to fix,"" he told the BBC, saying disruption was likely to continue into summer. In addition to Friday's delays, Tui cancelled six flights from Birmingham, Manchester and London Gatwick on Saturday morning. The cancellations were due to ""a combination of factors"" and refreshments and hotel accommodation would be provided, the company said. It also added that those whose flight was cancelled would be contacted directly and would receive a full refund within 14 days. Around 8,000 flights are expected to depart from UK airports over the weekend. Gatwick Airport said it expected 700 flights and 110,000 passengers on Saturday alone. Meanwhile, motoring organisation the RAC warned of congestion on the roads and said drivers were planning an estimated 17.8 million leisure trips between Friday and Sunday. Saturday is expected to be the busiest day. The Kent Resilience Forum said around 750 lorries were queuing near Dover on Saturday morning - though tourists are being prioritised. The coastguard has handed out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue. Passengers have faced delays and cancellations at airports in recent months following the easing of Covid restrictions on international travel. The travel industry cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but as demand for flights has returned, it has struggled to recruit staff, carry out security checks and train new workers quickly.

LiveLivePutin urged to hold 'serious negotiations' with Zelensky32 minutes ago,"President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a rare trip outside Kyiv - visiting troops on the front line in Kharkiv region His office said he had thanked troops for defending the country Russians have attacked Kharkiv city again - weeks after being pushed away by Ukrainian troops Mr Zelensky has described the situation in parts of Kharkiv region as ""indescribably difficult"" for the Ukrainian army The Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai says civilians have been killed in Severodonetsk, with buildings destroyed in the key eastern city Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine Andrei Kelin also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"" Meanwhile, heavy fighting is continuing near Severodonetsk in Luhansk Region, the General Staff of Ukraineâs Armed forces said Edited by Jeremy Gahagan And here we come to the end of today's live coverage. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system
against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area â a weapon described as a giant
flamethrower. That is what a Russian security official told the state-run
Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the
area of oxygen. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of
Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1
Solntsepyok (âBlazing Sunâ) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where
Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment. TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six
miles). The TOS-2âs manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer
range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis. TOS-2 artillery on display - the system was first deployed last year Hugo BachegaReporting from Zaporizhzhia It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He
visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraineâs second city, handed out
awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service. âYouâre risking your life for all of us and our state,â he
said. âThank you for defending Ukraineâs independence. Take care!â The visit was a demonstration of the countryâs success in
pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost
morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas
area further east. An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and
destruction. Hours after the president left, loud explosions were
reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces
there may have subsided, but itâs not entirely gone. James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House Ukraineâs capital is 1,540
years old this weekend, and youâd be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasnât in the mood
to celebrate. After all, itâs just over
three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some
predicting it would fall within 72 hours. At the time, I remember
standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was
outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry. Today it's a different
scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter
as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned
last week; and you canât help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket.
Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter. âLife really goes on and we do not stop,â says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. âWe hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alrightâ. Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. âI can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it wonât be the sameâ she admits. âI donât have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.â For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022. Soprano for the National Opera of Ukraine Olga Fomichova Joe InwoodBBC News, Kyiv Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out
to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian
Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight. Now,
he is compared to Winston Churchill. His
steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as
being a crucial factor in his countryâs remarkable performance in the beginning
of this war. His
defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical
middle finger to Russia and its president. While
President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their
shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long
table, his officials barely in shouting distance. As
effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital.
Todayâs visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since
the start of Russiaâs invasion. He
met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians,
almost pushing them back to the international border. The
fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in
Ukraineâs second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never
have been possible. But,
do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much
appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to
retreat in the Donbas. With
its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war.
Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be
decided. Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said. ""'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents,"" he wrote in a tweet. The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added. Allowing Russia to win would ""open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."" Podolyak went on to say: ""Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations. ""Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."" Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia. Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall. Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head ofKherson's Moscow-installed administration, says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed. According to Reuters news agency, he says: ""We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite
is planned, but it wonât be today and it wonât be tomorrow
because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson
region."" Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide. But the UK Ministry of Defence said,in an intelligence update in April,external, a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine. And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating ""pseudo-republics"" throughout the country. He has advised peoplenot to give the Russian authorities any personal data, such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes. More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv. He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts. It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Here are some more pictures of his visit. Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says. Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state,"" the president told troops. The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations
were not at the ""expected level"" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance. ""For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic
of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which
support terrorism entering Nato,"" the president said. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria. What is Nato and how can Finland and Sweden join? If you're just joining us, here is a brief recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed.Russia's ambassador to the UK says his country will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine  Russian forces continue assault in eastern Ukraine As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the
city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself
surrounded. Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk. What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine. It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next. Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russiaâs existence was threatened. The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"". Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerouseyewitness accounts from residents, who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.

Chelsea sale to be completed on Monday,"Chelsea won the Premier League five times and the Champions League twice during Abramovich's ownership The Chelsea sale is expected to be completed on Monday after a ""final and definitive agreement"" was reached with the consortium led by Todd Boehly. The Premier League and UK government have approved the Â£4.25bn takeover. Chelsea were put up for sale in March before owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The club have been operating under a special government licence which expires on 31 May. ""Chelsea Football Club can confirm that a final and definitive agreement was entered into last night to sell the club to the Todd Boehly/Clearlake Capital consortium,"" Chelsea said in a statement on Saturday. Abramovich, who bought Chelsea in 2003, said he was ""pleased this search has now come to a successful conclusion"". He added: ""As I hand over Chelsea to its new custodians, I would like to wish them the best of success, both on and off the pitch. ""It has been an honour of a lifetime to be a part of this club - I would like to thank all the club's past and current players, staff, and of course fans for these incredible years."" Who are key people behind Boehly consortium? What are the pressing issues for the Chelsea's new owners? Although the consortium is led by Boehly, Californian private equity firm Clearlake Capital would own a majority of the shares. Other investors include US billionaire Mark Walter, a co-owner of the LA Dodgers with Boehly, and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. It is understood the new owners have""big ambitions""in the transfer market as they seek to close the gap on Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. On Tuesday the Premier League said the consortium had passed its owners' and directors' test. On Wednesday the UK government said it had ""reached a position where we could issue a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea"". The Chelsea Supporters' Trust said: ""The CST has been very encouraged by the interactions we have had with Mr Boehly and his team over recent months, but the hard work starts now. ""It is now time to deliver both on and off the pitch in building a successful, inclusive and forward-thinking club with supporters at the forefront."" Several parties expressed an interest, but Chelsea agreed to sell to the Boehly-led consortium this month. The government does not want Abramovich to receive any of the proceeds from the sale, which will instead go into a frozen bank account to be donated to charity. The government says it is now ""satisfied that the full proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or any other sanctioned individual"" and the proceeds will be used for ""humanitarian causes in Ukraine, supporting victims of the war"". Chelsea finished third in the Premier League, lost the Carabao Cup and FA Cup finals to Liverpool on penalties and reached the Champions League quarter-finals. Abramovich bought Chelsea for Â£140m 19 years ago. Under his ownership, the club have won every major trophy - two Champions League titles, five Premier Leagues, five FA Cups, two Europa League titles and three EFL Cups. In August 2021 they won the Uefa Super Cup and in February their first Club World Cup. Abramovich has appointed 13 managers and the club have spent more than Â£2bn in the transfer market under his ownership. Chelsea's women's team, who became affiliated to Chelsea FC in 2004, have won five Women's Super League titles and four FA Cups under Abramovich. ""The ownership of this club comes with great responsibility,"" said Abramovich. ""Since I came to Chelsea nearly 20 years ago, I have witnessed first hand what this club can achieve. ""My goal has been to ensure that the next owner has a mindset that will enable success for the men's and women's team, as well as the will and drive to continue developing other key aspects of the club, such as the academy and the vital work of Chelsea Foundation."" 24 February:Russia invades Ukraine 26 February:Abramovichgives ""stewardship and care""of club to charitable foundation 2 March:Abramovichsays he plans to sell the club 10 March:The UK governmentsanctions Abramovich 5 May:Abramovichdenies he has requesteda Â£1.5bn loan he made to Chelsea is repaid 7 May:Boehlyagrees a Â£4.25bn dealfor the club 16 May:Government insider says thedeal is close to collapse 24 May:Premier Leagueapproves takeover 25 May:Governmentapproves takeover Our coverage of Chelsea is bigger and better than ever before - here'severything you need to knowto make sure you never miss a moment Everything Chelsea - go straight to all the best content BBC Sport Premier League Chelsea official site Australian Open: GB's Draper fighting in fifth set v Kokkinakis after Fearnley wins Transfers,  Premier League build-up and football latest New Match of the Day presenters announced A pregnant young woman is in crisis, but is it all a scam?

"Tens of thousands at NI centennial paradeOrange Order grand secretary says there's ""no interest in becoming part of an all-Ireland"".Northern Ireland","The parade leaves the grounds of Stormont, heading for the city centre About 100,000 people have watched an Orange Order parade to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, the chief constable has said. Some 25,000 people took part, amid a huge policing operation in Belfast. Before the parade started, Orange Order Grand Secretary, the Rev Mervyn Gibson, rejected any change to Northern Ireland's position within the UK. He said Northern Ireland has ""no interest in becoming part of an all-Ireland - save your breath"". The parade, which led to traffic restrictions in many areas of the city, ended on Saturday evening. Bands converged in the city centre on Saturday afternoon The march from Stormont to Belfast City Hall was postponed last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Itstarted at Stormont,externalat 13:00 BST before heading down the Newtownards Road, over Queen's Bridge and on to City Hall. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne said months of planning had gone into Saturday's operation with 500 officers on duty, mostly across Belfast. ""This is quite a significant policing operation,"" he said. This video can not be played 'British we are and British we'll stay' - centennial parade is told ""This is slightly unique because of the traffic disruption over the length of journey, but what we see here today is a blueprint for what could be a busy summer. ""But we're really optimistic about a family fun day and a celebration of the past."" People gathered to listen to speeches and music on the lawn at Stormont People started gathering at Stormont from about 10:00 with speeches beginning at noon in front of Parliament Buildings. Addressing the crowd at Stormont, the Rev Gibson said that ""it doesn't matter what you promise or offer [in a united Ireland], it doesn't matter if every day was the 12th of July"". ""If it's not under the Union Jack then count us out,"" he said. ""British we are and British we'll stay."" However, he warned thatthe Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit trade deal, was a threat to the union. ""No fundamental change to the protocol, then no functioning assembly,"" he said. ""Because let me make clear if the protocol is not sorted then make no mistake - no mistake - there will be no next 100 years for Northern Ireland."" Allow Twitter content?

The Rev Gibson ended his speech by saying: ""And the cry to those who seek to persuade us or push us into a united Ireland is still the same: 'no surrender'."" He added that he wants to see a Northern Ireland that is ""financially stable, where there is truly equality of opportunity for all, equality in education, an effective and efficient health service, where culture and heritage are celebrated and respected"". How was Northern Ireland's centenary year marked? Grand Master Edward Stevenson said that unionists ""are fully justified in not only commemorating, but proudly celebrating, this anniversary"". About 25,000 are thought to be taking part in the parade He added that ""disappointingly but predictably, throughout 2021 there were those who told us that there is nothing to celebrate"". ""Rather than a celebration they repeatedly downplayed the anniversary and all it stood for,"" he added. ""Regrettably, even our own UK government did little - despite much encouragement by this organisation and others - to ensure that the centenary was marked in a fitting way."" Orange Order NI Centennial parade in pictures About 130 bands were involved in the parade from the Orange Order, the Royal Black Institution, the Apprentice Boys of Derry, and the Independent Orange Order. The new parliament was officially opened by King George V on 22 June 1921 It was warmer than expected, and took much longer than anticipated, but the parade organisers went home content. There was plenty of heat too from the platform at Stormont. As expected, a united Ireland was rejected, in robust terms. However, it was said in front of Parliament Buildings, where Sinn FÃ©in is now the largest party, for the first time in Northern Ireland's 101 year history. Overall, unionists still have more seats, but only two more. Just like in 1921, politics in Belfast has entered an important phase. Translink had advised travellers to allow extra time for their journeys with road closures and diversions in place. The management of several city centre businesses also said they wouldthey will close for part of the day. Castle Court shopping centre closed two hours early at 16:00 and Victoria Square's opening hours on Saturday were 09:00 to 14:00, although individual retailers may have had different opening hours. Drone footage shows the participants in the grounds of Stormont Kieran Sloan, the owner of Sawers deli on College Street, told BBC News NI that staff getting home was his key consideration for remaining closed all day on Saturday. Belfast retailers to close early ahead of parade How was Northern Ireland's centenary year marked? ""Everyone will be out for the parade but not necessarily to do any shopping,"" he added. Spectators lined the streets of Belfast as the parade made its way along the route Mr Henning said it was always the intent of the Orange Order that the event should benefit the city of Belfast, its shops and its people. ""We know for a fact that you can hardly get a room in the city over the weekend,"" he added.

""But we're really optimistic about a family fun day and a celebration of the past."" People gathered to listen to speeches and music on the lawn at Stormont People started gathering at Stormont from about 10:00 with speeches beginning at noon in front of Parliament Buildings. Addressing the crowd at Stormont, the Rev Gibson said that ""it doesn't matter what you promise or offer [in a united Ireland], it doesn't matter if every day was the 12th of July"". ""If it's not under the Union Jack then count us out,"" he said. ""British we are and British we'll stay."" However, he warned thatthe Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit trade deal, was a threat to the union. ""No fundamental change to the protocol, then no functioning assembly,"" he said. ""Because let me make clear if the protocol is not sorted then make no mistake - no mistake - there will be no next 100 years for Northern Ireland."" Allow Twitter content?

The Rev Gibson ended his speech by saying: ""And the cry to those who seek to persuade us or push us into a united Ireland is still the same: 'no surrender'."" He added that he wants to see a Northern Ireland that is ""financially stable, where there is truly equality of opportunity for all, equality in education, an effective and efficient health service, where culture and heritage are celebrated and respected"". How was Northern Ireland's centenary year marked? Grand Master Edward Stevenson said that unionists ""are fully justified in not only commemorating, but proudly celebrating, this anniversary"". About 25,000 are thought to be taking part in the parade He added that ""disappointingly but predictably, throughout 2021 there were those who told us that there is nothing to celebrate"". ""Rather than a celebration they repeatedly downplayed the anniversary and all it stood for,"" he added. ""Regrettably, even our own UK government did little - despite much encouragement by this organisation and others - to ensure that the centenary was marked in a fitting way."" Orange Order NI Centennial parade in pictures About 130 bands were involved in the parade from the Orange Order, the Royal Black Institution, the Apprentice Boys of Derry, and the Independent Orange Order. The new parliament was officially opened by King George V on 22 June 1921 It was warmer than expected, and took much longer than anticipated, but the parade organisers went home content. There was plenty of heat too from the platform at Stormont. As expected, a united Ireland was rejected, in robust terms. However, it was said in front of Parliament Buildings, where Sinn FÃ©in is now the largest party, for the first time in Northern Ireland's 101 year history. Overall, unionists still have more seats, but only two more. Just like in 1921, politics in Belfast has entered an important phase. Translink had advised travellers to allow extra time for their journeys with road closures and diversions in place. The management of several city centre businesses also said they wouldthey will close for part of the day. Castle Court shopping centre closed two hours early at 16:00 and Victoria Square's opening hours on Saturday were 09:00 to 14:00, although individual retailers may have had different opening hours. Drone footage shows the participants in the grounds of Stormont Kieran Sloan, the owner of Sawers deli on College Street, told BBC News NI that staff getting home was his key consideration for remaining closed all day on Saturday. Belfast retailers to close early ahead of parade How was Northern Ireland's centenary year marked? ""Everyone will be out for the parade but not necessarily to do any shopping,"" he added. Spectators lined the streets of Belfast as the parade made its way along the route Mr Henning said it was always the intent of the Orange Order that the event should benefit the city of Belfast, its shops and its people. ""We know for a fact that you can hardly get a room in the city over the weekend,"" he added.

"Mayor flies 9,200 miles for TED talk on climateClimate campaigners question Marvin Rees' decision to fly to Vancouver to attend a conference.","Marvin Rees flew nines hours to appear at a TED conference where he gave a 14-minute talk about ways to cut carbon emissions The UK's first city mayor to declare a climate crisis has been questioned for flying nine hours to attend a conference to urge leaders to cut CO2. Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees told theTED conference,externalin Canada that city mayors could influence carbon policy. Climate campaigners Flight Free UK calculated the trip created 2.016 tonnes (2,016kg) of CO2 per passenger and was at odds with his message. The mayor's office said he had a full agenda with networking opportunities. A spokesman said the mayor was invited at the expense of the TED organisation as a speaker to share ideas and help change attitudes. His office said: ""He has been clear - the fight against climate change will be won or lost in cities, which generate three-quarters of global carbon emissions. ""And it is therefore the duty of city leaders to come together, lobby for change and influence each other to make a collective impact. ""The mayor's visit to Vancouver was not just to deliver the talk. He had a full agenda,"" the spokesman added - and said the conference offered him the chance to network with other influential speakers and attract future funding and inward investment too. Flight Free UK said Mr Rees flew some 4,600 miles (7,402km) each way in April to attend the annual TED conference held in Vancouver that he could have appeared at virtually. During his talk Mr Rees pointed to some of the action taken to tackle climate change in Bristol Flight Free UK director Anna Hughes, said: ""Bristol was the first place in the UK to declare a climate emergency, yet the mayor is acting completely at odds with this declaration. ""Faced with such a precarious climate situation, we need our leaders to demonstrate the kind of action we should all be taking, not flying to another continent to speak, ironically, about the climate emergency. ""Actions always speak louder than words, and in this post-pandemic age of online interactions, it would have been a much more powerful and effective statement to appear on screen."" Mr Rees gave the speech, which is available to watch online, a month before Bristol voted toabolish the position of elected mayor, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid. He said city mayors around the world were ""stepping up and taking action"" on cutting carbon emissions. ""I believe there's huge hope in our cities,"" Mr Rees said. ""Cities are responsible for around 75% of CO2 emissions, and we're also prodigious emitters of nitrogen dioxide and methane. And cities consume 80% of the world's energy. ""But it's the characteristics of cities - their reach, size, density, close proximity of the leadership to the people, their adaptability, and their capacity for reinvention - that mean we can actually plan to manage those numbers."" Mr Rees said efficient cities could be one of the most effective tools we have against climate change He said: ""While I have the stage, let me show off about my own city, Bristol. ""We're delivering net-zero homes at higher density on old industrial land in the middle of the city. ""This allows us to relieve pressure on urban sprawl, design in active travel and design out car dependency. ""Across our public housing stock, we're replacing bathrooms and replacing fittings with more water-efficient showers, sinks, taps, and toilets."" Mr Rees concluded: ""Efficient cities could be one of the most effective tools we have."" But Green councillors in Bristol criticised recent decisions in the city to remove bicycle lanes, and said more action was needed locally. Shadow cabinet member for climate and ecology, Katy Grant, called for a roadmap for how Bristol could reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030. ""The mayor is right to identify cities across the globe as crucial sites of efficiency, scale, innovation and impact when it comes to fighting the climate crisis,"" she said.

Jubilee fund to help revamp English village hallsThe government hopes the repairs fund will help create a jubilee legacy for villages in England.,"Halls like this one in Knodishall, Suffolk, typically provide a focal point for different aspects of village life Village halls in need of a facelift can apply to share a Â£3m fund marking the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The money will be divided between 125 halls in England to pay for renovations like wi-fi, building extensions and modernising facilities. Rural affairs minister Lord Benyon described the venues as ""the centrepiece of rural life"". The aim is to build on schemes that helped commemorate Queen Victoria and King George V. Three years ago 125 villages halls in England benefitted from Â£17m of government cash with other sources for renovations. Queen at Balmoral ahead of jubilee celebrations When's the four-day Jubilee bank holiday? Lord Benyon said of the support the halls offer: ""In a changing world, they are important facilities for community groups, social clubs and local services. ""This funding [from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] will ensure they are central to the fabric of our villages for many more years to come."" Villages halls are used for a wide variety of events, including as polling stations at election time Charity Action with Communities in Rural England (Acre) said the 10,000 village halls across England are often the only place people can socialise locally, and refurbishments would help safeguard their futures. Many of the volunteer-led halls are concerned about the rising cost of energy bills and need support to adopt more affordable heating and energy efficiency measures. Acre chair David Emerson said: ""This is an announcement that is especially appropriate in the week that thousands of halls across the country are hosting local celebrations of the royal jubilee."" Margaret Clark, chairwoman of the Rural Coalition, said the venues ""have a crucial role to play in helping levelling up in rural areas"". The Platinum Jubilee Village Halls Improvement Grant Fund follows a tradition of investments being made in village halls for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 and King George V's Silver Jubilee in 1935.

A Texas town turns to prayer,"Bible in hand as he approached the stage, Pastor Tony Gruben looked out onto a sea of shattered faces and paused. On Wednesday, less than 24 hours after one of America's deadliest school shootings, he admitted that he too, felt lost. ""I wanted to hope this was all a nightmare. I have no answers,"" he told a packed arena typically reserved for rodeos. ""But when the morning breaks, God is there."" As he spoke, neighbours clutched one another - too lost in their grief to really care about the news cameras nearby broadcasting their pain. Instead, they prayed for healing. They prayed for understanding. But most of all, they prayed for the souls of the 21 lives stolen from their community when an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School. Among the dead were 19 children between the ages of seven and 10. Who were the victims? Before last week, few could locate Uvalde, a small town of about 15,000 nestled between San Antonio and the US-Mexico border at the base of the Texas Hill Country. Now, its name has been added to a grim, yet growing, list of gun massacres in the United States. And as the world grasps for answers, the people here cling to their faith. ""We may not understand what happened here yesterday, but we seek the Lord, as best we can,"" another minister said. American flags, welcome signs and large crosses decorate front yards here. It's the kind of place where folks stop to help this journalist with a flat tyre, not caring how late they'll be to dinner, ""because that's what I would want someone to do for my daughter"". And it's a town full of people willing to offer a half-smile, even in the midst of their grief. Communities torn apart by mass shootings are often reduced to just a name: Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland. But where trauma transforms some into activists, the Uvalde community has turned inward. As she left a mid-day mass on Thursday, Irma Fuentes told the BBC she had spent the morning crying until she came to church. She said she prayed for the souls of the 19 children who were killed - and also for the soul of ""that boy"" who caused her community so much pain. Irma prays for her community ""The little girl that they found yesterday was my neighbour's granddaughter,"" she said, adding another neighbour's grandchild was still suffering from injuries in a San Antonio hospital. ""I'm going home now to be with them."" But while everyone knows someone who lost a loved one in the shooting, it seems no one really knew the boy who pulled the trigger. Salvador Ramos bought two rifles a week before the shooting, authorities have said. Texas shooting response was 'wrong', says official Classmates like Ivan Arrellano who, despite having shared classes and conversations with Ramos since they were 12 years old back in eighth grade, couldn't show you a school photo of him because ""he was never present for stuff like that."" Mickey Craddock lives just three doors down from the home where the rampage began after the gunman shot his grandmother. She always thought of him as a ""regular teenage kid"". She'd sometimes see him play basketball, and heard rumours about his unstable relationship with his mother. A mother holds up a photo of her child at the vigil ""He was a troubled kid, and I could probably point out five or six of them in this community,"" Ms Craddock said. ""People from bad backgrounds, drug backgrounds, you know, but we never thought anything like this would happen."" Some media reports have painted the gunman as a bullied and isolated teen, but Mr Arrellano said his experience was different. ""He was not a victim of bullying. He would try to scare people and I guess this was his last way to scare people,"" he said. We met 18-year-old Arellano two days before he was supposed to graduate high school. Now, because of the shooting, that milestone has been postponed, leaving the teenager to reflect on what he could have done. ""We knew he wasn't mentally healthyâ¦ we probably should've said something."" The morning after the shooting, the town was so silent you could hear a rooster crowing from blocks away. Standing in her yard, Sandra Parra looked down the street towards Robb Elementary. On any other weekday, she'd overhear the voices of small children as they walked past her home towards the school. Sometimes there'd be singing, sometimes there'd be shouting, but there was always proof of life. Monique holds son Joaquin close There was none of that Wednesday morning. Instead, her view of the school was obstructed by the hordes of media that swarmed the area - blocking roads and stomping through her neighbours' yards. ""The normality is not here anymore,"" Parra said. ""They didn't deserve it and I just don't understand what happened."" Politicians and pundits have already rebooted a familiar playbook: reducing the town's trauma to a talking point about mental health and gun control. Where does debate over US guns go now? America's gun culture in charts But all of that is not up for debate in Uvalde - at least not right now. On the day after the attack, once the initial shock of the shooting had passed, children returned to the school. Instead of backpacks and homework, they came bearing candles and flowers for classmates and friends they'd never see again. ""It's hard to explain to your kid that someone he used to play with won't be there anymore,"" said Monique, as she clutched her son, Joaquin, to her side. ""It's hard to explain evil, it's hard for them to understand."" The Jimenez siblings were inside the school during the shooting Ameriah, 10, and Travis, 11, were both inside the school when shots rang out. As they approached their school, now encircled with caution tape, they told the BBC they knew to hide because they'd practised active shooter drills. When police finally arrived, Travis had to climb over a chair and through a window to escape. Their father, Jesse Jimenez, said Ameriah was missing for four hours and he feared the worst. Finding her was a miracle. Both kids spoke quietly, leaving their father to fill in any details. ""My son ran up to me and said he didn't think he was going to make it out - that he didn't think he was going to see me or his mother again,"" he said. ""My daughter didn't know if it was a drill or if it was real."" The spectre of a school shooting has become so common in the United States, students across the country regularly practise how to respond to an active shooter. The Jimenez siblings said they were always told to ""take them seriously"". The teachers who died trying to save their pupils ""I know these kids practised,"" said JoAnn, a retired teacher who drove almost two hours to pay her respects. ""It just really breaks my heart that they might not have been able to put into place what they had learned - turning off the lights, shutting the door, locking the door, not opening the door unless someone physically opens it with a key."" And it hurts more because this time of the year was meant to be celebratory, she adds. In the 32 years JoAnn spent teaching, she came to love the end of the school year, even if it meant saying goodbye to students. ""Towards the end of the year you have a little bond with your students. You have a little love there. You're with them a lot more than your own family sometimes."" On Thursday afternoon, the community was dealt yet another blow. Joe Garcia, the husband of slain teacher Irma Garcia, had suffered a fatal heart attack. The two had been high school sweethearts. Earlier that day, Joe was seen taking flowers to a cross etched with his wife's name just outside the school.Now, his family says he died of a broken heart. ""I spent this afternoon with their family,"" Archbishop Gustavo Garcia-Siller said at the start of Mass that evening. ""This is a tragic situation."" Teacher Irma Garcia was killed. Her husband died of a heart attack days later For the Catholics in this predominantly-Latino community, Thursday was meant to be an annual day of celebration marking the Feast of Ascension, when Jesus rose to Heaven to take his seat beside God, His Father. Instead, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, where the Garcias spent most Sundays, the congregation bowed their heads to mourn children and teachers who ascended too soon, leaving loved ones wracked with confusion and grief. As he read from the Gospel, a church deacon reminded the congregation that before he departed, Jesus said, ""You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy."" This year, that verse is proving more difficult to understand. After the spotlight fades and camera crews leave, the people in this all-American town will be left to rebuild after yet another distinctly American tragedy.

LiveLiveRussia claims control of key city in Ukraine's east16 minutes ago,"President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a rare trip outside Kyiv - visiting troops on the front line in Kharkiv region His office said he had thanked troops for defending the country Russians have attacked Kharkiv city again - weeks after being pushed away by Ukrainian troops Mr Zelensky has described the situation in parts of Kharkiv region as ""indescribably difficult"" for the Ukrainian army The Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai says civilians have been killed in Severodonetsk, with buildings destroyed in the key eastern city Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine Andrei Kelin also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"" Meanwhile, heavy fighting is continuing near Severodonetsk in Luhansk Region, the General Staff of Ukraineâs Armed forces said Edited by Jeremy Gahagan And here we come to the end of today's live coverage. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system
against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area â a weapon described as a giant
flamethrower. That is what a Russian security official told the state-run
Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the
area of oxygen. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of
Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1
Solntsepyok (âBlazing Sunâ) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where
Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment. TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six
miles). The TOS-2âs manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer
range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis. TOS-2 artillery on display - the system was first deployed last year Hugo BachegaReporting from Zaporizhzhia It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He
visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraineâs second city, handed out
awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service. âYouâre risking your life for all of us and our state,â he
said. âThank you for defending Ukraineâs independence. Take care!â The visit was a demonstration of the countryâs success in
pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost
morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas
area further east. An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and
destruction. Hours after the president left, loud explosions were
reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces
there may have subsided, but itâs not entirely gone. James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House Ukraineâs capital is 1,540
years old this weekend, and youâd be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasnât in the mood
to celebrate. After all, itâs just over
three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some
predicting it would fall within 72 hours. At the time, I remember
standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was
outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry. Today it's a different
scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter
as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned
last week; and you canât help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket.
Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter. âLife really goes on and we do not stop,â says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. âWe hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alrightâ. Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. âI can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it wonât be the sameâ she admits. âI donât have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.â For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022. Soprano for the National Opera of Ukraine Olga Fomichova Joe InwoodBBC News, Kyiv Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out
to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian
Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight. Now,
he is compared to Winston Churchill. His
steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as
being a crucial factor in his countryâs remarkable performance in the beginning
of this war. His
defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical
middle finger to Russia and its president. While
President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their
shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long
table, his officials barely in shouting distance. As
effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital.
Todayâs visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since
the start of Russiaâs invasion. He
met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians,
almost pushing them back to the international border. The
fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in
Ukraineâs second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never
have been possible. But,
do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much
appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to
retreat in the Donbas. With
its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war.
Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be
decided. Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said. ""'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents,"" he wrote in a tweet. The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added. Allowing Russia to win would ""open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."" Podolyak went on to say: ""Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations. ""Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."" Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia. Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall. Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head ofKherson's Moscow-installed administration, says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed. According to Reuters news agency, he says: ""We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite
is planned, but it wonât be today and it wonât be tomorrow
because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson
region."" Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide. But the UK Ministry of Defence said,in an intelligence update in April,external, a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine. And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating ""pseudo-republics"" throughout the country. He has advised peoplenot to give the Russian authorities any personal data, such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes. More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv. He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts. It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Here are some more pictures of his visit. Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says. Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state,"" the president told troops. The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations
were not at the ""expected level"" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance. ""For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic
of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which
support terrorism entering Nato,"" the president said. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria. What is Nato and how can Finland and Sweden join? If you're just joining us, here is a brief recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed.Russia's ambassador to the UK says his country will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine  Russian forces continue assault in eastern Ukraine As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the
city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself
surrounded. Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk. What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine. It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next. Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russiaâs existence was threatened. The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"". Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerouseyewitness accounts from residents, who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones. The full interview can be seen in the UK on the Sunday Morning programme, BBC One 9am. This video can not be played War crimes a 'fabrication'- Russian Ambassador Â© 2025 BBC.

"Travel disruption as half-term getaway beginsFlights are cancelled, long queues form at London's St Pancras station, and delays mount at Dover.Business","This video can not be played WATCH: Lengthy queues fill London St Pancras station Airlines have cancelled dozens of flights as travel disruption affects the half-term getaway for many. EasyJet and Tui apologised and blamed a number of issues including air traffic restrictions and runway works for axing the flights. Meanwhile, people were urged to check the latest advice before travelling to the Port of Dover due to ""extremely busy"" roads. Long queues have also been seen at London's St Pancras station. The station - home to Eurostar services - was exceptionally busy on Saturday with slow-moving queues stretching outside the building. Families heading to Disneyland Paris and football fans going to Paris for the Champions League final were among those travelling on train services across the Channel on Saturday. The coastguard has been handing out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue at the port of Dover Earlier this week, EasyJet confirmed its plans to cancel 240 flights at airports across the UK over the next 10 days. The airline said about 24 flights a day from London's Gatwick airport would be cancelled between 28 May and 6 June. 'We were on the plane when our flight was cancelled' One passenger who spoke to the BBC said his EasyJet flight on Tuesday had been cancelled - but the earliest alternative flight offered by the airline was almost a week later on 6 June. And Tui passengers in Manchester and Birmingham said they were still waiting to fly to Dalaman, in Turkey, on Saturday - a day after their flight was due to depart. Tracey and her two sons had to watch the funeral on a Zoom call A woman has described how her family missed her father's funeral because their flight was cancelled by EasyJet minutes before departure. Tracey was booked to fly from Geneva to Bristol with her two sons to attend her father David Dane's funeral. Their flight was one of about 200the airline cancelledat short notice on 26 May. ""My problem isn't that the flight was cancelled,"" she said. ""It was the fact that there was no one to deal with the situation, this meant I had to watch my dad's funeral from a hotel room."" Read Tracey's story here On Thursday, a software failureforced EasyJet to cancel about 200 flights. The issue affected airports across the UK. EasyJet said the latest cancellations were unrelated to the IT issue, which is now resolved. It said a range of issues affected its operations and contributed to the cancellations, including air traffic control restrictions, runway works and airport handling delays. The airline will still be operating around 1,700 flights per day over the next week, it said. When a flight is cancelled fewer than seven days before the scheduled departure, airlines are obliged to inform those affected of their rights, and: offer to place them on an alternative flight - including on other airlines - to fly as soon as possible provide a full refund for parts of the ticket not used If a flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, passengers may be entitled to additional compensation payments depending on the timings of any alternative flights: Â£220 for flights under 1,500km such as Glasgow to Amsterdam Â£350 for flights 1,500km to 3,500km such as East Midlands to Marrakesh Passengers who receive little or no notice about their cancelled flight, and ultimately arrive much later at their destination, may be entitled to extra compensation payments. Airlines are also expected to provide refreshments and accommodation as required while their customers await their new flight - or reimburse reasonable costs later on.

Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? magazine, urged holidaymakers to take out travel insurance when they book, rather than before they travel to best protect themselves.""The problems that airlines are suffering are not easy to fix,"" he told the BBC, saying disruption was likely to continue into summer. In addition to Friday's delays, Tui cancelled six flights from Birmingham, Manchester and London Gatwick on Saturday morning. The cancellations were due to ""a combination of factors"" and refreshments and hotel accommodation would be provided, the company said. It also added that those whose flight was cancelled would be contacted directly and would receive a full refund within 14 days. Around 8,000 flights are expected to depart from UK airports over the weekend. Gatwick Airport said it expected 700 flights and 110,000 passengers on Saturday alone. Meanwhile, motoring organisation the RAC warned of congestion on the roads and said drivers were planning an estimated 17.8 million leisure trips between Friday and Sunday. Saturday is expected to be the busiest day. The Kent Resilience Forum said around 750 lorries were queuing near Dover on Saturday morning - though tourists are being prioritised. The coastguard has handed out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue. Passengers have faced delays and cancellations at airports in recent months following the easing of Covid restrictions on international travel.

Thousands in Belfast for NI centennial paradeThe Grand Orange Lodge of Irelandâs parade for the centenary of Northern Ireland features 130 bands.Northern Ireland,"The parade leaves the grounds of Stormont, heading for the city centre About 100,000 people have watched an Orange Order parade to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, the chief constable has said. Some 25,000 people took part, amid a huge policing operation in Belfast. Before the parade started, Orange Order Grand Secretary, the Rev Mervyn Gibson, rejected any change to Northern Ireland's position within the UK. He said Northern Ireland has ""no interest in becoming part of an all-Ireland - save your breath"". The parade, which led to traffic restrictions in many areas of the city, ended on Saturday evening. Bands converged in the city centre on Saturday afternoon The march from Stormont to Belfast City Hall was postponed last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Itstarted at Stormont,externalat 13:00 BST before heading down the Newtownards Road, over Queen's Bridge and on to City Hall. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne said months of planning had gone into Saturday's operation with 500 officers on duty, mostly across Belfast. ""This is quite a significant policing operation,"" he said. This video can not be played 'British we are and British we'll stay' - centennial parade is told ""This is slightly unique because of the traffic disruption over the length of journey, but what we see here today is a blueprint for what could be a busy summer. ""But we're really optimistic about a family fun day and a celebration of the past."" People gathered to listen to speeches and music on the lawn at Stormont People started gathering at Stormont from about 10:00 with speeches beginning at noon in front of Parliament Buildings. Addressing the crowd at Stormont, the Rev Gibson said that ""it doesn't matter what you promise or offer [in a united Ireland], it doesn't matter if every day was the 12th of July"". ""If it's not under the Union Jack then count us out,"" he said. ""British we are and British we'll stay."" However, he warned thatthe Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit trade deal, was a threat to the union. ""No fundamental change to the protocol, then no functioning assembly,"" he said. ""Because let me make clear if the protocol is not sorted then make no mistake - no mistake - there will be no next 100 years for Northern Ireland."" Allow Twitter content?

The Rev Gibson ended his speech by saying: ""And the cry to those who seek to persuade us or push us into a united Ireland is still the same: 'no surrender'."" He added that he wants to see a Northern Ireland that is ""financially stable, where there is truly equality of opportunity for all, equality in education, an effective and efficient health service, where culture and heritage are celebrated and respected"". How was Northern Ireland's centenary year marked? Grand Master Edward Stevenson said that unionists ""are fully justified in not only commemorating, but proudly celebrating, this anniversary"". About 25,000 are thought to be taking part in the parade He added that ""disappointingly but predictably, throughout 2021 there were those who told us that there is nothing to celebrate"". ""Rather than a celebration they repeatedly downplayed the anniversary and all it stood for,"" he added. ""Regrettably, even our own UK government did little - despite much encouragement by this organisation and others - to ensure that the centenary was marked in a fitting way."" Orange Order NI Centennial parade in pictures About 130 bands were involved in the parade from the Orange Order, the Royal Black Institution, the Apprentice Boys of Derry, and the Independent Orange Order. The new parliament was officially opened by King George V on 22 June 1921 It was warmer than expected, and took much longer than anticipated, but the parade organisers went home content. There was plenty of heat too from the platform at Stormont. As expected, a united Ireland was rejected, in robust terms. However, it was said in front of Parliament Buildings, where Sinn FÃ©in is now the largest party, for the first time in Northern Ireland's 101 year history. Overall, unionists still have more seats, but only two more. Just like in 1921, politics in Belfast has entered an important phase. Translink had advised travellers to allow extra time for their journeys with road closures and diversions in place. The management of several city centre businesses also said they wouldthey will close for part of the day. Castle Court shopping centre closed two hours early at 16:00 and Victoria Square's opening hours on Saturday were 09:00 to 14:00, although individual retailers may have had different opening hours. Drone footage shows the participants in the grounds of Stormont Kieran Sloan, the owner of Sawers deli on College Street, told BBC News NI that staff getting home was his key consideration for remaining closed all day on Saturday.

Thousands in Belfast for NI centennial parade,"The parade leaves the grounds of Stormont, heading for the city centre About 100,000 people have watched an Orange Order parade to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, the chief constable has said. Some 25,000 people took part, amid a huge policing operation in Belfast. Before the parade started, Orange Order Grand Secretary, the Rev Mervyn Gibson, rejected any change to Northern Ireland's position within the UK. He said Northern Ireland has ""no interest in becoming part of an all-Ireland - save your breath"". The parade, which led to traffic restrictions in many areas of the city, ended on Saturday evening. Bands converged in the city centre on Saturday afternoon The march from Stormont to Belfast City Hall was postponed last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Itstarted at Stormont,externalat 13:00 BST before heading down the Newtownards Road, over Queen's Bridge and on to City Hall. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne said months of planning had gone into Saturday's operation with 500 officers on duty, mostly across Belfast. ""This is quite a significant policing operation,"" he said. This video can not be played 'British we are and British we'll stay' - centennial parade is told ""This is slightly unique because of the traffic disruption over the length of journey, but what we see here today is a blueprint for what could be a busy summer. ""But we're really optimistic about a family fun day and a celebration of the past."" People gathered to listen to speeches and music on the lawn at Stormont People started gathering at Stormont from about 10:00 with speeches beginning at noon in front of Parliament Buildings. Addressing the crowd at Stormont, the Rev Gibson said that ""it doesn't matter what you promise or offer [in a united Ireland], it doesn't matter if every day was the 12th of July"". ""If it's not under the Union Jack then count us out,"" he said. ""British we are and British we'll stay."" However, he warned thatthe Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit trade deal, was a threat to the union. ""No fundamental change to the protocol, then no functioning assembly,"" he said. ""Because let me make clear if the protocol is not sorted then make no mistake - no mistake - there will be no next 100 years for Northern Ireland."" Allow Twitter content?

The Rev Gibson ended his speech by saying: ""And the cry to those who seek to persuade us or push us into a united Ireland is still the same: 'no surrender'."" He added that he wants to see a Northern Ireland that is ""financially stable, where there is truly equality of opportunity for all, equality in education, an effective and efficient health service, where culture and heritage are celebrated and respected"". How was Northern Ireland's centenary year marked? Grand Master Edward Stevenson said that unionists ""are fully justified in not only commemorating, but proudly celebrating, this anniversary"". About 25,000 are thought to be taking part in the parade He added that ""disappointingly but predictably, throughout 2021 there were those who told us that there is nothing to celebrate"". ""Rather than a celebration they repeatedly downplayed the anniversary and all it stood for,"" he added. ""Regrettably, even our own UK government did little - despite much encouragement by this organisation and others - to ensure that the centenary was marked in a fitting way."" Orange Order NI Centennial parade in pictures About 130 bands were involved in the parade from the Orange Order, the Royal Black Institution, the Apprentice Boys of Derry, and the Independent Orange Order. The new parliament was officially opened by King George V on 22 June 1921 It was warmer than expected, and took much longer than anticipated, but the parade organisers went home content. There was plenty of heat too from the platform at Stormont. As expected, a united Ireland was rejected, in robust terms. However, it was said in front of Parliament Buildings, where Sinn FÃ©in is now the largest party, for the first time in Northern Ireland's 101 year history. Overall, unionists still have more seats, but only two more. Just like in 1921, politics in Belfast has entered an important phase. Translink had advised travellers to allow extra time for their journeys with road closures and diversions in place. The management of several city centre businesses also said they wouldthey will close for part of the day. Castle Court shopping centre closed two hours early at 16:00 and Victoria Square's opening hours on Saturday were 09:00 to 14:00, although individual retailers may have had different opening hours. Drone footage shows the participants in the grounds of Stormont Kieran Sloan, the owner of Sawers deli on College Street, told BBC News NI that staff getting home was his key consideration for remaining closed all day on Saturday.

"Travel disruption as half-term getaway beginsFlights are cancelled, long queues form at London's St Pancras station, and delays mount at Dover.","This video can not be played WATCH: Lengthy queues fill London St Pancras station Airlines have cancelled dozens of flights as travel disruption affects the half-term getaway for many. EasyJet and Tui apologised and blamed a number of issues including air traffic restrictions and runway works for axing the flights. Meanwhile, people were urged to check the latest advice before travelling to the Port of Dover due to ""extremely busy"" roads. Long queues have also been seen at London's St Pancras station. The station - home to Eurostar services - was exceptionally busy on Saturday with slow-moving queues stretching outside the building. Families heading to Disneyland Paris and football fans going to Paris for the Champions League final were among those travelling on train services across the Channel on Saturday. The coastguard has been handing out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue at the port of Dover Earlier this week, EasyJet confirmed its plans to cancel 240 flights at airports across the UK over the next 10 days. The airline said about 24 flights a day from London's Gatwick airport would be cancelled between 28 May and 6 June. 'We were on the plane when our flight was cancelled' One passenger who spoke to the BBC said his EasyJet flight on Tuesday had been cancelled - but the earliest alternative flight offered by the airline was almost a week later on 6 June. And Tui passengers in Manchester and Birmingham said they were still waiting to fly to Dalaman, in Turkey, on Saturday - a day after their flight was due to depart. Tracey and her two sons had to watch the funeral on a Zoom call A woman has described how her family missed her father's funeral because their flight was cancelled by EasyJet minutes before departure. Tracey was booked to fly from Geneva to Bristol with her two sons to attend her father David Dane's funeral. Their flight was one of about 200the airline cancelledat short notice on 26 May. ""My problem isn't that the flight was cancelled,"" she said. ""It was the fact that there was no one to deal with the situation, this meant I had to watch my dad's funeral from a hotel room."" Read Tracey's story here On Thursday, a software failureforced EasyJet to cancel about 200 flights. The issue affected airports across the UK. EasyJet said the latest cancellations were unrelated to the IT issue, which is now resolved. It said a range of issues affected its operations and contributed to the cancellations, including air traffic control restrictions, runway works and airport handling delays. The airline will still be operating around 1,700 flights per day over the next week, it said. When a flight is cancelled fewer than seven days before the scheduled departure, airlines are obliged to inform those affected of their rights, and: offer to place them on an alternative flight - including on other airlines - to fly as soon as possible provide a full refund for parts of the ticket not used If a flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, passengers may be entitled to additional compensation payments depending on the timings of any alternative flights: Â£220 for flights under 1,500km such as Glasgow to Amsterdam Â£350 for flights 1,500km to 3,500km such as East Midlands to Marrakesh Passengers who receive little or no notice about their cancelled flight, and ultimately arrive much later at their destination, may be entitled to extra compensation payments. Airlines are also expected to provide refreshments and accommodation as required while their customers await their new flight - or reimburse reasonable costs later on.

Full details of the Civil Aviation Authority rules arehere,external. A helpful guide from Which? consumer magazine ishere,external. Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? magazine, urged holidaymakers to take out travel insurance when they book, rather than before they travel to best protect themselves.""The problems that airlines are suffering are not easy to fix,"" he told the BBC, saying disruption was likely to continue into summer. In addition to Friday's delays, Tui cancelled six flights from Birmingham, Manchester and London Gatwick on Saturday morning. The cancellations were due to ""a combination of factors"" and refreshments and hotel accommodation would be provided, the company said. It also added that those whose flight was cancelled would be contacted directly and would receive a full refund within 14 days. Around 8,000 flights are expected to depart from UK airports over the weekend. Gatwick Airport said it expected 700 flights and 110,000 passengers on Saturday alone. Meanwhile, motoring organisation the RAC warned of congestion on the roads and said drivers were planning an estimated 17.8 million leisure trips between Friday and Sunday. Saturday is expected to be the busiest day. The Kent Resilience Forum said around 750 lorries were queuing near Dover on Saturday morning - though tourists are being prioritised. The coastguard has handed out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue. Passengers have faced delays and cancellations at airports in recent months following the easing of Covid restrictions on international travel. The travel industry cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but as demand for flights has returned, it has struggled to recruit staff, carry out security checks and train new workers quickly.

"'It's hard to explain evil, it's hard to understand'Many in Uvalde say they feel lost after the school massacre, but their faith is a source of strength.US & Canada","Bible in hand as he approached the stage, Pastor Tony Gruben looked out onto a sea of shattered faces and paused. On Wednesday, less than 24 hours after one of America's deadliest school shootings, he admitted that he too, felt lost. ""I wanted to hope this was all a nightmare. I have no answers,"" he told a packed arena typically reserved for rodeos. ""But when the morning breaks, God is there."" As he spoke, neighbours clutched one another - too lost in their grief to really care about the news cameras nearby broadcasting their pain. Instead, they prayed for healing. They prayed for understanding. But most of all, they prayed for the souls of the 21 lives stolen from their community when an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School. Among the dead were 19 children between the ages of seven and 10. Who were the victims? Before last week, few could locate Uvalde, a small town of about 15,000 nestled between San Antonio and the US-Mexico border at the base of the Texas Hill Country. Now, its name has been added to a grim, yet growing, list of gun massacres in the United States. And as the world grasps for answers, the people here cling to their faith. ""We may not understand what happened here yesterday, but we seek the Lord, as best we can,"" another minister said. American flags, welcome signs and large crosses decorate front yards here. It's the kind of place where folks stop to help this journalist with a flat tyre, not caring how late they'll be to dinner, ""because that's what I would want someone to do for my daughter"". And it's a town full of people willing to offer a half-smile, even in the midst of their grief. Communities torn apart by mass shootings are often reduced to just a name: Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland. But where trauma transforms some into activists, the Uvalde community has turned inward. As she left a mid-day mass on Thursday, Irma Fuentes told the BBC she had spent the morning crying until she came to church. She said she prayed for the souls of the 19 children who were killed - and also for the soul of ""that boy"" who caused her community so much pain. Irma prays for her community ""The little girl that they found yesterday was my neighbour's granddaughter,"" she said, adding another neighbour's grandchild was still suffering from injuries in a San Antonio hospital. ""I'm going home now to be with them."" But while everyone knows someone who lost a loved one in the shooting, it seems no one really knew the boy who pulled the trigger. Salvador Ramos bought two rifles a week before the shooting, authorities have said. Texas shooting response was 'wrong', says official Classmates like Ivan Arrellano who, despite having shared classes and conversations with Ramos since they were 12 years old back in eighth grade, couldn't show you a school photo of him because ""he was never present for stuff like that."" Mickey Craddock lives just three doors down from the home where the rampage began after the gunman shot his grandmother. She always thought of him as a ""regular teenage kid"". She'd sometimes see him play basketball, and heard rumours about his unstable relationship with his mother. A mother holds up a photo of her child at the vigil ""He was a troubled kid, and I could probably point out five or six of them in this community,"" Ms Craddock said. ""People from bad backgrounds, drug backgrounds, you know, but we never thought anything like this would happen."" Some media reports have painted the gunman as a bullied and isolated teen, but Mr Arrellano said his experience was different. ""He was not a victim of bullying. He would try to scare people and I guess this was his last way to scare people,"" he said. We met 18-year-old Arellano two days before he was supposed to graduate high school. Now, because of the shooting, that milestone has been postponed, leaving the teenager to reflect on what he could have done. ""We knew he wasn't mentally healthyâ¦ we probably should've said something."" The morning after the shooting, the town was so silent you could hear a rooster crowing from blocks away. Standing in her yard, Sandra Parra looked down the street towards Robb Elementary. On any other weekday, she'd overhear the voices of small children as they walked past her home towards the school. Sometimes there'd be singing, sometimes there'd be shouting, but there was always proof of life. Monique holds son Joaquin close There was none of that Wednesday morning. Instead, her view of the school was obstructed by the hordes of media that swarmed the area - blocking roads and stomping through her neighbours' yards. ""The normality is not here anymore,"" Parra said. ""They didn't deserve it and I just don't understand what happened."" Politicians and pundits have already rebooted a familiar playbook: reducing the town's trauma to a talking point about mental health and gun control. Where does debate over US guns go now? America's gun culture in charts But all of that is not up for debate in Uvalde - at least not right now. On the day after the attack, once the initial shock of the shooting had passed, children returned to the school. Instead of backpacks and homework, they came bearing candles and flowers for classmates and friends they'd never see again. ""It's hard to explain to your kid that someone he used to play with won't be there anymore,"" said Monique, as she clutched her son, Joaquin, to her side. ""It's hard to explain evil, it's hard for them to understand."" The Jimenez siblings were inside the school during the shooting Ameriah, 10, and Travis, 11, were both inside the school when shots rang out. As they approached their school, now encircled with caution tape, they told the BBC they knew to hide because they'd practised active shooter drills. When police finally arrived, Travis had to climb over a chair and through a window to escape. Their father, Jesse Jimenez, said Ameriah was missing for four hours and he feared the worst. Finding her was a miracle. Both kids spoke quietly, leaving their father to fill in any details. ""My son ran up to me and said he didn't think he was going to make it out - that he didn't think he was going to see me or his mother again,"" he said. ""My daughter didn't know if it was a drill or if it was real."" The spectre of a school shooting has become so common in the United States, students across the country regularly practise how to respond to an active shooter. The Jimenez siblings said they were always told to ""take them seriously"". The teachers who died trying to save their pupils ""I know these kids practised,"" said JoAnn, a retired teacher who drove almost two hours to pay her respects. ""It just really breaks my heart that they might not have been able to put into place what they had learned - turning off the lights, shutting the door, locking the door, not opening the door unless someone physically opens it with a key."" And it hurts more because this time of the year was meant to be celebratory, she adds. In the 32 years JoAnn spent teaching, she came to love the end of the school year, even if it meant saying goodbye to students. ""Towards the end of the year you have a little bond with your students. You have a little love there. You're with them a lot more than your own family sometimes."" On Thursday afternoon, the community was dealt yet another blow. Joe Garcia, the husband of slain teacher Irma Garcia, had suffered a fatal heart attack. The two had been high school sweethearts. Earlier that day, Joe was seen taking flowers to a cross etched with his wife's name just outside the school.Now, his family says he died of a broken heart. ""I spent this afternoon with their family,"" Archbishop Gustavo Garcia-Siller said at the start of Mass that evening. ""This is a tragic situation."" Teacher Irma Garcia was killed. Her husband died of a heart attack days later For the Catholics in this predominantly-Latino community, Thursday was meant to be an annual day of celebration marking the Feast of Ascension, when Jesus rose to Heaven to take his seat beside God, His Father. Instead, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, where the Garcias spent most Sundays, the congregation bowed their heads to mourn children and teachers who ascended too soon, leaving loved ones wracked with confusion and grief. As he read from the Gospel, a church deacon reminded the congregation that before he departed, Jesus said, ""You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy."" This year, that verse is proving more difficult to understand. After the spotlight fades and camera crews leave, the people in this all-American town will be left to rebuild after yet another distinctly American tragedy.

On Wednesday, less than 24 hours after one of America's deadliest school shootings, he admitted that he too, felt lost. ""I wanted to hope this was all a nightmare. I have no answers,"" he told a packed arena typically reserved for rodeos. ""But when the morning breaks, God is there."" As he spoke, neighbours clutched one another - too lost in their grief to really care about the news cameras nearby broadcasting their pain. Instead, they prayed for healing. They prayed for understanding. But most of all, they prayed for the souls of the 21 lives stolen from their community when an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School. Among the dead were 19 children between the ages of seven and 10. Who were the victims? Before last week, few could locate Uvalde, a small town of about 15,000 nestled between San Antonio and the US-Mexico border at the base of the Texas Hill Country. Now, its name has been added to a grim, yet growing, list of gun massacres in the United States. And as the world grasps for answers, the people here cling to their faith. ""We may not understand what happened here yesterday, but we seek the Lord, as best we can,"" another minister said. American flags, welcome signs and large crosses decorate front yards here. It's the kind of place where folks stop to help this journalist with a flat tyre, not caring how late they'll be to dinner, ""because that's what I would want someone to do for my daughter"". And it's a town full of people willing to offer a half-smile, even in the midst of their grief. Communities torn apart by mass shootings are often reduced to just a name: Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland. But where trauma transforms some into activists, the Uvalde community has turned inward. As she left a mid-day mass on Thursday, Irma Fuentes told the BBC she had spent the morning crying until she came to church. She said she prayed for the souls of the 19 children who were killed - and also for the soul of ""that boy"" who caused her community so much pain. Irma prays for her community ""The little girl that they found yesterday was my neighbour's granddaughter,"" she said, adding another neighbour's grandchild was still suffering from injuries in a San Antonio hospital. ""I'm going home now to be with them."" But while everyone knows someone who lost a loved one in the shooting, it seems no one really knew the boy who pulled the trigger. Salvador Ramos bought two rifles a week before the shooting, authorities have said. Texas shooting response was 'wrong', says official Classmates like Ivan Arrellano who, despite having shared classes and conversations with Ramos since they were 12 years old back in eighth grade, couldn't show you a school photo of him because ""he was never present for stuff like that."" Mickey Craddock lives just three doors down from the home where the rampage began after the gunman shot his grandmother. She always thought of him as a ""regular teenage kid"". She'd sometimes see him play basketball, and heard rumours about his unstable relationship with his mother. A mother holds up a photo of her child at the vigil ""He was a troubled kid, and I could probably point out five or six of them in this community,"" Ms Craddock said. ""People from bad backgrounds, drug backgrounds, you know, but we never thought anything like this would happen."" Some media reports have painted the gunman as a bullied and isolated teen, but Mr Arrellano said his experience was different. ""He was not a victim of bullying. He would try to scare people and I guess this was his last way to scare people,"" he said. We met 18-year-old Arellano two days before he was supposed to graduate high school. Now, because of the shooting, that milestone has been postponed, leaving the teenager to reflect on what he could have done. ""We knew he wasn't mentally healthyâ¦ we probably should've said something."" The morning after the shooting, the town was so silent you could hear a rooster crowing from blocks away. Standing in her yard, Sandra Parra looked down the street towards Robb Elementary. On any other weekday, she'd overhear the voices of small children as they walked past her home towards the school. Sometimes there'd be singing, sometimes there'd be shouting, but there was always proof of life. Monique holds son Joaquin close There was none of that Wednesday morning. Instead, her view of the school was obstructed by the hordes of media that swarmed the area - blocking roads and stomping through her neighbours' yards. ""The normality is not here anymore,"" Parra said. ""They didn't deserve it and I just don't understand what happened."" Politicians and pundits have already rebooted a familiar playbook: reducing the town's trauma to a talking point about mental health and gun control. Where does debate over US guns go now? America's gun culture in charts But all of that is not up for debate in Uvalde - at least not right now. On the day after the attack, once the initial shock of the shooting had passed, children returned to the school. Instead of backpacks and homework, they came bearing candles and flowers for classmates and friends they'd never see again. ""It's hard to explain to your kid that someone he used to play with won't be there anymore,"" said Monique, as she clutched her son, Joaquin, to her side. ""It's hard to explain evil, it's hard for them to understand."" The Jimenez siblings were inside the school during the shooting Ameriah, 10, and Travis, 11, were both inside the school when shots rang out. As they approached their school, now encircled with caution tape, they told the BBC they knew to hide because they'd practised active shooter drills. When police finally arrived, Travis had to climb over a chair and through a window to escape. Their father, Jesse Jimenez, said Ameriah was missing for four hours and he feared the worst. Finding her was a miracle. Both kids spoke quietly, leaving their father to fill in any details. ""My son ran up to me and said he didn't think he was going to make it out - that he didn't think he was going to see me or his mother again,"" he said. ""My daughter didn't know if it was a drill or if it was real."" The spectre of a school shooting has become so common in the United States, students across the country regularly practise how to respond to an active shooter. The Jimenez siblings said they were always told to ""take them seriously"". The teachers who died trying to save their pupils ""I know these kids practised,"" said JoAnn, a retired teacher who drove almost two hours to pay her respects. ""It just really breaks my heart that they might not have been able to put into place what they had learned - turning off the lights, shutting the door, locking the door, not opening the door unless someone physically opens it with a key."" And it hurts more because this time of the year was meant to be celebratory, she adds. In the 32 years JoAnn spent teaching, she came to love the end of the school year, even if it meant saying goodbye to students. ""Towards the end of the year you have a little bond with your students. You have a little love there. You're with them a lot more than your own family sometimes."" On Thursday afternoon, the community was dealt yet another blow. Joe Garcia, the husband of slain teacher Irma Garcia, had suffered a fatal heart attack. The two had been high school sweethearts. Earlier that day, Joe was seen taking flowers to a cross etched with his wife's name just outside the school.Now, his family says he died of a broken heart. ""I spent this afternoon with their family,"" Archbishop Gustavo Garcia-Siller said at the start of Mass that evening. ""This is a tragic situation."" Teacher Irma Garcia was killed. Her husband died of a heart attack days later For the Catholics in this predominantly-Latino community, Thursday was meant to be an annual day of celebration marking the Feast of Ascension, when Jesus rose to Heaven to take his seat beside God, His Father. Instead, at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, where the Garcias spent most Sundays, the congregation bowed their heads to mourn children and teachers who ascended too soon, leaving loved ones wracked with confusion and grief. As he read from the Gospel, a church deacon reminded the congregation that before he departed, Jesus said, ""You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy."" This year, that verse is proving more difficult to understand. After the spotlight fades and camera crews leave, the people in this all-American town will be left to rebuild after yet another distinctly American tragedy.

Chelsea sale to be completed by Monday,"Chelsea won the Premier League five times and the Champions League twice during Abramovich's ownership The Chelsea sale is expected to be completed on Monday after a ""final and definitive agreement"" was reached with the consortium led by Todd Boehly. The Premier League and UK government have approved the Â£4.25bn takeover. Chelsea were put up for sale in March before owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The club have been operating under a special government licence which expires on 31 May. ""Chelsea Football Club can confirm that a final and definitive agreement was entered into last night to sell the club to the Todd Boehly/Clearlake Capital consortium,"" Chelsea said in a statement on Saturday. Abramovich, who bought Chelsea in 2003, said he was ""pleased this search has now come to a successful conclusion"". He added: ""As I hand over Chelsea to its new custodians, I would like to wish them the best of success, both on and off the pitch. ""It has been an honour of a lifetime to be a part of this club - I would like to thank all the club's past and current players, staff, and of course fans for these incredible years."" Who are key people behind Boehly consortium? What are the pressing issues for the Chelsea's new owners? Although the consortium is led by Boehly, Californian private equity firm Clearlake Capital would own a majority of the shares. Other investors include US billionaire Mark Walter, a co-owner of the LA Dodgers with Boehly, and Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. It is understood the new owners have""big ambitions""in the transfer market as they seek to close the gap on Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. On Tuesday the Premier League said the consortium had passed its owners' and directors' test. On Wednesday the UK government said it had ""reached a position where we could issue a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea"". The Chelsea Supporters' Trust said: ""The CST has been very encouraged by the interactions we have had with Mr Boehly and his team over recent months, but the hard work starts now. ""It is now time to deliver both on and off the pitch in building a successful, inclusive and forward-thinking club with supporters at the forefront."" Several parties expressed an interest, but Chelsea agreed to sell to the Boehly-led consortium this month. The government does not want Abramovich to receive any of the proceeds from the sale, which will instead go into a frozen bank account to be donated to charity. The government says it is now ""satisfied that the full proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or any other sanctioned individual"" and the proceeds will be used for ""humanitarian causes in Ukraine, supporting victims of the war"". Chelsea finished third in the Premier League, lost the Carabao Cup and FA Cup finals to Liverpool on penalties and reached the Champions League quarter-finals. Abramovich bought Chelsea for Â£140m 19 years ago.

MP quits government role over Sue Gray reportPaul Holmes's resignation comes as another Tory MP calls on Boris Johnson to resign over Partygate.UK Politics,"Boris Johnson visited the CityFibre Training Academy in Stockton-on-Tees on Friday Two more Tory MPs have revealed they have submitted letters of no confidence in Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Ex-minister Steve Brine and Anne Marie Morris join the six Tory MPs to call for him to go since the Sue Gray report was published last Wednesday. Ms Gray's report details widespread rule-breaking in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns. Overall, the BBC is aware of at least 20 Tory MPs who have submitted letters of no confidence. This is short of the 54 needed to force a vote on the PM's future. although the actual number of letters could be higher. Only Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, knows the exact number, and he is not expected to say anything until the 54 threshold has been reached. In a statement to constituents, Winchester MP Brine said he could no longer ""defend the indefensible"" as ""rule makers cannot be rule breakers"". On Friday, MP Paul Holmes quit his government job, saying he was ""shocked and appalled"" by events at No 10. Mr Holmes resigned as a parliamentary private secretary - a ministerial aide - to Home Secretary Priti Patel. He told the BBC he felt ""deeply uncomfortable"" over the findings inMs Gray's long-awaited report, which was published this week. Former junior minister Sir Bob Neill also called on the prime minister to quit over the report and submitted a letter of no confidence. Sir Bob, the Tory MP for Bromley & Chislehurst, said the report had ""highlighted a pattern of wholly unacceptable behaviour"". How much political danger is Boris Johnson in? Sue Gray reportâs key findings at a glance How many fines have there been over Partygate? And another of the 2019 intake of Conservative MPs, Alicia Kearns, issued a statement,reiterating that her position is ""unchanged"" since January, saying that the prime minister ""continues not to hold my confidence"". The MP for Rutland and Melton said she could only conclude that ""the prime minister's account of events to Parliament was misleading"", adding that the ""protracted affair has brought our government and my party into disrepute"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday, Treasury minister John Glen said the prime minister was in ""yellow card territory"" but said he would continue to ""get on and deliver"" as part of the government. In her report, Ms Gray said many events held during Covid restrictions ""should not have been allowed"" and the prime minister and his officials ""must bear responsibility for this culture"". She also found ""multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment"" of security staff and cleaners by officials when gatherings took place. Sir Bob told the BBC he had made his decision to call on Mr Johnson to resign after speaking to constituents, adding he was ""not part of any campaign group"" to unseat the PM. He added what had gone on had ""eroded trust"" in government, and he found Mr Johnson's explanation he was unaware of the nature of parties in No 10 not credible. ""I can't believe he was not aware about at least some of what was going on,"" he added. This video can not be played Conservative MP Paul Holmes explains why he is stepping down from his Home Office role. Eastleigh MP Mr Holmes said his work for constituents had been ""tarnished by the toxic culture that seemed to have permeated No 10."" But speaking to BBC South Today, Mr Holmes insisted his resignation was ""not about the leadership, this is not about letters or the 1922 committee"". Ms Gray's report follows a four-month Metropolitan Police inquiry that saw 126 fines issued to 83 people - including Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak - for events that took place in 2020 and 2021. Before Mr Holmes announced his resignation, Mr Johnson told reporters he was confident he has enough support within his party to stay in post - but he deflected questions on whether he had tolerated the culture of heavy drinking and rule-breaking highlighted by Ms Gray's report. ""If you look at the answers in the House of Commons over more than two hours, I think you'll be able to see I answered that very, very extensively,"" said the PM. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ The Sue Gray report Elected as MP at the 2019 general election, Mr Holmes has been a parliamentary private secretary to Ms Patel since September 2021. The unpaid role is the bottom rung of the government ladder, and is often seen as a way for newer MPs to gain experience of working with ministers. His resignation - announcedin a statement,external- made him the second Tory to have left a government post over the Partygate saga. In April, Lord David Wolfsonquit as a justice minister, saying the ""scale, context and nature"" of Covid breaches in government was inconsistent with his responsibility to uphold the rule of law.

EasyJet to cancel more than 200 half-term flightsThe airline says cancellations are required to provide reliable services in the busy holiday period.Business,"This video can not be played WATCH: Lengthy queues fill London St Pancras station Airlines have cancelled dozens of flights as travel disruption affects the half-term getaway for many. EasyJet and Tui apologised and blamed a number of issues including air traffic restrictions and runway works for axing the flights. Meanwhile, people were urged to check the latest advice before travelling to the Port of Dover due to ""extremely busy"" roads. Long queues have also been seen at London's St Pancras station. The station - home to Eurostar services - was exceptionally busy on Saturday with slow-moving queues stretching outside the building. Families heading to Disneyland Paris and football fans going to Paris for the Champions League final were among those travelling on train services across the Channel on Saturday. The coastguard has been handing out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue at the port of Dover Earlier this week, EasyJet confirmed its plans to cancel 240 flights at airports across the UK over the next 10 days. The airline said about 24 flights a day from London's Gatwick airport would be cancelled between 28 May and 6 June. 'We were on the plane when our flight was cancelled' One passenger who spoke to the BBC said his EasyJet flight on Tuesday had been cancelled - but the earliest alternative flight offered by the airline was almost a week later on 6 June. And Tui passengers in Manchester and Birmingham said they were still waiting to fly to Dalaman, in Turkey, on Saturday - a day after their flight was due to depart. Tracey and her two sons had to watch the funeral on a Zoom call A woman has described how her family missed her father's funeral because their flight was cancelled by EasyJet minutes before departure. Tracey was booked to fly from Geneva to Bristol with her two sons to attend her father David Dane's funeral. Their flight was one of about 200the airline cancelledat short notice on 26 May. ""My problem isn't that the flight was cancelled,"" she said. ""It was the fact that there was no one to deal with the situation, this meant I had to watch my dad's funeral from a hotel room."" Read Tracey's story here On Thursday, a software failureforced EasyJet to cancel about 200 flights. The issue affected airports across the UK. EasyJet said the latest cancellations were unrelated to the IT issue, which is now resolved. It said a range of issues affected its operations and contributed to the cancellations, including air traffic control restrictions, runway works and airport handling delays. The airline will still be operating around 1,700 flights per day over the next week, it said. When a flight is cancelled fewer than seven days before the scheduled departure, airlines are obliged to inform those affected of their rights, and: offer to place them on an alternative flight - including on other airlines - to fly as soon as possible provide a full refund for parts of the ticket not used If a flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, passengers may be entitled to additional compensation payments depending on the timings of any alternative flights: Â£220 for flights under 1,500km such as Glasgow to Amsterdam Â£350 for flights 1,500km to 3,500km such as East Midlands to Marrakesh Passengers who receive little or no notice about their cancelled flight, and ultimately arrive much later at their destination, may be entitled to extra compensation payments. Airlines are also expected to provide refreshments and accommodation as required while their customers await their new flight - or reimburse reasonable costs later on. People on affected package holidays booked throughmembers of Abta,externalhave the right to alternative arrangements at no extra cost or a full refund without delay. Full details of the Civil Aviation Authority rules arehere,external. A helpful guide from Which? consumer magazine ishere,external. Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? magazine, urged holidaymakers to take out travel insurance when they book, rather than before they travel to best protect themselves.""The problems that airlines are suffering are not easy to fix,"" he told the BBC, saying disruption was likely to continue into summer. In addition to Friday's delays, Tui cancelled six flights from Birmingham, Manchester and London Gatwick on Saturday morning. The cancellations were due to ""a combination of factors"" and refreshments and hotel accommodation would be provided, the company said. It also added that those whose flight was cancelled would be contacted directly and would receive a full refund within 14 days. Around 8,000 flights are expected to depart from UK airports over the weekend. Gatwick Airport said it expected 700 flights and 110,000 passengers on Saturday alone. Meanwhile, motoring organisation the RAC warned of congestion on the roads and said drivers were planning an estimated 17.8 million leisure trips between Friday and Sunday. Saturday is expected to be the busiest day. The Kent Resilience Forum said around 750 lorries were queuing near Dover on Saturday morning - though tourists are being prioritised. The coastguard has handed out food and water to lorry drivers stuck in the queue. Passengers have faced delays and cancellations at airports in recent months following the easing of Covid restrictions on international travel. The travel industry cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but as demand for flights has returned, it has struggled to recruit staff, carry out security checks and train new workers quickly.

LiveLiveZelensky admits to very difficult situation in Donbas15 minutes ago15 minutes ago Welcome back to our live coverageWelcome back to our live coverage,"President Volodymyr Zelensky makes a rare trip outside Kyiv - visiting troops on the front line in Kharkiv region His office said he had thanked troops for defending the country Russians have attacked Kharkiv city again - weeks after being pushed away by Ukrainian troops Mr Zelensky has described the situation in parts of Kharkiv region as ""indescribably difficult"" for the Ukrainian army The Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai says civilians have been killed in Severodonetsk, with buildings destroyed in the key eastern city Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine Andrei Kelin also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"" Meanwhile, heavy fighting is continuing near Severodonetsk in Luhansk Region, the General Staff of Ukraineâs Armed forces said Edited by Jeremy Gahagan And here we come to the end of today's live coverage. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system
against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area â a weapon described as a giant
flamethrower. That is what a Russian security official told the state-run
Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the
area of oxygen. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of
Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1
Solntsepyok (âBlazing Sunâ) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where
Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment. TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six
miles). The TOS-2âs manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer
range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis. TOS-2 artillery on display - the system was first deployed last year Hugo BachegaReporting from Zaporizhzhia It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He
visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraineâs second city, handed out
awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service. âYouâre risking your life for all of us and our state,â he
said. âThank you for defending Ukraineâs independence. Take care!â The visit was a demonstration of the countryâs success in
pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost
morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas
area further east. An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and
destruction. Hours after the president left, loud explosions were
reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces
there may have subsided, but itâs not entirely gone. James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House Ukraineâs capital is 1,540
years old this weekend, and youâd be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasnât in the mood
to celebrate. After all, itâs just over
three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some
predicting it would fall within 72 hours. At the time, I remember
standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was
outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry. Today it's a different
scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter
as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned
last week; and you canât help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket.
Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter. âLife really goes on and we do not stop,â says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. âWe hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alrightâ. Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. âI can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it wonât be the sameâ she admits. âI donât have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.â For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022. Soprano for the National Opera of Ukraine Olga Fomichova Joe InwoodBBC News, Kyiv Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out
to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian
Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight. Now,
he is compared to Winston Churchill. His
steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as
being a crucial factor in his countryâs remarkable performance in the beginning
of this war. His
defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical
middle finger to Russia and its president. While
President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their
shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long
table, his officials barely in shouting distance. As
effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital.
Todayâs visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since
the start of Russiaâs invasion. He
met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians,
almost pushing them back to the international border. The
fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in
Ukraineâs second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never
have been possible. But,
do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much
appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to
retreat in the Donbas. With
its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war.
Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be
decided. Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said. ""'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents,"" he wrote in a tweet. The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added. Allowing Russia to win would ""open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."" Podolyak went on to say: ""Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations. ""Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."" Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia. Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall. Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head ofKherson's Moscow-installed administration, says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed. According to Reuters news agency, he says: ""We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite
is planned, but it wonât be today and it wonât be tomorrow
because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson
region."" Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide. But the UK Ministry of Defence said,in an intelligence update in April,external, a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine. And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating ""pseudo-republics"" throughout the country. He has advised peoplenot to give the Russian authorities any personal data, such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes. More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv. He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts. It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Here are some more pictures of his visit. Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says. Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state,"" the president told troops. The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations
were not at the ""expected level"" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance. ""For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic
of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which
support terrorism entering Nato,"" the president said. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria. What is Nato and how can Finland and Sweden join? If you're just joining us, here is a brief recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed.Russia's ambassador to the UK says his country will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine  Russian forces continue assault in eastern Ukraine As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the
city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself
surrounded. Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk. What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine. It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next. Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russiaâs existence was threatened. The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"". Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerouseyewitness accounts from residents, who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.

Thousands to attend Belfast centennial parade,"The parade leaves the grounds of Stormont, heading for the city centre About 100,000 people have watched an Orange Order parade to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, the chief constable has said. Some 25,000 people took part, amid a huge policing operation in Belfast. Before the parade started, Orange Order Grand Secretary, the Rev Mervyn Gibson, rejected any change to Northern Ireland's position within the UK. He said Northern Ireland has ""no interest in becoming part of an all-Ireland - save your breath"". The parade, which led to traffic restrictions in many areas of the city, ended on Saturday evening. Bands converged in the city centre on Saturday afternoon The march from Stormont to Belfast City Hall was postponed last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Itstarted at Stormont,externalat 13:00 BST before heading down the Newtownards Road, over Queen's Bridge and on to City Hall. Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Simon Byrne said months of planning had gone into Saturday's operation with 500 officers on duty, mostly across Belfast. ""This is quite a significant policing operation,"" he said. This video can not be played 'British we are and British we'll stay' - centennial parade is told ""This is slightly unique because of the traffic disruption over the length of journey, but what we see here today is a blueprint for what could be a busy summer. ""But we're really optimistic about a family fun day and a celebration of the past."" People gathered to listen to speeches and music on the lawn at Stormont People started gathering at Stormont from about 10:00 with speeches beginning at noon in front of Parliament Buildings. Addressing the crowd at Stormont, the Rev Gibson said that ""it doesn't matter what you promise or offer [in a united Ireland], it doesn't matter if every day was the 12th of July"". ""If it's not under the Union Jack then count us out,"" he said. ""British we are and British we'll stay."" However, he warned thatthe Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit trade deal, was a threat to the union. ""No fundamental change to the protocol, then no functioning assembly,"" he said. ""Because let me make clear if the protocol is not sorted then make no mistake - no mistake - there will be no next 100 years for Northern Ireland."" Allow Twitter content?

The Rev Gibson ended his speech by saying: ""And the cry to those who seek to persuade us or push us into a united Ireland is still the same: 'no surrender'."" He added that he wants to see a Northern Ireland that is ""financially stable, where there is truly equality of opportunity for all, equality in education, an effective and efficient health service, where culture and heritage are celebrated and respected"". How was Northern Ireland's centenary year marked? Grand Master Edward Stevenson said that unionists ""are fully justified in not only commemorating, but proudly celebrating, this anniversary"". About 25,000 are thought to be taking part in the parade He added that ""disappointingly but predictably, throughout 2021 there were those who told us that there is nothing to celebrate"". ""Rather than a celebration they repeatedly downplayed the anniversary and all it stood for,"" he added. ""Regrettably, even our own UK government did little - despite much encouragement by this organisation and others - to ensure that the centenary was marked in a fitting way."" Orange Order NI Centennial parade in pictures About 130 bands were involved in the parade from the Orange Order, the Royal Black Institution, the Apprentice Boys of Derry, and the Independent Orange Order. The new parliament was officially opened by King George V on 22 June 1921 It was warmer than expected, and took much longer than anticipated, but the parade organisers went home content. There was plenty of heat too from the platform at Stormont. As expected, a united Ireland was rejected, in robust terms. However, it was said in front of Parliament Buildings, where Sinn FÃ©in is now the largest party, for the first time in Northern Ireland's 101 year history. Overall, unionists still have more seats, but only two more. Just like in 1921, politics in Belfast has entered an important phase. Translink had advised travellers to allow extra time for their journeys with road closures and diversions in place. The management of several city centre businesses also said they wouldthey will close for part of the day. Castle Court shopping centre closed two hours early at 16:00 and Victoria Square's opening hours on Saturday were 09:00 to 14:00, although individual retailers may have had different opening hours. Drone footage shows the participants in the grounds of Stormont Kieran Sloan, the owner of Sawers deli on College Street, told BBC News NI that staff getting home was his key consideration for remaining closed all day on Saturday. Belfast retailers to close early ahead of parade How was Northern Ireland's centenary year marked? ""Everyone will be out for the parade but not necessarily to do any shopping,"" he added. Spectators lined the streets of Belfast as the parade made its way along the route Mr Henning said it was always the intent of the Orange Order that the event should benefit the city of Belfast, its shops and its people. ""We know for a fact that you can hardly get a room in the city over the weekend,"" he added.

Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system
against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area â a weapon described as a giant
flamethrower. That is what a Russian security official told the state-run
Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially. The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the
area of oxygen. Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of
Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday. Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1
Solntsepyok (âBlazing Sunâ) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where
Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment. TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six
miles). The TOS-2âs manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer
range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis. TOS-2 artillery on display - the system was first deployed last year Hugo BachegaReporting from Zaporizhzhia It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He
visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraineâs second city, handed out
awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service. âYouâre risking your life for all of us and our state,â he
said. âThank you for defending Ukraineâs independence. Take care!â The visit was a demonstration of the countryâs success in
pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost
morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas
area further east. An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and
destruction. Hours after the president left, loud explosions were
reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces
there may have subsided, but itâs not entirely gone. James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House Ukraineâs capital is 1,540
years old this weekend, and youâd be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasnât in the mood
to celebrate. After all, itâs just over
three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some
predicting it would fall within 72 hours. At the time, I remember
standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was
outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry. Today it's a different
scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter
as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned
last week; and you canât help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket.
Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter. âLife really goes on and we do not stop,â says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. âWe hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alrightâ. Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. âI can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it wonât be the sameâ she admits. âI donât have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.â For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022. Soprano for the National Opera of Ukraine Olga Fomichova Joe InwoodBBC News, Kyiv Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out
to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian
Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight. Now,
he is compared to Winston Churchill. His
steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as
being a crucial factor in his countryâs remarkable performance in the beginning
of this war. His
defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical
middle finger to Russia and its president. While
President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their
shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long
table, his officials barely in shouting distance. As
effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital.
Todayâs visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since
the start of Russiaâs invasion. He
met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians,
almost pushing them back to the international border. The
fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in
Ukraineâs second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never
have been possible. But,
do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much
appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to
retreat in the Donbas. With
its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war.
Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be
decided. Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said. ""'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents,"" he wrote in a tweet. The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added. Allowing Russia to win would ""open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."" Podolyak went on to say: ""Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations. ""Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."" Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia. Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall. Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head ofKherson's Moscow-installed administration, says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed. According to Reuters news agency, he says: ""We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite
is planned, but it wonât be today and it wonât be tomorrow
because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson
region."" Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide. But the UK Ministry of Defence said,in an intelligence update in April,external, a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine. And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating ""pseudo-republics"" throughout the country. He has advised peoplenot to give the Russian authorities any personal data, such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes. More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv. He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts. It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians. Here are some more pictures of his visit. Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says. Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said. ""I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state,"" the president told troops. The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations
were not at the ""expected level"" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance. ""For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic
of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which
support terrorism entering Nato,"" the president said. Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance. Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria. What is Nato and how can Finland and Sweden join? If you're just joining us, here is a brief recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed.Russia's ambassador to the UK says his country will not use nuclear weapons in Ukraine  Russian forces continue assault in eastern Ukraine As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the
city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself
surrounded. Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk. What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine. It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next. Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russiaâs existence was threatened. The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"". Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerouseyewitness accounts from residents, who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.

Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 ""nationalists"" [Ukrainian soldiers]  have been killed. He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. He says: ""In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."" The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents. Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area. Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces. The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema. But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back. Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to ""squeeze out some result for itself"". Russia's defence ministry says that missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of
the Ukrainian army in Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's home city,
state news agency Tass reports. The defence ministry also said Russian anti-aircraft defence
systems shot down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro. Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin, weâve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county
is accused of anything. All accusations are
rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed. What you end up with
is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting
dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game. Where thehorrors of Buchaare dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential
areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian
soldiers. In other words,
none of this is ever Russiaâs fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is
blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent
party. This is the Kremlin
narrative which weâve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury
poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian
opposition leader Alexei Navalny and weâre hearing it again now. As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain hasimposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses, as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: ""She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position. ""But she's very belligerent... ""On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, [but] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe... ""But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that? ""To make Russia more feeble?"" The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not ""toppled down"" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which hasseen inflation hit a 40-year high, partly driven by the Ukraine war. After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered. More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks. Jeremy BowenReporting from Donbas The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it. It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains. But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas. The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory. So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room. Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions. The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world. The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it. ""The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. ""The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure,"" she said. The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 ""and is by no means a result of the special military operation"" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid. The pandemic ""has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services"", she added. This video can not be played Ros Atkins on... Russia's food war James WaterhouseKyiv correspondent, BBC News The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the
Donbas region. Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the
city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself
surrounded. Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk. What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine. It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next. Russiaâs ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine. Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russiaâs existence was threatened. The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"". Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerouseyewitness accounts from residents, who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.
