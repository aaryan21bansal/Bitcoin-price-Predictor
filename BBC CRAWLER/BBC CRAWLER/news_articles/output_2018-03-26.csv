Russian spy: The story so far,"Police released CCTV showing two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU On 4 March, a former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned by a nerve agent, in an attack ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. An extraordinary series of accusations and denials from the highest levels of governments came in the months that followed, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. The attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, left them hospitalised for weeks. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in June in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury, after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday 4 March with his daughter Yulia Skripal flew into London's Heathrow Airport from Russia at about 14:40 GMT on Saturday, 3 March On Sunday, 4 March, at about 09:15 GMT, Mr Skripal's car was seen in Salisbury around London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road At 13:30 GMT his car was seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre Mr Skripal and his daughter arrived at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct at 13:40 GMT Police said the pair went to The Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at 14:20 GMT, where they stayed until 15:35 GMT At 16:15 GMT, emergency services received the first report of an incident Police found the pair on a bench outside Zizzi in an ""extremely serious condition"" Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill after attending the incident, was treated in hospital but discharged on 22 March Det Sgt Nick Bailey was seriously ill 48 people were assessed in hospital in relation to the incident Ms Skripal was released from hospital on 9 April and her father was discharged on 18 May. Both were taken to a secure location Police believe the Skripals were ""targeted specifically"" and are treating the case as attempted murder. Detectives believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok at the front door of their home. Traces of Novichok were alsofound at the Mill and Zizzi, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant at the same time weretold to wash their clothes and possessions. Officers later focused searches in and around Mr Skripal's home and a nearby children's play area at Montgomery Gardens was cordoned off by police. Police appealed for anyone who saw the pair in Mr Skripal's red BMW - licence plate number HD09 WAO - on the morning of the attack. Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident A vehicle that is believed to have been used by Mr Skripal's friend to pick up Yulia from the airport on 3 March was removed from Durrington, Wiltshire, by the Army on 19 March. Witness Jamie Paine said he saw a woman on a bench frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". A doctor, who was shopping with her husband in the city centre on Sunday, said Ms Skripal was ""slumped in her seat, completely unconscious"" and had lost control of her bodily functions. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" The investigation has so far involved 250 specialist counter-terrorism officers and about 180 military personnel, who were deployed to Salisbury to help remove vehicles and objects that may have been contaminated. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, stressed the risk of harm to the public was ""low"" but there was some concern that prolonged exposure could cause health problems. Personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire identified the nerve agent. Its head saidthe precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tested samples of the chemical. Russia accused Britain of blocking access to the OPCW inquiry, but its proposal for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals, who go by the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are suspects in the attempted murder. They are understood to have arrived at Gatwick Airport on Russian passports from Moscow on 2 March, and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. The following day they visited Salisbury for reconnaissance before contaminating Mr Skripal's front door with Novichok on 4 March, police say. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that same night. The men, whose movements were captured on various CCTV cameras, are thought to be aged about 40 and operating under aliases. The officers are thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, and the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, Theresa May has said. In an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, the men said they were tourists, in the UK to visit the ""wonderful town"" of Salisbury andsee its famous cathedral. Details have since emerged showing the man calling himself Alexander Petrov has made around 10 trips to Europe in the last two years. Documents first obtained by the investigative group Bellingcat, shared with the BBC, show that as well as visiting Paris, Geneva and Amsterdam, he appears to have visited the UK three times. He seems to have visited once in September 2016, again between 28 February and 5 March 2017 and finally in March this year- during the period Sergei Skripal was poisoned. On the final visit, the pair both travelled on genuine Russian passports. Recently published pages from Mr Petrov's passport dossiers contain unusual stamps and a blank page where there is normally biographical data - all evidence which may point to the men being undercover intelligence officers, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said. An investigation by Bellingcat has claimed thereal identity of the man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov is actually Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga- a highly decorated military officer. Bellingcat later said the suspect calling himselfAlexander Petrov is Alexander Mishkin, a doctorwho has worked for Russian intelligence since 2010. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians Since the attack, the Kremlin's media machine has responded with a combination of denials and sarcasm. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two suspects are civilians, not criminals and he hoped the men would tell their story soon. A day later an interview with the men was broadcast by Russia's state-run international broadcaster. The Russian foreign ministry had previously called Mrs May's allegations ""insane"", and said the names and photographs of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to Moscow"". At a UN Security Council meeting in September to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and its own citizens. Mission implausible: Russians mock improbable spy duo Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Previously, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or possibly the United States. Another theory - offered by Russia's EU ambassador, Vladimir Chizhov - suggested a UK research laboratory in Wiltshire could be the source. No. Prosecutors will not apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. Sue Hemming, of the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said there was enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"" and it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to charge them with the Salisbury attack. Police say officers continue to work with the CPS on the Amesbury incident. Could the suspects be returned to the UK? Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK. In recent years Mr Skripal is thought to have given lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. A friend from college, Vladimir Svyatski, described Mr Skripal as ""very active, with a positive attitude and creative"". Former colleague Oleg Ivanov told the BBC he was ""the life and soul of the party"". Hiscondition improved from critical to stableon 6 April, and Salisbury District Hospital said he was  responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". He was discharged on 18 May and moved to a secure location. Read more about the poisoned spy Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father His daughter, Yulia, regularly travelled to the UK from her Moscow home to visit her father, relatives told the BBC. ""She told me she liked everything [in the UK],"" childhood friend Irina Petrova said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, Ms Petrova said, and had been the ""perfect kid"", achieving excellent grades at school. Ms Skripal, who friends say worked for multinationals including Nike and PepsiCo, was ""always smiling, just like her mother"", Ms Petrova added. The 33-year-old was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April and taken to a secure location. It is not known what long-term effects she might suffer. This video can not be played CCTV shows Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died in 2012 after suffering from cancer. His elder brother and son have died in the past two years. Some of the deaths, the family believe, happened in suspicious circumstances. The grave of Liudmila Skripal, Sergei's wife, is in London Road Cemetery in Salisbury His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure. He is buried in Salisbury, close to his mother. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6 and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. On 5 April, an unverified recording purported to be between Yulia Skripal and her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, was broadcast on Russian TV. In the recording, Viktoria said she hoped to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be Yulia's tells her that no-one will give her one. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the recording. In the weeks after the poisoning, Theresa May pointed the finger at Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats and their families from the UK. She also said: Ministers and the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia Russian state assets would be frozen if there was evidence they would be used as a weapon against UK nationals and residents Checks on private flights, customs and freight would be increased All planned high-level contacts between the UK and Russia would be suspended The state invitation to Russian's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was retracted In solidarity, 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Germany and France, expelled 145 Russian officials - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow initially responded in kind, expelling 23 British diplomats, 60 US diplomats and several from other countries. It also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Russia then increased that number to 50, as its ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals. Together they have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were poisoned by Novichok Police are linking the attack on the Skripals to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowleywere exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser, labelled Nina Ricci Premier Jour. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing a small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. Scotland Yard said the bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok nerve agents The possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning ofAlexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. An investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that there have been at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia.

What was the Cold War?,"Tensions have escalated following the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the US It was a dramatic show of solidarity that has escalated long-standing tensions between Russia and the West. On Monday, the US and its allies expelled dozens of Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the UK. It was the biggest such expulsion since the height of the Cold War era and the hostilities with the then Soviet Union. There are now fears of a serious diplomatic crisis and a freezing in relations between Moscow and the West which has raised the spectre of the Cold War once again. Dozens of Russian diplomats expelled What the diplomat expulsions tell us Full coverage of Russia spy poisoning This term describes the tense relationship between the US and the Soviet Union from 1945 to 1989. Neither side ever fought the other directly because the fear of nuclear war, which gripped millions of people at the time, was too terrifying to contemplate. Instead, historians consider it to be a war between two opposing systems of government. The US and the West represented capitalism and the Soviet Union represented communism. Both sides had very different ideas of how to run a country and both believed their system was superior. A source of major tension was that they both believed the other side was trying to spread their belief system around the world. US astronaut Neil Armstrong on the moon. Space exploration was the focus of fierce competition during the Cold War There is no single answer to this, but historians generally point to the end of World War Two in 1945 as a key turning point. This is because during the war the US and Soviet Union had been allies, but the relationship was forged in the face of a common enemy in Nazi Germany and did not last. The war left Europe divided and the two sides emerged as the world's most dominant superpowers. Given their opposing belief systems, there were disagreements about how the post-war world should be ordered and how Europe should be divided up. This sparked a fierce rivalry and a freezing in relations as both powers competed for dominance. This video can not be played WATCH: Find out what it was like to work in a ballistic missile complex The two sides organised into major alliances. The US and the West formed Nato, and the Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Pact with eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary. Crucially, both sides feared the other and so they began to rapidly build and stockpile weapons. By the 1960s, the US and the Soviet Union could deliver nuclear missiles across continents at high speeds. By the end of the decade both sides had developed anti-ballistic missile systems to defend themselves. Nuclear war was narrowly averted following theCuban Missile Crisisin 1962. Proxy wars, whereby the US and Soviet Union supported a side without participating directly, were commonplace. ""The Cold War was never really that cold,"" says Malcolm Craig, a senior lecturer in US history at Liverpool John Moores University. ""Millions of people died in proxy conflicts or in conflicts that the superpower struggle imposed itself on without any recognition of the conflict's fundamental local nature. For Cambodians, Congolese, Koreans, Ethiopians, Somalians, and many, many others, the Cold War was very much a hot war."" There are certainly echoes of the Cold War in the recent expulsions of Russian diplomats. In 1986 for example, the US and the Soviet Union exchanged tit-for-tat expulsions over a period of several weeks. US President Ronald Reagan expelled 80 Russian diplomats, five of whom were suspected of spying. US President Ronald Reagan expelled dozens of Russian diplomats in 1986 There have also been comparisons made between the poisoning of a former Russian spy and Soviet behaviour during the Cold War. ""The Soviet Union clearly did try and kill people abroad who they didn't like,"" says Michael Cox, Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics. ""So it isn't that Russia is doing anything novel in that regard."" But the history of this kind of behaviour from Russia goes back further than the Cold War. ""The tactics that are making the news, such as assassinations, have a much deeper history than the Cold War era,"" says Malcolm Craig. ""The sense that we face a new Cold War because of such tactics is slightly false."" So how worried should we be? ""We still have nuclear weapons and these are still a major deterrent. There are important economic relations between Russia and the EU which are not insignificant. There are also many Russians who live in the West,"" says Michael Cox. Russia has important economic ties to the EU which may make sanctions more effective There are also fundamental differences between the Soviet Union and modern-day Russia that make the current tensions less worrying. ""Russia is not the Soviet Union, and its international position is quite, quite different,"" says Malcolm Craig. ""It is much more tightly integrated into the global economic system than the USSR was, making it more susceptible to economic pressure."" ""I can't imagine that Putin would want a long-term freezing of relations and more and more sanctions,"" adds Michael Cox. But he warns that the present tensions are unpredictable. ""The one thing the Cold War managed to do, at least until 1989, was keep the two sides quite far apart from one another. There was a kind of spheres of influence acceptance,"" he says. ""The demarcation zones seem to have broken down completely.""

Boyzone founder 'never heard' of victim,"The court heard Sophie Lionnet's body showed signs of ""significant violence"" A former member of Boyzone embroiled in the murder case of his ex-girlfriend's French nanny told jurors he ""never, ever"" had any contact with the victim. Mark Walton was allegedly a focal point of his former partner's campaign of torture against Sophie Lionnet. Sabrina Kouider, 35, and Ouissem Medouni, 40, beat the 21-year-old au pair into a confessionthat she was in league with Mr Walton to spy on the family, the Old Bailey heard. They deny killing her hours later. Ms Lionnet's body wasthrown on to a bonfire in their garden in Southfields, south-west London, the court heard. Sophie Lionnet's body was found after neighbours raised concerns about a fire in a back garden Giving evidence, Mr Walton, who is based in Los Angeles, told jurors his ex-partner, Ms Kouider, would ""flip"" during their two-year turbulent relationship. He would support the fashion designer with thousands of pounds every month, even paying her rent long after she left him, he told the court. On their relationship, he said: ""It was turbulent, probably the most turbulent relationship I had ever been in. ""She would go from a softly spoken French accent, then she would flip, get very angry, very loud and just not care where we were. ""She would just go crazy over something trivial."" The first he heard about Miss Lionnet was on 21 September last year when he was contacted by murder detectives, he said. Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider deny murder Referring to accusations levelled at him by Ms Kouider, prosecutor Richard Horwell QC said: ""Have you ever been party to a plot to drug the people in the Wimbledon flat and, whilst unconscious, sexually abuse the occupants?"" Mr Walton said: ""Absolutely not."" He said the last time he was in the UK was when he went to a meeting in October 2015 and he told jurors he had ""never, ever"" heard of Ms Lionnet or ever been in contact with her. Mr Walton told jurors he ""created"" Boyzone in 1993 and was in the band for about a year before going on to be involved in Fifth Avenue. 1993:Auditions take place for a new Irish boyband. Mark Walton, along with Keith Duffy, Ronan Keating, Shane Lynch and Richie Rock form Boyzone and are later managed by Louis Walsh 1994:Mark Walton and Richie Rock leave the band 2000s:After Boyzone, Mr Walton sets up a band called Fifth Avenue, and also gets involved with the management of Irish girlband B*Witched 2015:Mr Walton appears as a judge on Vietnam's Pop Idol 2017:Mr Walton named during the murder case of his ex-girlfriend's French nanny By the time he met Ms Kouider in 2011 he was doing well financially in the music business, he said. Mr Walton said he paid for Ms Kouider's nannies but she would fire them over accusations of stealing and of being interested in him, the court heard. ""I actually challenged Sabrina on this. I did not believe her,"" he told the court. Ms Kouider and Mr Medouni have admitted perverting the course of justice but deny murder. The trial continues.

Harassment victims 'need more protection',"Victims of sexual harassment at work need better protection, the equality watchdog has said. The Equality and Human Rights Commission called upon ministers to take ""urgent action"" to tackle ""corrosive"" cultures. Its report said employers should be legally obliged to prevent harassment or victimisation after concluding that the problem had become ""normalised"". The commission said it had found ""truly shocking"" examples of harassment. It highlighted cases including a 17-year-old worker who locked herself in a toilet after male colleagues ""joked"" about rape, and a woman who revealed she lost her job and her health after speaking out. Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the commission, said employers were failing to take consistent and effective action. ""Corrosive cultures have silenced individuals and sexual harassment has been normalised,"" she said. 'I can't report boss for bullying' Is #meToo changing Hollywood? ""We need urgent action to turn the tables in British workplaces, shifting from the current culture of people risking their jobs and health in order to report harassment, to placing the onus on employers to prevent and resolve it. ""It cannot be right that millions of people go to work fearing what might have happened by the time they come home."" The commission also said companies should not be allowed to use non-disclosure agreements to cover up sexual harassment. Neil Carberry of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, said companies would welcome a statutory code of practice to ensure that non-disclosure agreements never silenced victims. ""The CBI recommends that employers make it explicit that any confidentiality clauses do not prevent a person from whistleblowing on systematic abuses of power,"" he said. If staff were not being properly protected from sexual harassment by customers or clients, Mr Carberry said it may be necessary to introduce additional legal protections to ensure everyone felt safe and respected at work. Too many employers are still ignoring or even silencing victims of harassment, according to Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society. Carole Easton, head of the Young Women's Trust, added: ""We have heard a huge amount of testimonies that show how widespread this problem is, but so far we have seen very little action."" The issue of workplace sexual harassment has been repeatedly highlighted this year, following the downfall of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, sparking the #MeToo movement. More than 300 actresses, writers and directors have launched aproject to help fight sexual harassmentin the film industry and other workplaces. In January there was widespread outrage after the Financial Times reported that an undercover reporter and many other women working as hostesseswere gropedat a male-only annual charity dinner run by the Presidents Club.

"2,000 jobs under threat at fashion chain","About 2,000 jobs are under threat as another high street retailer faces tough trading conditions. The company that owns Select, a fashion chain aimed at young women, is seeking a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) that would allow it to slash rents. The chain has 183 stores in England and Wales also sells 4,000 items online. Genus UK, Select's owner, has no plans to close stores, but the proposal includes an option for landlords to ""take back loss-making sites"". Earlier this month another fashion chain, New Look,New Look, announced plans to close 60 storesas part of a rescue deal to keep it afloat. Rents at the remaining 400 New Look stores will be cut and almost 1,000 staff face redundancy. Six reasons behind the High Street crisis All Toys R Us stores to close Andrew Andronikou of business advisory firm Quantuma, which is aiding Genus with the CVA, said the chain had been hit by the ""depressed retail market and escalating rent and rate charges"". ""The loss of anchor tenants on high streets and in smaller shopping centres has had a downward spiralling effect on stores such as Select, culminating in a reduction of footfall and therefore custom,"" he said. ""The position for this business, and many businesses of the same model is no longer tenable and has escalated to the present situation where a CVA is considered to be the only option, other than closing it in its entirety."" Cutting rents is the main aim of the CVA and it was not clear how many stores the company aimed to close. Genus UK made a loss of Â£1.5m on sales of Â£81m for the year to June 2016.

Has Kim Jong-un taken a train to Beijing?,"A high-level official, thought to be North Korea's leader, is now in Beijing There is widespread speculation that a senior North Korean official who made a surprise day-long visit to Beijing was Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Japanese media outlets first reported that a high-profile figure had arrived via a North Korean diplomatic train and was met with tight security. South Korea said it did not know the official's identity, but that it was trying to verify the situation. It would be Mr Kim's first foreign visit since taking office in 2011. There has been no official comment from North Korea, while China's foreign ministry said it had ""no information for the moment"", but more would ""be published in due course"". A visit by Mr Kim to Beijing would be seen as a significant development. Last month, US President Donald Trump accepted an unprecedented invitation to meet Mr Kim, and officials are believed to be working behind the scenes to work out the complex diplomatic requirements. Analysts have said the North Korean and Chinese leaders would be likely to meet before that summit goes ahead. China is North Korea's main economic ally. Japanese media reported on the train's arrival into Beijing on Monday evening. Footage of the train from the Tokyo-based Nippon News Network showed a green carriage with yellow horizontal lines. People in Beijing described seeing ""unusual"" scenes, including tightened security outside the train station, and tourists being ushered out of the capital's Tiananmen Square, which usually signals a high-level meeting in the Great Hall of the People there. Bloomberg cited three unnamed sources,externalas saying the visitor was Mr Kim. Chinese policemen block a road as a procession believed to be North Korean officials pass near Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing But analysts speaking to South Korea's Yonhap news said the official could also be Mr Kim's younger sister Kim Yo-jong, who recently made an appearance at the Winter Olympics in South Korea, or military official Choe Ryong-hae. ""We have not confirmed yet who has travelled to Beijing,"" said an official from the presidential office in Seoul. ""We are carefully watching the situation... with all possibilities in mind."" At the Chinese border city of Dandong, the main railway link between China and North Korea, similarly unusual scenes were also seen. Allow Twitter content?

The train, believed to be carrying the North Korean delegation, pulled out of Beijing on Tuesday afternoon, although it is not clear where it is headed next. It is not clear when North Korean or Chinese officials will release more details about the visit. Mr Kim's late father and predecessor Kim Jong-il had also made trips abroad by train, but these were often not confirmed until after the visits were over. Japanese media say the green and yellow train resembles the one used by Kim Jong-il when he visited China and Russia in 2011. Kim Jong-Il taking the train during his 2011 Russia trip South Korean daily Chosun Ibo has previously reported that Kim Jong-Il's armoured train featured about 90 carriages, and contained conference rooms, an audience chamber and bedrooms, with satellite phones and televisions installed for briefings. According to reports, Kim Jong-il had several private trains, and, while travelling by train across Russia, had live lobsters air-lifted to the train each day. Kim Jong-il and his father Kim Il-sung favoured trains to flights when visiting China and Russia, often attributed to a reported fear of heights, BBC Monitoring reports.

Yachtsman missing after falling overboard,"John Fisher was part of the 13-strong Sun Hung Kai/ Scallywag crew A British yachtsman is missing at sea after falling overboard off the tip of South America during a round-the-world race. John Fisher, 47, from Southampton, was washed overboard 1,400 miles west of Cape Horn at 13:42 GMT on Monday, said organisers of the Volvo Ocean Race. The Sun Hung Kai/ Scallywag crew have been searching for Mr Fisher, who was wearing survival equipment. A ship approximately 400 nautical miles away has been diverted to the scene. The rescue operation is being co-ordinated by the race control centre in Alicante. Race organisers said: ""Naturally we are deeply concerned, especially given the weather conditions, and race control in Alicante is supporting the Scallywag team and MRCC throughout the operation."" The Volvo Ocean Race is a 45,000 nautical mile race around the world and the teams were on day nine of the seventh leg from Auckland, New Zealand to Iajai, Brazil when Mr Fisher went missing. The 2017-18 race is the 13th - and longest - edition of the event, that was first held in 1973 when it was known as the Whitbread Round The World Race. Mr Fisher, who now lives in Adelaide but competes for Great Britain, is taking part in the race for the first time.

Gay wedding ban sparks cruise boycott call,"Carnival's Queen Mary 2 is registered in Bermuda Carnival Corporation, the cruise firm that owns P&O and Cunard, is facing a boycott from LGBT travellers after halting gay weddings on some ships. The company was forced to stop allowing same-sex unions on its ships that are registered in Bermuda. The British Overseas Territory legalised gay weddings in May last year, but the law was repealed last month following a change of government. That legally prevented Carnival from allowing same-sex ceremonies on board. A P&O Cruises spokesman said: ""Carnival Corporation believes that same sex marriage should be legalised in Bermuda and therefore we are opposed to the new law. We are currently working with local interest groups in Bermuda and elsewhere to explore options in relation to this."" Some LGBT travel agencies have called for a boycott of Carnival cruises because the company has not moved the registration of its ships to another jurisdiction. P&O Cruises has six ships registered in Bermuda, while Cunard has three. London-listed Carnival is the world's largest cruise operator with about half the market and a fleet of 102 ships. Bermuda restores same-sex marriage ban UK government won't block Bermuda gay marriage ban Nick Harding-McKay, a director of London agency Travel Designers, backed a boycott of Carnival and argued that the company was not forced to register its ships in Bermuda. Consumer pressure on Carnival would encourage the firm to lobby the island's government, he added. ""There's not a lot of pressure being put on them it seems."" Darren Burn, founder and managing director of OutOfOffice.com, a gay travel agency, said some customers had raised the issue with his staff. He said Carnival had a ""duty to their customers"" to convince the Bermudian government to restore marriage equality. ""It's a business decision to register their ships there - why should LGBT discrimination be treated any differently to ethnic or disability discrimination?"" Mr Burn was also concerned about the message sent by Bermuda's decision to reverse marriage equality, which he argued was ""more dangerous than not changing the law in the first place"". Bermuda has a population of about 65,000 and tourism is one of its biggest industries, with more than 600,000 visitors a year - most of whom are American. Some US gay rights groups have called for LGBT travellers to boycott Bermuda in the wake of the ban. Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted earlier this month: Allow Twitter content?

However, some LGBT activists in Bermuda oppose a tourism boycott of the island.Kenita Placide said,externalmany LGBT people work in the tourism industry, while Linda Miezer said a boycott would ""cause people to discriminate against the LGBT community"". Tony Brannon, a Bermudian campaigner, said reinstating the island's gay wedding ban had ""given Bermuda a huge PR black eye"". Legalisation came about after the Bermuda supreme court ruled that excluding same-sex couples from marriage amounted to discrimination. TheDomestic Partnerships Actwas then passed by Bermuda's House of Assembly and signed into law by the island's governor John Rankin last month, making Bermuda the first country to revoke gay marriage. Mr Brannon said a case would be heard by the supreme court in May arguing that the ban violated Bermuda's constitution. If the legal challenge was successful, he hoped the government would accept the decision. As Bermuda is an overseas dependent territory, the UK government could have blocked Bermuda's move to ban same-sex unions. However, Foreign Office minister Harriett Baldwin told the Commons last month that it ""would not be appropriate to use this power to block legislation, which can only can be used where there is a legal or constitutional basis for doing so, and even then only in exceptional circumstances"". Labour MP Chris Bryant said Britain's failure to act ""totally undermines UK efforts to advance LGBT rights"".

First and second-class stamp prices rise,"The 2p price rise in the cost of first and second class stamps has now taken effect. A first-class stamp now costs 67p and a second-class stamp now costs 58p, under the price rises that came into force on Monday. Stamps bought before the price rise can still be used without any need to top-up the cost. Royal Mail said the squeeze on consumer finances was considered when setting the new price. But it added that the price rise was needed to maintain the universal postal service, which means that the price of a stamp is the same irrespective of where in the UK the letter is sent from and to. If the price of a first-class stamp had risen in line with inflation since 1989, it would now cost 41p. If the price of a second-class stamp had risen in line with inflation since 1989, it would now cost 31p. The price of a first-class stamp for a large letter has risen by 3p to Â£1.01. A second-class stamp for a large letter has also risen in cost by 3p to 79p. All the changes were first announced in February.

Trump 'strongly' denies porn star affair,"This video can not be played White House: The president ""has consistently denied these allegations"" The White House has denied allegations that Donald Trump had an affair with an adult-film actress. Stormy Daniels gave details about the alleged 2006 affair during an interview on CBS News' 60 Minutes programme. ""The president doesn't believe that any of the claims that Ms Daniels made last night in her interview were accurate,"" said spokesman Raj Shah. President Trump's lawyers are seeking $20m (Â£14m) in damages from her, saying she broke a non-disclosure deal. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? The president and the porn star: Why this matters Ex-model apologises for 'Trump affair' Ms Daniels, 39, told CBS in an interview aired on Sunday night that she had accepted $130,000 in ""hush money"" from Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, just before the 2016 election. This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: 'I was threatened' Ms Daniels is suing the president, alleging that the non-disclosure she signed is invalid because Mr Trump did not sign it. On Monday, she amended her lawsuit to include Mr Cohen as a defendant, claiming he defamed her with a statement he made about the payment. ""Just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage,"" Mr Cohen said in a mid-February statement. ""I will always protect Mr Trump."" The amended lawsuit also claims the payment violated campaign-finance laws. She said she originally accepted the ""hush money"" and signed the deal because she was concerned for the safety of her family. Ms Daniels claimed in the Sunday night interview she was threatened by a stranger in a car park in 2011 to ""leave Trump alone"". But Mr Shah said the president does not believe Ms Daniels' claim to be true, adding that Mr Cohen would need to be asked about the specifics of their monetary arrangement. ""The president strongly, clearly and consistently has denied these underlying claims, and the only person who has been inconsistent is the one making the claims,"" said Mr Shah. This video can not be played Legal problems mount for Trump Mr Cohen's lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to Ms Daniels following the interview, dismissing her claims about being threatened by a stranger. ""Mr Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,"" said a letter by Mr Cohen's attorney, Brent Blakely. The letter also said Ms Daniels needed to immediately ""retract and apologise to Mr Cohen through the national media for your defamatory statements on '60 Minutes,' and make clear that you have no facts or evidence whatsoever to support your allegations that my client had anything whatsoever to do with this alleged thug"". Mr Trump - who has no public events scheduled for Monday - did not comment himself about Ms Daniels' story. Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, says she had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006 But he did tweet earlier: ""So much Fake News. Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all, our country is doing great!"" Mr Shah said Ms Daniels' had been ""inconsistent"" in her claims about the sexual encounter. ""My understanding is that she signed the statements that conflict with what she said last night,"" he said, refuting Ms Daniels' claim that she felt pressured to sign the nondisclosure agreement despite her objections. Ms Daniels is one of three women who have taken legal action that could damage Mr Trump. Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims she had an affair with Mr Trump between 2006 and 2007, has filed a lawsuit to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with tabloid newspaper the National Enquirer. 'Mere allegations' wrecking lives - Trump Polygraph backs porn star's Trump story Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she had consensual unprotected sex with Mr Trump once, in a hotel room during a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, California, in July 2006. Mr Trump married Melania Trump in 2005. And Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice, accuses Mr Trump of sexually assaulting her at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. Mrs Trump - who has not publicly responded to the claims made in Ms Daniels' interview - did not return to the White House with her husband on Sunday from Florida. The US first lady is said to be staying at Mar-a-Lago estate for spring holiday. Michael Cohen has sent Stormy Daniels a cease-and-desist letter Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Mrs Trump was ""focused on being a mom and is quite enjoying spring break at Mar-a-Lago while working on future projects"". Ms Daniels has meanwhile been capitalising on the purported scandal. The 60 minutes interview- with 22.1m viewers- was its highest viewed episode in 10 years, according to CBS. She has reportedly extended her nationwide tour of strip clubs, Making America Horny Again, until November. Ms Daniels has also been touting a $14.99-per-month subscription to her naked web cam service.

What the expulsions tell us,"This video can not be played The war of words between the UK and Russia This is building into the most serious diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West since Moscow's seizure of the Crimea. Whatever the denials, Britain's allies have clearly accepted London's view - thatthe use of a military grade nerve agent in an assassination attempt in a British citywas ""highly likely"" to be the work of the Russian state. The collective expulsion of Russian diplomats from the US and 14 European Union statesis a remarkable show of solidarity with Britain; even more so because it comes at a time when UK-EU relations are strained due to the Brexit negotiations. Indeed Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, noted that ""additional measures, including further expulsions were not excluded in the coming days"" - a tough signal to Moscow as it considers how it will respond. This is a significant diplomatic victory for Prime Minister Theresa May, and also marks a significant toughening of the Trump administration's stance towards Russia. Britain was swift to point the finger at Moscow. But then it largely avoided public diatribes, seeking out every available international forum, from the EU, to Nato, the UN, and the highly relevant OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons) to set out its evidence and justify its conclusions. This patient diplomacy has now paid off. This video can not be played The BBC's Paul Adams looks at why the UK is expelling 23 Russian diplomats One must assume that many or most of the Russian diplomats designated for expulsion are intelligence operatives. Thus the cumulative impact on Russia's overseas intelligence activities could be considerable. Russia must now ponder what actions it will take in response. But President Putin could never have imagined there would be this degree of solidarity. Russia perceived Britain as weak and increasingly isolated; the EU as distracted; and the Trump administration as off-balance and compromised by President Trump's own curious unwillingness to castigate Moscow. Mr Putin may have made a serious mistake. This is in many ways a remarkable display of concerted European action, though he may prefer to note that by no means all members of the EU have participated. Russian spy: What we know so far Ex-spy asked Putin if he could go home It may be the US shift, though, that is most significant. Mr Trump's approach to Russia has been curiously lenient and unfocused. But the US diplomatic action is noteworthy because it doesn't just involve throwing out 48 diplomats in the US and closing the Russian Consulate General in Seattle. It also includes the separate expulsion of 12 Russian diplomats at the UN who are described by the State Department as ""intelligence operatives"" who have ""abused their privilege of residence in the United States"". Only a few days ago Mr Trump was seemingly setting aside the Salisbury attack and talking about a new summit with Mr Putin. Will this now go ahead? And if so when? It remains to be seen what the frostiness will mean for long-term US-Russia relations The current row comes just as the cast-list overseeing US foreign policy is changing significantly, with former CIA chief Mike Pompeo taking over at the State Department and John Bolton at the National Security Council. While both men are closely in tune with the president on policy towards Iran and North Korea, Mr Pompeo must have a comprehensive understanding of Moscow's disruptive activities from his intelligence job, and Mr Bolton has long been an advocate of a tougher stance towards Moscow. What happens when you expel a diplomat? Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Russian diplomats leave UK Russia is clearly in the diplomatic dog-house; and a frostier period of relations between Moscow and the West beckons. But this is also a moment for Western governments to define exactly what the Russian ""problem"" is. Rhetoric about a new ""Cold War"" and a significant defensive build-up is all very well, but probably wide of the mark. The poisoning of Sergei Skripal - which the UK and its allies blame on Moscow - has put Russia in the diplomatic dog-house It overstates the case: Russia is not the Soviet Union, a global player with an ideology that mobilises people around the world. It has its strengths but also its weaknesses, not least its economy. In recent years Mr Putin has made a good hand out of focusing Russia's capabilities on places that matter to Russia, where it has strong historical or diplomatic links. Essentially Russia is a power close to home, in what Russians call the ""near abroad"". Thus it can mount a threat to Georgia or Ukraine. Syria in a strange way could also be included in this ""near abroad"". Russian ""power"" may be reaching its zenith. It retains, though, an extraordinary ability to create trouble more broadly through hacking, information warfare, and by backing extremist political parties. To counter this, Western governments and societies may need to spend some more on defence; but they certainly need to spend a great deal more on making their societies more resilient. The first thing is to reach a common and comprehensive assessment of the problem. And the use of a nerve agent in the quiet cathedral city of Salisbury may just have set that process in motion.

What next for Russiaâs spy networks?,"It's not the first time the UK has sent officials back to Moscow en masse On 24 September, 1971 there was a party in the headquarters of MI5. The safe that was used to stash bottles of drink was opened up and a bottle or two pulled out for a toast. The reason was ""Operation Foot"" - the expulsion from the UK of 105 Soviet officials linked to espionage. Moscow's spies had been running riot in Britain through much of the 1960s. There were so many that MI5 was struggling to keep tabs on their movements. That expulsion was a blow that the KGB, the Soviet Union's intelligence service, never quite recovered from. In that instance, while allies congratulated Britain they did not follow through in the same way.This time it has been different. But will the impact be as great? The avowed goal this time is both to send a message, and to have a substantial impact on the ability of Russia's intelligence services to collect secrets and carry out operations abroad. As in the Cold War, intelligence officers at embassies are used to recruit and run agents who supply classified material to Moscow. They come from the GRU - military intelligence - and the SVR, the foreign intelligence successor to the KGB. Relationships with any agents they are running may be interrupted, perhaps fatally. More than in the Cold War, these (and other colleagues from Russia's domestic security service, the FSB) may also have a mission in gathering intelligence on exiles as well. Some will have been involved in ""active measures"" - covert activities which can include the spreading of propaganda and political influence. These activities may be handicapped. Inside UK lab that identified ex-spy nerve agent What happens when you expel a diplomat? As well as the sheer volume of suspected spies expelled from multiple countries, one of the most significant moves may be the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle, said to be because of its proximity to a submarine base and to the aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which has a large chunk of its global workforce in the area. President Trump has ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle, which stands near a US Navy submarine base These consulates can play a significant role in espionage since they act not only as a base for intelligence officers, but also potentially as a home to communications interception equipment. The impact may not be quite the same as the Cold War though. One reason is cyberspace. In the past, the only way for Moscow to gather intelligence or steal secrets was through human intelligence or intercepting communications, but now it can reach out using its effective cyber-operators to steal secrets and gather non-classified material remotely. This is not a total substitute for the human intelligence provided by agents - and the two often combine in practice - but it does offer a new avenue. Cyberspace may also offer a route for Moscow to strike back against the countries that have expelled its officers - perhaps not just by stealing secrets but by carrying out ""active measures"", ""influence operations"" and even sabotage online in a way which was not possible in the past, but is now. Is Russia really interfering in European states? Russia and the West: A century of subversion and suspicion Everyone knows Russia will respond with its own expulsions.But the truth is that most countries, even the US, are thought to have fewer spies in Russia than Russia does in their territories. Russia will also send out new spies to replace the old. The hope will be that the scale of these expulsions - and the international nature of them - will deter Russia from using its spies abroad to carry out acts like those it is suspected of being involved with in Salisbury. The disruption will also allow the counter-espionage, spy-hunting services, like MI5 in the UK and the FBI, to gather breath and re-focus their efforts once again. And so, perhaps there might be another bottle pulled from a safe for a celebration after the latest expulsions.

UK lab that identified nerve agent,"Porton Down is building a facility for the analysis of explosives The UK's military research base at Porton Down has been at the heart of the investigation into what happened to Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The BBC has been granted exclusive access to the Wiltshire lab. The headquarters of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down is a sprawling campus. Stern warning signs and red flags make clear it is a sensitive facility as you approach. And beyond the security perimeter, there are buildings old and new, some with open-plan offices, others with labs. An urgent call came in here in the early hours of Monday 5 March. DSTL is used to being contacted in response to major incidents in the UK such as terrorist attacks. But this was different. This time the incident was only a few miles down the road in Salisbury. A man and a woman had been found on a park bench the previous day and it had become clear they were not suffering from an ordinary illness. 'No way' spy nerve agent came from UK lab Russian spy: What we know so far Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? UK accused of 'anti-Russian campaign' A few hours after the call, one of the Specialist Response Teams, ready 24/7 for such calls, was deployed. The initial symptoms from the patients seemed consistent with a nerve agent. The team collected samples which were then analysed at the labs in Porton Down. This video can not be played Porton Down chief: Russia's poison accusation 'just not true' We were shown one lab where one type of test can be undertaken on such samples, but officials will not go into details about the exact chemistry involved with the tests after Salisbury. However, the tests did confirm that a military-grade nerve agent had been deployed on the streets of Britain. A combination of this scientific analysis and other information would in turn lead to the government's conclusion that it was highly likely Russia was behind the attack. DSTL officials say that its role has been to use its scientific expertise to support the police investigation, including the need to keep material forensically secure so there is a proper evidential trail, as well as assist the medical teams involved in treatment and help with broader public health concerns. It has been helping check the police and emergency workers who have been to various locations to make sure that they have not been contaminated. This has all led to a far higher profile for the site than it has been used to. We were invited into the site but there were strict limits about what we were able to see. Armed police and dogs patrol the perimeter. Not all the attention has been welcome. Russian officials have made pointed reference to the proximity of Porton Down to Salisbury with the suggestion the nerve agent might even have come from here. Chief executive Gary Aitkenhead said Porton Down had the highest levels of controls of security That is something the chief executive of DSTL is firm in denying. ""We've got the highest levels of controls of security around the work that we do here,"" Gary Aitkenhead told me. ""We would not be allowed to operate if we had lack of control that could result in anything leaving the four walls of our facility here. ""There's no way that agent would have left. We have complete confidence that nothing could have come from here out into the wider world."" Asked if it was frustrating to hear such accusations, he said: ""It is coincidence that it is down the road [and] that this has happened. It is frustrating to hear that and it is just not true. "" Porton Down emphasises the work undertaken there is purely defensive Officials are keen to emphasise that the work here is defensive only. In one building, the size and shape of a bungalow, we are shown a sealed metal chamber. Inside a robot called ""Porton Man"" wears a military protection suit as live agents are pumped in. The aim is to see what defence the suit offers over time as the robot moves. Huge effort needs to then go into cleaning the chamber and disposing of the agents. The work here is also much broader then just dealing with chemical and biological weapons but also covers ballistics, explosives and cyber security amongst other fields. Officials say the defensive remit has increasingly moved to supporting homeland security as well as the military in recent years. A large building is being constructed in one corner of the campus. There have been claims from Russia that it might be some kind of chemical weapons factory. ""That's just nonsense. This is a defensive organisation,"" Sir David Pepper, the chairman of DSTL, told the BBC, in response to those claims. Officials at DSTL say the planning application has long been available at the local council, explaining that it going to be a new facility for forensic analysis of explosives. DSTL has been involved in recent investigations including the attack at the Manchester Arena last year. New money to upgrade facilities was recently announced. International inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have arrived in the UK. They have been to the location in Salisbury and have also been given permission, following approval by a judge, to take a sample of the Skripals' blood. They are also present at Porton Down itself. The DSTL is an OPCW certified lab and the inspectors will be carrying out their own work here and at other labs around the world to independently verify the work done by DSTL.

Missing Corrie search to be stood down,"Corrie Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was last seen at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016 There are ""no realistic lines of inquiry left"" in the investigation into the disappearance of RAF airman Corrie Mckeague, police have said. Mr Mckeague was 23 when he was last seen on 24 September 2016 walking into a bin loading bay in Bury St Edmunds. Suffolk Police said the inquiry, which has cost Â£2.1m, had been handed to a cold case team but remained open. Det Supt Katie Elliott said: ""It is extremely disappointing that we have not been able to find Corrie."" ""We have now reached a point where we are unable to make any further progress, and have gone as far as we realistically can with the information we have,"" she added. A police spokesman said the case had always been a missing persons investigation and there is no evidence of ""criminal activity or third party involvement"". A landfill site was extensively searched as part of the investigation By Alex Dunlop, BBC East senior defence reporter Corrie Mckeague had no reason to vanish. He comes from a loving family and has a strong second family - his fellow gunners at RAF Honington. I use the present tense because he is still officially missing, but the police and his parents now hold out little hope that the Scottish airman is still alive. Why has this 18-month investigation gained such huge public interest? A combination of factors: Corrie is a serviceman, his girlfriend - unbeknown to him - was pregnant with his baby daughter and his family have kept the search for him in the public domain thanks to social media. Now the case has 'gone cold', Corrie Mckeague's family will be devastated but not surprised. I have come to know Corrie's mother, Nicola Urquhart, well. She is articulate and determined. Her family is in Scotland, but she has had to make Suffolk her second home. Corrie's family cannot properly mourn until they have some resolution. For now that seems a long way off. Suffolk Police said it had been ""re-examining the evidence relating to all realistic theories to identify whether there is anything else that could be done to establish what could have happened to Corrie"". But the force said an assessment of the evidence ""still points to Corrie being transported from the 'horseshoe' area in a bin lorry and ultimately taken to the Milton landfill site"". The mystery of the airman who disappeared Missing airman search costs police Â£2.1m Landfill search for missing airman ends Mr Mckeague was last seen on CCTV pictures at about 03:25 BST after a night out and his phone was tracked as taking the same route as a bin lorry. As part of the inquiry, police trawled a landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, for the missing airman's remains. However, after the search the force said they were ""content"" he was not in the landfill areas. Assistant Chief Constable Simon Megicks said he had ""absolute confidence"" in the way the investigation was conducted. ""The major investigation team inquiry has been reviewed at various points by senior officers within the constabulary and external experts,"" he said. Det Supt Elliott added: ""If any new, credible and proportionate inquiries relating to Corrie's disappearance emerge we will pursue them."" The airman was seen on CCTV pictures walking through Bury St Edmunds after a night out The force said Mr Mckeague's family have been informed of the decision. Mr Mckeague's mother Nicola Urquhart previously said the search of the waste site had given her ""immeasurable peace of mind"". The investigation into the disappearance has cost Â£2.1m and Suffolk's police and crime commissioner saidthe government had agreed to contribute with a special grant, expected to be about Â£800,000.

Southern Health fined Â£2m over deaths,"Connor Sparrowhawk and Teresa Colvin died while in the care of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust An NHS trust that admitted failing two patients who died in its care, one in a bath, has been fined Â£2m. Connor Sparrowhawk, 18, drowned in Oxford in 2013. Teresa Colvin, 45, died in Hampshire in 2012. Southern Health admitted to ""systemic failures"" and pleaded guilty in 2017 to breaching health and safety laws. Passing sentence at Oxford Crown Court,external, Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said each death was an ""unnecessary human tragedy"". The trust will pay Â£950,000 for Mrs Colvin's death and just over Â£1m for that of Connor Sparrowhawk. The judge said the penalty was ""a just and proportionate outcome that marks the seriousness of the Trust's offending, the terrible consequences of that offending, and the other material factors that I have indicated"". This video can not be played Dr Sara Ryan's campaign uncovered problems at the trust He said it was a ""regrettable fact"" Dr Sara Ryan, Mr Sparrowhawk's mother, and Roger Colvin, Teresa Colvin's husband, had to campaign to uncover problems at the trust. The judge paid tribute in particular to Dr Ryan who had to endure ""entirely unjustified criticism"" during her JusticeforLB campaign - named after her son's nickname Laughing Boy. Southern Trust admits ""failing"" Teresa Colvin NHS Trust admits guilt of death of teenaged patient Southern Health appoints new chief executive A victim impact statement from Dr Ryan made for ""almost unbearable reading,"" he said. He acknowledged the trust's early indication it would plead guilty and said Southern Health had made it completely clear it would not attempt to shift responsibility to individuals. Speaking outside court, Teresa Colvin's husband Roger said his wife - who he called TJ - had been ""a vivacious, beautiful, and loving woman"". Roger Colvin paid tribute to his wife outside court ""Six years on, so many questions play over in my mind"", he said, adding his life was ""much poorer"" for her loss.  ""We all loved her so dearly,"" he said. ""TJ and I believed the hospital was a place of safety and Southern Health failed her,"" he added. Teresa Colvin with her husband Roger Mr Sparrowhawk's mother thanked the judge for his summary of Southern Health's failures and also thanked the Health and Safety Executive for their ""meticulous investigation"". She added: ""No-one should die a preventable death in the care of the state. ""I'm left thinking if Connor was here now in the shadow of Oxford Crown Court and St Aldates police station, he would say: 'Why mum?' And I would say: 'I don't know, but we've done you proud'."" In its submissions to the court, Southern Health acknowledged the deaths were ""entirely preventable"" and were ""a matter of significant regret"" it did not address its failures quicker. Dr Nick Broughton, its chief executive,said he wanted to ""apologise unreservedly"".,external He was ordered to stand during the final part of the sentencing by the judge as an acknowledgement of the trust's historic failings. Speaking outside court, he said: ""Those mistakes and those failures had dire consequences. ""Both Connor and Teresa should not have died. That is a matter of profound regret to me and the organisation, and I am truly sorry. We let them down and we let their families down,"" he said. Southern Health admitted both Connor Sparrowhawk and Teresa Colvin's deaths were ""entirely preventable"" The deaths had ""served as a catalyst for change,"" he added. Dr Broughtonwas appointed in Septemberafter previous boss Katrina Percy resigned after it was revealed the trust hadfailed to investigate hundreds of deathsof patients in its care.

G4S staff cleared of youth jail misconduct,"The centre is now run by HM Prison and Probation Service Four men accused of threatening and assaulting children at a youth jail in Kent have been cleared. Anthony Dance, 28, Gareth Evans, 27, Matthew Cunningham, 37, and Christopher Lomax, 36, had been charged with misconduct in a public office. Police investigated after BBC Panorama broadcast undercover footage of Medway Secure Training Centre from 2015. On 9 March, two men were cleared by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court and the others have now been formally cleared. At the earlier hearing, Mr Evans, of Tintagel Gardens, Rochester, and Mr Lomax of Timbertops, Chatham, were acquitted of two charges each of assaulting and threatening inmates, by a majority verdict of 11 to one. Mr Dance, from Hailsham, East Sussex, was found not guilty of misreporting an incident. However, the jury had been unable to reach a verdict on allegations he, and Mr Cunningham, of Megby Close, Gillingham, assaulted and threatened inmates and the charges were dismissed. That disagreement on 9 March can now be reported after the Crown Prosecution Service decided at the latest hearing against pursuing a retrial for Mr Dance and Mr Cunningham. Medway Secure Training Centre, Rochester The Panorama footage was secretly filmed by Robert Padmore, who got a job at the Rochester centre. Earlier, Judge Carey said it was a ""difficult and sensitive case"". After the hearing, Mr Cunningham criticised the BBC and said: ""The show was broadcast and the next day I was fired without any notice, and arrested the day after that. ""I've not been able to get a job, I'm on the verge of bankruptcy. I've had depression and anxiety since."" He accused the BBC of ""shocking editing"", claimed the programme lacked facts or context and said he was considering legal action. A BBC spokeswoman stood by the allegations made in the programme, adding: ""There is a serious case review underway, prompted by our investigation, looking at the lessons to be learned. ""That would not have happened without BBC Panorama's investigation and our undercover reporter's work and we remain committed to investigative journalism."" By January 2016, seven members of staff were suspended amid the allegations, and four were sacked. Eight staff were chargedover the scandal Rebecca Harold, of Maidstone, James Beech, of Sittingbourne, and Jonathan Kane, of Gillingham, all had the cases against them dismissed due to a lack of evidence Peter Scott, of Gravesend, Kent, admitted taking photographsand making recordings inside the prison and was ordered by magistrates to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work G4S held the contract to run the centre from 1998 to 2016, at which point the government took over.

What the diplomat expulsions tell us,"This video can not be played The war of words between the UK and Russia This is building into the most serious diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West since Moscow's seizure of the Crimea. Whatever the denials, Britain's allies have clearly accepted London's view - thatthe use of a military grade nerve agent in an assassination attempt in a British citywas ""highly likely"" to be the work of the Russian state. The collective expulsion of Russian diplomats from the US and 14 European Union statesis a remarkable show of solidarity with Britain; even more so because it comes at a time when UK-EU relations are strained due to the Brexit negotiations. Indeed Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, noted that ""additional measures, including further expulsions were not excluded in the coming days"" - a tough signal to Moscow as it considers how it will respond. This is a significant diplomatic victory for Prime Minister Theresa May, and also marks a significant toughening of the Trump administration's stance towards Russia. Britain was swift to point the finger at Moscow. But then it largely avoided public diatribes, seeking out every available international forum, from the EU, to Nato, the UN, and the highly relevant OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons) to set out its evidence and justify its conclusions. This patient diplomacy has now paid off. This video can not be played The BBC's Paul Adams looks at why the UK is expelling 23 Russian diplomats One must assume that many or most of the Russian diplomats designated for expulsion are intelligence operatives. Thus the cumulative impact on Russia's overseas intelligence activities could be considerable. Russia must now ponder what actions it will take in response. But President Putin could never have imagined there would be this degree of solidarity. Russia perceived Britain as weak and increasingly isolated; the EU as distracted; and the Trump administration as off-balance and compromised by President Trump's own curious unwillingness to castigate Moscow. Mr Putin may have made a serious mistake. This is in many ways a remarkable display of concerted European action, though he may prefer to note that by no means all members of the EU have participated. Russian spy: What we know so far Ex-spy asked Putin if he could go home It may be the US shift, though, that is most significant. Mr Trump's approach to Russia has been curiously lenient and unfocused. But the US diplomatic action is noteworthy because it doesn't just involve throwing out 48 diplomats in the US and closing the Russian Consulate General in Seattle. It also includes the separate expulsion of 12 Russian diplomats at the UN who are described by the State Department as ""intelligence operatives"" who have ""abused their privilege of residence in the United States"". Only a few days ago Mr Trump was seemingly setting aside the Salisbury attack and talking about a new summit with Mr Putin. Will this now go ahead? And if so when? It remains to be seen what the frostiness will mean for long-term US-Russia relations The current row comes just as the cast-list overseeing US foreign policy is changing significantly, with former CIA chief Mike Pompeo taking over at the State Department and John Bolton at the National Security Council. While both men are closely in tune with the president on policy towards Iran and North Korea, Mr Pompeo must have a comprehensive understanding of Moscow's disruptive activities from his intelligence job, and Mr Bolton has long been an advocate of a tougher stance towards Moscow. What happens when you expel a diplomat? Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Russian diplomats leave UK Russia is clearly in the diplomatic dog-house; and a frostier period of relations between Moscow and the West beckons. But this is also a moment for Western governments to define exactly what the Russian ""problem"" is. Rhetoric about a new ""Cold War"" and a significant defensive build-up is all very well, but probably wide of the mark. The poisoning of Sergei Skripal - which the UK and its allies blame on Moscow - has put Russia in the diplomatic dog-house It overstates the case: Russia is not the Soviet Union, a global player with an ideology that mobilises people around the world. It has its strengths but also its weaknesses, not least its economy. In recent years Mr Putin has made a good hand out of focusing Russia's capabilities on places that matter to Russia, where it has strong historical or diplomatic links. Essentially Russia is a power close to home, in what Russians call the ""near abroad"". Thus it can mount a threat to Georgia or Ukraine. Syria in a strange way could also be included in this ""near abroad"". Russian ""power"" may be reaching its zenith. It retains, though, an extraordinary ability to create trouble more broadly through hacking, information warfare, and by backing extremist political parties. To counter this, Western governments and societies may need to spend some more on defence; but they certainly need to spend a great deal more on making their societies more resilient. The first thing is to reach a common and comprehensive assessment of the problem. And the use of a nerve agent in the quiet cathedral city of Salisbury may just have set that process in motion.

UK diplomacy's new focus,"The WhatsApp group is both a bane and boon to modern working life. Her Majesty's Foreign and Commonwealth Office is no exception. And in a recent exchange between senior officials at King Charles Street a simple phrase expressed the collective frustration of many: ""(Expletive) elephants!"" This was a reference to the increasing occupation of the foreign secretary with the welfare of animals. A brief perusal of Boris Johnson's Twitter feed confirms this. He is much concerned with the trafficking of pangolins. While many denizens of the Foreign Office are no doubt deeply concerned with the continuing survival of these particular fauna, there are others who would also prefer their boss to concentrate a little more closely on perhaps more strategic elements of British foreign policy. The focus of their frustration is the government's strategy entitled ""Global Britain"". The aim of this policy is to show that the UK will remain internationally engaged after Brexit. It argues that Britain has a unique blend of assets that gives it a special place in the world. These include hard power - its membership of Nato and its status as one of Europe's major military and intelligence powers; soft power - its language, universities, BBC World Service and so on, its diplomatic clout as a close ally of the US and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and its values as a liberal standard-bearer for human rights and the rule of law. That, at least, is the theory behind Global Britain. But in practice it is much maligned as a slogan in pursuit of a strategy. The Foreign Affairs Committee recently issued a report saying Global Britain risks being seen as a""superficial branding exercise"",externalunless ministers actually set out what it means in practice. Others believe it is a post facto justification for Brexit, an attempt to convince other countries that the UK is not turning in on itself. Other critics go even further and see Global Britain as a post-imperial fantasy by nostalgic Brexiteers. The foreign secretary's ""Global Britain"" strategy has come in for criticism But here is a question - has the confrontation with Russia over the Salisbury nerve agent attack finally given the Foreign Office an issue through which Global Britain can come of age? Here is a crisis where the UK can use its assets to unite allies against Russia, to use the incident as a catalyst to unlock wider diplomatic action against Moscow that has been long coming. Here is an issue where the UK can show some leadership and persuade European allies that while it may be leaving the EU, it is by no means leaving the wider European defence and security alliance. One can argue that this strategy has borne some fruit. Theresa May has succeeded in uniting her European allies behind Britain's position on Russia. They have agreed formally that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury attack, saying there was ""no plausible alternative explanation"". The EU has taken the extraordinary step of recalling its ambassador from Moscow. To get 27 other EU member states to sign up to this language is a significant diplomatic success for the UK. One has to remember that there are many countries in the EU that are economically and politically far closer to Moscow than the UK. It is frankly surprising that countries like Greece, Italy and Hungary are prepared to put their names to a statement that is so critical of Russia. Mrs May clearly shared enough intelligence about the attack to ensure that an alliance of Berlin, Paris, the Baltic and Eastern European states would persuade the rest of the EU to fall in line. And the diplomatic work behind the scenes is also showing results. UK officials have quite sensibly not been asking for things they know the EU could not agree. For example, the UK has not sought tougher EU sanctions against Moscow. They know this would not be agreed and would be used by Russia to illustrate EU division. Instead, the UK has been playing a longer game, looking for allies to step up pressure on Russia unilaterally, arguing that Salisbury is just the latest example of a pattern of aggressive behaviour that affects them all. The UK is saying it will support other countries if they too decide to disrupt Russia's intelligence networks by expelling some spies masquerading as diplomats. The UK is urging its allies to make sure that Russia feels it is under pressure in every international forum, constantly being asked questions, constantly being put on  the back foot. One official told me that by the time of the Nato summit in July, the UK wants Russia to have pulled in its horns and accepted that it over-reached itself in Salisbury. This, of course, is the rosy scenario. Not all of Britain's diplomacy has been so deft. The decision by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to tell Russia to ""shut up and go away"" prompted MPs to nickname him the Joe Dolce of British politics (after the 1980s one-hit wonder who topped the charts with the song, Shaddap You Face). The decision by the foreign secretary to compare Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler provoked equal brickbats from colleagues, not least because it broke one of the first rules of British politics - never, ever make comparisons with the Nazis. These missteps mattered because they risked turning the confrontation with Russia into a bilateral shouting match between the UK and Moscow. The government's clear intention throughout the crisis has been to ensure that the pressure on Russia remains international. And there clearly remains a limit beyond which European unity will not survive. It is one thing to unite around a condemnatory statement, it is quite another to agree collective action. David Cameron, with some foresight, took steps to ensure the UK had greater energy independence and security. Other EU countries are far more dependent on the pipelines bringing gas from the eastern steppes and will be reluctant to provoke the Russian bear too much. Will these countries really be ready to punish Russia where it hurts by making it harder for Moscow's elite to make and protect its money overseas? Gas pipelines under construction in Germany - some EU countries are dependent on supplies from Russia But right now, UK officials believe Russia finds itself more isolated than it had anticipated and that, in part, is due to British diplomatic and political leadership. Some believe that Global Britain has a bit more flesh on its bones. They argue that Russia and Brexit have, counter-intuitively, led to Britain leaning into European allies more than before. They cite the deepening European diplomatic attempts to protect the Iran nuclear deal from Donald Trump's scepticism. Others are more sceptical, saying the UK still has to decide its approach to a US that is increasingly unpredictable, to a resurgent and more confident China, and to a Middle East where confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran is oft mooted. It still has to work out what role a post-Brexit UK can play in a world - a role that is realistic and pragmatic, not based on false grandeur but a practical use of what diplomatic assets the UK has. The crisis with Russia may not have turned Global Britain into reality, but it has certainly given diplomats something to work on.

The key questions for Australia,"This video can not be played Watch: Bancroft and Smith admit ball-tampering plan Australian cricket is mired in the biggest scandal to hit the Test game since three Pakistan players were caught spot-fixing at Lord's in 2010. The pictures from thethird day of the third Test against South Africaof Cameron Bancroft rubbing what we were later told was yellow tape against the ball and then hiding it down the front of his trousers were only outdone on the scale of extraordinary by the news conference that followed. Bancroft and then captain Steve Smith came clean. It was a premeditated and calculated plan to alter the condition of the ball. There is a debate to be had on the severity of ball-tampering as a cricketing crime. It is nothing new for bowlers and fielders to attempt to conjure something from the leather by fair means or foul. That, though, is for another day. Right now, the ferocity of the backlash against Smith, his team and its management has left a number of Australian cricketing giants fighting for their jobs and the governing body of the sport down under wondering how to repair its shattered reputation. TV cameras caught the moment Bancroft took what he said was yellow tape out of his pocket From what has happened so far, we know Smith, vice-captain David Warner and Bancroft are conspirators. But how many other players are in the ""leadership group"" referred to by Smith? Was substitute fielder Peter Handscomb, seen on a walkie-talkie and then passing a message to Bancroft, also in on the plot? There are also questions around coach Darren Lehmann. Smith said only players were involved, but is that to be believed? If not, and Lehmann genuinely didn't know, why not? Is it worse to be in on the plan, or to be so out of control that you are unaware your team is about to do something so brazenly stupid, damaging and beyond the laws of the game? His future is also on the line. Former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie told Sky Sports: ""Until we've heard from Lehmann, we won't know any more. He hasn't fronted the media yet - everyone is waiting for that. ""It's hard to think there isn't going to be a fall-out and a big change in personnel. It appears there's going to be some big changes on and off the field. ""The Australia side has to have a deep reflection on how they go about the game, how they're perceived in the wider cricketing world. That perception isn't good, that's the brutal reality."" In the short term, Australia need a captain for the fourth and final Test following theone-match ban handed to Smith by the International Cricket Council. It seems unlikely that can be Warner who, like Smith, was removed from his role for the rest of the third Test by Cricket Australia for being part of the ""leadership group"" that cooked up the plan. If there are further bans to be dished out by CA, how would that affect the match in Johannesburg, which is due to begin on Friday? Might the majority of a new squad have to be scrambled to South Africa? After that, there are decisions to be made on the long-term futures of Smith, Warner and any other players or coaches involved. Smith and Bancroft have form as a news-conference double act. It was the same pair who lampoonedJonny Bairstow's 'headbutt'after the first Ashes Test in Brisbane. This video can not be played What really happened between Bancroft & Bairstow? It is quite an effort to pull off a second memorable performance, but this time for quite different reasons. On the one hand, it can be said they should be applauded for facing the music right away. They came clean, rather than choosing to hide. They admitted what they did was wrong and promised it would never happen again. But did they have much choice? The evidence against Bancroft was overwhelming, played and replayed not only on TV, but on big screens inside the ground, causing him to ""panic"", in his own words. Once Bancroft was in the dock, it was only right Smith joined him. It would have been grossly unfair to ask a team-mate or coach to explain what happened on their behalf. Both men said the attempt to alter the ball did not work because the umpires did not opt to change it. If that was offered as a defence, Smith followed up by saying Australia had made a ""poor choice"". In amongst the contrition came the most pertinent question - were they sorry they had cheated, or sorry they had been caught? ""If we weren't caught, I'd still feel incredibly bad about it,"" said Smith, who also insisted it had never happened before. When that was put to Stuart Broad, the England pace bowler said he had seen no evidence of ball-tampering during the Ashes. He did wonder, though, why Australia, with such a talented pace attack, would need to move from the method that defeated his team 4-0. ""Look at the Ashes series we've just played, look through all of those Test matches and they reverse swing the ball sometimes in conditions you wouldn't expect the ball to reverse,"" said Broad. ""I don't understand why they've changed their method for this one game."" Bancroft speaks to umpires Llong and Illingworth and shows them a black cloth in his pocket Some have suggested Australia should have forfeited the match, but that was a fanciful notion that would have punished spectators for the actions of the players. In the middle of a Test, it is hard to see what more Cricket Australia could have done. Indeed, there is an argument to say that, from the other side of the world and without all the facts, CA was hasty in even acting so soon, but the weight of public opinion forced its hand. For Smith, though, to be temporarily replaced as skipper by wicketkeeper Tim Paine midway through a Test is a remarkable fall from grace. Little more than two months ago, he was the toast of the nation, having batted England into submission in the Ashes, held the urn aloft in Sydney and then been namedAustralian of the Year,externalby The Australian newspaper. Now he is a clinging to a role often referred to as the second most important job in Australia, behind that of the prime minister, by his fingernails. And even PM Malcolm Turnbull has expressed his outrage. This video can not be played Australian cheating beyond belief - PM Turnbull Before Smith was removed as skipper for the third Test, Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland would only go as far as to say the batsman was ""currently"" the captain. The likes of Kevin Pietersen, Simon Katich and government agency theAustralia Sports Commissionhave called for Smith to go, while predecessor Michael Clarke has said he would be open to returning to the job ""if asked by the right people"". Former wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist said Australian cricket is the ""laughing stock"" of the sporting world. ""I'm stunned and shocked, embarrassed and sad,"" he toldBBC Radio 5 live. It may be a stretch to say the men in baggy green caps have gone feral, but this is the latest and most serious violation of an unwritten cricketing moral code that Australia claim to adhere to. Cast your mind back to the Ashes and talk of ""the line"" - the mythical barrier which separates what is acceptable on a cricket field to what is not. Australia insisted it was not crossed, but some English voices disagreed. It seems a moveable line. Take Warner as an example. Never short of a word, all is fair game until Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock fires back with comments that cross ""the line"", resulting inugly scenesduring the first Test in South Africa. The series has been played in an unpleasantly hostile atmosphere and nobody can condone the reported comments from some fans towards Warner or any Australian player about their wives, partners or families. However, it seemed a little rich for Lehmann to be complaining when, before the 2013-14 Ashes, he asked the home supporters to""give it"" to Broadin the hope he ""cries and goes home"". And what of the perceived hounding of South Africa captain Faf du Plessis when he was accused of ball-tampering on his side's last tour of Australia? Or when England'sJames Anderson faced similar claimsin December? It has been suggested the tension of this series has played a part in pushing Smith and his team towards this error of judgement. Still, what goes around comes around, and sympathy for Australia will not run deep. ""They've set themselves as this higher than high, pious team who look down at everyone and set the benchmark for what is right and what is wrong in cricket,"" said former England off-spinner Graeme Swann. ""Everyone that's played against them knows that's an absolute joke."" 5 memorable ball-tampering moments Smith under pressure from government to go Smith fined and banned for one Test Bergvall scores late winner as Spurs beat Liverpool in first leg West Ham to appoint Potter after sacking Lopetegui Tottenham's Bentancur taken off on stretcher after injury against Liverpool Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the factory he used to work in to find out how they bake 1.4 million loaves a week Dara Ã  Briain and Isy Suttie discover strange-but-true tales The pair are joined by astronaut Helen Sharman to learn about how humans learned to survive in space A round-up of 2024's top sports stories.

Council calls temporary halt to tree work,"This video can not be played Anger over Sheffield's plan to fell healthy trees Sheffield City Council is to call a temporary halt to its tree replacement programme. Campaigners claim the council has cut down a number of healthy trees among the thousands felled since 2012. The BBC's Dino Sofos told the Daily Politics show there would be ""no felling for the next few weeks"". The council said contractor Amey was ""exploring options for completing the work and will present these options to the council"". More stories from across Yorkshire The news comes after Environment SecretaryMichael Gove said he would do ""anything required"" to stop the work. In a statement, the council said: ""In the past year or so the actions of a handful of people unlawfully entering the safety zones where tree replacement work is being carried out has meant that it has become increasingly difficult for Amey to complete the programme without danger to staff and members of the public."" The council added during the review period ""only trees which are dangerous will be worked on"". The felling is part ofthe Â£2bn 25-year Streets Ahead project,external, which is being carried out by contractor Amey and has seen about 5,500 trees removed since 2012. The council says the trees have been assessed as dead, dying, diseased, damaging or dangerous, and each tree cut down will be replaced. However, campaigners say healthy trees have also been lost. Protesters stand next to a rare Huntingdon Elm tree in Sheffield The dispute has led to a series of stand-offs between protestors, contractors, private security staff and police, with a number of campaigners arrested and a court injunction imposed as a result. Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Conservative MP for Chichester Gillian Keegan said: ""It does seem ridiculous. The whole country is covered with tree-lined streets that have these problems with roots and trying to keep flat pavements. ""This is something every other council deals with. What on earth is happening [in Sheffield], to have police on the streets, for this to have escalated in to such a big deal? This happens day in, day out across the country.""

Man guilty of boys' hit-and-run deaths,"Corey, six, and Casper Platt-May, two, were on a family trip to a park when they were hit by a car A man has admitted causing the deaths of two young brothers in a hit-and-run crash in Coventry last month. Corey, six, and Casper Platt-May, two, were on a family trip to the park when they were hit by Robert Brown's car. Brown, 53, of Attwood Crescent, Wyken, admitted causing the deaths by dangerous driving on 22 February. The court heard he had previously been jailed for possessing a machete and had been let out on licence just six days before the crash. Midlands Live: Murder charge over Giovanni Lewis death; Who helps the paramedics? Corey and Casper had been with a group of up to nine children crossing Macdonald Road in the Stoke area of the city at about 14:00 GMT when Brown's Ford Focus ploughed into them. Both boys were taken to hospital with severe injuriesbut neither could be saved. Their mother, who had been with them at the time, was unhurt. Corey (left) and Casper Platt-May were described by Corey's head teacher as ""lovely boys"" The court heard Brown - and his passenger, Gwendoline Harrison - tried to flee the scene on foot but members of the public attempted to stop them. Harrison, 42, hit a someone who intervened and admitted a charge of assault intending to resist arrest. The judge adjourned sentencing until 27 April and remanded Brown in custody until then. Tyrone Smith QC, defending, said the presiding judge would need to watch ""troubling"" CCTV footage before deciding on a punishment. The court heard how Robert Brown and Gwendoline Harrison tried to flee the scene after the crash The court heard Brown had been jailed for six months in November for possessing an offensive weapon and was released on licence less than a week before the crash. One of Brown's release conditions was not to contact Harrison, of Triumph Close, also in Wyken, while on licence. On Monday, Brown admitted all charges, including two counts of death by dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified, using a motor vehicle without insurance and using a motor vehicle without a licence. The prosecution said it would offer no evidence on Harrison's second alleged offence of perverting the course of justice. Photos, tributes and toys were among items left at the scene A donation page set up to help the boys' family cover funeral costs has amassed more than Â£26,000 following donations from more than 1,500 supporters. Louise Platt-May said earlier this month on Facebook she could not bring herself to talk about what happened to her sons, but that she was ""overwhelmed"" by the community's help. Previously she had described Corey as loving ""school more than any kid I know"" but said his ""main passion in life was his football"". Floral tributes were laid at Coventry Cathedral, where a memorial service was held last week Casper ""was so loving and caring and constantly told his family how much he loved them,"" his mother said. She said: ""He loved walking everywhere with his wellies and splashing in the puddles.""

"Scouts pay out Â£42,000 over autism claimThe family of a boy aged 11 say he was discriminated against and excluded from certain activities.4h4 hours agoUK","Ben Gleeson joined a cub scout group in Hertfordshire in 2015 An 11-year-old boy has received Â£42,000 in compensation after his family said his cub scout group discriminated against him for having autism. Ben Gleeson joined a group in Hertfordshire in 2015, but was later told he could not go to camps or take part in athletics without supervision. His family sued the group - saying it amounted to a ban - and the dispute was settled out of court last year. The Scout Association said it had apologised and started an inquiry. Ben joined the 10th Harpenden Scout Group in January 2015, having previously been a member of the beavers. His parents said they explained his autism to the scout leaders and suggested strategies to help calm and distract him, should he get upset. We grew up not knowing we were autistic US Boy Scouts revoke badges from Down's syndrome boy They said his autism manifested as anxiety to change and that he needed to know plans in advance. They said that although few people would realise he was autistic on first meeting him, if something unpredictable happened he could become distressed. In March 2016, Ben had a short episode at a cub scout camp in which he became distressed. He tried to run a short distance from the rest of the group at an indoor venue after he was asked to change into a pair of shoes he could not find. Later, he said he did not want to join an egg-and-spoon race because of a phobia of spoons. Soon afterwards, the pack leaders said Ben could not travel with the rest of the group on a bus to events or participate in athletics.  They also said he had to have one-to-one supervision at other events. The scout group said the decision had been made for the health and safety of the whole pack. However, Ben's parents - who are both lawyers - argued the decision effectively amounted to a ban. This video can not be played Beverly Gleeson said the Scout group's decision would ""single Ben out"" While she accepted her son needed some extra support, Ben's mum, Beverly Gleeson, told the BBC the decision was a ""complete overreaction"". She said: ""Pretty much every event had to be supervised on a one-to-one basis, which I felt wasn't inclusive."" She said the decision would ""single Ben out"" and that she feared it would make him ""feel different"". ""I felt he didn't need it.  He didn't have this level of supervision at school. He'd made one mistake and then that was it, they wanted to make the rules and regulations. It was supposed to be a dialogue,"" she added. Ben, who said he enjoyed being with his friends and taking part in the activities, added: ""It was quite upsetting, my friends were there and I quite enjoyed it."" ""I don't like the idea of someone following me all the time,"" he added. The family's solicitor, Chris Fry of Fry Law, said: ""I am pretty sure no one goes into scouting looking to exclude anyone. Those giving up their time need to know that they are properly trained and that they are protected by the organisation that they love and serve. ""The organisation needs to anticipate that scouts with autism need reasonable adjustments so they can access activities in the same way as other children."" The family eventually sued under the Equality Act, as well as for breach of privacy and under data protection legislation - claiming emails and a briefing to parents had identified them. Insurers for the Scout Association settled the case out of court, paying the Gleeson family Â£42,000 plus costs. The Gleesons have donated some of the money to a local autism charity, while Ben's portion is being held in a trust. 'Orange snow' baffles eastern Europeans Harry Kane and the making of a Premier League star The country where citizenship depends on your skin colour The 10th Harpenden Scout Group disputed some of the family's claims. Ms Gleeson said it was only after the BBC had become involved that the Scout's national headquarters apologised to them. In a statement, the Scout Association said: ""The handling of Ben's case was completely unacceptable. ""We are very sorry that Ben and his family were not supported as they should have been by their cub scout pack, and we have made a personal apology to them. ""While cases like this are very unusual, we know that action must be taken. We have established an inquiry to investigate what went wrong in this case."" The association said it was also looking at plans for mandatory training for all adult volunteers on ""how to make reasonable adjustments for young people with developmental disabilities"".

Does UK diplomacy have new focus?,"The WhatsApp group is both a bane and boon to modern working life. Her Majesty's Foreign and Commonwealth Office is no exception. And in a recent exchange between senior officials at King Charles Street a simple phrase expressed the collective frustration of many: ""(Expletive) elephants!"" This was a reference to the increasing occupation of the foreign secretary with the welfare of animals. A brief perusal of Boris Johnson's Twitter feed confirms this. He is much concerned with the trafficking of pangolins. While many denizens of the Foreign Office are no doubt deeply concerned with the continuing survival of these particular fauna, there are others who would also prefer their boss to concentrate a little more closely on perhaps more strategic elements of British foreign policy. The focus of their frustration is the government's strategy entitled ""Global Britain"". The aim of this policy is to show that the UK will remain internationally engaged after Brexit. It argues that Britain has a unique blend of assets that gives it a special place in the world. These include hard power - its membership of Nato and its status as one of Europe's major military and intelligence powers; soft power - its language, universities, BBC World Service and so on, its diplomatic clout as a close ally of the US and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and its values as a liberal standard-bearer for human rights and the rule of law. That, at least, is the theory behind Global Britain. But in practice it is much maligned as a slogan in pursuit of a strategy. The Foreign Affairs Committee recently issued a report saying Global Britain risks being seen as a""superficial branding exercise"",externalunless ministers actually set out what it means in practice. Others believe it is a post facto justification for Brexit, an attempt to convince other countries that the UK is not turning in on itself. Other critics go even further and see Global Britain as a post-imperial fantasy by nostalgic Brexiteers. The foreign secretary's ""Global Britain"" strategy has come in for criticism But here is a question - has the confrontation with Russia over the Salisbury nerve agent attack finally given the Foreign Office an issue through which Global Britain can come of age? Here is a crisis where the UK can use its assets to unite allies against Russia, to use the incident as a catalyst to unlock wider diplomatic action against Moscow that has been long coming. Here is an issue where the UK can show some leadership and persuade European allies that while it may be leaving the EU, it is by no means leaving the wider European defence and security alliance. One can argue that this strategy has borne some fruit. Theresa May has succeeded in uniting her European allies behind Britain's position on Russia. They have agreed formally that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury attack, saying there was ""no plausible alternative explanation"". The EU has taken the extraordinary step of recalling its ambassador from Moscow. To get 27 other EU member states to sign up to this language is a significant diplomatic success for the UK. One has to remember that there are many countries in the EU that are economically and politically far closer to Moscow than the UK. It is frankly surprising that countries like Greece, Italy and Hungary are prepared to put their names to a statement that is so critical of Russia. Mrs May clearly shared enough intelligence about the attack to ensure that an alliance of Berlin, Paris, the Baltic and Eastern European states would persuade the rest of the EU to fall in line. And the diplomatic work behind the scenes is also showing results. UK officials have quite sensibly not been asking for things they know the EU could not agree. For example, the UK has not sought tougher EU sanctions against Moscow. They know this would not be agreed and would be used by Russia to illustrate EU division. Instead, the UK has been playing a longer game, looking for allies to step up pressure on Russia unilaterally, arguing that Salisbury is just the latest example of a pattern of aggressive behaviour that affects them all. The UK is saying it will support other countries if they too decide to disrupt Russia's intelligence networks by expelling some spies masquerading as diplomats. The UK is urging its allies to make sure that Russia feels it is under pressure in every international forum, constantly being asked questions, constantly being put on  the back foot. One official told me that by the time of the Nato summit in July, the UK wants Russia to have pulled in its horns and accepted that it over-reached itself in Salisbury. This, of course, is the rosy scenario. Not all of Britain's diplomacy has been so deft. The decision by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to tell Russia to ""shut up and go away"" prompted MPs to nickname him the Joe Dolce of British politics (after the 1980s one-hit wonder who topped the charts with the song, Shaddap You Face). The decision by the foreign secretary to compare Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler provoked equal brickbats from colleagues, not least because it broke one of the first rules of British politics - never, ever make comparisons with the Nazis. These missteps mattered because they risked turning the confrontation with Russia into a bilateral shouting match between the UK and Moscow. The government's clear intention throughout the crisis has been to ensure that the pressure on Russia remains international. And there clearly remains a limit beyond which European unity will not survive. It is one thing to unite around a condemnatory statement, it is quite another to agree collective action. David Cameron, with some foresight, took steps to ensure the UK had greater energy independence and security. Other EU countries are far more dependent on the pipelines bringing gas from the eastern steppes and will be reluctant to provoke the Russian bear too much. Will these countries really be ready to punish Russia where it hurts by making it harder for Moscow's elite to make and protect its money overseas? Gas pipelines under construction in Germany - some EU countries are dependent on supplies from Russia But right now, UK officials believe Russia finds itself more isolated than it had anticipated and that, in part, is due to British diplomatic and political leadership. Some believe that Global Britain has a bit more flesh on its bones. They argue that Russia and Brexit have, counter-intuitively, led to Britain leaning into European allies more than before. They cite the deepening European diplomatic attempts to protect the Iran nuclear deal from Donald Trump's scepticism. Others are more sceptical, saying the UK still has to decide its approach to a US that is increasingly unpredictable, to a resurgent and more confident China, and to a Middle East where confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran is oft mooted. It still has to work out what role a post-Brexit UK can play in a world - a role that is realistic and pragmatic, not based on false grandeur but a practical use of what diplomatic assets the UK has. The crisis with Russia may not have turned Global Britain into reality, but it has certainly given diplomats something to work on.

'Unusual if Lehmann didn't know plan',"This video can not be played Watch: Bancroft and Smith admit ball-tampering plan It would be ""highly unusual"" if Australia coach Darren Lehmann was unaware of his players' plan to tamper with the ball against South Africa, says former coach John Buchanan. Buchanan, who led Australia between 1999 and 2007, also believes captain Steve Smith's position is untenable. Cricket Australia says it expects to ""fully update"" people on Tuesday about its findings on the incident. ""We know Australians want answers,"" said chief executive James Sutherland. Smith has beenbanned for one matchand fined his entire match fee by cricket's world governing body for his involvement. But Australian cricket chiefs have held off on issuing punishments while they carry out their own inquiry. What were they thinking? Cricket scandal stuns Australia The key questions facing Australian cricket Tape, sun cream & mints - the murky world of ball-tampering, and why it's such a big deal Podcast: Aggers' journalist panel discusses the ball tampering saga Team sponsor Qantas 'disappointed' by ball-tampering row ""It is unusual as the teams are walking out that the coach is unaware of what's about to happen,"" Buchanan, who led Australia to a world-record 16 consecutive Test victories and three World Cup triumphs, told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast programme. ""Generally it will be the coach and captain, in the last couple of minutes before they go to the field, who will be saying 'these are the sort of things we want to do and put in place when we get out on the field'."" He added: ""Personally I don't think Steve Smith can continue as captain. It may be his first major error but it is such an enormous error of judgement. ""Hopefully he can continue as a player but I would have thought there is very little opportunity for him to retain his position as captain."" Former Australia batsman Marcus North, who played 21 Tests in 2009 and 2010, thinks it is ""inevitable"" Smith will not continue as captain and says Lehmann faces ""some difficult questions"". An ill-tempered series against South Africa has been marred byconfrontations between playersand complaints from Lehmann about""disgraceful"" verbal abuse. ""The behaviour of the team recently has not been up to the standard expected,"" said North. ""We have already seen a lot of issues in this series and this is another thing that has happened in his tenure."" Australia's prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the latest incident had ""shocked and bitterly disappointed"" him. Many former players have criticised the actions of the current Australia team and management, with ex-skipper Michael Clarke - Smith's predecessor - describing it as ""premeditated cheating"". Senior Cricket Australia (CA) officials Iain Roy and Pat Howard have arrived in South Africa to conduct an inquiry into the ""specifics"" of the incident. Sutherland is travelling to Cape Town and will meet Roy and Howard on Tuesday to ""understand the findings of the investigation to that point, and to determine recommended outcomes"". This video can not be played Australia ball-tampering row: Simon Hughes explains what happened in Cape Town Smith said the team's ""leadership group"" had agreed a plan, carried out by batsman Cameron Bancroft, to tamper with the ball to ""get an advantage"". Bancroft admitted in a news conference following the third day's play that he had tampered with the ball while fielding, after television pictures showed him using what the 25-year-old opener says was yellow tape with grit on. Smith, who appeared alongside Bancroft at the news conference, will miss the fourth and final Test of the series after being punished by the International Cricket Council (ICC). He also stepped down from his captaincy role for the final day of the Test, which Australia lost. But Smith said he would not consider stepping down permanently, adding that he was still ""the right person for the job"". Bancroft was fined 75% of his match fee and given three demerit points. Smith, 28, admitted a charge of conduct ""of a serious nature that is contrary to the spirit of the game"", according to a statement from governing body the ICC. ICC chief executive David Richardson said ""the game needs to have a hard look at itself"", while the MCC - the guardian of the laws and spirit of cricket - has called for a ""major shift in attitude and culture"" within the game. Australia lost 10 wickets in the final session of day four to lose the third Test by 322 runs. The final match of the ill-tempered series, which South Africa now lead 2-1, begins in Johannesburg on Friday. Clarke said the incident was ""a terrible day for Australian cricket"" and condemned its instigators for choosing Bancroft to carry it out. ""I can't believe the leadership group have got a young kid playing in his eighth Test match to do this,"" Clarke told Australia's Channel Nine. ""We have got the best bowling attack in the world. We don't need to cheat to beat anyone."" Former Test vice-captainAdam Gilchristtold BBC Radio 5 live he was ""stunned and shocked... embarrassed and sad"". The legendary wicketkeeper added: ""Australian cricket is the laughing stock of the sporting world."" Former Australia fast bowlerJason Gillespiesaid he expected to see a ""big change of personnel"" in the current set-up following the incident. ""The Australia side has to have a deep reflection on how they go about the game, how they're perceived in the wider cricketing world,"" he said. ""That perception isn't good, that's the brutal reality."" Former England captainMichael Vaughancriticised the ""pathetic penalties"" handed down to Smith and Bancroft by the ICC. In a series of tweets, Vaughan said: ""Surely this moment was the time to set a precedent. All the team should be penalised."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: Ball-tampering has always happened in cricket but it's exceptionally difficult to prove. This time they have someone who has admitted his guilt - he's a captain, the act was premeditated and, worst of all, he has clearly coerced the most inexperienced player in his team to go out and do the dirty work for them, and that's awful. Australia have very few friends in cricket at the moment. The boorish way in which they've behaved over the years hasn't helped. The current series between Australia and South Africa has been ill-tempered. There's been bad blood about the way the Australians play the game. Many in the cricket world will feel a sense of satisfaction today about what they'll see as chickens coming home to roost. I really think this is an opportunity for the Australian authorities to look very carefully at their game.

Full text: Jewish leaders' letter,"Here is the full text of the open letter to the Labour Party by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council. The response from Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is also published below. Today, leaders of British Jewry tell Jeremy Corbyn that enough is enough.  We have had enough of hearing that Jeremy Corbyn ""opposes anti-Semitism"", whilst the mainstream majority of British Jews, and their concerns, are ignored by him and those he leads. There is a repeated institutional failure to properly address Jewish concerns and to tackle anti-Semitism, with the Chakrabarti Report being the most glaring example of this. Jeremy Corbyn did not invent this form of politics, but he has had a lifetime within it, and now personifies its problems and dangers. He issues empty statements about opposing anti-Semitism, but does nothing to understand or address it. We conclude that he cannot seriously contemplate anti-Semitism, because he is so ideologically fixed within a far left worldview that is instinctively hostile to mainstream Jewish communities. When Jews complain about an obviously anti-Semitic mural in Tower Hamlets, Corbyn of course supports the artist. Hizbollah commits terrorist atrocities against Jews, but Corbyn calls them his friends and attends pro-Hizbollah rallies in London. Exactly the same goes for Hamas. Raed Salah says Jews kill Christian children to drink their blood. Corbyn opposes his extradition and invites him for tea at the House of Commons. These are not the only cases. He is repeatedly found alongside people with blatantly anti-Semitic views, but claims never to hear or read them. Again and again, Jeremy Corbyn has sided with anti-Semites rather than Jews. At best, this derives from the far left's obsessive hatred of Zionism, Zionists and Israel. At worst, it suggests a conspiratorial worldview in which mainstream Jewish communities are believed to be a hostile entity, a class enemy. When Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of the Labour Party, Jews expressed sincere and profound fears as to how such politics would impact upon their wellbeing. Our concerns were never taken seriously. Three years on, the party and British Jews are reaping the consequences. Routine statements against anti-Semitism ""and all forms of racism"" get nowhere near dealing with the problem, because what distinguishes anti-Semitism from other forms of racism is the power that Jews are alleged to hold, and how they are charged with conspiring together against what is good. This is not only historic, or about what Jeremy Corbyn did before being party leader. It is also utterly contemporary. There is literally not a single day in which Labour Party spaces, either online or in meetings, do not repeat the same fundamental anti-Semitic slanders against Jews. We are told that our concerns are faked, and done at the command of Israel and/or Zionism (whatever that means); that anti-Semitism is merely ""criticism of Israel""; that we call any and all criticism of Israel ""anti-Semitic""; that the Rothschilds run the world; that Isis terrorism is a fake front for Israel; that Zionists are the new Nazis; and that Zionists collaborate with Nazis. Rightly or wrongly, Jeremy Corbyn is now the figurehead for an anti-Semitic political culture, based on obsessive hatred of Israel, conspiracy theories and fake news that is doing dreadful harm to British Jews and to the British Labour Party. Jeremy Corbyn is the only person with the power to demand that it stops. Enough is enough. Below is the full text of the letter Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn sent in response this afternoon, recognising anti-Semitism ""has surfaced"" within the party, but reiterating his commitment, both personally and as party leader, to its eradication. Thank you for your letter to the Labour Party concerning anti-Semitism issued as a press statement last night. First of all, let me acknowledge the anger and upset that provoked it, and  repeat my offer of an urgent meeting to discuss the issues you have raised as soon as possible. I stated yesterday, and repeat today, that I will not tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in or around our party and movement. I am committed to eliminating anti-Semitism wherever it exists. As I told the Labour Party conference in 2016, anti-Semitism is an evil that led to the worst crimes of the 20th century. Prejudice and hatred of Jewish people has no place whatsoever in the Labour Party, and every one of us has a responsibility to ensure it is never allowed to fester in our society again. I recognise that anti-Semitism has surfaced within the Labour Party, and has too often been dismissed as simply a matter of a few bad apples. This has caused pain and hurt to Jewish members of our Party and to the wider Jewish community in Britain. I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused, and pledge to redouble my efforts to bring this anxiety to an end. While the forms of anti-Semitism expressed on the far Right of politics are easily detectable, such as Holocaust denial, there needs to be a deeper understanding of what constitutes anti-Semitism in the labour movement. Sometimes this evil takes familiar forms - the east London mural which has caused such understandable controversy is an example. The idea of Jewish bankers and capitalists exploiting the workers of the world is an old anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. This was long ago, and rightly, described as ""the socialism of fools"". I am sorry for not having studied the content of the mural more closely before wrongly questioning its removal in 2012. Newer forms of anti-Semitism have been woven into criticism of Israeli governments. Criticism of Israel, particularly in relation to the continuing dispossession of the Palestinian people, cannot be avoided. Nevertheless, comparing Israel or the actions of Israeli governments to the Nazis, attributing criticisms of Israel to Jewish characteristics or to Jewish people in general and using abusive phraseology about supporters of Israel such as ""Zio"" all constitute aspects of contemporary anti-Semitism. And Jewish people must not be held responsible or accountable for the actions of the Israeli government. The Labour Party has always opposed anti-Semitism, old and new, and always will. We are proud of our deep historical links with Jewish communities, and to have fought alongside generations of Jewish men and women against fascism, prejudice and discrimination. This is a part of our common heritage from which we will never be separated. But I acknowledge that anti-Semitic attitudes have surfaced more often in our ranks in recent years, and that the Party has been too slow in processing some of the cases that have emerged. Early action has nevertheless been taken, and we will work to speed up procedures, to deal with cases of anti-Semitic abuse or attitudes. I am committed to making our Party a welcoming and secure place for Jewish people. Zero tolerance for anti-Semites means what it says, and the Party will proceed in that spirit. That demands among other things the overdue full implementation of the recommendations of the Chakrabarti report, including a programme of political education to increase awareness and understanding of all forms of anti-Semitism. The battle against anti-Semitism should never become a party political issue. It must unite all of us if we are both to honour the memory of the victims of the bestial crimes of the 20th century and build a future of equality and justice for all. In that spirit, I must make it clear that I will never be anything other than a militant opponent of anti-Semitism. In this fight, I am your ally and always will be.

How anti-Semitism saga unfolded,"Jeremy Corbyn says he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party A row about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party has been prompted by Jeremy Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. But this is not the first time the Labour leader has faced calls to deal with anti-Semitism in recent years. The current row can be traced back to two allegations in 2016 - a year after Mr Corbyn became leader. The first was against the MP for Bradford West, Naz Shah. It was revealed that the year before she became the MP,she shared a graphicshowing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"", with the comment ""problem solved"". A number of other posts emerged, with her comparing Israel to the Nazis and saying ""the Jews are rallying"". She apologised and resigned from her post as John McDonnell's parliamentary private secretary. This video can not be played 2016: Naz Shah blames ignorance for posts she admits were anti-Semitic Mr Corbyn said Ms Shah's remarks were ""offensive and unacceptable"", andshe was suspended from the party. She was reinstated in July and blamed her ""ignorance"" for the posts, admitting they were anti-Semitic. Labour's National Executive Committee gave her a formal warning, told her to apologise for bringing the party into disrepute and warned that if there was another incident she would be expelled. It was during the row over Ms Shah that the former London Mayor Ken Livingstone made his own comments that were alleged to have been anti-Semitic. Mr Livingstone appeared on BBC Radio London defending the MP and said he had never heard anyone in the Labour Party say anything anti-Semitic. He added: ""When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."" This led to widespread criticism of Mr Livingstone, with Labour MP John Mann accusing him of being a ""Nazi apologist"" in front of a media scrum. This video can not be played 2016: Ken Livingstone said Naz Shah's comments were not anti-Semitic Mr Livingstone said he was not suggesting Hitler was a Zionist, adding that the Nazi leader was ""a monster from start to finish"". But he said he had simply been quoting historical ""facts"". The long-time ally of Mr Corbyn wassuspended by the party for a year, but he refused to apologise and continued to repeat his comments. He was then suspended for a further 12 months in April 2017 after a Labour disciplinary panel upheld three charges of breaching party rules, prompting Mr Corbyn to order a fresh internal inquiry into his conduct. His suspension hasnow been extended againpending the outcome of an internal investigation. It was after Ms Shah's comments and Mr Livingstone's defence thatMr Corbyn announced an inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the partyat the end of April 2016. It was led by Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of human rights campaign group Liberty. She announced she had joined the Labour Party after her appointment as chair on the inquiry. The inquiry lasted for two months and at the end of June 2016, Ms Chakrabarti concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism,there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Ms Chakrabarti made 20 recommendations,external, including: Abusive references to any particular person or group based on actual or perceived physical characteristics and racial or religious tropes and stereotypes should have no place in Labour Party discourse. Labour members should resist the use of Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular. There should be procedural rule changes to improve the party's disciplinary process and the adoption and publication of a complaints procedure. The appointment of a general counsel to the Labour Party to give advice on issues including disciplinary matters and to take responsibility for instructing external lawyers. The party should increase the ethnic diversity of its staff. However, she said she did not approve of lifetime bans for party membership. Two months later, she became a Labour peer - the only appointment to the House of Lords Mr Corbyn has so far made. Around the same time,allegations of anti-Semitism arose from the Oxford University Labour Club. They claimed that members of the club had discussed Zionists rigging British elections, frequently used the term ""Zio"" and said that European attacks on Jews were justified because of Gaza. The allegations led to the Labour Party's national student organisation conducting their own inquiry, and its report was leaked to the press in the summer of 2016. In it,Baroness Royall concluded there had been ""some incidents"" of anti-Semitic behaviourand ""behaviour and language that would once have been intolerable is now tolerated"" in the club. However, she said there was ""no evidence the club is itself institutionally anti-Semitic"". Just under a year later, two students were cleared by the NEC's disputes committee of being anti-Semitic. 'Anti-Semitic behaviour' was said to have taken place at the Oxford University Labour Club Despite the inquiries,promises to adopt tough new rulesto tackle anti-Semitism at its conference and pledges from Mr Corbyn that racism would be ""rooted out"", a number of other allegations have come to light during his tenure. These included: Labour activist Jackie Walker being suspended from the party in 2016 forclaiming Jewish people were ""financiers of the sugar and slave trade"" Author Miko Peled allegedly saying during a speech at a fringe conference event that party membersshould be able to debate whether or not the Holocaust happened,external- he is not a member of the party Brighton and Hove Labour housing campaigner Daniel Harris being suspended afterposting a video on Facebook,externalfeaturing the faces of three Labour councillors superimposed on the heads of dancing Jewish figures A member from Barnet, London, being suspendedfor writing anti-Semitic posts on social media, leading to a councillor receiving abuse for reporting it Now, Mr Corbyn himself is facing criticism aftersending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural. In October 2012, Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockefeller destroyed Diego [Rivera's] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" Allow Twitter content?

Aftera letter from Jewish groupsthat held Mr Corbyn personally responsible for the ""hostile"" environment Jews in the Labour Party face, he is facing calls from some of his own MPs to take tougher action. But members of the Jewish Voice for Labour group claim the two organisations behind the letter do not represent the views of the ""great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness"" and that there is ""massively more anti-Semitism on the right of politics than on the left"". Responding to the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council with a letter of his own, Mr Corbyn said he would not ""tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in or around our party and movement"". He acknowledged that anti-Semitic attitudes had ""surfaced more often in [Labour's] ranks in recent years"" and emphasised the need for a ""deeper understanding of what constitutes anti-Semitism"".

Corbyn sorry for pain caused,"Mr Corbyn said he would meet representatives from the Jewish community in the ""coming days, weeks and months"" Jeremy Corbyn has said he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour party. In a statement, the Labour leader said he would be meeting representatives of the Jewish community this week to ""rebuild"" confidence in his party. He said Labour was ""anti-racist"" and he ""utterly condemns"" anti-Semitism. The comments came after Mr Corbyn was criticised for sending anapparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. In a message sent via Facebook, he had appeared to question a decision to remove the artist's controversial mural. He later called the mural ""deeply disturbing"" and backed its removal. Mr Corbyn's statement, which was released on Sunday evening, said: ""I want to be clear that I will not tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in and around our movement. ""We must stamp this out from our party and movement. ""We recognise that anti-Semitism has occurred in pockets within the Labour Party, causing pain and hurt to our Jewish community in the Labour Party and the rest of the country. ""I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused. Mr Corbyn said he and the party - which has ""deep roots in the Jewish community"" - were now campaigning to ""increase support and confidence in Labour"" among Jewish people in Britain. He said: ""I will be meeting representatives from the Jewish community over the coming days, weeks and months to rebuild that confidence in Labour as a party which gives effective voice to Jewish concerns and is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism in all its forms."" Tom Watson apologises over 'anti-Semitic' mural row Jeremy Corbyn regrets comments about 'anti-Semitic' mural The statement came after Jewish community leaders organised a protest in Westminster on Monday. The Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews said ""enough is enough"", announcing they will deliver a letter to the Parliamentary Labour Party. The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism group has also called for a national protest against anti-Semitism in Labour. The group has compiled a list of complaints against Mr Corbyn and deputy leader Tom Watson, who on Sunday also apologised for any hurt caused. In October 2012, street artist Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller destroyed Diego Viera's mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.""

""I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form."" Mear One - whose real name is Kalen Ockerman - has denied being anti-Semitic, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". On Sunday, senior Labour figures joined in condemnation of the mural but defended Mr Corbyn. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told Sky News that Mr Corbyn ""hasn't got an anti-Semitic bone in his body"" and that the row had ""misinterpreted the intentions of a really good and decent man"".

"Jewish groups in scathing attack on CorbynIn an open letter the Labour leader is accused of siding with anti-Semites ""again and again"".2h2 hours agoUK Politics","Jeremy Corbyn is seeking an ""urgent meeting"" with Jewish leaders to discuss their concerns about the rise of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Jewish groups have accused the Labour leader of not doing enough to tackle it, and in a strongly-worded open letter told him ""enough is enough"". Protesters gathered outside Parliament earlier, demanding action. MP Luciana Berger told the crowd anti-Semitism had become ""more commonplace, conspicuous and corrosive"". And her colleague Wes Streeting said the time was over for ""mealy-mouthed words"" from Mr Corbyn and action was needed to drain the ""cesspit"" of anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn repeated his apology to Jewish people in a letter to Jewish leaders ahead of the protest. In it, he says: ""I recognise that anti-Semitism has surfaced within the Labour Party, and has too often been dismissed as simply a matter of a few bad apples. ""This has caused pain and hurt to Jewish members of our party and to the wider Jewish community in Britain. ""I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused, and pledge to redouble my efforts to bring this anxiety to an end."" Full text: Jewish leaders' letter and Corbyn's response Kuenssberg: Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? He calls older forms of anti-Semitism such as the ""idea of Jewish bankers and capitalists exploiting the workers"" the ""socialism of fools"" - a reference to a phrase attributed to 19th Century German social democrat August Bebel. But, in his most detailed rejection of anti-Jewish prejudice yet, the Labour leader says ""newer forms of anti-Semitism have been woven into criticism of Israeli governments"". ""Criticism of Israel, particularly in relation to the continuing dispossession of the Palestinian people, cannot be avoided,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, comparing Israel or the actions of Israeli governments to the Nazis, attributing criticisms of Israel to Jewish characteristics or to Jewish people in general and using abusive phraseology about supporters of Israel such as 'Zio' all constitute aspects of contemporary anti-Semitism. ""And Jewish people must not be held responsible or accountable for the actions of the Israeli government."" Mr Corbyn says ""anti-Semitic attitudes have surfaced more often in our ranks in recent years"" and he accepts criticism that the party ""has been too slow in processing some of the cases that have emerged"". What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? Corbyn sorry over Labour anti-Semitism And he goes on to call for a meeting with Jewish leaders and pledge that the party will have ""zero tolerance for anti-Semites"". Labour will also bring forward a programme of political education within the party ""to increase awareness and understanding of all forms of anti-Semitism,"" he adds. In a statement on Sunday night, the Labour leader said he was ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party. On Monday, former PM Tony Blair told BBC's Newsnight that Mr Corbyn and the people around him did not understand the seriousness of the party's problem with anti-Semitism - although he said he did not believe Mr Corbyn personally was anti-Semitic. ""It's got beyond the stage where words will solve this. ""He's going to have to show that he really understands the issue, that the people round him really understand it, and that he's prepared to act on it,"" he added. The Jewish Voice for Labour group led a counter-demonstration By Brian Wheeler, BBC political reporter, in Parliament Square A few of those present in Parliament Square were clearly no fans of the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn, although most I spoke to were Labour supporters who felt real anger about what they saw as Mr Corbyn's ""soft"" stance on anti-Semitism. One man told me the party was in the grip of a ""horrible, pernicious"" form of racism. Tim, from Bermondsey, told me: ""I have been a member of the Labour Party since 1981 but I never thought I would be in the position of standing outside Parliament complaining about the treatment of our Jewish comrades."" The counter-demonstration organised by Jewish Voice for Labour was smaller, but everyone I spoke to was a Labour Party member - and they were all passionate supporters of Mr Corbyn, who felt he was being persecuted unfairly. One man was handing out ""Labour against the witch hunt"" leaflets. Another gave a speech attacking the Jewish Board of Deputies, ending with the battle cry: ""Freedom for Palestine, Corbyn for prime minister!"" Leah Levine, the co-chair of Jewish Voice for Labour, did not deny there was some anti-Semitism in Labour just as, she said, there was in society as a whole - but she argued it was being blown out of proportion by opponents of Mr Corbyn - and that anti-Semitism was a far bigger problem on the right. ""We are not a racist movement,"" she told me. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said in an open letter to Labour MPs there has been a ""repeated institutional failure"" to properly address anti-Semitism. It accuses Mr Corbyn of being unable to ""seriously contemplate anti-Semitism, because he is so ideologically fixed within a far-left world view that is instinctively hostile to mainstream Jewish communities"". The organisations refer to Mr Corbyn's apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012 and his attendance at ""pro-Hezbollah rallies"". They say the Labour leader has ""sided with anti-Semites"" either because of ""the far left's obsessive hatred of Zionism"" or ""a conspiratorial world view in which mainstream Jewish communities are believed to be a hostile entity, a class enemy"". The letter says those who push anti-Semitic material view Mr Corbyn as ""their figurehead"" and that he is ""the only person with the standing to demand that all of this stops"". This video can not be played Jonathan Arkush says Jeremy Corbyn ""needs to take action"" against anti-Semitism The letter was due to be delivered to a meeting of Labour MPs and peers, although the Labour leader is not expected to attend. The protest was held outside the Houses of Parliament, with a number of Labour MPs - including Liz Kendall, Ruth Smeeth, John Woodcock and Ian Austin - joining members of the Jewish community. Labour MP John Mann said anti-Semites needed to be ""driven out"" of the party. ""The very existence of my Labour Party is at stake,"" he said. ""It is time for Jeremy Corbyn to act."" At the same time, a counter-demonstration by pro-Corbyn Jewish Labour members was staged nearby. In a statement, the Jewish Voice for Labour group said it was ""appalled"" by the Board of Deputies' letter. ""They do not represent us or the great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness. ""Jeremy's consistent commitment to anti-racism is all the more needed now."" In 2016 an inquiry into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, led by Shami Chakrabarti, said the party was not overrun by racism but there was ""too much clear evidence... of ignorant attitudes"". It followed the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone amid anti-Semitism claims.

EU neighbours 'summon Russian envoys'The moves come amid reports of imminent diplomatic expulsions over the nerve agent attack in the UK.1han hour agoEurope,"The Kremlin has been expecting a series of diplomatic expulsions in response to the attack Russian ambassadors have been summoned to several European foreign ministries amid reports of imminent diplomatic expulsions, reports say. EU leaders agreed last week it was highly likely Russia was behind the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in the UK. The bloc recalled its envoy to Moscow. On Monday, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland summoned Russian ambassadors to their foreign ministries, officials were reported as saying. An adviser to Lithuania's foreign minister confirmed to the BBC that the government had summoned the ambassador in Vilnius. No official reason has so far been given for the diplomatic action but a number of countries across the EU had been expected to expel Russian diplomats this week over the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on 4 March in Salisbury, southern England. The pair remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Official statements from the European governments are expected on Monday afternoon. Russia has denied outright any connection to the attack. European Council President Donald Tusk said at the end of an EU summit on Friday that more than one country would expel diplomats ""but I don't think that it will be the whole group"". EU recalls Russia ambassador in spy row Russian spy: What we know so far Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats last week who it said were spies, in the aftermath of the nerve agent attack. Russia has responded with tit-for-tat expulsions. US President Donald Trump is also weighing whether to expel Russian diplomats, as recommended by the National Security Council, US media report. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has threatened to respond in kind. Speaking during a visit Estonia, British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the support shown for Britain was ""itself a defeat for President Putin"". Mr Williamson said the Russian president wanted to divide nations but they were, in fact, uniting. Separately, in Poland, a government official has been detained on suspicion of providing information to Russia about how Warsaw planned to block the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which it opposes. The suspect had been in contact with Russian intelligence agents in Warsaw, state news agency PAP said. This video can not be played The war of words between the UK and Russia On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron called the use of the Soviet-era Novichok agent in Salisbury an ""attack on European sovereignty"". German Chancellor Angel Merkel said co-ordinated measures among EU countries in response would be ""necessary"". On Monday, ambassadors from EU member states were meeting in Brussels to discuss what diplomatic measures individual countries may be prepared to take against Russia. ""Decisions are in the hands of member states, done in a European framework, with decisions at a national level,"" a spokeswoman for EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said. There are divisions among the EU's 28 member states as to how far retaliatory measures against Russia should go. Austria is among several countries that have already ruled out expelling diplomats.

'Exits blocked' in Russian mall inferno,"This video can not be played Firefighters tackle fatal shopping centre blaze Russian investigators and witnesses say there was no alarm and exits were blocked when a fire engulfed a shopping and entertainment mall in Siberia, killing at least 64 people. Many of the victims in the coal-mining city of Kemerovo were children. Russia's Investigative Committee spoke of blocked exits and ""serious violations"" at the Winter Cherry mall. Sunday's blaze started on an upper floor. The mall's shops, cinema and bowling alley were packed at the time. Video on social media showed people jumping from windows to escape. How party turned into nightmare The Investigative Committee says a fire safety technician at the complex ""switched off the alarm system"" after being alerted about the fire. The committee says two other fire safety officials have been detained for questioning, along with the Winter Cherry complex's technical director and the manager of a business located where the fire started. Ten people are still listed as missing. Local teachers are trying to trace their pupils, who were on holiday. They do not know how many were in the complex. In a Facebook post (in Russian), Kemerovo politician Anton Gorelkin said,externalthat ""fire exits were shut, turning the complex into a trap"" and ""there was no organised evacuation"". He also said a fire extinguisher that could have doused the flames at the start did not work. The region's deputy governor, Vladimir Chernov, said ""this is the question: why were the doors shut?"" Russian media said most of the roof had collapsed. The fire engulfed a children's trampoline room and a cinema on the fourth floor. The cause of the fire is not yet known. Firefighters said the building was still smouldering a day later, with smoke billowing out and the remaining structures at risk of collapse. The fire broke out at about 17:00 (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. Some 660 emergency personnel were deployed in the rescue effort. Deputy governor Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in the children's trampoline room. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Anna Kuznetsova, has blamed negligence, and called for urgent safety checks at similar entertainment complexes. Two witnesses told BBC Russian that they had seen the fire blazing in the trampoline room on the fourth floor but had not heard any fire alarm. Meanwhile, witness Anna Zarechneva told Russian RBC News that ""a woman burst into the cinema during the film and shouted 'Fire! Fire!', and we started running out"". ""The lights didn't come on in there to help us escape. We got out by following the floor lighting. But at that point no alarm bells were ringing. I only heard an alarm when I reached the first floor."" The daughter of a shop assistant who was working on the second floor said ""the alarm didn't go off... she learnt about the fire from a man who ran past her - there was no help from any staff"". 2009- 156 people die in a Perm nightclub inferno in the Urals region, Russia's worst fire in recent years (fireworks and lack of exits blamed) 2007- Fire engulfs a rural old people's home in the southern region of Krasnodar, killing 63 (burning cigarette blamed) 2006- 46 die in Moscow narcological hospital fire (arson blamed) 2003- A hostel fire at the Russian People's Friendship University in Moscow kills 44 (lack of safety measures blamed) 1999- Fire engulfs the police headquarters in the southern city of Samara, killing 57 people (burning cigarette blamed officially, but arson by criminals not ruled out) Source: Interfax news agency There are unconfirmed reports that some mall guards prevented children from fleeing down staircases.

The pair remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Official statements from the European governments are expected on Monday afternoon. Russia has denied outright any connection to the attack. European Council President Donald Tusk said at the end of an EU summit on Friday that more than one country would expel diplomats ""but I don't think that it will be the whole group"". EU recalls Russia ambassador in spy row Russian spy: What we know so far Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats last week who it said were spies, in the aftermath of the nerve agent attack. Russia has responded with tit-for-tat expulsions. US President Donald Trump is also weighing whether to expel Russian diplomats, as recommended by the National Security Council, US media report. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has threatened to respond in kind. Speaking during a visit Estonia, British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the support shown for Britain was ""itself a defeat for President Putin"". Mr Williamson said the Russian president wanted to divide nations but they were, in fact, uniting. Separately, in Poland, a government official has been detained on suspicion of providing information to Russia about how Warsaw planned to block the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which it opposes. The suspect had been in contact with Russian intelligence agents in Warsaw, state news agency PAP said. This video can not be played The war of words between the UK and Russia On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron called the use of the Soviet-era Novichok agent in Salisbury an ""attack on European sovereignty"". German Chancellor Angel Merkel said co-ordinated measures among EU countries in response would be ""necessary"". On Monday, ambassadors from EU member states were meeting in Brussels to discuss what diplomatic measures individual countries may be prepared to take against Russia. ""Decisions are in the hands of member states, done in a European framework, with decisions at a national level,"" a spokeswoman for EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said. There are divisions among the EU's 28 member states as to how far retaliatory measures against Russia should go. Austria is among several countries that have already ruled out expelling diplomats.

Abuse inquiry in Telford within 'months',"Alexis Jay is chair of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse The national inquiry into child sexual abuse will begin sessions in Telford ""in the next few months"". The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said it would be speaking to victims as part of its Truth Project. It comes after aSunday Mirror report that hundreds could have been victims of abuse in Telford since the 1980s.,external The inquiry is examining the extent to which organisations failed to protect children from sexual abuse. Midlands Live: Man guilty of boys' hit-and-run deaths; Burst pipe closes main road IICSA said the project was to give victims and survivors of child sexual abuse the chance to speak about their experiences. It said there were no legal consequences to attendingTruth Project,externalsessions and participants could make their own recommendations for change. Chair of the inquiry Prof Alexis Jay,who headed the inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham, said it was ""vital"" that anyone who wants to participate in the project had the chance to do so. She said: ""Child sexual abuse can take many different forms and we want to hear from as many victims and survivors as possible."" Sarah Champion said the victims and survivors have not been listened to for decades and that the council needed to listen to their stories It comes as Rotherham's MP Sarah Champion, said Telford & Wrekin Council needed to listen to the stories of the victims involved and called for it to hold a further inquiry. The Labour-run authority has previously said a government-led statutory institutional inquiry would have more powers than a council-led ""independent expert inquiry"", including the ability to compel witnesses to give evidence. Telford victim's daughter 'wants answers' Concerns over youth workers' caseloads How the system failed But it has now said it willlook into how it could hold its own investigationand a report will be presented to councillors on Thursday. Ms Champion said a non-statutory inquiry would be a good way forward, showing it would recognise and accept what victims and survivors have gone through. Telford and Wrekin Council previously said a council-led inquiry ""would not give victims answers"" and cost ""millions"" ""I personally believe that they (the victims) have been let down historically and so we owe it to them to put a marker in the ground."" Telford's Conservative MP Lucy Allanhas also called for a Rotherham-style inquiryinto the allegations. Councillor Shaun Davies, leader of Telford & Wrekin Council, said he was ""grateful"" for the decision by IICSA to bring the project to Telford. He added: ""This is another very important step forward in ensuring that we have as true a picture as possible of what happened in Telford to make any further recommendations of changes to the work of partners in Telford continue to do to tackle and prevent this vile crime."" Operation Chalice, launched by West Mercia Police,led to the jailing in 2012 of a group of men officers believe may have targeted more than 100 girls.

How Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded,"Jeremy Corbyn says he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party A row about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party has been prompted by Jeremy Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. But this is not the first time the Labour leader has faced calls to deal with anti-Semitism in recent years. The current row can be traced back to two allegations in 2016 - a year after Mr Corbyn became leader. The first was against the MP for Bradford West, Naz Shah. It was revealed that the year before she became the MP,she shared a graphicshowing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline ""Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States"", with the comment ""problem solved"". A number of other posts emerged, with her comparing Israel to the Nazis and saying ""the Jews are rallying"". She apologised and resigned from her post as John McDonnell's parliamentary private secretary. This video can not be played 2016: Naz Shah blames ignorance for posts she admits were anti-Semitic Mr Corbyn said Ms Shah's remarks were ""offensive and unacceptable"", andshe was suspended from the party. She was reinstated in July and blamed her ""ignorance"" for the posts, admitting they were anti-Semitic. Labour's National Executive Committee gave her a formal warning, told her to apologise for bringing the party into disrepute and warned that if there was another incident she would be expelled. It was during the row over Ms Shah that the former London Mayor Ken Livingstone made his own comments that were alleged to have been anti-Semitic. Mr Livingstone appeared on BBC Radio London defending the MP and said he had never heard anyone in the Labour Party say anything anti-Semitic. He added: ""When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."" This led to widespread criticism of Mr Livingstone, with Labour MP John Mann accusing him of being a ""Nazi apologist"" in front of a media scrum. This video can not be played 2016: Ken Livingstone said Naz Shah's comments were not anti-Semitic Mr Livingstone said he was not suggesting Hitler was a Zionist, adding that the Nazi leader was ""a monster from start to finish"". But he said he had simply been quoting historical ""facts"". The long-time ally of Mr Corbyn wassuspended by the party for a year, but he refused to apologise and continued to repeat his comments. He was then suspended for a further 12 months in April 2017 after a Labour disciplinary panel upheld three charges of breaching party rules, prompting Mr Corbyn to order a fresh internal inquiry into his conduct. His suspension hasnow been extended againpending the outcome of an internal investigation. It was after Ms Shah's comments and Mr Livingstone's defence thatMr Corbyn announced an inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the partyat the end of April 2016. It was led by Shami Chakrabarti, the former director of human rights campaign group Liberty. She announced she had joined the Labour Party after her appointment as chair on the inquiry. The inquiry lasted for two months and at the end of June 2016, Ms Chakrabarti concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism,there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Ms Chakrabarti made 20 recommendations,external, including: Abusive references to any particular person or group based on actual or perceived physical characteristics and racial or religious tropes and stereotypes should have no place in Labour Party discourse. Labour members should resist the use of Hitler, Nazi and Holocaust metaphors, distortions and comparisons in debates about Israel-Palestine in particular. There should be procedural rule changes to improve the party's disciplinary process and the adoption and publication of a complaints procedure. The appointment of a general counsel to the Labour Party to give advice on issues including disciplinary matters and to take responsibility for instructing external lawyers. The party should increase the ethnic diversity of its staff. However, she said she did not approve of lifetime bans for party membership. Two months later, she became a Labour peer - the only appointment to the House of Lords Mr Corbyn has so far made. Around the same time,allegations of anti-Semitism arose from the Oxford University Labour Club. They claimed that members of the club had discussed Zionists rigging British elections, frequently used the term ""Zio"" and said that European attacks on Jews were justified because of Gaza. The allegations led to the Labour Party's national student organisation conducting their own inquiry, and its report was leaked to the press in the summer of 2016. In it,Baroness Royall concluded there had been ""some incidents"" of anti-Semitic behaviourand ""behaviour and language that would once have been intolerable is now tolerated"" in the club. However, she said there was ""no evidence the club is itself institutionally anti-Semitic"". Just under a year later, two students were cleared by the NEC's disputes committee of being anti-Semitic. 'Anti-Semitic behaviour' was said to have taken place at the Oxford University Labour Club Despite the inquiries,promises to adopt tough new rulesto tackle anti-Semitism at its conference and pledges from Mr Corbyn that racism would be ""rooted out"", a number of other allegations have come to light during his tenure. These included: Labour activist Jackie Walker being suspended from the party in 2016 forclaiming Jewish people were ""financiers of the sugar and slave trade"" Author Miko Peled allegedly saying during a speech at a fringe conference event that party membersshould be able to debate whether or not the Holocaust happened,external- he is not a member of the party Brighton and Hove Labour housing campaigner Daniel Harris being suspended afterposting a video on Facebook,externalfeaturing the faces of three Labour councillors superimposed on the heads of dancing Jewish figures A member from Barnet, London, being suspendedfor writing anti-Semitic posts on social media, leading to a councillor receiving abuse for reporting it Now, Mr Corbyn himself is facing criticism aftersending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural. In October 2012, Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockefeller destroyed Diego [Rivera's] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" Allow Twitter content?

The Labour leader has since called the mural ""deeply disturbing"" and said he is ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by anti-Semitism in the party. Aftera letter from Jewish groupsthat held Mr Corbyn personally responsible for the ""hostile"" environment Jews in the Labour Party face, he is facing calls from some of his own MPs to take tougher action. But members of the Jewish Voice for Labour group claim the two organisations behind the letter do not represent the views of the ""great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness"" and that there is ""massively more anti-Semitism on the right of politics than on the left"". Responding to the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council with a letter of his own, Mr Corbyn said he would not ""tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in or around our party and movement"". He acknowledged that anti-Semitic attitudes had ""surfaced more often in [Labour's] ranks in recent years"" and emphasised the need for a ""deeper understanding of what constitutes anti-Semitism"". Mr Corbyn also said he recognised the ""overdue"" need for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Chakrabarti report and apologised for ""not having studied the content of the [Mear One] mural more closely"".

Watson issues apology,"This video can not be played Watson: ""I am very, very sorry that people feel hurt by this"" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson says Jeremy Corbyn was right to express regret for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural. Jeremy Corbyn faced criticism over his initial response to a Facebook post by street artist Mear One in 2012. He later called the mural ""deeply disturbing"" and backed its removal. Mr Watson also apologised personally for any hurt that had been caused by his leader's comments. Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row In October 2012, Mear One posted a picture of his mural in east London called ""Freedom of Humanity"" on Facebook, with the words: ""Tomorrow they want to buff my mural. Freedom of expression. London calling. Public Art."" Mr Corbyn replied: ""Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller destroyed Diego [Rivera's] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin."" More recently, Labour MP Luciana Berger sought clarification from the leader's office on the 2012 comments - made three years before Mr Corbyn became the party's leader. Mr Corbyn said: ""I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic. ""I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form."" Mear One - whose real name is Kalen Ockerman - has denied being anti-Semitic, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". Allow Twitter content?

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Watson was shown the mural and asked for his reaction to it. ""My reaction is that is a horrible anti-Semitic mural that was rightly taken down,"" he said. But he defended his leader - who said he regretted he ""did not look more closely at the image"" before commenting online - adding: ""You are showing it to me on a 32-inch screen on national television and I have seen it about 100 times on social media. ""It's very different from seeing it on Facebook when you are on the move."" Mr Watson said Mr Corbyn had made his comment in regards to freedom of expression, but apologised for any offence caused. ""I am very, very sorry that people feel hurt by this and that is why I think it is right that Jeremy has expressed regret for it,"" said Mr Watson. The deputy leader added that it was time Labour said ""enough is enough"" and they would ""work harder to stamp out anti-Semitism"" in the party. Jeremy Corbyn says he ""wholeheartedly supported"" the removal of the mural in east London Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said the mural was ""grotesque and disgusting"" but Mr Corbyn had given his explanation for his online comment. He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""The most important thing here is that the Labour Party keeps on saying that anti-semitism has no place in our party, in our communities, or in our society. ""We've got to have zero tolerance, and zero tolerance has got to be more than two words. It's got to dictate everything the Labour Party does in relation to anti-Semitism."" Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told Sky News that Mr Corbyn ""hasn't got an anti-Semitic bone in his body"" and that the row had ""misinterpreted the intentions of a really good and decent man"". But Ms Berger called Mr Corbyn's response ""wholly inadequate"". Shetweeted,external:  ""It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about Anti-Semitism. ""I will be raising this further."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Friday, Labour MP Angela Smith joined other members in supporting Ms Berger and sent a statement to the Leader's Office, calling for Mr Corbyn to appear before MPs to explain himself. It read: ""It is horrifying that anyone in our party - never mind the leader - should be able to condone anti-Semitism without facing consequences. And rather than facing up, Jeremy Corbyn has chosen to dissemble to defend himself. ""It is simply not credible to suggest that a man with his knowledge of foreign affairs did not recognise those images for what they were.

Russian shopping centre inferno kills 64,"This video can not be played Firefighters tackle fatal shopping centre fire At least 64 people have died in a fire that engulfed a shopping and entertainment complex in the Siberian coal-mining city of Kemerovo. Many of the victims are children. Ten people are still listed as missing. The blaze started on an upper floor of the Winter Cherry complex during school holidays. The mall's shops, cinema and bowling alley were packed at the time. Video posted on social media showed people jumping from windows to escape the flames. ""According to preliminary information, the roof collapsed in two cinemas,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The authorities have launched an investigation. Four people have been detained for questioning, including the head of the company that manages the shopping centre, according to the Investigative Committee. The owner of the Winter Cherry complex is among those being held. The fire broke out at about 17:00 (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. Some 660 emergency personnel were deployed in the rescue effort. Firefighters said the building was still smouldering a day later, with smoke billowing out and the remaining structures at risk of collapse. The region's deputy governor Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in a children's trampoline room. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Anna Kuznetsova, has blamed negligence, and called for urgent safety checks at similar entertainment complexes. Firefighters had to be lifted to a great height to tackle the blaze Two witnesses told BBC Russian that they had seen the fire blazing in the trampoline room on the fourth floor but had not heard any fire alarm. Meanwhile, witness Anna Zarechneva told Russian RBC News that ""a woman burst into the cinema during the film and shouted 'Fire! Fire!', and we started running out"". ""The lights didn't come on in there to help us escape. We got out by following the floor lighting. But at that point no alarm bells were ringing. I only heard an alarm when I reached the first floor."" At least nine of the bodies found so far are children. As well as those killed, 11 injured victims are being treated in hospital, suffering from smoke inhalation. Smoke billowed from the building The most serious case is an 11-year-old boy whose parents and siblings died in the fire, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said. He reportedly fell from the fourth floor and is in intensive care with multiple injuries. An Instagram post from Kemerovo showed a big queue of volunteers waiting to donate blood at a clinic.

Kemerovo, a key coal-producing area, lies about 3,600km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow. The shopping centre, covering 23,000 sq m (248,000 sq ft), opened in 2013. It includes a petting zoo, all of whose animals are reported to have died. Yevgeny Dedyukhin, deputy head of the Kemerovo region emergency department, said the area of the fire was about 1,500 sq m. ""The shopping centre is a very complex construction,"" he said. ""There are a lot of combustible materials."" Russia factory fire leaves workers dead.

Northern children 'too often left behind',"The government says its Northern Powerhouse programme is investing billions to boost local economies Too many children growing up in the north of England are facing the double disadvantage of entrenched deprivation and poor schools, a report warns. England's Children's Commissioner Anne Longfield says children from poorer homes face an education gap that starts before school and widens over time. She calls for greater investment for struggling families and a scheme to boost teacher recruitment in the North. The government says it has committed Â£70m to improve schools in the region. The commissioners' report - Growing Up North, Look North: A generation of children await the powerhouse promise - is based on 12 months of research and conversations with children, schools, businesses, councils, health professionals and charities. It says that while many children growing up in the North are thriving, there are huge gaps between the poorest children in the North and the poorest in London. It says a child on free school meals (FSM) living in Hackney, east London, is three times more likely to go to university than a child on FSM from Hartlepool. And London children on FSM are 40% more likely to achieve a good maths and English GSCE than children in the North. Is there a north-south divide in schools? Osborne urges action on north-south divide The commissioner's research also finds: too many children start school far behind where they should be, often with special educational needs that have not been picked up more than half of the secondary schools serving the North's most deprived communities are judged to be less than good large numbers of children drop out of education before they reach the age of 18 there is a lack of confidence among children that economic regeneration will mean more jobs or opportunities Ms Longfield is urging the government to inject more investment into the most disadvantaged areas of northern England to support children and family hubs to help families who are struggling. She also calling for a northern schools programme to boost teacher recruitment and new partnerships between employers and schools to broaden horizons. Three young people from Elliott Hudson College in Leeds told the BBC that, while they were confident about their own individual futures, there were barriers for a lot of young people in the North. ""There's way more opportunities and a lot more investment down south than there is up north,"" said Hafsah. ""Maybe in the future they might bring it up north, but right now it's definitely down south, concentrated down south. This video can not be played How Northern students see North-South education gap ""It's really frustrating to be honest because everyone deserves equal opportunities, especially because in our country that is, like, supposed to be the main focus. ""It seems like if you're from London and a deprived area, you know you'd get a good education, regardless. Whereas if you're up North and you live in a deprived area - well you're practically living in that cycle. ""For you it's like you're deprived, your kids might be deprived unless one of you decides to up your game and walk out.  But it's not fair."" Tiseana said money issues were also a barrier for a lot of youngsters. ""A lot of people I know went for the apprenticeship route because they get money and they didn't want to go to university because of the debt. I think that's a big problem. ""So I think that if you have a lot of money and you can pay for your university fees straightway then it's a lot easier for you."" Qasim added: ""If you have more money, you have better opportunities to get the best and if you have quite a bit of money you can even pay for your own education. Qasim says money plays a big part in opportunity ""If you have more money, it does lead to more doors being opened for you. ""Some of us may have part-time jobs, but if your parents have a lot more money than other parents would do, then you won't have to get a part-time job so you can focus more on education, rather having a part-time job and having to pay for stuff."" Ms Longfield said that disadvantage manifested itself in childhood in many ways, including ""a lack of confidence, uncertainty and low expectation, isolated communities with narrow and poor job prospects, poor school results and poor connections to further and higher education"". She added: ""Children in some areas look at new developments in the north but have little hope they might feel the benefits or have increased choices in life as a result. ""There are 3.6 million children growing up in the north. Every one of them should have the brightest future possible and best opportunities to look forward to happy, healthy and prosperous lives. ""Where they live and grow up should not be a barrier to making the most of their lives."" The Children's Commissioner wants more investment in the north of England Sir John Townsley, chief executive of The Gorse Academies Trust which runs 10 schools in Leeds, said the eyes of central government were not on the North. ""The great interest from government remains in the south and south-east. We're barely visited, no-one's particularly interested in what we do."" Sir John said children from disadvantaged backgrounds needed high expectations of them, alongside a high quality education. ""We still have many young people who in their primary schools, in their secondary schools, are not in very strong schools and they themselves come from lives that are characterised by deprivation. ""So they suffer that double disadvantage that means it's incredibly difficult for them to move forward effectively on to rigorous programmes of study, success in A-levels, success in degrees, success in higher level apprenticeships. ""Far too many people from disadvantaged backgrounds are not really put into a position where they are challenged to a truly rigorous and dynamic academic education. ""The greatest gift that we can give to a child who has very little is not to make excuses, not to seek reasons to have them avoid doing very difficult things, but actually to make them challenged more than anyone else in any of our schools."" The Department for Education said five of the 12 disadvantaged areas selected as ""Opportunity Areas"" to receive government funding are in the north. Since 2010, there are now 1.9 million more children in England in good or outstanding schools, it added. A government spokesman said: ""We want to create a country where everyone gets the best start in life, no matter what their background is or where they live. ""As the children's commissioner notes, many children in the north are now thriving, but there is more to do. ""Our Northern Powerhouse programme includes Â£3.4bn investment in projects to boost the local economy, Â£12m to spread good teaching practice in English and improve early literacy, and schemes that help families to support their child's education at home."" The government has also committed Â£70m to boost school performance in the north as part of the Northern Powerhouse Schools Strategy. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Where a child is born should not determine their life chances. ""By slashing funding for local services, introducing the first cuts to school budgets in a generation and denying the north the level of investment that some areas in the south can take for granted, the Tories are holding back children in the north of England"" Is there a north-south divide in schools?

'Record number' of slavery victims in UK,"More than 5,000 potential victims of modern slavery and trafficking were referred to UK authorities last year, a record number, a report has revealed. The National Crime Agency said British nationals made up the highest number of cases for the first time, followed by people from Albania and Vietnam. The number of children thought to be victims rose by 66% from 2016. The agency said the increase in referrals was ""driven by greater awareness"" of the problem. The NCA said the increase in child referrals was partly because of the growth of a drug supply route, known as ""county lines"". This is where city-based gangs use young people as couriers to move drugs like heroin and crack cocaine to rural and coastal areas. ""They are enticed by wealth but quickly coerced by violence,"" said the NCA's deputy director, Tom Dowdall. Investigators said this was largely the reason for the rise in the number of UK nationals involved - up to 819 last year from 326 in 2016. The children forced to sell drugs Is a slave doing your nails? Last year, 5,145 potential victims of trafficking and slavery were flagged up to the National Referral Mechanism, which identifies and supports victims. That was the highest number recorded by the UK authorities since the figures were first compiled in 2009 - and a 35% rise from 2016. The report found that forced labour accounted for 2,352 cases - almost half of all referrals. The figures also showed that in a third of cases (1,744) it was suspected that people had been exploited for sexual purposes. More than 2,000 children (2,118) were referred for help, compared with 1,278 the previous year. Slavery 'affecting every city' in UK Modern slavery victims in 'plain sight' The analysis showed that 116 different nationalities made up the referrals from 2017, with Albanian (777) and Vietnamese (739) nationals the next most commonly reported potential victims after the British. Will Kerr, NCA director, said greater reporting of modern slavery was behind the overall rise in referrals but that the figures ""almost certainly represent an underestimate of the true scale"" in the UK. He added that authorities were dealing with an ""evolving threat"" as criminals go into online spaces - particularly ""adult services websites"", to enable their offending. Victoria Atkins, Home Office minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, said the figures showed more potential victims were being ""identified and protected"" because of an ""improved understanding of modern slavery"". She said the government was ""leading the world in our response to this horrendous crime"". The Modern Slavery Act wasintroduced into law in 2015. It states an offence is committed if someone holds another in slavery or servitude or requires them to perform forced or compulsory labour. The legislation also increased the maximum jail term for people traffickers from 14 years to life. Modern slaves in the UK, often said to be hiding in plain sight, are working in nail bars, construction sites, brothels, cannabis farms and in agriculture. Traffickers are using the internet to lure their victims with hollow promises of jobs, education and even love. There is no typical victim. They can be men, women or children of all ages but it is normally more prevalent among the most vulnerable, minorities or socially-excluded groups. Many believe they are escaping poverty, limited opportunities at home, a lack of education, unstable social and political conditions or war.

Russian envoys 'summoned by EU neighbours',"The Kremlin has been expecting a series of diplomatic expulsions in response to the attack Russian ambassadors have been summoned to several European foreign ministries amid reports of imminent diplomatic expulsions, reports say. EU leaders agreed last week it was highly likely Russia was behind the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in the UK. The bloc recalled its envoy to Moscow. On Monday, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland summoned Russian ambassadors to their foreign ministries, officials were reported as saying. An adviser to Lithuania's foreign minister confirmed to the BBC that the government had summoned the ambassador in Vilnius. No official reason has so far been given for the diplomatic action but a number of countries across the EU had been expected to expel Russian diplomats this week over the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on 4 March in Salisbury, southern England. The pair remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Official statements from the European governments are expected on Monday afternoon. Russia has denied outright any connection to the attack. European Council President Donald Tusk said at the end of an EU summit on Friday that more than one country would expel diplomats ""but I don't think that it will be the whole group"". EU recalls Russia ambassador in spy row Russian spy: What we know so far Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats last week who it said were spies, in the aftermath of the nerve agent attack. Russia has responded with tit-for-tat expulsions. US President Donald Trump is also weighing whether to expel Russian diplomats, as recommended by the National Security Council, US media report. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has threatened to respond in kind. Speaking during a visit Estonia, British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the support shown for Britain was ""itself a defeat for President Putin"". Mr Williamson said the Russian president wanted to divide nations but they were, in fact, uniting. Separately, in Poland, a government official has been detained on suspicion of providing information to Russia about how Warsaw planned to block the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which it opposes. The suspect had been in contact with Russian intelligence agents in Warsaw, state news agency PAP said. This video can not be played The war of words between the UK and Russia On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron called the use of the Soviet-era Novichok agent in Salisbury an ""attack on European sovereignty"". German Chancellor Angel Merkel said co-ordinated measures among EU countries in response would be ""necessary"". On Monday, ambassadors from EU member states were meeting in Brussels to discuss what diplomatic measures individual countries may be prepared to take against Russia. ""Decisions are in the hands of member states, done in a European framework, with decisions at a national level,"" a spokeswoman for EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said. There are divisions among the EU's 28 member states as to how far retaliatory measures against Russia should go. Austria is among several countries that have already ruled out expelling diplomats.

Heathrow: No redress for disabled passengers,"This video can not be played Heathrow CEO John Holland Kaye responds to criticism from disabled passengers Disabled passengers who are stranded on planes at Heathrow airport will not be compensated, its chief executive says. The BBC's Frank Gardner criticised the airportafter he was left waiting for 100 minutes because his wheelchair had been misplaced by ground staff. CEO John Holland-Kaye said: ""I don't think it's reasonable that we should take financial responsibility."" He said Heathrow would aim to help disabled passengers off the plane within 20 minutes of landing. On Saturday, the BBC's security correspondent said that airports would only listen to disabled passengers if there was a financial penalty. He has used a wheelchair since being shot six times by militants while reporting in Saudi Arabia, in 2004. Mr Gardner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Heathrow was not the only UK airport where he had experienced problems disembarking. He described one ""extreme case"" where a captain and first officer had to carry him off a plane because, after an hour of waiting, the only exit was via a staircase. Allow Twitter content?

In an exclusive interview with Stephen Nolan on BBC Radio 5 live, Mr Holland-Kaye committed to a new target for disabled people to be disembarked from aircraft. He said Heathrow will now be working to a standard of ""20 minutes"", after taking advice from Mr Gardner. He clarified this would be ""20 minutes after everybody else has got off"" the aircraft. Speaking to the Today programme, Mr Holland-Kaye added: ""We have invested significantly over the past 12 months to improve the service [for people with disabilities]. ""[The airport has] over 250 new people to support them, new equipment but also training better in how to support people, not just with physical disabilities but with hidden disabilities."" He added: ""We are not perfect yet. We are much, much better than we were 12 months ago but we have a long way to go."" Roberto Castiglioni, chair of the Heathrow Access Advisory Group, which was established by the airport to help improve accessibility and inclusion, said the ""simple solution"" was to introduce legislation to ensure correct procedures are in place at airports. He added that airlines needed to share responsibility for failings. ""Some airlines do it better than others,"" said Mr Castiglioni. ""[Mr Gardner] clearly mentioned that when he travels [with] British Airways he doesn't have this problem, so it's a matter of getting all airlines at the same level."" 'Orange snow' baffles eastern Europeans Scouts pay out Â£42,000 over autism claim Missing Corrie Mckeague search to be stood down On Saturday the Stephen Nolan programme was inundated with calls, texts and emails from listeners who reported major problems when travelling through airports across the UK. One caller, Anne, highlighted that wheelchairs went missing for her and a group of six companions. Adam spoke of his mother being forced to walk from an aircraft, resulting in her being hospitalised. Mr Holland-Kaye compared his job to that of the ""mayor of a city"" and promised to fix flaws in Heathrow's provision for disabled passengers. He said the airport needed to make sure it had the right information on passengers, to ensure the correct help was available once a plane had landed. He explained that, in the case of the BBC journalist, the wheelchair had been mislabelled and therefore did not go to the correct gate. Mr Holland-Kaye said he would be using Heathrow's influence to help airlines and their handlers improve their service and prevent such situations occurring in the future. He apologised to any other passengers who have had a poor experience, and encouraged those affected to get in touch. He said Heathrow Airport is ""committed to making sure that any passengers travelling through Heathrow will have a good experience, and will be treated with dignity and respect."" ""We want to be seen as the best airport in the world for passenger service. We've made huge improvements, but clearly we have more to do, and I'm committed to doing that.""

Ex-leader's arrest sparks Catalan protests,"This video can not be played Catalan protesters clash with police in Barcelona Protests broke out across the Spanish region of Catalonia on Sunday after former leader Carles Puigdemont was taken into custody in Germany. At least 89 people were injured in clashes with police and four arrests were made. Mr Puigdemont, who is wanted in Spain for sedition and rebellion, was detained by German police acting on a European arrest warrant. He appeared before a German judge on Monday and was remanded in custody. Prosecutor Georg-Friedrich Guentge said Mr Puigdemont ""appeared calm and composed"". Mr Puigdemont was detained while crossing from Denmark on his way to Belgium, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since Catalonia's parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain in October. A European warrant for his arrest was reissued on Friday. Catalan crisis in 300 words In central Barcelona, protesters chanted ""Freedom for the political prisoners"" and ""This Europe is shameful!"" as they headed to the offices of the European Commission and the German consulate. Spanish news agency Efe estimated crowds of 55,000 in the centre of the city. People tie yellow ribbons - a symbol of support for jailed Catalan politicians - to a fence outside the German Consulate in Barcelona Smaller demonstrations were held in Girona, where Mr Puigdemont once served as mayor, Tarragona and Lleida. Some protesters also formed road blocks in various locations. Tensions in Catalonia are very high and its separatist leaders abandoned plans to name a new president afterthe arrest on Friday of the latest candidate, Jordi Turull, sparked protests in Barcelona. An image of Spain's King Felipe VI was burnt at a protest in Girona Spain's Supreme Court has ruled 25 that Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. They all deny the allegations. German police said that Mr Puigdemont was detained by a highway patrol in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, which borders Denmark. Mr Puigdemont had been living in Belgium He had been on a trip to Finland to meet lawmakers and attend a conference last week when the arrest warrant against him was reissued, taking him by surprise. He slipped out of Finland before the authorities could arrest him but only got as far as Germany before being intercepted. His spokesman, Joan Maria Pique, said he had been heading to Belgium ""to put himself, as always, at the disposal of Belgian justice"". International warrants for Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders were withdrawn in December by a Spanish judge, who said they had shown a willingness to return to the country. Mr Puigdemont spent Sunday night in a prison in the north German town of NeumÃ¼nster. His court appearance there on Monday was a formality to confirm his identity. The court remanded him in custody pending extradition proceedings. Mr Puigdemont faces charges of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of public funds in Spain as a result of his role in last year's Catalan banned independence referendum. The charges in Spain could result in up to 30 years in prison. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Germany has 60 days to decide whether to return him. In order to do so, its judges need to assess whether the Spanish charges are punishable under German law. Criminal lawyer Martin Heger told Germany's Spiegel website (in German) that the lesser charge of misappropriation of public funds was also a crime under German law,external, and therefore it was clear that the exiled ex-leader would have to be extradited. However, if he is extradited on that charge, he can only be tried on that offence. It is unclear whether the alleged crimes of rebellion and sedition are punishable in Germany. The extradition procedure can last about two months. Mt Puigdemont also has the right to oppose the warrant and apply for asylum in Germany. Spain's latest move is considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight. Various other Catalan politicians have been subjected to new warrants, including Catalonia's former education minister, Clara Ponsati.She is in Scotland, where she has a position at the University of St Andrews, and is preparing tohand herself in. The number of European arrest warrants issued has increased since 2005, according to EU figures.,externalIn 2015, about 16,000 warrants were issued and about 5,000 executed.

Passing sentence at Oxford Crown Court,external, Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said each death was an ""unnecessary human tragedy"". The trust will pay Â£950,000 for Mrs Colvin's death and just over Â£1m for that of Connor Sparrowhawk. The judge said the penalty was ""a just and proportionate outcome that marks the seriousness of the Trust's offending, the terrible consequences of that offending, and the other material factors that I have indicated"".

"Scouts pay out Â£42,000 over autism claimThe family of a boy aged 11 say he was discriminated against and excluded from certain activities.15m15 minutes agoUK","Ben Gleeson joined a cub scout group in Hertfordshire in 2015 An 11-year-old boy has received Â£42,000 in compensation after his family said his cub scout group discriminated against him for having autism. Ben Gleeson joined a group in Hertfordshire in 2015, but was later told he could not go to camps or take part in athletics without supervision. His family sued the group - saying it amounted to a ban - and the dispute was settled out of court last year. The Scout Association said it had apologised and started an inquiry. Ben joined the 10th Harpenden Scout Group in January 2015, having previously been a member of the beavers. His parents said they explained his autism to the scout leaders and suggested strategies to help calm and distract him, should he get upset. We grew up not knowing we were autistic US Boy Scouts revoke badges from Down's syndrome boy They said his autism manifested as anxiety to change and that he needed to know plans in advance. They said that although few people would realise he was autistic on first meeting him, if something unpredictable happened he could become distressed. In March 2016, Ben had a short episode at a cub scout camp in which he became distressed. He tried to run a short distance from the rest of the group at an indoor venue after he was asked to change into a pair of shoes he could not find. Later, he said he did not want to join an egg-and-spoon race because of a phobia of spoons. Soon afterwards, the pack leaders said Ben could not travel with the rest of the group on a bus to events or participate in athletics.  They also said he had to have one-to-one supervision at other events. The scout group said the decision had been made for the health and safety of the whole pack. However, Ben's parents - who are both lawyers - argued the decision effectively amounted to a ban. This video can not be played Beverly Gleeson said the Scout group's decision would ""single Ben out"" While she accepted her son needed some extra support, Ben's mum, Beverly Gleeson, told the BBC the decision was a ""complete overreaction"". She said: ""Pretty much every event had to be supervised on a one-to-one basis, which I felt wasn't inclusive."" She said the decision would ""single Ben out"" and that she feared it would make him ""feel different"". ""I felt he didn't need it.  He didn't have this level of supervision at school. He'd made one mistake and then that was it, they wanted to make the rules and regulations. It was supposed to be a dialogue,"" she added. Ben, who said he enjoyed being with his friends and taking part in the activities, added: ""It was quite upsetting, my friends were there and I quite enjoyed it."" ""I don't like the idea of someone following me all the time,"" he added. The family's solicitor, Chris Fry of Fry Law, said: ""I am pretty sure no one goes into scouting looking to exclude anyone. Those giving up their time need to know that they are properly trained and that they are protected by the organisation that they love and serve. ""The organisation needs to anticipate that scouts with autism need reasonable adjustments so they can access activities in the same way as other children."" The family eventually sued under the Equality Act, as well as for breach of privacy and under data protection legislation - claiming emails and a briefing to parents had identified them. Insurers for the Scout Association settled the case out of court, paying the Gleeson family Â£42,000 plus costs. The Gleesons have donated some of the money to a local autism charity, while Ben's portion is being held in a trust.

Ms Gleeson said it was only after the BBC had become involved that the Scout's national headquarters apologised to them. In a statement, the Scout Association said: ""The handling of Ben's case was completely unacceptable. ""We are very sorry that Ben and his family were not supported as they should have been by their cub scout pack, and we have made a personal apology to them. ""While cases like this are very unusual, we know that action must be taken. We have established an inquiry to investigate what went wrong in this case."" The association said it was also looking at plans for mandatory training for all adult volunteers on ""how to make reasonable adjustments for young people with developmental disabilities"".

England lose to NZ despite Stokes innings,"Ben Stokes was dismissed three balls before the dinner break after making 66 from 188 balls First Test, Eden Park, Auckland (day five of five) England 58 & 320:Stokes 66; Astle 3-39 New Zealand 427-8 dec:Nicholls 145; Broad 3-78 New Zealand won by an innings and 49 runs Scorecard England lost by an innings and 49 runs to New Zealand in the first Test at Auckland despite the efforts of all-rounder Ben Stokes on the final day. Stokes made a patient 66 from 188 balls as he and Chris Woakes (52) helped the tourists recover after early wickets. The Durham man's dismissal three balls before the dinner break effectively ended England's hopes of a draw. They will get a chance to level the two-match series at Christchurch in the second Test, which starts on Thursday. The seeds of defeat were sown on day one of this match when England weredismissed for a paltry 58- their sixth-lowest total in Test history and arguably the batting nadir of the winter. However, with two daysseverely impacted by rain,they had a realistic chance to salvage a draw if they could bat out the final day. This was not a typical day five pitch at Eden Park, and conditions were relatively comfortable for batting but the task proved beyond England. They lost three wickets in the first session, but Stokes proved difficult to dislodge as he shared a seventh-wicket stand of 83 with Woakes. His vigil was ended three balls before the end of the second session, though, when he skied a bouncer from Neil Wagner (3-77) and was caught by Tim Southee in the point region. That left New Zealand requiring three wickets in 31.3 overs under the floodlights and Wagner duly had Woakes caught at short leg before James Anderson was last man out when he was caught by Trent Boult off Todd Astle, who finished with 3-39. One-dimensional England must make changes - Agnew TMS podcast: Agnew and Swann review the final day Podcast: Aggers' journalist panel discusses the series Smith fined and banned for ball tampering New Zealand fast bowler Neil Wagner captured the key wickets of Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes Five years ago to the day at Eden Park, Matt Prior made an unbeaten century as Englanddramatically batted outto draw the third Test and the series. Prior faced 182 balls and occupied the crease for four hours and 29 minutes - the longest innings of his Test career - as he and Monty Panesar batted memorably at the death. England had begun that day 90-4, while on this occasion they had seven wickets in hand and 132 on the board, and Stokes and Woakes both showed a similar kind of fortitude and stoicism to Prior. Defeat felt inevitable as soon as Stokes was dismissed in the 114th over, although fellow all-rounder Woakes continued the defiance for another 12 overs until he fended a Wagner bouncer into the hands of Henry Nicholls at short leg. England will have had high hopes for this series after the first part a winter of discontentresulted in a 4-0 thrashing by Australiain the Ashes. However, it must feel a case of deja vu for supporters waking up in the UK to see England's Test team struggling on a tour. This was their 10th defeat in their past 12 overseas matches. Ultimately they paid the price for a disastrous first innings where rustiness, poor footwork and shot selection - combined with the brilliance of man-of-the-match Boult - proved the difference. England at least showed in the second innings they could compete but that will be only a crumb of comfort. Stokes was playing in a Test match for the first time sincean incident outside a Bristol nightclublast September, which saw him charged with affray. Stokes has denied the charges andwill appear in court on 6 August. England batsman Dawid Malan said before play started on the final day that ""reputations are built"" on ""saving your team by batting all day"". However, Malan's was the first wicket to fall when he hung his bat out and edged Southee to the hands of Tom Latham at second slip. In 2013's draw, England benefited from dropped catches. Here, Jonny Bairstow was put down twice as wicketkeeper BJ Watling parried a tough chance down leg side before Boult spilled a dolly at mid-on off leg-spinner Astle. Bairstow's luck ran out, though, when he pulled a long hop from Astle and Black Caps skipper Kane Williamson took a fine diving catch at short mid-wicket. Moeen Ali lived a charmed life before he was given out lbw on review to Boult (3-67) before Stokes and Woakes led the fightback. Stokes in particular had a steely determination in his eyes and his tussles with Wagner's short-pitched bowling were gripping. He batted for 188 balls - 25 more than he needed for hisrecord-breaking double hundred against South Africain 2016 - with maturity in a measured innings. The major regret for the 26-year-old will be the frustrating manner of his dismissal, which was out of kilter with the rest of the knock. Just three balls were left before the dinner break when he flailed at a wide-ish bouncer from Wagner and Southee ran around to take the catch. It later emerged Stokes, who had not bowled in the match, had taken painkillers after feeling some discomfort in his back. He will be assessed by England's medical staff. Once he was out, victory for New Zealand was inevitable as Craig Overton was trapped lbw by Astle, Woakes bounced out and Anderson chipped one into the hands of Boult. This was England's fifth loss in their past six Tests and their 10th defeat in their past 12 Test matches overseas. Since the beginning of 2016, England's away record in Test cricket is worse than all but Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. There have been 11 occasions when a team have been 200 behind with three wickets in hand heading into the final day and have batted through to save the Test. Ben Stokes' partnership with Chris Woakes was only the fifth all winter to have lasted more than 180 balls. This was New Zealand's 10th Test victory over England in 102 Tests. England's last win in a Test match overseas was against Bangladesh in October 2016 England captain Joe Root:""We weren't at our best in all departments if we're being brutally honest. We couldn't take those 10 wickets and it's important we learn those lessons quickly as we've got another Test match next week and we want to win it to draw the series. ""Decisions have to be made with rational thinking and we'll do that over the next couple of days. ""I had great belief in the boys in the dressing room. I asked them before the start of play to show how much it meant to them to play for England. The Test match wasn't lost today, it was lost on day one. ""I'm a little bit sore. You always worry about finger injuries but I'll be fine for the next Test."" New Zealand captain Kane Williamson:""We knew we would have to work hard against a quality England bowling attack and to take wickets in the second innings. It was great we were able to exert pressure throughout the day. ""We knew we wanted to come out and play the long game and not get too far ahead of ourselves. We knew the ball wouldn't do a lot for us. We had a couple go our way but they came after periods of pressure. ""A big part was taking wickets before the end of the session. It was important - the guys spirits were high. Trent [Boult] was outstanding, so was Tim [Southee].""

The key questions for AustraliaFive memorable ball-tampering moments'Unusual if Lehmann didn't know plan',"This video can not be played Watch: Bancroft and Smith admit ball-tampering plan Australian cricket is mired in the biggest scandal to hit the Test game since three Pakistan players were caught spot-fixing at Lord's in 2010. The pictures from thethird day of the third Test against South Africaof Cameron Bancroft rubbing what we were later told was yellow tape against the ball and then hiding it down the front of his trousers were only outdone on the scale of extraordinary by the news conference that followed. Bancroft and then captain Steve Smith came clean. It was a premeditated and calculated plan to alter the condition of the ball. There is a debate to be had on the severity of ball-tampering as a cricketing crime. It is nothing new for bowlers and fielders to attempt to conjure something from the leather by fair means or foul. That, though, is for another day. Right now, the ferocity of the backlash against Smith, his team and its management has left a number of Australian cricketing giants fighting for their jobs and the governing body of the sport down under wondering how to repair its shattered reputation. TV cameras caught the moment Bancroft took what he said was yellow tape out of his pocket From what has happened so far, we know Smith, vice-captain David Warner and Bancroft are conspirators. But how many other players are in the ""leadership group"" referred to by Smith? Was substitute fielder Peter Handscomb, seen on a walkie-talkie and then passing a message to Bancroft, also in on the plot? There are also questions around coach Darren Lehmann. Smith said only players were involved, but is that to be believed? If not, and Lehmann genuinely didn't know, why not? Is it worse to be in on the plan, or to be so out of control that you are unaware your team is about to do something so brazenly stupid, damaging and beyond the laws of the game? His future is also on the line. Former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie told Sky Sports: ""Until we've heard from Lehmann, we won't know any more. He hasn't fronted the media yet - everyone is waiting for that. ""It's hard to think there isn't going to be a fall-out and a big change in personnel. It appears there's going to be some big changes on and off the field. ""The Australia side has to have a deep reflection on how they go about the game, how they're perceived in the wider cricketing world. That perception isn't good, that's the brutal reality."" In the short term, Australia need a captain for the fourth and final Test following theone-match ban handed to Smith by the International Cricket Council. It seems unlikely that can be Warner who, like Smith, was removed from his role for the rest of the third Test by Cricket Australia for being part of the ""leadership group"" that cooked up the plan. If there are further bans to be dished out by CA, how would that affect the match in Johannesburg, which is due to begin on Friday? Might the majority of a new squad have to be scrambled to South Africa? After that, there are decisions to be made on the long-term futures of Smith, Warner and any other players or coaches involved. Smith and Bancroft have form as a news-conference double act. It was the same pair who lampoonedJonny Bairstow's 'headbutt'after the first Ashes Test in Brisbane. This video can not be played What really happened between Bancroft & Bairstow? It is quite an effort to pull off a second memorable performance, but this time for quite different reasons. On the one hand, it can be said they should be applauded for facing the music right away. They came clean, rather than choosing to hide. They admitted what they did was wrong and promised it would never happen again. But did they have much choice? The evidence against Bancroft was overwhelming, played and replayed not only on TV, but on big screens inside the ground, causing him to ""panic"", in his own words. Once Bancroft was in the dock, it was only right Smith joined him. It would have been grossly unfair to ask a team-mate or coach to explain what happened on their behalf. Both men said the attempt to alter the ball did not work because the umpires did not opt to change it. If that was offered as a defence, Smith followed up by saying Australia had made a ""poor choice"". In amongst the contrition came the most pertinent question - were they sorry they had cheated, or sorry they had been caught? ""If we weren't caught, I'd still feel incredibly bad about it,"" said Smith, who also insisted it had never happened before. When that was put to Stuart Broad, the England pace bowler said he had seen no evidence of ball-tampering during the Ashes. He did wonder, though, why Australia, with such a talented pace attack, would need to move from the method that defeated his team 4-0. ""Look at the Ashes series we've just played, look through all of those Test matches and they reverse swing the ball sometimes in conditions you wouldn't expect the ball to reverse,"" said Broad. ""I don't understand why they've changed their method for this one game."" Bancroft speaks to umpires Llong and Illingworth and shows them a black cloth in his pocket Some have suggested Australia should have forfeited the match, but that was a fanciful notion that would have punished spectators for the actions of the players. In the middle of a Test, it is hard to see what more Cricket Australia could have done. Indeed, there is an argument to say that, from the other side of the world and without all the facts, CA was hasty in even acting so soon, but the weight of public opinion forced its hand. For Smith, though, to be temporarily replaced as skipper by wicketkeeper Tim Paine midway through a Test is a remarkable fall from grace. Little more than two months ago, he was the toast of the nation, having batted England into submission in the Ashes, held the urn aloft in Sydney and then been namedAustralian of the Year,externalby The Australian newspaper. Now he is a clinging to a role often referred to as the second most important job in Australia, behind that of the prime minister, by his fingernails. And even PM Malcolm Turnbull has expressed his outrage. This video can not be played Australian cheating beyond belief - PM Turnbull Before Smith was removed as skipper for the third Test, Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland would only go as far as to say the batsman was ""currently"" the captain. The likes of Kevin Pietersen, Simon Katich and government agency theAustralia Sports Commissionhave called for Smith to go, while predecessor Michael Clarke has said he would be open to returning to the job ""if asked by the right people"". Former wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist said Australian cricket is the ""laughing stock"" of the sporting world. ""I'm stunned and shocked, embarrassed and sad,"" he toldBBC Radio 5 live. It may be a stretch to say the men in baggy green caps have gone feral, but this is the latest and most serious violation of an unwritten cricketing moral code that Australia claim to adhere to. Cast your mind back to the Ashes and talk of ""the line"" - the mythical barrier which separates what is acceptable on a cricket field to what is not. Australia insisted it was not crossed, but some English voices disagreed. It seems a moveable line. Take Warner as an example. Never short of a word, all is fair game until Proteas wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock fires back with comments that cross ""the line"", resulting inugly scenesduring the first Test in South Africa. The series has been played in an unpleasantly hostile atmosphere and nobody can condone the reported comments from some fans towards Warner or any Australian player about their wives, partners or families. However, it seemed a little rich for Lehmann to be complaining when, before the 2013-14 Ashes, he asked the home supporters to""give it"" to Broadin the hope he ""cries and goes home"". And what of the perceived hounding of South Africa captain Faf du Plessis when he was accused of ball-tampering on his side's last tour of Australia? Or when England'sJames Anderson faced similar claimsin December? It has been suggested the tension of this series has played a part in pushing Smith and his team towards this error of judgement. Still, what goes around comes around, and sympathy for Australia will not run deep. ""They've set themselves as this higher than high, pious team who look down at everyone and set the benchmark for what is right and what is wrong in cricket,"" said former England off-spinner Graeme Swann. ""Everyone that's played against them knows that's an absolute joke."" 5 memorable ball-tampering moments Smith under pressure from government to go Smith fined and banned for one Test Bergvall scores late winner as Spurs beat Liverpool in first leg West Ham to appoint Potter after sacking Lopetegui Tottenham's Bentancur taken off on stretcher after injury against Liverpool Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the factory he used to work in to find out how they bake 1.4 million loaves a week Dara Ã  Briain and Isy Suttie discover strange-but-true tales The pair are joined by astronaut Helen Sharman to learn about how humans learned to survive in space A round-up of 2024's top sports stories.

Breaking|Breaking newsMan pleads guilty over hit and run deathsMan admits causing death of brothers aged six and two in hit and run in Coventry last month,"Corey, six, and Casper Platt-May, two, were on a family trip to a park when they were hit by a car A man has admitted causing the deaths of two young brothers in a hit-and-run crash in Coventry last month. Corey, six, and Casper Platt-May, two, were on a family trip to the park when they were hit by Robert Brown's car. Brown, 53, of Attwood Crescent, Wyken, admitted causing the deaths by dangerous driving on 22 February. The court heard he had previously been jailed for possessing a machete and had been let out on licence just six days before the crash. Midlands Live: Murder charge over Giovanni Lewis death; Who helps the paramedics? Corey and Casper had been with a group of up to nine children crossing Macdonald Road in the Stoke area of the city at about 14:00 GMT when Brown's Ford Focus ploughed into them. Both boys were taken to hospital with severe injuriesbut neither could be saved. Their mother, who had been with them at the time, was unhurt. Corey (left) and Casper Platt-May were described by Corey's head teacher as ""lovely boys"" The court heard Brown - and his passenger, Gwendoline Harrison - tried to flee the scene on foot but members of the public attempted to stop them. Harrison, 42, hit a someone who intervened and admitted a charge of assault intending to resist arrest. The judge adjourned sentencing until 27 April and remanded Brown in custody until then. Tyrone Smith QC, defending, said the presiding judge would need to watch ""troubling"" CCTV footage before deciding on a punishment. The court heard how Robert Brown and Gwendoline Harrison tried to flee the scene after the crash The court heard Brown had been jailed for six months in November for possessing an offensive weapon and was released on licence less than a week before the crash. One of Brown's release conditions was not to contact Harrison, of Triumph Close, also in Wyken, while on licence. On Monday, Brown admitted all charges, including two counts of death by dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified, using a motor vehicle without insurance and using a motor vehicle without a licence. The prosecution said it would offer no evidence on Harrison's second alleged offence of perverting the course of justice. Photos, tributes and toys were among items left at the scene A donation page set up to help the boys' family cover funeral costs has amassed more than Â£26,000 following donations from more than 1,500 supporters. Louise Platt-May said earlier this month on Facebook she could not bring herself to talk about what happened to her sons, but that she was ""overwhelmed"" by the community's help. Previously she had described Corey as loving ""school more than any kid I know"" but said his ""main passion in life was his football"". Floral tributes were laid at Coventry Cathedral, where a memorial service was held last week Casper ""was so loving and caring and constantly told his family how much he loved them,"" his mother said. She said: ""He loved walking everywhere with his wellies and splashing in the puddles."" Rob Matthews, head of Ravensdale Primary School where Corey went, described them as ""lovely boys"", adding that Corey ""lit up the room he was in with his energy"". The boys also have two brothers, aged eight and four.

"Vote Leave activist to 'reveal evidence'Brexit activist to present ""recommendations to MPs"" over claims the campaign exceeded spending limits.9h9 hours agoUK Politics","The Brexit activist who has accused the Vote Leave campaign of exceeding legal spending limits said his claims will be backed up by evidence presented to MPs. Shahmir Sanni alleged that the official Brexit campaign used a different group, BeLeave, to overspend. Both groups deny any wrongdoing and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a prominent Vote Leave campaigner, said the claims were ""utterly ludicrous"". Labour's Tom Watson said that ""if needs be"" the police should investigate. Mr Sanni said his lawyers would be presenting ""recommendations to MPs"" at a news conference in London on Monday. He told the BBC: ""It's quite literally a matter of democracy and it's up to the people of this country to have a look at the evidence themselves and decide for themselves whether the allegations are false or true. ""Lawyers are looking at the evidence and [have] said there is reasonable ground and so they are going to be presenting their recommendations to MPs."" Vote Leave 'broke spending limits' Electoral Commission reopens Vote Leave probe In interviews withChannel 4 News,externaland the Observer, Mr Sanni - a volunteer for Vote Leave - said the official Brexit campaign donated Â£625,000 to a youth-oriented group, BeLeave, but required it to spend the money on a firm Vote Leave used for its digital advertising. Vote Leave would have gone over its campaign spending limit of Â£7m if it had spent the money. The Electoral Commission is already looking into whether Vote Leave spent more than it was entitled to during the campaign. Vote Leave chief Dominic Cummings denied the claim and Brexit Secretary David Davis told the BBC it was the job of the commission, not ministers, to make a judgement. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told the BBC the Electoral Commission needs to get sufficient resources to investigate Mr Sanni told the Observer,externalÂ£625,000 was given to the founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, who - he claims - was not in control of how the money was spent. He said everything they did they passed through Vote Leave manager Stephen Parkinson, Mr Sanni's ex-boyfriend, who is now the prime minister's political secretary. Mr Sanni told the newspaper that most of the donation went to Canadian data firm Aggregate IQ, which has been linked to Cambridge Analytica - the firm facing claims it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent. He said he - along with two other pro-Brexit friends - reported the overspending allegation to the Electoral Commission on Thursday. Vote Leave chief denies Cambridge Analytica links Cummings hits out ""In effect they used BeLeave to overspend, and not just by a small amountâ¦ Almost two thirds of a million pounds makes all the difference and it wasn't legal,"" said Mr Sanni, who first worked as a Vote Leave outreach volunteer before working for BeLeave.

Leader regrets mural post,"Jeremy Corbyn has expressed ""sincere regret"" at failing to look more closely at an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in London before questioning its removal. The Labour leader has been criticised for responding to a Facebook post by street artist, Mear One, in 2012, which asked why the image faced destruction. Mr Corbyn had written: ""Why? You are in good company"" - but has now said the image was ""deeply disturbing"". The mural, ""Freedom of Humanity"", was removed from East London in 2012. ""I wholeheartedly support its removal,"" Mr Corbyn said. Labour MP Luciana Berger - who highlighted the post on Twitter - called Mr Corbyn's response ""wholly inadequate"". She said: ""It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about anti-Semitism. I will be raising this further."" Allow Twitter content?

In the post from October 2012, the Labour leader appeared to oppose the mural's removal - by comparing it to Diego Rivera's ""Man at the Crossroads"", which the US Rockefeller family covered over because it featured a picture of Lenin. In a statement, Mr Corbyn said he had intended to make a ""general comment"" about the removal of public art on the grounds of freedom of speech. He added: ""I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic.

"England lose to NZ despite Stokes inningsEngland lose by an innings and 49 runs to New Zealand in the first Test, despite Ben Stokes' efforts.","Ben Stokes was dismissed three balls before the dinner break after making 66 from 188 balls First Test, Eden Park, Auckland (day five of five) England 58 & 320:Stokes 66; Astle 3-39 New Zealand 427-8 dec:Nicholls 145; Broad 3-78 New Zealand won by an innings and 49 runs Scorecard England lost by an innings and 49 runs to New Zealand in the first Test at Auckland despite the efforts of all-rounder Ben Stokes on the final day. Stokes made a patient 66 from 188 balls as he and Chris Woakes (52) helped the tourists recover after early wickets. The Durham man's dismissal three balls before the dinner break effectively ended England's hopes of a draw. They will get a chance to level the two-match series at Christchurch in the second Test, which starts on Thursday. The seeds of defeat were sown on day one of this match when England weredismissed for a paltry 58- their sixth-lowest total in Test history and arguably the batting nadir of the winter. However, with two daysseverely impacted by rain,they had a realistic chance to salvage a draw if they could bat out the final day. This was not a typical day five pitch at Eden Park, and conditions were relatively comfortable for batting but the task proved beyond England. They lost three wickets in the first session, but Stokes proved difficult to dislodge as he shared a seventh-wicket stand of 83 with Woakes. His vigil was ended three balls before the end of the second session, though, when he skied a bouncer from Neil Wagner (3-77) and was caught by Tim Southee in the point region. That left New Zealand requiring three wickets in 31.3 overs under the floodlights and Wagner duly had Woakes caught at short leg before James Anderson was last man out when he was caught by Trent Boult off Todd Astle, who finished with 3-39. One-dimensional England must make changes - Agnew TMS podcast: Agnew and Swann review the final day Podcast: Aggers' journalist panel discusses the series Smith fined and banned for ball tampering New Zealand fast bowler Neil Wagner captured the key wickets of Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes Five years ago to the day at Eden Park, Matt Prior made an unbeaten century as Englanddramatically batted outto draw the third Test and the series. Prior faced 182 balls and occupied the crease for four hours and 29 minutes - the longest innings of his Test career - as he and Monty Panesar batted memorably at the death. England had begun that day 90-4, while on this occasion they had seven wickets in hand and 132 on the board, and Stokes and Woakes both showed a similar kind of fortitude and stoicism to Prior. Defeat felt inevitable as soon as Stokes was dismissed in the 114th over, although fellow all-rounder Woakes continued the defiance for another 12 overs until he fended a Wagner bouncer into the hands of Henry Nicholls at short leg. England will have had high hopes for this series after the first part a winter of discontentresulted in a 4-0 thrashing by Australiain the Ashes. However, it must feel a case of deja vu for supporters waking up in the UK to see England's Test team struggling on a tour. This was their 10th defeat in their past 12 overseas matches. Ultimately they paid the price for a disastrous first innings where rustiness, poor footwork and shot selection - combined with the brilliance of man-of-the-match Boult - proved the difference. England at least showed in the second innings they could compete but that will be only a crumb of comfort. Stokes was playing in a Test match for the first time sincean incident outside a Bristol nightclublast September, which saw him charged with affray. Stokes has denied the charges andwill appear in court on 6 August. England batsman Dawid Malan said before play started on the final day that ""reputations are built"" on ""saving your team by batting all day"". However, Malan's was the first wicket to fall when he hung his bat out and edged Southee to the hands of Tom Latham at second slip. In 2013's draw, England benefited from dropped catches. Here, Jonny Bairstow was put down twice as wicketkeeper BJ Watling parried a tough chance down leg side before Boult spilled a dolly at mid-on off leg-spinner Astle. Bairstow's luck ran out, though, when he pulled a long hop from Astle and Black Caps skipper Kane Williamson took a fine diving catch at short mid-wicket. Moeen Ali lived a charmed life before he was given out lbw on review to Boult (3-67) before Stokes and Woakes led the fightback. Stokes in particular had a steely determination in his eyes and his tussles with Wagner's short-pitched bowling were gripping. He batted for 188 balls - 25 more than he needed for hisrecord-breaking double hundred against South Africain 2016 - with maturity in a measured innings. The major regret for the 26-year-old will be the frustrating manner of his dismissal, which was out of kilter with the rest of the knock. Just three balls were left before the dinner break when he flailed at a wide-ish bouncer from Wagner and Southee ran around to take the catch. It later emerged Stokes, who had not bowled in the match, had taken painkillers after feeling some discomfort in his back. He will be assessed by England's medical staff. Once he was out, victory for New Zealand was inevitable as Craig Overton was trapped lbw by Astle, Woakes bounced out and Anderson chipped one into the hands of Boult. This was England's fifth loss in their past six Tests and their 10th defeat in their past 12 Test matches overseas. Since the beginning of 2016, England's away record in Test cricket is worse than all but Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. There have been 11 occasions when a team have been 200 behind with three wickets in hand heading into the final day and have batted through to save the Test. Ben Stokes' partnership with Chris Woakes was only the fifth all winter to have lasted more than 180 balls. This was New Zealand's 10th Test victory over England in 102 Tests. England's last win in a Test match overseas was against Bangladesh in October 2016 England captain Joe Root:""We weren't at our best in all departments if we're being brutally honest. We couldn't take those 10 wickets and it's important we learn those lessons quickly as we've got another Test match next week and we want to win it to draw the series. ""Decisions have to be made with rational thinking and we'll do that over the next couple of days. ""I had great belief in the boys in the dressing room. I asked them before the start of play to show how much it meant to them to play for England. The Test match wasn't lost today, it was lost on day one. ""I'm a little bit sore. You always worry about finger injuries but I'll be fine for the next Test."" New Zealand captain Kane Williamson:""We knew we would have to work hard against a quality England bowling attack and to take wickets in the second innings. It was great we were able to exert pressure throughout the day. ""We knew we wanted to come out and play the long game and not get too far ahead of ourselves. We knew the ball wouldn't do a lot for us. We had a couple go our way but they came after periods of pressure. ""A big part was taking wickets before the end of the session. It was important - the guys spirits were high. Trent [Boult] was outstanding, so was Tim [Southee].""

Missing airman search to be stood down,"Corrie Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was last seen at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016 There are ""no realistic lines of inquiry left"" in the investigation into the disappearance of RAF airman Corrie Mckeague, police have said. Mr Mckeague was 23 when he was last seen on 24 September 2016 walking into a bin loading bay in Bury St Edmunds. Suffolk Police said the inquiry, which has cost Â£2.1m, had been handed to a cold case team but remained open. Det Supt Katie Elliott said: ""It is extremely disappointing that we have not been able to find Corrie."" ""We have now reached a point where we are unable to make any further progress, and have gone as far as we realistically can with the information we have,"" she added. A police spokesman said the case had always been a missing persons investigation and there is no evidence of ""criminal activity or third party involvement"". A landfill site was extensively searched as part of the investigation By Alex Dunlop, BBC East senior defence reporter Corrie Mckeague had no reason to vanish. He comes from a loving family and has a strong second family - his fellow gunners at RAF Honington. I use the present tense because he is still officially missing, but the police and his parents now hold out little hope that the Scottish airman is still alive. Why has this 18-month investigation gained such huge public interest? A combination of factors: Corrie is a serviceman, his girlfriend - unbeknown to him - was pregnant with his baby daughter and his family have kept the search for him in the public domain thanks to social media. Now the case has 'gone cold', Corrie Mckeague's family will be devastated but not surprised. I have come to know Corrie's mother, Nicola Urquhart, well. She is articulate and determined. Her family is in Scotland, but she has had to make Suffolk her second home. Corrie's family cannot properly mourn until they have some resolution. For now that seems a long way off. Suffolk Police said it had been ""re-examining the evidence relating to all realistic theories to identify whether there is anything else that could be done to establish what could have happened to Corrie"". But the force said an assessment of the evidence ""still points to Corrie being transported from the 'horseshoe' area in a bin lorry and ultimately taken to the Milton landfill site"".

Vote Leave activist to 'reveal evidence',"The Brexit activist who has accused the Vote Leave campaign of exceeding legal spending limits said his claims will be backed up by evidence presented to MPs. Shahmir Sanni alleged that the official Brexit campaign used a different group, BeLeave, to overspend. Both groups deny any wrongdoing and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a prominent Vote Leave campaigner, said the claims were ""utterly ludicrous"". Labour's Tom Watson said that ""if needs be"" the police should investigate. Mr Sanni said his lawyers would be presenting ""recommendations to MPs"" at a news conference in London on Monday. He told the BBC: ""It's quite literally a matter of democracy and it's up to the people of this country to have a look at the evidence themselves and decide for themselves whether the allegations are false or true. ""Lawyers are looking at the evidence and [have] said there is reasonable ground and so they are going to be presenting their recommendations to MPs."" Vote Leave 'broke spending limits' Electoral Commission reopens Vote Leave probe In interviews withChannel 4 News,externaland the Observer, Mr Sanni - a volunteer for Vote Leave - said the official Brexit campaign donated Â£625,000 to a youth-oriented group, BeLeave, but required it to spend the money on a firm Vote Leave used for its digital advertising. Vote Leave would have gone over its campaign spending limit of Â£7m if it had spent the money. The Electoral Commission is already looking into whether Vote Leave spent more than it was entitled to during the campaign. Vote Leave chief Dominic Cummings denied the claim and Brexit Secretary David Davis told the BBC it was the job of the commission, not ministers, to make a judgement. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told the BBC the Electoral Commission needs to get sufficient resources to investigate Mr Sanni told the Observer,externalÂ£625,000 was given to the founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, who - he claims - was not in control of how the money was spent. He said everything they did they passed through Vote Leave manager Stephen Parkinson, Mr Sanni's ex-boyfriend, who is now the prime minister's political secretary. Mr Sanni told the newspaper that most of the donation went to Canadian data firm Aggregate IQ, which has been linked to Cambridge Analytica - the firm facing claims it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent. He said he - along with two other pro-Brexit friends - reported the overspending allegation to the Electoral Commission on Thursday. Vote Leave chief denies Cambridge Analytica links Cummings hits out ""In effect they used BeLeave to overspend, and not just by a small amountâ¦ Almost two thirds of a million pounds makes all the difference and it wasn't legal,"" said Mr Sanni, who first worked as a Vote Leave outreach volunteer before working for BeLeave. ""They say that it wasn't coordinated, but it was. And so the idea thatâ¦ the campaign was legitimate is false."" This video can not be played Vote Leave denies breaching spending rules in the EU referendum Vote Leave has previously said it made the donation to Mr Grimes because it was coming up to its Â£7m spending limit and wanted a way of using the Â£9.2m it had raised from individuals and companies on campaigning activities - and that it had received permission to from the Electoral Commission to do this. The campaign separately spent Â£2.7m on the services of AIQ in the run-up to the EU referendum. BeLeave was set up to give young pro-Brexit campaigners a voice during the referendum. Separate campaign groups could spend up to Â£700,000 if they registered as permitted participants. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Egypt to vote in presidential electionThe polls will be open for three days, with incumbent Abdel Fattah El-Sisi facing one challenger.1han hour agoMiddle East","The ballot has been criticised by human rights activists for a lack of competition Egyptians have begun three days of voting in an election widely expected to deliver a second four-year term for President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. His sole challenger, Moussa Mustafa Moussa, is a little-known party leader who had supported him until his last-minute decision to enter the race. Two other potential candidates dropped out, while a third was arrested. Mr Sisi led the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule. Since then, he has overseen what human rights group say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of tens of thousands of people. He has also faced an insurgency by jihadist militants based in the Sinai Peninsula, who have killed hundreds of security personnel and civilians in attacks. Among the potential challengers to Mr Sisi was Gen Sami Anan, a former military chief-of-staff. He is currently in prison after being arrested for announcing his candidacy without seeking the military's permission. Abdul Fattah al-Sisi (L) and his sole challenger Moussa Mustafa Moussa (R) Another potential candidate was Ahmed Shafiq, a former prime minister who narrowly lost to Morsi in the 2012 election. He was deported from the United Arab Emirates after declaring his candidacy and dropped out a month later. The liberal opposition was represented by the human rights lawyer, Khaled Ali. But he also withdrew, saying the conditions did not allow for a fair contest. Mr Sisi was set to run unopposed, but hours before nominations were due to close Mr Moussa joined the race. Security personnel have been deployed outside polling stations across the country Despite having previously endorsed the president for a second term, the al-Ghad party leader insisted that he would mount a full challenge to Mr Sisi. However, opposition activists dismissed Mr Moussa as a ""puppet"". Mr Sisi insisted last week that the withdrawals were not his doing, telling an Egyptian TV channel: ""I wish we had one, or two, or three, or 10 of the best people and you choose however you want."" By Tom Bateman, BBC News, Cairo Voting at one polling station in a central Cairo neighbourhood appeared orderly with a steady trickle of people coming and going.

Supporters of Abdul Fattah al-Sisi say he has restored stability to the country Egypt has been plagued by unrest since a popular uprising forced long-time President Hosni Mubarak to step down during the so-called ""Arab Spring"" in 2011. Mr Sisi's supporters argue that Egypt is now far more stable than when, as the military's commander-in-chief, he ousted Mubarak's democratically-elected successor. But critics say the stability has come at a heavy cost in human rights. More than 1,000 protesters have been killed in clashes with security forces, at least 60,000 people are reported to have been arrested or charged, hundreds have been handed preliminary death sentences, and hundreds more have gone missing. Most of them have been supporters of Morsi's now-banned Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, but liberal and secular activists have also been targeted. The election is being held amid tight security, with police and soldiers deployed outside polling stations across the country. The jihadist group Islamic State (IS) threatened to launch attacks ahead of the vote. A car bomb killed two policemen in the city of Alexandria on Saturday On Saturday, two policemen were killed in a car bombing that targeted the security chief in the city of Alexandria. Gen Mostafa al-Nemr escaped unharmed. The interior ministry said late on Sunday that its forces had killed six militants believed to have been involved in the attack. It identified them as members of the Hasm movement, which it referred to as the armed wing of the Brotherhood. Mr Sisi's supporters express confidence in the president's ability to enforce security across Egypt and put down the jihadist insurgency.

Children missing in Russian mall inferno,"This video can not be played Firefighters tackle fatal shopping centre fire At least 64 people have died in a fire that engulfed a shopping and entertainment complex in the Siberian coal-mining city of Kemerovo. Many of the victims are children. Ten people are still listed as missing. The blaze started on an upper floor of the Winter Cherry complex during school holidays. The mall's shops, cinema and bowling alley were packed at the time. Video posted on social media showed people jumping from windows to escape the flames. ""According to preliminary information, the roof collapsed in two cinemas,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The authorities have launched an investigation. Four people have been detained for questioning, including the head of the company that manages the shopping centre, according to the Investigative Committee. The owner of the Winter Cherry complex is among those being held. The fire broke out at about 17:00 (10:00 GMT) on Sunday. Some 660 emergency personnel were deployed in the rescue effort. Firefighters said the building was still smouldering a day later, with smoke billowing out and the remaining structures at risk of collapse. The region's deputy governor Vladimir Chernov was quoted as saying the fire probably began in a children's trampoline room. ""The preliminary suspicion is that a child had a cigarette lighter which ignited foam rubber in this trampoline room, and it erupted like gunpowder,"" he said. However, Rossiya 24 TV, a national broadcaster, said an electrical fault was the most likely cause - as in most previous deadly fires in Russia. Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Anna Kuznetsova, has blamed negligence, and called for urgent safety checks at similar entertainment complexes. Firefighters had to be lifted to a great height to tackle the blaze Two witnesses told BBC Russian that they had seen the fire blazing in the trampoline room on the fourth floor but had not heard any fire alarm. Meanwhile, witness Anna Zarechneva told Russian RBC News that ""a woman burst into the cinema during the film and shouted 'Fire! Fire!', and we started running out"". ""The lights didn't come on in there to help us escape. We got out by following the floor lighting. But at that point no alarm bells were ringing. I only heard an alarm when I reached the first floor."" At least nine of the bodies found so far are children. As well as those killed, 11 injured victims are being treated in hospital, suffering from smoke inhalation. Smoke billowed from the building The most serious case is an 11-year-old boy whose parents and siblings died in the fire, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said. He reportedly fell from the fourth floor and is in intensive care with multiple injuries. An Instagram post from Kemerovo showed a big queue of volunteers waiting to donate blood at a clinic.

Kemerovo, a key coal-producing area, lies about 3,600km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow. The shopping centre, covering 23,000 sq m (248,000 sq ft), opened in 2013. It includes a petting zoo, all of whose animals are reported to have died. Yevgeny Dedyukhin, deputy head of the Kemerovo region emergency department, said the area of the fire was about 1,500 sq m. ""The shopping centre is a very complex construction,"" he said. ""There are a lot of combustible materials."" Russia factory fire leaves workers dead.

Jewish groups' scathing attack on Corbyn,"Jeremy Corbyn is seeking an ""urgent meeting"" with Jewish leaders to discuss their concerns about the rise of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. Jewish groups have accused the Labour leader of not doing enough to tackle it, and in a strongly-worded open letter told him ""enough is enough"". Protesters gathered outside Parliament earlier, demanding action. MP Luciana Berger told the crowd anti-Semitism had become ""more commonplace, conspicuous and corrosive"". And her colleague Wes Streeting said the time was over for ""mealy-mouthed words"" from Mr Corbyn and action was needed to drain the ""cesspit"" of anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn repeated his apology to Jewish people in a letter to Jewish leaders ahead of the protest. In it, he says: ""I recognise that anti-Semitism has surfaced within the Labour Party, and has too often been dismissed as simply a matter of a few bad apples. ""This has caused pain and hurt to Jewish members of our party and to the wider Jewish community in Britain. ""I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused, and pledge to redouble my efforts to bring this anxiety to an end."" Full text: Jewish leaders' letter and Corbyn's response Kuenssberg: Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? He calls older forms of anti-Semitism such as the ""idea of Jewish bankers and capitalists exploiting the workers"" the ""socialism of fools"" - a reference to a phrase attributed to 19th Century German social democrat August Bebel. But, in his most detailed rejection of anti-Jewish prejudice yet, the Labour leader says ""newer forms of anti-Semitism have been woven into criticism of Israeli governments"". ""Criticism of Israel, particularly in relation to the continuing dispossession of the Palestinian people, cannot be avoided,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, comparing Israel or the actions of Israeli governments to the Nazis, attributing criticisms of Israel to Jewish characteristics or to Jewish people in general and using abusive phraseology about supporters of Israel such as 'Zio' all constitute aspects of contemporary anti-Semitism. ""And Jewish people must not be held responsible or accountable for the actions of the Israeli government."" Mr Corbyn says ""anti-Semitic attitudes have surfaced more often in our ranks in recent years"" and he accepts criticism that the party ""has been too slow in processing some of the cases that have emerged"". What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? Corbyn sorry over Labour anti-Semitism And he goes on to call for a meeting with Jewish leaders and pledge that the party will have ""zero tolerance for anti-Semites"". Labour will also bring forward a programme of political education within the party ""to increase awareness and understanding of all forms of anti-Semitism,"" he adds. In a statement on Sunday night, the Labour leader said he was ""sincerely sorry"" for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party. On Monday, former PM Tony Blair told BBC's Newsnight that Mr Corbyn and the people around him did not understand the seriousness of the party's problem with anti-Semitism - although he said he did not believe Mr Corbyn personally was anti-Semitic. ""It's got beyond the stage where words will solve this. ""He's going to have to show that he really understands the issue, that the people round him really understand it, and that he's prepared to act on it,"" he added. The Jewish Voice for Labour group led a counter-demonstration By Brian Wheeler, BBC political reporter, in Parliament Square A few of those present in Parliament Square were clearly no fans of the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn, although most I spoke to were Labour supporters who felt real anger about what they saw as Mr Corbyn's ""soft"" stance on anti-Semitism. One man told me the party was in the grip of a ""horrible, pernicious"" form of racism. Tim, from Bermondsey, told me: ""I have been a member of the Labour Party since 1981 but I never thought I would be in the position of standing outside Parliament complaining about the treatment of our Jewish comrades."" The counter-demonstration organised by Jewish Voice for Labour was smaller, but everyone I spoke to was a Labour Party member - and they were all passionate supporters of Mr Corbyn, who felt he was being persecuted unfairly. One man was handing out ""Labour against the witch hunt"" leaflets. Another gave a speech attacking the Jewish Board of Deputies, ending with the battle cry: ""Freedom for Palestine, Corbyn for prime minister!"" Leah Levine, the co-chair of Jewish Voice for Labour, did not deny there was some anti-Semitism in Labour just as, she said, there was in society as a whole - but she argued it was being blown out of proportion by opponents of Mr Corbyn - and that anti-Semitism was a far bigger problem on the right. ""We are not a racist movement,"" she told me. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said in an open letter to Labour MPs there has been a ""repeated institutional failure"" to properly address anti-Semitism. It accuses Mr Corbyn of being unable to ""seriously contemplate anti-Semitism, because he is so ideologically fixed within a far-left world view that is instinctively hostile to mainstream Jewish communities"". The organisations refer to Mr Corbyn's apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012 and his attendance at ""pro-Hezbollah rallies"". They say the Labour leader has ""sided with anti-Semites"" either because of ""the far left's obsessive hatred of Zionism"" or ""a conspiratorial world view in which mainstream Jewish communities are believed to be a hostile entity, a class enemy"". The letter says those who push anti-Semitic material view Mr Corbyn as ""their figurehead"" and that he is ""the only person with the standing to demand that all of this stops"". This video can not be played Jonathan Arkush says Jeremy Corbyn ""needs to take action"" against anti-Semitism The letter was due to be delivered to a meeting of Labour MPs and peers, although the Labour leader is not expected to attend. The protest was held outside the Houses of Parliament, with a number of Labour MPs - including Liz Kendall, Ruth Smeeth, John Woodcock and Ian Austin - joining members of the Jewish community. Labour MP John Mann said anti-Semites needed to be ""driven out"" of the party. ""The very existence of my Labour Party is at stake,"" he said. ""It is time for Jeremy Corbyn to act."" At the same time, a counter-demonstration by pro-Corbyn Jewish Labour members was staged nearby. In a statement, the Jewish Voice for Labour group said it was ""appalled"" by the Board of Deputies' letter. ""They do not represent us or the great majority of Jews in the party who share Jeremy Corbyn's vision for social justice and fairness. ""Jeremy's consistent commitment to anti-racism is all the more needed now."" In 2016 an inquiry into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, led by Shami Chakrabarti, said the party was not overrun by racism but there was ""too much clear evidence... of ignorant attitudes"". It followed the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone amid anti-Semitism claims.

Catalonia seethes after exile's arrestProtests erupt across the Spanish region after Germany detains independence leader Carles Puigdemont.4h4 hours agoEurope,"This video can not be played Catalan protesters clash with police in Barcelona Protests broke out across the Spanish region of Catalonia on Sunday after former leader Carles Puigdemont was taken into custody in Germany. At least 89 people were injured in clashes with police and four arrests were made. Mr Puigdemont, who is wanted in Spain for sedition and rebellion, was detained by German police acting on a European arrest warrant. He appeared before a German judge on Monday and was remanded in custody. Prosecutor Georg-Friedrich Guentge said Mr Puigdemont ""appeared calm and composed"". Mr Puigdemont was detained while crossing from Denmark on his way to Belgium, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since Catalonia's parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain in October. A European warrant for his arrest was reissued on Friday. Catalan crisis in 300 words In central Barcelona, protesters chanted ""Freedom for the political prisoners"" and ""This Europe is shameful!"" as they headed to the offices of the European Commission and the German consulate. Spanish news agency Efe estimated crowds of 55,000 in the centre of the city. People tie yellow ribbons - a symbol of support for jailed Catalan politicians - to a fence outside the German Consulate in Barcelona Smaller demonstrations were held in Girona, where Mr Puigdemont once served as mayor, Tarragona and Lleida. Some protesters also formed road blocks in various locations. Tensions in Catalonia are very high and its separatist leaders abandoned plans to name a new president afterthe arrest on Friday of the latest candidate, Jordi Turull, sparked protests in Barcelona. An image of Spain's King Felipe VI was burnt at a protest in Girona Spain's Supreme Court has ruled 25 that Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. They all deny the allegations. German police said that Mr Puigdemont was detained by a highway patrol in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, which borders Denmark. Mr Puigdemont had been living in Belgium He had been on a trip to Finland to meet lawmakers and attend a conference last week when the arrest warrant against him was reissued, taking him by surprise. He slipped out of Finland before the authorities could arrest him but only got as far as Germany before being intercepted. His spokesman, Joan Maria Pique, said he had been heading to Belgium ""to put himself, as always, at the disposal of Belgian justice"". International warrants for Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders were withdrawn in December by a Spanish judge, who said they had shown a willingness to return to the country. Mr Puigdemont spent Sunday night in a prison in the north German town of NeumÃ¼nster. His court appearance there on Monday was a formality to confirm his identity. The court remanded him in custody pending extradition proceedings. Mr Puigdemont faces charges of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of public funds in Spain as a result of his role in last year's Catalan banned independence referendum. The charges in Spain could result in up to 30 years in prison. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Germany has 60 days to decide whether to return him. In order to do so, its judges need to assess whether the Spanish charges are punishable under German law. Criminal lawyer Martin Heger told Germany's Spiegel website (in German) that the lesser charge of misappropriation of public funds was also a crime under German law,external, and therefore it was clear that the exiled ex-leader would have to be extradited. However, if he is extradited on that charge, he can only be tried on that offence. It is unclear whether the alleged crimes of rebellion and sedition are punishable in Germany. The extradition procedure can last about two months. Mt Puigdemont also has the right to oppose the warrant and apply for asylum in Germany. Spain's latest move is considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight. Various other Catalan politicians have been subjected to new warrants, including Catalonia's former education minister, Clara Ponsati.She is in Scotland, where she has a position at the University of St Andrews, and is preparing tohand herself in. The number of European arrest warrants issued has increased since 2005, according to EU figures.,externalIn 2015, about 16,000 warrants were issued and about 5,000 executed.

Catalonia seethes after exile's arrest,"This video can not be played Catalan protesters clash with police in Barcelona Protests broke out across the Spanish region of Catalonia on Sunday after former leader Carles Puigdemont was taken into custody in Germany. At least 89 people were injured in clashes with police and four arrests were made. Mr Puigdemont, who is wanted in Spain for sedition and rebellion, was detained by German police acting on a European arrest warrant. He appeared before a German judge on Monday and was remanded in custody. Prosecutor Georg-Friedrich Guentge said Mr Puigdemont ""appeared calm and composed"". Mr Puigdemont was detained while crossing from Denmark on his way to Belgium, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since Catalonia's parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain in October. A European warrant for his arrest was reissued on Friday. Catalan crisis in 300 words In central Barcelona, protesters chanted ""Freedom for the political prisoners"" and ""This Europe is shameful!"" as they headed to the offices of the European Commission and the German consulate. Spanish news agency Efe estimated crowds of 55,000 in the centre of the city. People tie yellow ribbons - a symbol of support for jailed Catalan politicians - to a fence outside the German Consulate in Barcelona Smaller demonstrations were held in Girona, where Mr Puigdemont once served as mayor, Tarragona and Lleida. Some protesters also formed road blocks in various locations. Tensions in Catalonia are very high and its separatist leaders abandoned plans to name a new president afterthe arrest on Friday of the latest candidate, Jordi Turull, sparked protests in Barcelona. An image of Spain's King Felipe VI was burnt at a protest in Girona Spain's Supreme Court has ruled 25 that Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. They all deny the allegations. German police said that Mr Puigdemont was detained by a highway patrol in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, which borders Denmark. Mr Puigdemont had been living in Belgium He had been on a trip to Finland to meet lawmakers and attend a conference last week when the arrest warrant against him was reissued, taking him by surprise. He slipped out of Finland before the authorities could arrest him but only got as far as Germany before being intercepted. His spokesman, Joan Maria Pique, said he had been heading to Belgium ""to put himself, as always, at the disposal of Belgian justice"". International warrants for Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders were withdrawn in December by a Spanish judge, who said they had shown a willingness to return to the country. Mr Puigdemont spent Sunday night in a prison in the north German town of NeumÃ¼nster. His court appearance there on Monday was a formality to confirm his identity. The court remanded him in custody pending extradition proceedings. Mr Puigdemont faces charges of sedition, rebellion and misappropriation of public funds in Spain as a result of his role in last year's Catalan banned independence referendum. The charges in Spain could result in up to 30 years in prison. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Germany has 60 days to decide whether to return him. In order to do so, its judges need to assess whether the Spanish charges are punishable under German law. Criminal lawyer Martin Heger told Germany's Spiegel website (in German) that the lesser charge of misappropriation of public funds was also a crime under German law,external, and therefore it was clear that the exiled ex-leader would have to be extradited. However, if he is extradited on that charge, he can only be tried on that offence. It is unclear whether the alleged crimes of rebellion and sedition are punishable in Germany. The extradition procedure can last about two months. Mt Puigdemont also has the right to oppose the warrant and apply for asylum in Germany. Spain's latest move is considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight. Various other Catalan politicians have been subjected to new warrants, including Catalonia's former education minister, Clara Ponsati.She is in Scotland, where she has a position at the University of St Andrews, and is preparing tohand herself in. The number of European arrest warrants issued has increased since 2005, according to EU figures.,externalIn 2015, about 16,000 warrants were issued and about 5,000 executed.

"Vote Leave activist to 'reveal evidence'Brexit activist to present ""recommendations to MPs"" over claims the campaign exceeded spending limits.2m3 minutes agoUK Politics","The Brexit activist who has accused the Vote Leave campaign of exceeding legal spending limits said his claims will be backed up by evidence presented to MPs. Shahmir Sanni alleged that the official Brexit campaign used a different group, BeLeave, to overspend. Both groups deny any wrongdoing and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a prominent Vote Leave campaigner, said the claims were ""utterly ludicrous"". Labour's Tom Watson said that ""if needs be"" the police should investigate. Mr Sanni said his lawyers would be presenting ""recommendations to MPs"" at a news conference in London on Monday. He told the BBC: ""It's quite literally a matter of democracy and it's up to the people of this country to have a look at the evidence themselves and decide for themselves whether the allegations are false or true. ""Lawyers are looking at the evidence and [have] said there is reasonable ground and so they are going to be presenting their recommendations to MPs."" Vote Leave 'broke spending limits' Electoral Commission reopens Vote Leave probe In interviews withChannel 4 News,externaland the Observer, Mr Sanni - a volunteer for Vote Leave - said the official Brexit campaign donated Â£625,000 to a youth-oriented group, BeLeave, but required it to spend the money on a firm Vote Leave used for its digital advertising. Vote Leave would have gone over its campaign spending limit of Â£7m if it had spent the money. The Electoral Commission is already looking into whether Vote Leave spent more than it was entitled to during the campaign. Vote Leave chief Dominic Cummings denied the claim and Brexit Secretary David Davis told the BBC it was the job of the commission, not ministers, to make a judgement. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told the BBC the Electoral Commission needs to get sufficient resources to investigate Mr Sanni told the Observer,externalÂ£625,000 was given to the founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, who - he claims - was not in control of how the money was spent. He said everything they did they passed through Vote Leave manager Stephen Parkinson, Mr Sanni's ex-boyfriend, who is now the prime minister's political secretary. Mr Sanni told the newspaper that most of the donation went to Canadian data firm Aggregate IQ, which has been linked to Cambridge Analytica - the firm facing claims it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent. He said he - along with two other pro-Brexit friends - reported the overspending allegation to the Electoral Commission on Thursday. Vote Leave chief denies Cambridge Analytica links Cummings hits out ""In effect they used BeLeave to overspend, and not just by a small amountâ¦ Almost two thirds of a million pounds makes all the difference and it wasn't legal,"" said Mr Sanni, who first worked as a Vote Leave outreach volunteer before working for BeLeave. ""They say that it wasn't coordinated, but it was. And so the idea thatâ¦ the campaign was legitimate is false."" This video can not be played Vote Leave denies breaching spending rules in the EU referendum Vote Leave has previously said it made the donation to Mr Grimes because it was coming up to its Â£7m spending limit and wanted a way of using the Â£9.2m it had raised from individuals and companies on campaigning activities - and that it had received permission to from the Electoral Commission to do this. The campaign separately spent Â£2.7m on the services of AIQ in the run-up to the EU referendum. BeLeave was set up to give young pro-Brexit campaigners a voice during the referendum. Separate campaign groups could spend up to Â£700,000 if they registered as permitted participants. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Porn star 'threatened over Trump affair'Stormy Daniels says she was told to ""leave Trump alone"" after her claims of an affair, which he denies.10m10 minutes agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: 'I was threatened' An adult film actress has said she was threatened to keep quiet about an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump in 2006. Stormy Daniels told CBS News' 60 Minutes programme that a man approached her in a Las Vegas car park in 2011. The stranger allegedly said ""leave Trump alone"", then looked at her young daughter and added: ""It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom."" Mr Trump denies having had an affair with the actress. His lawyers are seeking $20m (Â£14m) in damages from her, saying she broke a non-disclosure deal signed before the 2016 presidential election. She has filed a lawsuit to scrap the agreement, saying it is invalid because Mr Trump did not sign it. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she had sex with Mr Trump just once, in a hotel room during a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, California, in July 2006. Mr Trump married Melania Trump in 2005. Ms Daniels claims she and Mr Trump stayed in contact for years afterwards, and last spoke in 2010. While Mr Trump flew back to the capital from his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida on Sunday night, Mrs Trump will reportedly stay in Florida for the remainder of spring vacation. In response to questions about the interview, spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Mrs Trump was, ""focused on being a mom and is quite enjoying spring break at Mar-a-Lago while working on future projects.""

The president and the porn star: Why this matters Ex-model apologises for 'Trump affair' In the highly anticipated interview, which aired on Sunday evening,Stormy Daniels said she was approached by the man in the car park,externalin 2011 after having agreed to sell her story to a magazine. But the magazine did not publish the story after legal threats from Donald Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, 60 Minutes reported, citing former employees. The interview was finally published in InTouch magazine earlier this year. ""I was in a parking lot, going to a fitness class with my infant daughter,"" she said. ""A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story'. And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom'. And then he was gone."" President Trump has not directly responded to the interview but tweeted on Monday about ""fake news"". After the programme aired, a lawyer representing Mr Cohen said he had nothing to do with the alleged threat, accused the actress and her lawyer of defaming him and demanded a public apology.

Stormy Daniels told CBS that her only sexual encounter with Mr Trump took place after he invited her to dinner in his hotel suite. She said he had shown her a magazine with his picture on the cover and she had jokingly smacked his bottom with it. ""He turned around and pulled his pants down a little, you know [he] had underwear on and stuff, and I just gave him a couple swats,"" she said. Mr Trump returned to the White House from Florida on Sunday After they talked for a while, Mr Trump allegedly told her, ""You remind me of my daughter"". Stormy Daniels was 27 at the time. ""You know - he was like, 'You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,"" she said. Read the full transcript,external She said that although she had not been attracted to Mr Trump, she had had unprotected sex with him, adding: ""I didn't say no. I'm not a victim."" Mr Trump, she added, had suggested she might appear in his TV game show, The Apprentice, and she thought of the encounter ""as a business deal"". Stormy Daniels' lawyer said on Monday she was prepared to give further evidence of the alleged affair. ""She was prepared to discuss intimate details relating to Mr Trump,"" said lawyer Michael Avenatti on NBC. ""She can describe his genitalia."" ""She can describe various conversations that they had that leave no doubt as to whether this woman is telling the truth."" Stormy Daniels told CBS she later accepted $130,000 in ""hush money"" from Mr Cohen just before the 2016 election because she was concerned for the safety of her family. Mr Cohen confirmed in February he had privately paid her the money but did not say what it was for. Mr Trump's critics have suggested the money might amount to an illicit campaign contribution. Mr Cohen said last month that neither the Trump campaign nor the Trump Organization were parties to the transaction. Stormy Daniels told 60 Minutes she was risking a million-dollar fine by breaking the agreement and speaking out on national television ""because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself"". Given Mr Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct, infidelity andinfamously boasted about grabbing women's genitals, there have been questions asked about why this particular scandal matters, when it involves what Ms Daniels says was consensual sex. But Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, told the BBC his client's case was different to others' because of ""acts of intimidation and the tactics that have been used to silence my client"". 'Mere allegations' wrecking lives - Trump ""I think that is very problematic and it should be very disturbing to not only the American people but anyone in western civilisation,"" he added. ""That is not how people in power should conduct themselves.""  It is also believed that Mr Trump could be called to testify in depositions if Stormy Daniels' court case proceeds. Stormy Daniels is one of three women who have taken legal action that could damage Mr Trump. Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims she had an affair with Mr Trump between 2006 and 2007, has filed a lawsuit to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with tabloid newspaper the National Enquirer. She says she was paid for her story but the newspaper - published by a company run by a friend of President Trump - never ran it. Ms Zervos is suing the president for defamation Summer Zervos,a former contestant on The Apprentice, accuses Mr Trump of sexually assaulting her at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. Ms Zervos says that he groped her and ""began thrusting his genitals"" during a meeting to discuss employment opportunities. While president-elect, Mr Trump dismissed the allegations against him and said that Ms Zervos and other accusers were ""sick"" and driven by fame, money or politics. Ms Zervos filed a defamation law suit against Mr Trump in January 2017, but his lawyers argued that as the president he could not be sued. A judge in New York has now overturned that decision.

'Beast of Wombwell' found deadPolice said Peter Pickering was their main suspect in the unsolved 1965 murder of schoolgirl Elsie Frost.9h9 hours agoSheffield & South Yorkshire,"Peter Pickering (pictured here in 1972) was convicted of killing schoolgirl Shirley Boldy and suspected of murdering Elsie Frost A convicted child killer dubbed the ""Beast of Wombwell"" has died in a psychiatric hospital. Peter Pickering, 80, stabbed and strangled 14-year-old Shirley Boldy in Wombwell, near Barnsley, in 1972 and was suspected of murdering Wakefield schoolgirl Elsie Frost in 1965. On Tuesday he wasconvicted of raping a womanweeks before he killed Shirley and was waiting to be sentenced. He had been detained under a hospital order since admitting killing Shirley. Pickering had been detained under a hospital order since he admitted killing Shirley Boldy West Yorkshire Police said Pickering died on Saturday night after falling ill in a secure psychiatric accommodation in Berkshire and his death was not being treated as suspicious. Det Sup Nick Wallen said: ""We can now formally confirm that Peter Pickering was the man we arrested and interviewed over the last two years as part of the renewed investigation into the murder of 14-year-old schoolgirl Elsie Frost in Wakefield in 1965. ""We strongly suspected that Peter Pickering was responsible for her murder. We had been liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service and it was our expectation that Pickering would be charged in due course. ""His unexpected death clearly means that will no longer happen."" In 1965 a major murder inquiry was launched after Elsie's body was found at the bottom of a flight of steps by a dog walker. In 2015 police launched a fresh appeal to find her killer. Elsie Frost, 14, was found dead by dog walker in Wakefield, in 1965 It came as a result ofthe BBC Radio 4 podcast series Who Killed Elsie Frost?which followed her brother Colin Frost and sister Anne Cleave as theysought justice for the schoolgirl. Mr Frost said hearing about Pickering's death felt ""like a hollow victory"". ""We really needed to see this man in court,"" he said. ""That day's been taken away from us. We've been really close, but it's not going to have the right ending now. ""When the detective rang me this morning, I laughed it off. But as the day's gone onâ¦ I'm almost speechless."" Colin Frost (pictured here in 2015) fought to get documents relating to the original murder investigation, including the inquest file Detectives said the rape Pickering was convicted of this week only came to light while they were investigating the murder of Elsie, who was stabbed in the back and head while walking through a railway tunnel, just off a canal towpath. The woman he raped, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told his trial she did not think she would have been believed if she had reported the attack in the 1970s. She was then persuaded by police to co-operate in 2016. During the rape trial, Leeds Crown Court heard Pickering had lured his victim into his van before driving to a secluded spot in 1972.
