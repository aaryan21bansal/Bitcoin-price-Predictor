Race to be new prime minister begins,"This video can not be played Matt Hancock said he would be ""brutally honest"" on Brexit Conservative leadership contenders have clashed over Brexit as the race to succeed Theresa May in No 10 begins. Rory Stewart said he would not serve under rival Boris Johnson because of his backing for a no-deal exit. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the fifth Tory to enter the race, said Mrs May's successor must be more ""brutally honest"" about the ""trade-offs"" required to get a deal through Parliament. The leadership contest will determine who is the UK's next prime minister. Party bosses expect a new leader to be chosen by the end of July. Mrs May confirmed on Friday thatshe will resign as party leader on 7 June, but will continue as PM while the leadership contest takes place. Who's standing? How the new Tory leader will be chosen She agreed with chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, that the process to choose a new leader should begin the week after she stands down. Five candidates have, so far, confirmed their intention to stand: Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt International Development Secretary Rory Stewart Health Secretary Matt Hancock Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson Former Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey Announcing his candidacy, Mr Hancock ruled out a snap general election in order to resolve the Brexit stalemate, saying this would be ""disastrous for the country"" and would risk seeing the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in power ""by Christmas"". Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Rory Stewart and Esther McVey have already said they will run for the leadership Instead, he said his focus would be on getting a Brexit deal through the current Parliament and ""levelling"" with MPs about what this would mean for the UK. Mr Hancock told Radio 4's Today there was no point in becoming prime minister unless he was straightforward about the trade offs - ""between sovereignty and market access and the trade-offs to get a deal through this Parliament"". He also said the party needed a ""leader for the future not just for now"", capable of appealing to younger voters. What May's exit means for Brexit Kuenssberg: May was overwhelmed ""We need to move on from the horrible politics of the last three years,"" he said. ""We need a fresh start and a fresh face to ensure this country wins the battles of the 2020s and remains prosperous for many years to come."" This video can not be played Rory Stewart said Boris Johnson was going for something undeliverable and damaging Mr Stewart called for politicians to tell the truth about where they stood on Brexit and suggested, for that reason, he could not serve in a cabinet under Boris Johnson. ""It pains me to say it,"" he told BBC News. ""Boris has many, many qualities but I talked to him a few days ago and I thought he had said to me that he was not going for a no-deal exit. ""He has now come out and said yesterday that he is going for something which I believe is undeliverable, unnecessary and is going to damage our country and economy."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Stewart later tweeted that Jiminy Cricket - a fictional character who plays Pinocchio's conscience in the Walt Disney film - would sometimes ""make a better leader than Pinocchio"". Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith criticised Mr Stewart's comments, stressing that MPs needed to ""bring the party together"" and deliver Brexit. He told the BBC that candidates standing for the leadership should accept that if they were successful, they would need to ""reach out to everybody in the party"". If unsuccessful, they should pledge to ""serve whoever gets elected and to serve them to get this Brexit deal done,"" he added. Amber Rudd is not standing but wants to shape the debate on Brexit Mr Johnson told an economic conference in Switzerland on Friday that a new leader would have ""the opportunity to do things differently"". ""We will leave the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal. The way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no deal."" Most bookmakers have Mr Johnson as favourite, in front of former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who are yet to declare. More than a dozen more senior Conservatives are believed to be seriously considering running - including Sir Graham, who has resigned as chair of the 1922 Committee. This video can not be played Theresa May: How the PM fought through Brexit battles Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has ruled herself out, telling the BBC the party and the country wants ""someone who is more enthusiastic about Brexit than I am"". Asked who she would support, she told Radio 4's Today she would ""not malign"" any of the candidates but would prefer someone who ""wants to find a compromise"" on Brexit and be realistic about what can be achieved"". Meanwhile, Conservative MP Steve Double criticised those who were not willing to countenance a no-deal Brexit under a new leader. Allow Twitter content?

Tory MPs have until the week commencing 10 June to put their name forward, and any of them can stand - as long as they have the backing of two parliamentary colleagues. The candidates will be whittled down until two remain, and in July all party members will vote to decide on the winner. The Conservative Party had124,000 members, as of March last year,external. The last leader elected by the membership was David Cameron in 2005, as Theresa May was unopposed in 2016. It will be the first time Conservative members have directly elected a prime minister, as opposed to a leader of the opposition. Announcing her departure in Downing Street on Friday, Mrs May urged her successor to ""seek a way forward that honours the result of the referendum"" and seeks ""consensus"" in Parliament. Meanwhile, shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested Labour might need to harden its position on another Brexit referendum if the Tories elected someone willing to pursue a no-deal exit. Mr McDonnell told Today that ""some form of public vote"" would definitely be needed in that situation and he would seek to talk to MPs from all parties to potentially try and bring down a government that tried to take the UK out without a deal. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: 86% fall into the ABC1 category. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters.

Rail firm removes 'wrong values' Morrissey posters,"""With voice extended to breaking point, I call for the prosperity of free speech,"" said Morrissey on Friday Posters promoting Morrissey's latest album have been removed from railway stations after a commuter complained. Adverts for the new album by the former Smiths singer have been taken down on the Merseyrail network. Morrissey has previously expressed support for the far-right For Britain party and earlier this month wore a badge with its logo on during a TV show, but he denies he is a racist. Merseyrail apologised and said the posters did not reflect its ""values"". The adverts, which contain no political message, were removed after a traveller on a Southport service to Moorfields contacted the company to ask if it agreed with Morrissey's opinions. The man, who asked not to be named, told the BBC he was not ""offended"" by the posters and did not demand they were taken down. He said he just questioned the company on whether they were appropriate. In a statement, Merseyrail said: ""Any content used within advertising on the Merseyrail network does not reflect the organisation's values and we apologise for any offence the publication of these posters may have caused."" The company said advertising was managed by an external third party. Morrisey has not responded to the rail company's decision. But in amessage on his website,externalon Friday, he said: ""With voice extended to breaking point, I call for the prosperity of free speech; the eradication of totalitarian control; I call for diversity of opinion; I call for the total abolition of the abattoir; I call for peace, above all; I call for civil society."" Morrissey expressed his support for For Britain in a 2018 interview Earlier this week, the world's oldest record shop, Spillers Records in Cardiff, took the decision to stop selling Morrissey albums. It said on Twitter,external: ""Morrissey's views are not in synch with ours, in fact they are at complete odds and this is why (as an independent) we are not stocking / giving our shelf space to his music."" Morrissey, 60, has denied on multiple occasions he holds racist views. Earlier this month, the Manchester-born singer appeared on The Tonight Show in the USA wearing a For Britain badge on his jacket. He came out in support of the partyin an interview,externalin 2018 and in the past has criticised the production of halal meat and claimed London mayor Sadiq Khan ""cannot speak properly"".

Museum sorry for racist 'no watermelons' remark,"The Museum of Fine Arts has apologised for the ""challenging and unacceptable experiences"" The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has apologised after a teacher alleged her group of pupils suffered racist language and treatment during a visit. Marvelyne Lamy said staff had followed the black and other minority 12 and 13-year-olds, yelling at them not to touch exhibits while ignoring white groups. She claimed staff told the group: ""No food, no drink, and no watermelon."" The term dates back to the US civil war and is considered derogatory when used in relation to the black community. In a statement, a museum spokesperson said the employee in question said they told the students, ""No food, no drink and no water bottles"" were allowed inside the galleries. The museum said there was no way to ""definitively confirm or deny what was said"", but added it would provide additional training for all frontline staff on engaging with school groups. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh called the alleged remarks""incredibly disturbing"".,external Should black Americans get slavery reparations? Should the term 'racist' be redefined? One thing Americans find hard to talk about Ms Lamy, an English teacher at the Davis Leadership Academy in Boston, complained about the ""racial profiling"" of her class of black and minority pupils in a Facebook post.It has been shared more than 1,000 times,external. ""We were instructed not to touch any of the artefacts in the museum, yet the white students there touched the displays several times while security looked on without saying anything,"" she said. ""The minute one of our students followed suit, the security guards would yell at them that they should not touch exhibits."" Her students became agitated because of this treatment and she gathered them to leave as a result, she said. Visitors at the museum also made racist and derogatory remarks about the pupils, Ms Lamy said. ""The worse part about all of this is seeing the hurt look on my children's faces as this was their first time experiencing racism first hand,"" she said. In an open letter,the museum apologised,externaland said Ms Lamy and her pupils had ""encountered a range of challenging and unacceptable experiences that made them feel unwelcome"". The museum also said it had found thatvisitors made racist comments to the students,externalon two occasions. It said that it had ""identified the patrons who made the disparaging remarks and revoked their membership."" They are now banned from the museum's grounds. The museum will also train staff in how they engage with visitors inside and outside the museum, and review how guards are instructed to patrol the galleries, following claims from the school group that they felt followed. When slavery was abolished at the end of the 1860s some black people grew and sold watermelon to provide for their families. The fruit went on to be used as an excuse to characterise an entire section of the population as being lazy and content with simple pleasures and, therefore, flaunting their independence. Minstrel shows, caricatures, songs and cartoons were used to dehumanise and denigrate the black community. In 2014The Boston Herald was forced to apologise,externalfor a cartoon after an intruder broke into the White House during Barack Obama's presidency. The cartoon showed a man sitting in the bathtub referring to ""watermelon flavoured toothpaste"". In another separate incident in 2014an American football coach in South Carolina was first fired and then reinstated,externalfor allowing players to smash a watermelon while making ape-like noises in a post game celebration.

PM's exit 'may be dangerous' for Ireland,"Mrs May became emotional as she announced her intention to quit Theresa May's resignation puts Brexit in a new phase that may be ""very dangerous for Ireland"", Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar said the PM's departure could lead to the election of a ""Eurosceptic"" prime minister. Mrs May saidshe would quit as Conservative leader on 7 June, paving the way for a leadership contest. The taoiseach said her successor may scrap the Brexit withdrawal agreement. What does PM's resignation mean for NI? LIVE reaction as May signals her departure Brush with May signposted Brexit maze ""We may see the election of a Eurosceptic prime minister who wants to repudiate the withdrawal agreement and go for no-deal, or we may even see a new British government that wants a closer relationship with the EU and goes for a second referendum,"" said Mr Varadkar. But the taoiseach said that whatever happens, the Irish government will ""hold its nerve"". ""We are going to build and strengthen our alliances across the European Union and we will make sure that we see Ireland through this,"" he added. Mr Varadkar said Mrs May was ""principled, honourable, and deeply passionate about doing her best for her country"". ""Politicians throughout the EU have admired her tenacity, her courage, and her determination during what has been a difficult and challenging time,"" he said. Leo Varadkar's deputy Simon Coveney (right), warned the UK would not get a better Brexit deal than that negotiated with Theresa May However, TanÃ¡iste (Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney warned the European Union would not offer Mrs May's successor a better Brexit deal. ""This idea that a new prime minister will be a tougher negotiator and will put it up to the EU and get a much better deal for Britain? That's not how the EU works,"" Mr Coveney told Ireland's Newstalk radio station. He said a further Article 50 extension, delaying Brexit, was ""possible and may be likely"". Political leaders from across the island have been giving their reaction to Mrs May's resignation announcement. Here are some of them: Karen Bradley said she was ""deeply saddened to see the prime minister step down from the job she loved"". She said Mrs May was an ""extremely courageous and dedicated public servant"" who ""always does what she believes is in the best interest"" of the whole of the UK. Mrs Bradley added that Mrs May ""worked tirelessly to deliver Brexit that works for all parts of the UK"" and ""passionately believed in working with all parties and parts of the community in NI ""to restore devolution and build a stronger, shared society for all"". DUP leader Arlene Foster,whose 10 MPs prop up the Conservative government in Westminster, paid tribute to Mrs May's ""selfless service in the interests of the United Kingdom"". She also thanked the prime minister for ""her willingness to recognise Northern Ireland's need for additional resources through confidence-and-supply arrangements"". She told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme Theresa May had discovered that ""when you try to bounce the DUP it simply doesn't work"". Mrs Foster said Mrs May had fundamentally misjudged the DUP's position on Brexit throughout the negotiations. The DUP leader said she hopes the next Conservative leader has ""an understanding of what makes the DUP tick"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said the ""chaos at Westminster"" cannot be allowed to distract from ""the very real threat that Brexit poses to Ireland"". She also said the talks process should not be pushed off course. Ms McDonald accused Mrs May of having prioritised a deal with the DUP at Westminster over re-establishing the power-sharing institutions. ""An agreement can be reached and a deal can be done. But the process must not be derailed nor responsibility abdicated in respect of people's rights and agreements."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the prime minister's resignation showed that Brexit was ""fundamentally undeliverable"". ""A new prime minister should recognise the mistakes made by Theresa May, revoke Article 50 and put an end to this political, diplomatic and economic car crash,"" he said. Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said that while Mrs May had been a dignified prime minister, she had ""left the UK in a worse place than when she took up the role"". ""While she attempted several times to get her withdrawal agreement through Parliament, she had her hands tied through mutually contradictory red lines over Brexit,"" he said. He said Mrs May had also squandered a chance to build a consensus around a softer version of Brexit with a special deal for Northern Ireland. ""No matter who now replaces her, the same problems will still persist . They will face stark choices regarding Brexit and its consequences, and they need to approach them with honesty and realism."" Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said Mrs May's successor ""should have an absolute commitment to the maintenance of the union and the prosperity of all its people"". Mr Swann said ""the bind"" in which the prime minister's government found itself ""was of its own making"". ""A change of Conservative Party leader will not necessarily solve the problem unless there is a change in approach. ""The backstop is the problem that needs dealt with and it ultimately broke Theresa May's premiership,"" he added.

Did Theresa May solve her 'burning injustices'?Kuenssberg: May was just overwhelmedEU asks what next for Brexit after May goesPM's exit has consequences for Brexit,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to ""build a better Britain"" When Theresa May became prime minister in July 2016 she promised to build a better Britain and lead a government that worked for everyone rather than being ""driven by the interests of the privileged few"". As part of that, she identified seven ""burning injustices"". Since the speech, she and the government have been pre-occupied with Brexit - something Mrs May has called ""the biggest peacetime challenge any government has faced"". Three years on, the Reality Check team assesses how she has fared in tackling the domestic policy goals she set out in Downing Street. In recent years, the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived people in England has worsened - by three months for men and seven months for women. At the time of Mrs May's speech,the most recent figures on life expectancy inequality,externalwere for 2012-14, and showed a 9.1 and 6.9 year gap for men and women respectively. This had grown to 9.3 years and 7.5 years respectively by 2015-17. Has life expectancy fallen in Britain? We're looking at England because some key decisions for the rest of the UK, for example around education and health, are devolved to the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments and are not in Mrs May's power. Theresa May gave her ""burning injustices"" speech straight after being asked to form a government by the Queen Establishing how far Theresa May has acted to address this ""burning injustice"" is tricky, since life expectancy isn't determined by a single factor. But there are a few things we know influence how long people are expected to live: lifestyle factors, like smoking and drinking alcohol, and social factors like income, access to good healthcare services and education. During her premiership, the prime ministerpledged an extra Â£20bn to the NHS in Englandspread over five years. Globally (with thenotable exception of the United States), higher health spending is linked to longer life expectancies. NHS long-term plan: Are there enough staff to make it happen? NHS plan: What it means for you The benefit of this money hasn't been felt yet, but we could mark this down as an action taken to address this particular injustice in the future. On the other hand,spending on public health,external- including things like smoking cessation and substance misuse services - has fallen since 2016. Social care didn't get any extra money alongside the NHS's ""70th birthday present"", and education spending is flat-lining. Benefits cuts pledged before Mrs May became prime minister have continued to be rolled out and food-bank use and homelessness have continued to rise since the summer of 2016. Since deprivation is the driver of this inequality in life expectancy, all of these things could play a role longer-term. Mrs May has taken steps to make this inequality more transparent, but there has been less in the way of action to directly alter it. Sheordered a Race Disparity Audit,externalwith the explicit motivation of ""tackling burning injustices"". This was designed to show how people of different ethnic backgrounds are treated by a range of public bodies, including the criminal justice system. It highlighted the fact that, for example, black defendants were more likely than white defendants to be remanded in custody rather than let out on bail while waiting for their cases to go to trial. These disparities are largely unchanged, and in some cases have worsened. It's hard to say from this alone that black people are being treated more harshly by the criminal justice system as it doesn't tell us anything about disparities in offending behaviour. But we can also look at the sentences being handed out for the same offences. Black people were given longer sentences, on average, than white people for the same category of offence in most cases, excluding fraud and criminal damage. And average custodial sentences for black people have increased over the past couple of years, while for white people they have remained the same. In June 2016,42% of under-18s in custody were from a black,externalor minority ethnic background, with 22.8% describing themselves as black. By March 2019, the proportion of young people in custody from a minority ethnic, or specifically from a black background, had risen to 49% and 27.8% respectively. Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said while the statistics were helpful, ""highlighting the gaps doesn't address the gaps"". Areview into the higher education system,externaland its funding is imminent, which could have implications for poorer students. There's been an upward trend in university participation for many years, and this has continued under Theresa May's supervision. The number of people going to university for the first time from the neighbourhoods with the lowest higher education participation has increased by 3% since 2016 -  a faster rate than the average for all neighbourhoods. But this is part of a much longer-term trend - it's difficult to point to any of Mrs May's policies that would have particularly driven this. The key data in this area comes fromthe Sutton Trust,external, which focuses on social mobility. It looked in 2016 at the proportion of people from private schools holding top jobs in a selection of professions. There is little sign of improvement in this area, although the one area over which Theresa May has direct control - the cabinet - currently has 41% of members who attended independent schools, down from 50% in 2016. The Social Mobility Commission, which reports to the government on this issue, releasedits annual report,externalin April saying that social mobility had been virtually stagnant for the past four years. It also found that people from professional backgrounds are 80% more likely to get into a professional job than their less privileged peers. Social mobility: The worst places to grow up poor State of the Nation report: Inequality 'entrenched from birth' ""At a time when our country needs to be highly productive and able to carve out a new role in a shifting political and economic landscape, we must find a way to maximise the talent of all our citizens, especially those that start the furthest behind,"" said commission chairwoman Dame Martina Milburn. But there was some optimism from Russell Hobby, chief executive of Teach First: ""Over recent years, we've definitely seen a welcome vigour across the education sector and government when it comes to solving the puzzle of inequality,"" he said. ""At the government level, this includes a welcome commitment to the pupil premium, new efforts to recruit teachers in poorer areas, and much needed emphasis on careers education in schools."" During her time in office, Mrs May extended the dutyto report gender pay gaps,externalto more companies. A duty on larger companies to report their pay gaps had already been promised before she took office. Gender pay gap: What is the pay gap at your company? The gender pay gap has continued to narrow since she became prime minister, although this forms part of a longer-term trend. Women on average still earn 18% less than men. Of the Â£20bn Mrs May pledged to the NHS, Â£2bn is earmarked to be spent on mental health. Despite the investment, there are clear signs services are struggling to cope. The number of out-of-area placements for people needing hospital treatment have risen by a third. Children's community services are particularly strained. Just 16% of children referred for help last year were seen in six weeks - the rest had to wait longer or were turned away. The children's commissioner Anne Longfield has said she is worried about the state of these services. Mental health spending varies widely across England Is young people's mental health getting worse? But the NHS's talking therapy programme has continued to grow, with more than a million new starts on a course of therapy in the year ending March 2018, compared with 953,522 in 2015-16. This is largely a culmination of many years of investment in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme, launched in 2006. Mrs May did take other steps to show her dedication to mental health care. She appointed the first minister for suicide prevention, launched an annual review of children's mental health in England and ordered an independent review of the Mental Health Act after concerns over the use of force and detention. During her tenure, Mrs May introduced a new stamp duty relief for first-time buyers and an additional Â£10bn for the Help to Buy loan scheme, both aimed at helping people on to the property ladder. Home ownership among 25-34 year-olds has fallen steadily over the past two decades as property prices have soared, according to research by think tank the Resolution Foundation - but there's been a small uptick in home ownership among young people since 2016. The think tank put this in large part down to banks being more willing to offer larger mortgages as post-financial crisis conditions have eased, as well as a slowing in the growth of house prices. But it did also point to stamp duty relief as a factor.

EU asks what next for Brexit after May goesPM's exit has consequences for Brexit,"Mr Juncker said he would ""equally respect and establish working relations with any new Prime Minister."" The EU response to Theresa May's resignation speech was immediate. From across Europe came expressions of respect - though notably, not regret. The Brexit process is a painful one for the EU - a constant reminder that the bloc is failing to keep a key member state, a constant shadow over other EU business and an economic drain - provoked by all the uncertainty - on European companies and outside investment. As UK prime minister, Theresa May became associated with all that negativity. It was a source of continuous frustration in Brussels that she - in EU leaders' opinion - repeatedly pandered to the extreme Brexiteers in her party, rather than face the inevitability of compromise and the necessity of cross-party co-operation (which Brussels believes finally came too late) to get an exit deal agreed. European politicians and diplomats have always said to me: ""What we (the EU) need, is a British prime minister strong enough to be able to do a deal in Brussels and to sell it back home in Westminster, whoever they may be."" Theresa May never was that prime minister. European parliament elections: The Brexit effect Here's what's just happened in UK politics Today the president of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, described her as ""a woman of courage for whom he has great respect"" but he also made clear, as did other European leaders, that finishing the Brexit process was the EU's primary concern. Mr Juncker declared he would ""equally respect and establish working relations with any new prime minister whoever they may be"". Adding those last four words ""whoever they may be"", alludes to the EU fear that Boris Johnson or another arch Brexiteer is most likely to become Mrs May's successor. The EU has prepared for the prospect of ""Prime Minister Boris"" for months now. Theresa May's demise doesn't exactly come as a surprise. As was the case when Donald Trump became US president, many Europeans have wondered whether ""populist Boris, the arch Brexiteer"" might be tamed by office into becoming calmer and (from the European perspective) more reasonable. The worry here is that Mr Johnson, or another Brexiteer, keen to prove their mettle, will want to play to the gallery at home: obstructing EU business where they can, as long as the UK remains a reluctant member. The EU has already taken legal advice on how to get around that potential problem. They have concluded, for example, that if the new UK prime minister held up the next EU budget, which needs to be decided in the coming months, the 27 EU leaders minus the UK could informally sign the budget off. Their decision would then become legally binding once the UK officially left the EU. All the speculation about post-May Britain has also got EU leaders thinking about whether to grant the UK a new Brexit extension. The current one runs out on 31 October. The EU assumption is that the new UK prime minister will want more time to hold a general election or to try to renegotiate the current Brexit deal, particularly the controversial backstop guarantee for the Irish border. Good luck with that one, says Brussels, though Dublin will worry that the resolve of some EU leaders may falter if faced with the real prospect (this time) of a no-deal Brexit. With all this in mind, a number of EU countries, notably France, think it probably best to close the door sooner rather than later, to a country that is leaving anyway. President Macron worries that the longer the UK stays reluctantly, the more it might poison the general EU atmosphere. Germany, however, would prefer to give the UK more time, if not to change its mind about Brexit, then at least to ensure an ""orderly exit"" - ie Brexit with a deal - to avoid the economic and political fallout of no deal at all. But 31 October is still a long way away in political terms. Right now, EU leaders are far more preoccupied with this week's elections for the European parliament. The result promises to have a profound impact on the national governments of a fair few countries, including the EU's Big Two, Germany and France. Spain's general election: What just happened?

PM's exit has consequences for Brexit,"The resignation of Theresa May has clear consequences for the Conservative Party - the starting gun on a leadership contest has been fired. But what does it mean for Brexit? The short answer is that both No Deal and No Brexit are now both more likely. Theresa May quits: UK set for new PM Tories to choose new leader by end of July What Theresa May said in her resignation speech With Mrs May's ""bold new Brexit plan"" in tatters, there is no vehicle for leaving the EU with a deal, and the default is that the UK's membership will expire on Halloween. If that is where things appear to be heading in the autumn, some MPs who previously opposed a second referendum might reconsider if it is the best option for avoiding no deal - putting Brexit at risk. After all, Jeremy Corbyn - who has been reluctant to weaponise Labour's ""option"" of a public vote - has said the Labour leadership would back a referendum to avoid either ""a bad Tory deal"" or ""no deal at all"". But Mrs May called ""on all sides of the debate"" to find a compromise. The question is whether, in the short term, the language of compromise is seen as an asset or liability by the Conservative leadership contenders. MPswill be able to choose from a wide range of options- from Rory Stewart and Matt Hancock, who have been emphasising the need to leave with a deal, through to Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom, who certainly don't fear no deal. But polling evidence suggests many of the Conservative grassroots members don't just want Brexit to happen quickly, but they positively favour leaving without a Withdrawal Agreement. Once MPs have whittled down the contenders to the final two in June, winning over the party faithful will require the remaining candidates to talk tough. This will mean, at the very least, that ""no deal"" is back on the table. If - for example - the eventual contest was between a former Remainer and a Brexiteer - say Jeremy Hunt or Sajid Javid versus Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab - then to attack their opponent on a wide range of issues, including fitness for high office, the former Remainer would have to dismantle any barrier to their support amongst the wider membership by stressing their willingness to leave with no deal. The One Nation Group of Conservatives, who are largely former Remainers such as Nicky Morgan and Amber Rudd, haven't ruled out backing Boris Johnson - so long as he pivots to the position of at least arguing for a deal with the EU. So, let's just assume for a moment that this is the position any successor to Mrs May adopts. The only version of the exiting PM's deal which passed the Commons was at the end of January This was the so-called Brady amendment (after the chairman of the Conservatives' 1922 committee Sir Graham Brady), which called for a deal and support for the Withdrawal Agreement, but minus the contentious Northern Irish backstop. This backstop is despised by many Brexiteers as it would keep the UK close to EU regulations in the absence of a trade deal. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Following that vote, Mrs May said: ""There is a limited appetite for change in the EU, and negotiating it won't be easy."" She was right on both counts. While there were additional reassurances from Brussels around the backstop, there was no major rewrite, never mind replacing it with unspecified ""alternative arrangements"". Now, Mr Johnson believes that more robust negotiation is required and this could unlock a deal. Mr Javid believes technical solutions to the problem of Irish border checks already exist - but that the EU would have to recognise this. The trouble is, so far, the prospect of a change of leader hasn't led to a change of mind in Brussels. And the Irish Deputy Prime Minister, Simon Coveney, is already warning that the European Union would not offer the next prime minister a better Brexit deal. He told an Irish radio station: ""This idea that a new prime minister will be a tougher negotiator and will put it up to the EU and get a much better deal for Britain? That's not how the EU works."" What he said the EU would contemplate is a longer extension of Article 50, and a further delay to Brexit. A new Conservative leader committed to a deal may well have to ask for this. They would begin their tenancy in No 10 at the height of the European holiday season, and time will be short for any renegotiation. However, unless the EU is willing to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with Mrs May, there may be little point in long, drawn out discussions. Mr Johnson confirmed he wouldn't ask for an extension in any case, declaring that the UK would leave on 31 October with or without a deal. It's possible some of the legislative legwork for a future deal will be done during the dying days of Mrs May's premiership. For example, uncontentious aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, such as citizen's rights, could be incorporated into UK law. But the contentious issues would remain. Assuming a substantially different deal isn't on offer by October, and the Conservatives are led by a Brexiteer who will come out of the EU no matter what, we could be faced with the following scenarios: Control of Parliament's legislation is seized once again by MPs opposed to No Deal The new prime minister receives a bounce in the polls, and calls an election to break the deadlock and get backing for their approach There is an election because enough MPs vote ""no confidence"" in the government as a way to stop No Deal Enough MPs decide to drop their opposition to another referendum - though the means for putting this on the statute books is not entirely clear The EU really does blink at the last minute and offer a free trade deal minus the backstop Mrs May warned of 'division and uncertainty' if MPs didn't pass her deal. In that respect, at least, she was right.

Three more die on Everest amid overcrowding,"The summit of Everest stands at 8,848m (29,029ft) Three more climbers have died on Mount Everest, taking the death toll to seven in a week - more than the total for the whole of last year. The three died of exhaustion while descending on Thursday. It comes amid traffic jams near the summit as record numbers make the ascent, despite calls to limit the number of climbing permits. Nepal has issued 381 permits at $11,000 (Â£8,600) each for the spring climbing season at the world's highest peak. Two Indian climbers - Kalpana Das, 52, and Nihal Bagwan, 27 - died while scaling back down the mountain on Thursday. Why Everest's summit gets so crowded How deadly is Mount Everest? Sherpa climbs Everest twice in a week, setting record 24 ascents Local tour organiser Keshav Paudel told AFP news agency that Bagwan had been ""stuck in the traffic for more than 12 hours and was exhausted"". A 65-year-old Austrian climber died on the northern Tibet side of the mountain. An Indian and an American lost their lives on the mountain on Wednesday, while an Irish professor, SÃ©amus Lawless, is presumed dead after falling on 16 May. Conditions this year have also been worse than usual, with high winds leaving a large number of climbers a narrow time frame to reach the summit. Five people are known to have died on Everest and one in Lhotse in the spring season last year. The number of people climbing Everest in 2019 could exceed last year's record of 807 people reaching the summit. The rising numbers of people climbing - and dying - on Everest has led for calls for permits to be limited. Ben Fogle, the adventurer and television presenter who climbed the mountain last year, called for ""London Marathon style lottery for climbing permits"" in a Twitter post. Nirmal Purja has climbed six of the world's highest summits in just over four weeks Mountaineer Nirmal Purja's photo of queues at Mount Everest has attracted attention around the world this week. The photo shows the last ridge Mount Everest's summit, from the southern, Nepali side. Climbers can also reach the summit via the northern, Tibetan side, but the southern route is much busier. If you look carefully, you'll see there are two rows of climbers. Because there is only one fixed rope at the summit, climbers ascending and descending the summit all have to share the same rope. The vast majority of Everest climbers use oxygen masks and cylinders at the summit - oxygen levels there are only about 30% what they are at sea level.

What does PM's departure mean for NI?,"Theresa May's announcement that she will quit as Conservative leader on 7 June paves the way for a contest to decide a new prime minister. She had been facing intense pressure to quit after MPs across Parliament said they would not back her Brexit deal. Opposition to it focused on the Irish border backstop. Mrs May had also recently supported fresh power-sharing talks in Northern Ireland. So what will her departure from Downing Street mean for Northern Ireland? This video can not be played The prime minister said the failure to deliver Brexit was a matter of ""deep regret"" Most of Theresa May's time in office centred on negotiating the UK's exit from the EU. The biggest difficulty she faced in navigating that was resolving the Irish border issue - not reaching an agreement with the EU until November 2018. Her government signed up to the backstop, the insurance policy to maintain an open Irish border unless and until another solution could be found. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop It immediately faced a backlash from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs, and in the months that followed she tried to build up support for her deal by promising changes to the backstop and vowing it would never come into effect. Her critics said she had allowed the EU to act with ""intransigence"" when it came to Northern Ireland, and said because she had voted remain in the EU referendum, she was never really committed to delivering Brexit. Ardent Brexiteers in the Conservative Party will be hoping they can now negotiate a different deal - but that idea has already been swiftly dismissed. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney moved quickly on Friday to point out that he didn't see the EU offering ""any new prime minister a better or very different deal to what was on offer to Theresa May"". Whoever moves into Number 10 next could find themselves facing the same Brexit dead end as Mrs May did. That means more questions about the possibility of another extension to the current 31 October deadline; does a no-deal Brexit appear firmly on the table again, and will a Brexit deal ever get through Parliament? After Theresa May failed to get a majority in the snap general election in June 2017, she needed allies in order to form a government. The DUP had just managed their best ever Westminster result, returning 10 MPs. The DUP has always said its agreement is with the Conservative government - not the prime minister After two weeks of negotiations with the Conservatives,the DUP signed up to a confidence-and-supply arrangement, in exchange for an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland. That deal is due to expire next month, just after Mrs May hands over the reigns to her successor. LIVE: Latest updates and reaction The Theresa May story Theresa May: Premiership in six charts The arrangement has been tested at times over the past year, with the DUP abstaining and even voting against the government in the Commons on occasions to express its displeasure over Brexit - a warning shot to the government about the power the DUP could, at times, wield in Parliament - but it always insisted the deal was still in place. What happens now? It's not certain yet, but the DUP and the Conservatives will likely re-negotiate the deal in the short-term, in order to give the new prime minister some sort of safety net when he or she takes office. The DUP has always said it doesn't mind who leads the Tories, but will no doubt hope to see someone at the helm who shares similar views on the Brexit process. That being said, the party will be wary of political promises from any new prime minister, given it accused Mrs May of breaking so many she made to the DUP during her time as prime minister. Mrs May is resigning just a few weeks aftera new talks process aimed at restoring power-sharing in Northern Ireland began. Several rounds of talks since January 2017 have failed to break the Stormont deadlock The talks were announced after the murder of journalist Lyra McKee by the New IRA in Londonderry - the prime minister was among political leaders who attended the funeral. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January 2017, after a bitter row between the two biggest parties. Talks have been relatively low-key so far because of the European election campaign, but Mrs May and the Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar had said they would review progress next week. There had already been little optimism that the new process would lead to a breakthrough, primarily because the issues that divide the political parties have not changed. Theresa May's government had also faced accusations of being too hands-off in approaching the Stormont process, because of the link between the DUP and the Conservatives. Other Stormont parties had repeatedly called for an independent mediator to chair the talks, although the government refused to do so. Whoever takes over as PM will now have the issue of power-sharing in their in-tray. But will they bring a fresh pair of eyes to a stale process, or could restoring devolution fall further down the agenda? Secretary of State Karen Bradley has come under repeated criticism for appearing reluctant to take decisions about Northern Ireland When a prime minister leaves office, so too does the entirety of their cabinet and the new office-holder picks their own team - which means we are likely to shortly see a new Northern Ireland secretary. Karen Bradley is known for being a friend of Theresa May, and a loyalist to the prime minister, one of few cabinet ministers who steadfastly supported the Brexit withdrawal deal. She was moved to the Northern Ireland Office in January 2018, when James Brokenshire resigned for health reasons. But throughout her time in the role, she has come under repeated criticism for appearing reluctant to take decisions for Northern Ireland in the absence of an executive. She is currently facing pressure for refusing to take legislation through Westminster to compensate victims of Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA), and has made several comments demonstrating a lack of understanding about Northern Ireland, which have lead to calls for her to resign. The political parties might welcome a new Northern Ireland secretary, but the arms-length stance recent holders of the role have taken towards Stormont may not give the parties much to be optimistic about.

Ten arrested over Whorlton Hall 'abuse',"Whorlton Hall, near Castle Barnard, looked after 17 adults with learning difficulties and autism Ten workers have been arrested over the alleged abuse of patients with learning difficulties at a specialist hospital. Seven men and three women were arrested at addresses in Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland, Darlington and Stockton. Undercover filming by BBC Panorama at Whorlton Hall in County Durham appeared to show patients being mocked, intimidated and restrained. The site had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before the abuse was discovered. Those arrested were being questioned about offences relating to abuse and neglect at the privately-run NHS-funded unit, Durham Police said. A spokesman said investigations were expected to take some time but repeated the force's ""immediate priority has been to work with other agencies to safeguard the victims at the centre of the allegations and their families"". Those arrested would be released under investigation pending further inquiries, he added. The force said it was seeking the co-operation of the Panorama team to gather further evidence. Cygnet, the firm that runs the 17-bed hospital unit for adults with learning difficulties and autism, said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the allegations. The company only took over the running of the centre at the turn of the year and said it was ""co-operating fully"" with the police investigation. All the patients have been transferred to other services and the hospital closed down, Cygnet said. Care minister Caroline Dinenage told the House of Commons this week she was ""deeply sorry that this has happened"".

"Met want 1,130 climate protesters charged","Protesters occupied Oxford Circus as part of Extinction Rebellion demonstrations The Met will push for the prosecution of more than 1,100 people arrested over last month's Extinction Rebellion protests, a senior officer has said. So far more than 70 activists have been charged in connection with the demonstrations that brought parts of central London to a standstill. Ten days of protests in April saw 1,130 people arrested for various offences. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said the Met wanted to deter other groups employing similar tactics. The group's tactics included asking volunteers to deliberately get arrested to cause maximum disruption at roadblocks on Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. Other protesters glued themselves to trains and buildings. How do police control demonstrations? Climate activists block stock exchange Mr Taylor said 70 people had so far been charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). ""It is our anticipation that we are putting all of those to the CPS for decisions,"" he said. Mr Taylor insisted the Met was equipped to deal with any upcoming actions and said officers from other forces would be called into action if needed. This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion protesters reach Parliament Square He said the force was in discussions with the Home Office to review the current Public Order legislation with fears Extinction Rebellion's tactics could be adopted by other groups. Mr Taylor added: ""I'm not saying going to jail, but we would like to see consequences for any activity at these events that is unlawful. ""Protest is not illegal. There is nothing unlawful about protest."" In 2011, courts in London and Manchester had to open over the weekendto deal with more than 1,000 people charged with riot-related offences.

US museum sorry for racist 'no watermelons' remark,"The Museum of Fine Arts has apologised for the ""challenging and unacceptable experiences"" The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has apologised after a teacher alleged her group of pupils suffered racist language and treatment during a visit. Marvelyne Lamy said staff had followed the black and other minority 12 and 13-year-olds, yelling at them not to touch exhibits while ignoring white groups. She claimed staff told the group: ""No food, no drink, and no watermelon."" The term dates back to the US civil war and is considered derogatory when used in relation to the black community. In a statement, a museum spokesperson said the employee in question said they told the students, ""No food, no drink and no water bottles"" were allowed inside the galleries. The museum said there was no way to ""definitively confirm or deny what was said"", but added it would provide additional training for all frontline staff on engaging with school groups. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh called the alleged remarks""incredibly disturbing"".,external Should black Americans get slavery reparations? Should the term 'racist' be redefined? One thing Americans find hard to talk about Ms Lamy, an English teacher at the Davis Leadership Academy in Boston, complained about the ""racial profiling"" of her class of black and minority pupils in a Facebook post.It has been shared more than 1,000 times,external. ""We were instructed not to touch any of the artefacts in the museum, yet the white students there touched the displays several times while security looked on without saying anything,"" she said. ""The minute one of our students followed suit, the security guards would yell at them that they should not touch exhibits."" Her students became agitated because of this treatment and she gathered them to leave as a result, she said. Visitors at the museum also made racist and derogatory remarks about the pupils, Ms Lamy said. ""The worse part about all of this is seeing the hurt look on my children's faces as this was their first time experiencing racism first hand,"" she said. In an open letter,the museum apologised,externaland said Ms Lamy and her pupils had ""encountered a range of challenging and unacceptable experiences that made them feel unwelcome"". The museum also said it had found thatvisitors made racist comments to the students,externalon two occasions. It said that it had ""identified the patrons who made the disparaging remarks and revoked their membership."" They are now banned from the museum's grounds. The museum will also train staff in how they engage with visitors inside and outside the museum, and review how guards are instructed to patrol the galleries, following claims from the school group that they felt followed. When slavery was abolished at the end of the 1860s some black people grew and sold watermelon to provide for their families. The fruit went on to be used as an excuse to characterise an entire section of the population as being lazy and content with simple pleasures and, therefore, flaunting their independence. Minstrel shows, caricatures, songs and cartoons were used to dehumanise and denigrate the black community. In 2014The Boston Herald was forced to apologise,externalfor a cartoon after an intruder broke into the White House during Barack Obama's presidency. The cartoon showed a man sitting in the bathtub referring to ""watermelon flavoured toothpaste"". In another separate incident in 2014an American football coach in South Carolina was first fired and then reinstated,externalfor allowing players to smash a watermelon while making ape-like noises in a post game celebration.

Victims suing clubs over paedophile coach,"Bob Higgins was convicted of dozens of counts of indecent assault Former trainee footballers abused by paedophile Bob Higgins are to seek compensation from the clubs concerned. The football coach was found guilty of indecently assaulting 24 boys, most of whom were youth players at Southampton and Peterborough United. A solicitor representing some of the 66-year-old's victims said the clubs had a duty of care and should ""accept responsibility"". Peterborough United said it dealt with all allegations ""appropriately"". Southampton declined to comment on the compensation bid but said it had worked closely with police to uncover the truth. Young players would train in the gym at The Dell in Southampton Higgins was convicted at his retrial on Thursday of 45 counts of indecent assault between 1971 and 1996.

Infected blood victim 'wanted to die',"The inquiry is looking at why 4,800 people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV A woman has given a harrowing account of her devastation at telling her sons their father was going to die. Sharon Lowry was giving evidence at the Infected Blood Inquiry into what has been called ""the worst treatment scandal"" in NHS history. On the final day of witness hearings in Belfast, she spoke of the deterioration of Richard Lowry's health. He was told he had contracted Hepatitis C in 1991. He died in 2011 from chronic renal failure with cirrhosis. Mrs Lowry described how, at the end of his life, he was ""a skeleton with skin on"". ""That's the only way I can describe him,"" she said. ""He had no flesh. He had no muscle."" Blood victim's 'life of fear and anger' Lives have been ruined, say victims Blood inquiry seeks answers at last Tainted love: One woman's story The inquiry is looking at why 4,800 people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. With allegations of a cover-up, no-one in government or the NHS has been held to account. Some people have waited 30 years for a full public inquiry. At times breaking down, Mrs Lowry said towards the end of his life, her husband became depressed, his personality changed and he ""shut down"". ""He had just given up completely,"" she said. ""He was so low looking and there was no fight in him."" ""He begged me to kill him. He just wanted to die."" Mrs Lowry said she hoped the government would ""accept responsibility and liability for what should never, ever have happened"". ""Sadly, I feel as if I am having to prove that my husband's life was important enough to matter."" There have been complaintsthat victims in England and Scotland are receiving more financial help than those in Wales and Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has written to one victim, saying any decision about financial support for victimswas a matter for Northern Ireland's assembly. Northern Ireland has beenwithout a devolved power-sharing government for more than two-and-a-half years, after the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. Mrs Lowry told BBC News NI she was angry at Mrs Bradley's intervention, describing it as ""unhelpful"". About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years. That was because they were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. It was a treatment introduced in the early 1970s. Before then, patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries. The UK was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment - known as clotting agent Factor VIII - and so supplies were imported from the US. But much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s The blood products were made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors and concentrating it. People who had blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s, the products started to be heat treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before that and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991. By the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk.

Making an emotional statement in Downing Street, Mrs May became tearful as she said serving as PM had been ""the honour of my life"". Attention has now turned to who will replace her, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt today becoming the latest MP to indicate he would stand. He joins declared candidates Boris Johnson, Esther McVey and Rory Stewart, with more than a dozen others also believed to be considering throwing their hats into the ring. The Conservative party says it hopes a new leader can be in place by the end of July - which is also when Sir Vince Cable wants tostep down as Lib Dem leader. Sir Vince said he would be handing over the reins to his successor on 23 July. It looks like a couple of busy months ahead... US President Donald Trump has responded to Theresa May's resignation announcement, saying: ""I feel badly for Theresa"". ""I like her very much. Sheâs a good
woman. She worked very hard. Sheâs very strong. ""She decided to do something
that some people were surprised at, some people werenât, for the good of her
country. But I like her very much."" BBC News Channel The Institute for Government's Bronwen Maddox says there are roughly 124,000 members of the Conservative Party - the people who are likely to have the final say over who the next leader will be. She says  ""as far as we can tell there is a large minority - not a majority - among that group for a no-deal Brexit."" ""The other members seem to be spread along the spectrum - but they are definitely to the right of Conservative MPs. ""The big question is whether MPs who don't like Boris Johnson will block him from getting through to the final two candidates. ""A no-dealer vs a pro-dealer is a very possible outcome.""

Jayne McCormackBBC News NI DUP leader Arlene Foster has told BBC Northern Ireland
she hopes the next Conservative leader has âan understanding of what makes the
DUP tickâ. She said Theresa May had discovered that âwhen you try to bounce
the DUP it simply doesnât workâ. Mrs Foster said the PM had fundamentally misjudged her party's position on Brexit throughout negotiations. Although the party has refused to be drawn on who it would
back as the next PM, Mrs Foster said the DUP would be âlistening carefullyâ to
leadership pitches in relation to how they view the Irish border backstop. The confidence and supply arrangement the DUP shares with
the Conservatives is due to expire next month. Mrs Foster dismissed suggestions that signing up to a
renewed agreement would damage the prospect of restoring devolution in Northern
Ireland. She also refused to be drawn on whether the DUP would seek
to exact a certain price in exchange for support â but said Mrs May
had recognised the importance of extra money for Northern Ireland, in the
absence of a devolved government â and added that she wanted to see money for
vital services reflected in any future DUP-Tory pact. BBC News ""Britain is in a state of paralysis,"" says the veteran Conservative politician Lord Heseltine The former deputy prime minister said: ""The domestic agenda has been frozen, the civil service is obsessed with coping with the uncertainty and British industry is reducing its investment plans. ""I don't see how you get out of that position without a general election or a second referendum."" Lord Heseltine was suspended from the Conservative parliamentary party earlier this week when he said he would be voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections. BBC political editor tweets...

Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry,  has told Sky News that a no-deal Brexit has ""never felt more likely"". She said: ""The compromise deal that was on the table has now evaporated and the clock is ticking. ""Businesses are looking at that date [31 October]. It is a new cliff edge. ""All of the issues we had before around the cost of tariffs, the challenges of no deal, remain. ""So, things have not changed for business."" Scottish National Party MP Ian Blackford - who is the party's Westminster leader - has told the BBC that Mrs May's resignation has been ""expected for some time"" - but that it now causes problems with regards to the Brexit timeline. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. ""The tragedy of all of this is that we're going to spend the next two months in an internal Tory leadership election,"" he said ""We'll have a new prime minister by the end of July, but of course Parliament then goes on recess. We're not going to come back until September, we're back for a couple of weeks, we're then back on recess again. ""We'll come back in the middle of October and we'll have very little time left to bring this whole Brexit chaos to a conclusion."" Asked about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit now being more likely, Mr Blackford added: ""Parliament would have to take its own responsibilities if that is the case and I would remind everyone that we have that option of revoking Article 50 and stopping this process. ""Leaving the EU with no deal would be absolutely disastrous."" The leader of Sinn FÃ©in has reacted to Theresa May's resignation. Speaking in Dublin, Mary Lou McDonald said: ""The chaos at Westminster cannot be allowed to distract from the very real threat that Brexit poses to Ireland."" She also said the deal agreed for the DUP to support Theresa May's minority government has had ""a negative influence on the political process"". And Mrs May came in for criticism from Sinn FÃ©in's leader for setting ""unrealisable red lines"" in the Brexit negotiations. BBC News Channel Former Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps says he thinks the contest to replace the PM will be between someone who voted Remain and someone who voted Leave. ""I think that's probably quite a good outcome for the party"", he says. He adds that he would guess the contest could come down to Remain-voting Jeremy Hunt facing down either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab, who were both Leavers. He says Mr Johnson ""looks a lot more serious as a candidate"" than after the Brexit referendum in 2016. Mr Juncker said he would ""equally respect and establish working relations with any new Prime Minister."" Theresa May's impending departure as prime ministerleaves EU leaders wondering how finishing the Brexit process will be affected. The race to be Conservative leader isn't the only show in town. Today, the Liberal Democrats have opened nominations for a new party leader after incumbent Sir Vince Cable confirmed he would be stepping down on 23 July. In an email to party members, he said the Lib Dems were ""in an excellent position"" to lead a ""powerful, liberal, green, and social democratic force in the centre ground of
British politics"". Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The resignation of Theresa May has clear consequences for the Conservative Party - the starting gun on a leadership contest has been fired. But what does it mean for Brexit? The short answer is that both No Deal and No Brexit are now both more likely. With Mrs May's ""bold new Brexit plan"" in tatters, there is no vehicle for leaving with the EU with a deal, and the default is that the UK's membership will expire on Halloween. Continue reading here. BBC News Channel Theresa May's former speechwriter, Chris Wilkins, says he thought the PM's statement in Downing Street this morning was a ""speech of two halves"". After a first part which recounted her ""greatest hits"" in office, he says the second half was more about her ""personal mission"" in politics. ""That was a much more personal and emotional section"", he says. ""Maybe if we'd heard a bit more of that over the past few years, then she might have done rather better - but of course Brexit simply drowned all of that out."" To help visualise the timetable of when we'll get a new PM, here's how it fits in to this summer's music festival schedule. The Conservative Party hopes a new leader could be in place by the end of July. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And does this mean Theresa May would be free to go to Boardmaster's, Cornwall's music and surf festival? Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The EU establishment, like everyone, marvelled at Theresa May's amazing ability to stay standing. ""If you're a lion tamer you're going to get bitten,"" said one diplomat this morning. They were grateful that she respected the rules of the negotiations and didn't rock the boat on other EU business. EU leaders would bolster her position when things got tough - a photo-op here, some complimentary words there. But they weren't prepared to compromise on the big one - the backstop to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - because they think it's already a compromise. They think it took her too long to realise - or admit - that the UK's economy required something that looked like a customs union. And they were amazed at her regular misreading of her own party and parliament. EU Brexit negotiators have been war-gaming potential replacements for weeks and the scenario that seems to have been considered most seriously is a Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for changes to the backstop that cannot be granted, and then blaming the EU. But there's been no formal discussion about what comes next. That will probably happen at a summit of leaders next week, supposedly about appointments to the EU's top jobs and now inevitably about Brexit. Speaking in Brussels, European Union Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said: ""I just want to express my full respect for Theresa May and for her determination in working towards an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom. ""And on our side we would work exactly in that direction in the next few weeks and months. Asked if a new prime minister could change things, he said: ""That it is for the UK to decide. Nobody else."" ITV political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no deal.â Our correspondent added that Mr Johnson is the person that ""everybody else has got to beat"". ""Why is that? Lots of Conservatives recognise his foibles and the downsides of Boris Johnson. ""But the thing that gets mentioned over and over again by Conservative MPs and Conservative activists is that they think, politically, he is someone who can beat Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, and can also beat Nigel Farage,the leader of The Brexit Party. ""They are the two prominent opponents for the Conservatives in the coming months and years, particularly if we head into a general election which might be tempting for a new Conservative prime minister who wouldn't have a majority in Parliament and wouldn't have anything that they can call their own as far as a mandate.

From a town of industry to a city of culture?,"Mima - Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art - has been open for 12 years Once known for steelmaking and chemical factories, Middlesbrough wants to reinvent itself, and is looking to arts and culture to help. On Thursday, it hosted the north-east of England's annual culture awards, run by two local papers; while it will be at the heart of the Tees Valley's bid to be UK City of Culture in 2025. And this weekend, some of the world's biggest pop stars will flock there forBBC Radio 1's Big Weekend. Here, three artists from the town talk about why it deserves a better press, why being far from London provides artistic freedom, and why they are excavating its history and land - literally - for their creative projects. One of acclaimed scriptwriter Ishy Din's next projects is a stage musical about the fortunes of his home town, beginning when Middlesbrough rapidly expanded during the industrial revolution. ""Sometimes we get a hard time,"" he says. ""We're consistently at the top of lists. Bad lists. Worst place to live. Worst place to be a girl. Health. Employment. Education. And I think that's unfair."" His musical, Iron and Steel, will show a different view. He's creating it with actress and producer Victoria Gibson - daughter of Middlesbrough FC chairman Steve - as well as local folk group Cattle & Cane and singer-songwriter Alistair Griffin. Having a creative career in Middlesbrough has its pros and cons, according to Din, who is also currently working on a play for the Royal Shakespeare Company and has written for Channel 4's Ackley Bridge. Living costs are cheaper than London - to where many people move to try to make their names. But he thinks his career would have progressed faster in the capital. ""There aren't very many of us who have broken through, but in the town there are lots of people and lots of young artists striving to make the leap."" He credits the council with putting faith in culture to help turn the the town's fortunes around in the post-industrial age. ""We want to move forward. We want to celebrate the past but embrace the future. And culture is one of the things that will do it."" BBC News - We Are Middlesbrough From taxi driver to the people's playwright Emily Hesse (front) leading a walking performance titled No Silence Here Emily Hesse hasn't just taken inspiration from the Teesside landscape - she has taken the landscape for her art. She excavated clay from the banks of the River Tees herself, and took a master's degree in ceramics to learn what to do with it. She used it in projects including New Linthorpe, for which she set up a community kiln and gave 1,000 members of the public a lump of clay, and taught them basic techniques. ""It's a very ancient material,"" she says. ""It embodies and holds within it the experiences of communities and traumas and tragedies as well as what it must have been to have lived here at various points in time."" For her parents' generation, art wasn't usually a career option in Middlesbrough. ""Everybody was pretty much just sent into the steelworks, the industry, ICI."" Hesse didn't think art was a career option at first either, but when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at the age of 19, a consultant encouraged her to ""go and have a life"". ""I'm still here and I'm still having a life."" As well as a sculptor, she's an author, performer and activist. She published a book last year - her take on being an artist in the north-east, and being sidelined by more visible artists and institutions. She's currently writing another book, making a film inspired by matriarchal communities, and organising a symposium for the 30th anniversary of a Middlesbrough exhibition titled Miners. ""Often I'm looking for moments to speak about a history that's been marginalised,"" Hesse says. ""That's the root of my work - however those moments appear."" Middlesbrough's lower living costs allow her to do things she couldn't afford to in London, she says. Like have time to think. It also means she doesn't need to sell her art. ""If you're choosing to not produce a commodity, then you have to exist in a different way, and this is a great place to exist outside the capitalist structures of the art world,"" she says. ""We know we're making a sacrifice so we can have that time to think, so we can read a book, so we can produce work, so we can write books. ""We wouldn't get that anywhere else, and that's what this town can offer you."" Mackenzie Thorpe is one of Middlesbrough's most successful artistic exports - his colourful, affectionate paintings are owned by the Queen, JK Rowling and, apparently, Tom Hardy. He's currently on a world tour to mark his 30 years as an artist. He doesn't live in Middlesbrough any more, but in April he returned to unveil a statue next to the famous Transporter Bridge - two children trying to spot their dad among the throng of men who would cross at the end of a shift. It's a tribute to Thorpe's own father, and ""a monument to the working man and the working woman"", he says. Telling the story of the statue, he explains: ""All these men come roaring over, and it's, 'Have you seen my dad? Where's my dad? There he is! There he is!' ""And then he comes over and they grab hold of each hand and he turns round and says, 'Let's go home'. That warmth that goes through them is something that I really miss."" Middlesbrough still informs ""every aspect"" of his work, he says. It's work that is heavily tinged with nostalgia. If he's painting children with his trademark flowers and giant hearts, he's conjuring feelings from his own youth. ""In my mind, all I can see is these six-year-old kids running around the street with a busted ball. You think 'they've got nowt', but we had so much. We were totally happy. It's looking back in such an affectionate way and wishing I still had that."" He goes back regularly - but perhaps living elsewhere means it's easier to draw inspiration from memories of an era when the ""comradeship"" he often mentions was fostered by the heavy industry the town was built upon. ""It's because I constantly miss the place and miss what it means to me that keeps it fresh."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Hugs, sleep and Islam for Dummies","Middlesbrough's Berwick Hills library - a quiet haven even in 1997 Libraries are more than buildings with books in. They are free gateways to infinite worlds and providers of help, advice and unexpected acts of kindness. As part of We Are Middlesbrough, the BBC has been finding out how the town's central library cares for its people. Occasionally, when librarian Jennifer O'Donnell was somewhere in Middlesbrough's Central Library, maybe putting books away, she was called back to the lending desk. She was needed for something almost definitely outside her job description. ""An old lady used to ask for a hug when she came in to collect her books,"" she says. ""She lived alone and I think she just wanted a little contact."" Librarians regularly have stories like this. When first built, the library's boys' and girls' sections were separated by a screen and there was a reading room just for ladies Middlesbrough has11 libraries,external, some prettier than others. But the town's central library is a Victorian treat with a reference section that doesn't look like it's changed since the building opened in 1912. Scottish-American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie had a soft spot for libraries and donated the Â£15,000 cost of building it. On a warm afternoon in May the book shelves have a few people browsing the thrillers and romances but every computer is in use. Robert Kaczkowski is sitting reading Islam for Dummies, part of a series of reference books that takes in subjects as diverse as parenting, carpentry and Shakespeare. ""My friend is a Muslim and I'm just trying to understand,"" he says. Robert Kaczkowski came to learn about another religion He likes the central library because it's quiet. ""It's quite enclosed, it means you get a bit of privacy,"" he says. ""I don't like those libraries where it's open plan and everyone's watching you."" Author Glen James Brown also likes a quiet library. He lives up the road in Chester-le-Street but pushed Middlesbrough on to the fiction bookshelves with his novel Ironopolis, set on a council estate amid the town's industrial decline. Like many authors, he's not sure he would have become a writer had he not spent so much time in his local library as a child. ""I loved stories and I loved reading because of libraries,"" he says ""I still remember the thrill of going down there on a Saturday and the smell of the place. ""It's an access for anybody, from any walk of life. I mean, books cost money to buy. Not everybody has a lot of money."" Author Glen James Brown believes libraries are for everyone, regardless of wealth or background Brown accepts the importance of creches and community hubs in today's libraries but he mourns that the ""books come second"". ""It's kind of this weird multi-use space now,"" he says. They are still safe havens, but books ""aren't top of the list now"", he thinks. But they still provide help, advice and information. The men who call Ms O'Donnell from noisy pubs asking her to settle a bet still get what they need. Librarian Jennifer O'Donnell paid off fines for a borrower who had been in hospital Some come for other reasons. She once woke up someone ""with the imprint of the keyboard still on their face, swearing blind that they were not asleep"". The computers are ICT officer David Harrington's area. They are a big part of the library now, sitting rather incongruously in the Victorian building among its old card-filing cabinets and wooden desks. People use them for submitting job applications, honing their CVs, practising their driving test theory, applying for benefits. For some, it's the first time they've gone near a computer and it is a bit of a shock. ""As well as being newly unemployed they're also being forced onto a PC,"" Mr Harrington says. They need help - emotionally as well as practically - and ""sometimes you find yourself being a social worker"", he says. But computers can only do so much. He quotes author Neil Gaiman: ""Google can bring you back 100,000 answers - a librarian can bring you back the right one."" The number of books you are allowed to take out seems to have increased dramatically Richard Bailey has brought his daughters Isabel and Imogen. They're allowed something like 13 books now, he thinks. Far more than the four it once was. In the end, it comes down to what they can carry. Despite their proliferating computers, libraries are a useful tool against the assault of the internet, he thinks. ""It's drilling it into my daughters that you can pick anything,"" he says. ""Get them out of the mindset of head stuck in phone."" Richard Bailey, Isabel and Imogen Central Library knows its audience, too, it seems. Young readers are offered a holiday reading challenge, with rewards and - highly rated by Isabel and Imogen - a magician. Isabel, collecting a stash of books about gymnastics, likes the relative silence, compared to home. ""I really like it because it's quiet and peaceful,"" she says, pointing out peace is not something her little sister will let her have normally. Imogen, sitting nearby, is oblivious, quietly absorbed in her book.

EU asks what next for Brexit after May goes,"Mr Juncker said he would ""equally respect and establish working relations with any new Prime Minister."" The EU response to Theresa May's resignation speech was immediate. From across Europe came expressions of respect - though notably, not regret. The Brexit process is a painful one for the EU - a constant reminder that the bloc is failing to keep a key member state, a constant shadow over other EU business and an economic drain - provoked by all the uncertainty - on European companies and outside investment. As UK prime minister, Theresa May became associated with all that negativity. It was a source of continuous frustration in Brussels that she - in EU leaders' opinion - repeatedly pandered to the extreme Brexiteers in her party, rather than face the inevitability of compromise and the necessity of cross-party co-operation (which Brussels believes finally came too late) to get an exit deal agreed. European politicians and diplomats have always said to me: ""What we (the EU) need, is a British prime minister strong enough to be able to do a deal in Brussels and to sell it back home in Westminster, whoever they may be."" Theresa May never was that prime minister. European parliament elections: The Brexit effect Here's what's just happened in UK politics Today the president of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, described her as ""a woman of courage for whom he has great respect"" but he also made clear, as did other European leaders, that finishing the Brexit process was the EU's primary concern. Mr Juncker declared he would ""equally respect and establish working relations with any new prime minister whoever they may be"". Adding those last four words ""whoever they may be"", alludes to the EU fear that Boris Johnson or another arch Brexiteer is most likely to become Mrs May's successor. The EU has prepared for the prospect of ""Prime Minister Boris"" for months now. Theresa May's demise doesn't exactly come as a surprise. As was the case when Donald Trump became US president, many Europeans have wondered whether ""populist Boris, the arch Brexiteer"" might be tamed by office into becoming calmer and (from the European perspective) more reasonable. The worry here is that Mr Johnson, or another Brexiteer, keen to prove their mettle, will want to play to the gallery at home: obstructing EU business where they can, as long as the UK remains a reluctant member. The EU has already taken legal advice on how to get around that potential problem. They have concluded, for example, that if the new UK prime minister held up the next EU budget, which needs to be decided in the coming months, the 27 EU leaders minus the UK could informally sign the budget off. Their decision would then become legally binding once the UK officially left the EU. All the speculation about post-May Britain has also got EU leaders thinking about whether to grant the UK a new Brexit extension. The current one runs out on 31 October. The EU assumption is that the new UK prime minister will want more time to hold a general election or to try to renegotiate the current Brexit deal, particularly the controversial backstop guarantee for the Irish border. Good luck with that one, says Brussels, though Dublin will worry that the resolve of some EU leaders may falter if faced with the real prospect (this time) of a no-deal Brexit. With all this in mind, a number of EU countries, notably France, think it probably best to close the door sooner rather than later, to a country that is leaving anyway. President Macron worries that the longer the UK stays reluctantly, the more it might poison the general EU atmosphere. Germany, however, would prefer to give the UK more time, if not to change its mind about Brexit, then at least to ensure an ""orderly exit"" - ie Brexit with a deal - to avoid the economic and political fallout of no deal at all. But 31 October is still a long way away in political terms. Right now, EU leaders are far more preoccupied with this week's elections for the European parliament. The result promises to have a profound impact on the national governments of a fair few countries, including the EU's Big Two, Germany and France. Spain's general election: What just happened?

Students walk out in global climate strike,"This video can not be played Belgium students among one million expected in more than 100 countries School students around the world have gone on strike to demand action on climate change. Organisers said more than a million people were expected to join the action in at least 110 countries on Friday. They are calling on politicians and businesses to take urgent action to slow global warming. The strikes are inspired by student Greta Thunberg, who has become a global figurehead since protesting outside Sweden's parliament in 2018. Carrying a ""school strike for climate change"" sign, the then 15-year-old said she was refusing to attend classes until Swedish politicians took action. This video can not be played The Swedish teen behind the climate strikes The solo protest led to various movements across Europe, the US and Australia, known as Fridays for Future or School Strike for Climate. The last co-ordinated international protest took place on 15 March, with an estimated 1.6 million students from 125 countries walking out of school. Sea level rise could be much larger than expected The schoolgirls seeking to save the world Climate change- Answers to your most asked questions The action on Friday began in Australia and New Zealand. In Melbourne, 13-year-old Nina Pasqualini said she was joining the strike because she was worried about ""weather disasters"". ""Every time we have huge a bushfire here another animal might go extinct,"" she told Reuters news agency. Organisers are expecting more than a million students around the world to walk out Australia just had its hottest summer on record and climate change is seen as the cause of the increasing frequency and severity of droughts, heat waves, floods and the melting of glaciers around the world. In 2018, global carbon emissions hit a record high and UN-backed panel on climate change last October warned that to stabilise the climate,emissions will have to be slashed over the next 12 years. Earlier this month, a UN report warned thatone million animal and plant species were now threatened with extinction. Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate claims? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Sophie Hanford, a national organiser in New Zealand, said Friday's strike was ""only the beginning"". The protesting students have vowed to continue boycotting classeson Fridays until their countries adhere to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which aims to prevent global temperatures from rising 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. As countries around the world woke up, the action spread. Strikes were held in Asian nations including India, Afghanistan Thailand and Japan. In Europe - where the movement first gained traction - images of mass strikes were shared on social media. ""Inaction equals extinction"" and ""save the world not your money"" read some of the placards on display. Greta Thunberg led a march in Stockholm on Friday Protesters in Brussels warned that time is running out to take action Students in Frankfurt were among those calling for policies to save the planet Climate protesters blocked the entrance to Norway's central bank, demanding that it stop investing in companies that burn coal Demonstrators in the Austrian capital said governments needed to act to ""stop climate change now"" In London, scores of protesters congregated outside parliament, chanting ""climate change has got to go"". ""Act now or burn later"" and ""change the system not the government"" read some of the signs held up by participants, as they called for urgent action. Student protesters want the government to reform the national curriculum to include more material on climate change. Organisers said strikes had been organised in about 125 towns and cities across the UK. Student protesters joined the global movement outside parliament in London Young people are calling on their governments to ""act now"" on climate change In an open letter published in Germany's SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung on the eve of Friday's strike, Ms Thunberg and prominent German climate activist Luisa Neubauer, 22, called on older generations to join the action in September. ""This is a task for all humanity. We young people can contribute to a bigger fight, and that can make a big difference.But that only works if our action is understood as a call,"",externalthey wrote. ""This is our invitation. On Friday, 20 September, we will start an action week for the climate with a worldwide strike. We ask you to join us...

The Jews who came back to Portugal," Three years ago, Alex Abrahams was flicking through the pages of a newspaper when he chanced upon the advert which would end up changing his identity. “I saw that the governments of Spain and Portugal had passed restitution laws to offer citizenship to the descendants of those expelled by the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions at the end of the 15th Century and beginning of the 16th Century. I thought: ‘Wow, that’s amazing!’” Alex Abrahams Alex, a 32-year-old lawyer, is British and has lived in London all his life. Like many British Jews, his ancestors came to the UK in the early years of the 20th Century to escape political and civil unrest in Europe. Alex’s mother’s family came to Britain in 1914 to escape war in the Balkans. They hailed from Salonica - now modern day Thessaloniki in Greece - where they had lived for generations. But it was well known that the Jews of Salonica had settled there after being expelled from Spain and Portugal centuries earlier. Alex recalls his grandfather telling him never to forget that he was a Sephardi (the name for Jews who hail originally from the Iberian peninsula). Harry Assael, Alex's grandfather “It’s part of my identity” he explains.  “My grandfather, even though he was born in London, spoke to his family in Ladino. It’s medieval Spanish with some Portuguese pronunciation, infused with bits of Turkish, Italian and Hebrew.” The inheritance was also culinary, as Alex recalls: “He and my grandmother used to cook something called bimuelos  during Passover. They’re basically doughnuts made out of matzah.“ Alex laughs and mischievously adds: “They’re OK if you put honey on them.” Three years on from seeing that advert, Alex has just become a father for the first time. He’s also in the process of becoming Portuguese, despite only having been to the country twice (once for his own stag weekend). Alex on holiday in Portugal For him, it’s a way to formally recognise a key part of his identity. “I know it sounds like an incredibly tenuous link considering how many generations of the family you have to go through from essentially the Middle Ages till now. But half of my family comes from that community and these traditions. I think if my grandparents and great-grandparents and their ancestors were alive today, they would take up the opportunity too.” The streets of Lisbon’s Alfama district are winding, cobbled and atmospheric. Tourists are drawn to the area for a sense of what the medieval city would have been like (as well as some celebrity spotting - Madonna has a house in Lisbon, and can occasionally be seen eating in local cafes). Ruth Calvao, from the Centre for Jewish Studies Centre in Trás-os-Montes, is gesturing to a very old, rough-hewn stone wall providing shade from Lisbon’s strong spring sun. Despite its obvious age, it still looks like it could withstand any kind of modern military attack. This is the site of the one of the city’s old Jewish quarters, nestled into the side of the old city wall. A street sign says Rua da Judiaria. The story that ends with Alex Abrahams begins in neighbourhoods such as this. In 1492 the Spanish monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, issued the Alhambra Decree, expelling Jews from the Spanish kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. Tens of thousands of Jews sought refuge over the border in Portugal. A Portuguese priest, Andrés Bernáldez, observed at the time how the refugees “walked along the roads and over the fields with great difficulty and misfortune, with some of them falling, some of them dying, others being born and every single Christian felt sorry for them.” At the peak of this influx, it’s estimated that up to a fifth of Portugal’s entire population was Jewish. Ruth - who was born into Catholic aristocracy but later converted to Judaism - describes the refugee crisis: “All the Jewish quarters were overflowing because of all the people coming in all the time.” In 1495, Manuel I ascended to the Portuguese throne. Although first seen as friendly towards the Jewish population, Manuel wanted to marry Ferdinand and Isabella’s daughter, the Infanta of Aragon. As part of the marriage contract, the Spanish rulers insisted Manuel copy their strictures on the Jews of Portugal. On 5 December 1496, Manuel ordered the expulsion of all Jews who would not convert to Catholicism. Some did leave but as the policy took force, Manuel vacillated and even sought to delay the departure of the Jews. Ruth Calvao “Manuel was very ambiguous about this,” says Ruth. “He knew much of Portugal’s finances were in Jewish hands – such as the ports, the trades and the construction of the caravels (ships) that helped with the discovery of the New World. He didn’t want the Jews to leave so that’s why he staged forced conversions instead.” In the centre of Lisbon, Ruth shows where a mass conversion involving 20,000 Jews took place in late 1497. Herded together in a courtyard, they were doused with baptismal water. These converted Jews became known as “New Christians”. Despite their conversion, New Christians faced limitations on their legal, financial and civil rights, as well as threats to their safety. Under Manuel’s heir, João III, the Inquisition was set up in Portugal in 1536, focusing on New Christians suspected of secretly practising their old faith. It’s thought more than 40,000 individuals were charged by the Inquisition, which lasted until 1821 although the last public trial was in 1765. An engraving shows the burning of heretics by the Portuguese Inquisition In 1506 a Lisbon mob invaded one of the city’s old Jewish quarters and massacred around 3,000 people – including women and children. It’s commemorated by a monument outside the Church of São Domingos - half of a stone orb with a metal Star of David set in it. It was unveiled in 2006 and calls for a spirit of tolerance in place of fanaticism. The massacre set off another wave of emigration. The Ottoman empire, under Sultan Bayezid II, saw the dividend in offering refuge to exiled Jews - including Alex’s ancestors in what was then Salonica. In 2013, Portuguese MPs unanimously passed a law allowing the descendants of Sephardic Jews to apply for nationality in Portugal. The bill was the idea of the country’s former health minister, Maria De Belém Roseira. “When I was in high school and I read history, I never understood why Portugal had institutionalised the Inquisition.” she says. That nagged away at her over the years until she decided to do something about it. “You cannot make things the same as before. But you can say it was a mistake and it was unacceptable. When we have the power to repair an injustice, we should do that.” Maria De Belém Roseira Maria insists that the events of the 15th and 16th centuries are still relevant to today’s politics: “We cannot sign international treaties on human rights, tolerance and equality if we persecuted people because of their beliefs. In politics, you have to give the right signs.” Spain also passed a similar law but it decided to place a time limit on applications and it required applicants to pass a language test. “Our law was broader,” says Maria, “This was something that happened five centuries ago. So we wanted to give people the opportunity to look into their roots and their families. This is not a problem of time.” For that reason, many Sephardic Jews have chosen to apply for Portuguese citizenship. In any case, many of their ancestors would have crossed the border from Spain to Portugal as refugees. Today Ruth has lots of groups contacting her from these diaspora communities – especially from Turkey. She’ll be showing ten Jewish Turkish families around the Porto area this summer. “They really want to see their roots,” she says. “It’s so lovely.” Lisbon synagogue Lisbon Synagogue was built in the early 1900s appropriately enough by Jews who had returned from a long exile in Morocco and Gibraltar. These returning Jews originally worshipped in their homes but as their confidence as a community grew, so did their desire for a proper place of worship. The building has wooden pews with 12 elegant pillars round the edge supporting an upper gallery. At the front, there’s a frieze of glittering mosaics over the ark which contains the Torah scrolls. Above that, carved into stone, is the inscription in Hebrew: Know Before Whom You Stand. The staff have been surprised by the number of applications for Portuguese citizenship. To help the government, they have been issuing certificates to those who can prove they have Sephardic ancestry. After that, applicants must apply via the Ministry of Justice for the formal naturalisation process. Gabriel Steinhardt (below) is the President of the Jewish community in Lisbon. Although he himself is descended from Ashkenazi Jews (from eastern Europe and Russia), he was born in Portugal and so the new nationality laws have an emotional pull. “I call it a law of return,” he says, “allowing Jews to get back a passport that they normally would be holding if their ancestors had not been forced to leave. It’s the closing of a circle of reconciliation between the Jews and Portugal.” Since 2015 (when the laws came into effect) around 30,000 people have applied to the Ministry of Justice. Out of them about 25% - or just over 7,000 - have already got Portuguese nationality. The largest group of applicants is from Israel, then Turkey and Brazil. One of those who knows most about the motivations of applicants is Yoram Zara, an Israeli immigration lawyer. He says large numbers of Jewish Turks applied early on because of political instability at home. “They were worried about their own well-being; about Turkey becoming less democratic; more Islamic and less predictable. They wanted an insurance of sorts.” As for the Israeli applicants, Yoram says often they apply because “an EU passport is a bit of a status symbol – to walk through the short line at border control”. But he also adds a more serious point: “It wasn’t that long ago that Jews were persecuted and if you had the right papers you could escape your destiny. So there’s a feeling that having another identity can’t hurt.” What about Brexit and British applicants? “The day the referendum results were announced my phone didn’t stop ringing and the emails didn’t stop landing in my inbox,” says Yoram. “It was a kind of panic.” He says it’s calmed down a lot now. Gabriel Steinhardt also says that interest from the UK has not been that high: “The numbers are relatively small - just 1 or 2%. So we’re talking hundreds, not tens of thousands”. The synagogue in Porto, which has dealt with many of the UK applications, says it’s approved 419 certificates of Sephardic ancestry to Britons since the law came into effect. Proving Sephardic heritage can happen in several different ways. Many people have been able to draw up family trees using records from established Sephardic communities such as the Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London and the Portuguese Synagogue in Amsterdam. If, like Alex, you have strong family links to such a community you might only require a letter from a Rabbi and a family document such as a ketubah or marriage certificate. Kadoorie Mekor Haim Synagogue in Porto Gabriel Steinhardt has seen some British families trace their family roots right back to the 17th Century but he admits that is an exception. There’s even been some talk of individuals presenting rusty keys from ancient family homesteads as evidence. “I know of at least two cases of Jews from Turkey that have kept keys from homes in Portugal and transmitted them over 500 years from generation to generation,” he says. “Obviously, those houses do not exist any more, nor do they know where the houses were. But it’s a very moving story.” Other pieces of evidence sent in have included photographs of gravestones and recordings of songs sung by parents and grandparents perhaps in Ladino, Spanish or Portuguese. By way of a demonstration, Rabbi Natan Peres from the Lisbon Synagogue sings a traditional table prayer in Spanish called Bendigamos or Let Us Bless: “It’s an example of how the Jews who left the Iberian Peninsula kept a cultural and spiritual connection back to their homelands.” Gabriel explains that often family names are a good clue, combined with the regions people have come from - for example, the established diasporas in Turkey or Morocco. “We understand, and the Portuguese government understands, that except for some very rare cases it is hard to be 100% sure. But it is possible – with a high level of certainty - to say that the person applying is a descendant of a Sephardic family.” Gabriel says there are now only about 1,500 practising Jews in Portugal although in the last census 5,000 people identified as Jewish. It’s one of the smallest populations in the EU. “Our big hope is that perhaps 1% of those who’ve been approved for nationality will stay in Portugal amongst us and make our community grow a little bit. That would be fantastic.” Etel Sason is a retired university lecturer from a Turkish Sephardic family. She now fills her time with volunteering in a local high school in Istanbul and part-time healing work at a wellness centre. She loves her life as it is, but even at the age of 61 there’s a restlessness there – something pulling her back to the Iberian Peninsula. Etel tells me her ancestors had lived in Toledo, Spain until 1492: “They were forced to leave and part of us still feels we belong there.” Etel Sason Etel and her family got their Spanish citizenship in 2016 through its version of the Sephardic ancestry scheme. She’s now considering splitting her year between Turkey and either Spain or Portugal - possibly Lisbon. “Something calls me – perhaps my genes are telling me I have lived there before. There are so many similarities. Even the cookies they sell in Portugal – they are the same cookies that were baked by my grandmother. The soup too – it’s my grandmother’s soup!” Perhaps the most uncanny thing is that Etel says she can pick up the languages of Spain and Portugal just like that. “It’s miraculous. I’ve never had lessons and I don’t know how to write those languages but I can understand almost everything.” Etel’s parents, like Alex’s grandparents, spoke Ladino at home and there’s enough overlap to help Etel get the gist of what Spanish and Portuguese people are saying to her. “It’s so easy to feel at home in Portugal. Lisbon is really like a smaller Istanbul. Whenever I visit I feel the call.” Etel will be renting a summer home in Lisbon this year and she tells me she knows other families who are moving there permanently. She admits it’s not just their Sephardic roots which make it an attractive prospect. It’s also the fact that Portugal and Spain have good universities and business opportunities as well as a good standard of living compared to more expensive European cities. A sunny climate, of course, also helps. Not every member of Alex Abrahams’ family shares his enthusiasm for becoming Portuguese. “My Mum thinks I’m nuts,” he confesses, even though it’s her family roots which give him the right to claim Portuguese citizenship in the first place. “She thought it was ridiculous when I first told her but as more people have applied, she’s started to take it more seriously.” When he decided to apply, he was able to delve into the family archives to prove his ancestry. He is lucky to have such a well-documented family. Alex has a picture of his grandparents getting married in the Holland Park Synagogue, and he even has a pristine copy of their marriage certificate - in Hebrew but with Ladino phrases in it too. His application included a copy of this document alongside a letter from the synagogue’s rabbi, testifying that his family had strong historical links to the congregation there. Fortunée Stella Amar Interestingly Alex’s family records also contain a miniature portrait from the 18th Century. It shows a woman in local Sephardic dress from Morocco. Alex tells me this is Fortunée Stella Amar – his seven-times great aunt. She is from his maternal grandmother’s side but it’s yet another sign of his Sephardic roots. It’s a beautiful but fragile picture. Thankfully Alex didn’t need to part with it for his passport application. Alex still has the documents to show how his great-grandparents were exempted from the Aliens Restriction Order controlling their movements. The Home Office was satisfied that because they were originally a family of Jews from the Iberian Peninsula they posed no internal threat to Britain. So the family stayed. Alex’s grandfather, Harry, was born in West London in 1915. He’s the man who told his grandson never to forget his Sephardic heritage. Following the Brexit vote in 2016, many British citizens applied for second passports. An estimated 200,000 applications for an Irish passport were made by UK citizens in 2018. Alex says that Brexit played some part in his decision: “It wasn’t just airport queue time. Brexit was the catalyst but I would have done it anyway.” Alex says he’s worried by a resurgence of what he calls ethno-nationalism: “It is frightening. I know that’s not representative of most Brexiteers, but it harks back to previous eras and I think many Jews are scared by that aspect because it never bodes well for them.” He says he’s also concerned about the “conspiratorial language” of some left-wingers in the UK: “They do have a problem with modern Jews,” he says. “They don’t think they can be victims of racism. So I do worry about the world my children will grow up into if that becomes the prevailing politics.” His growing family has also been a factor in obtaining an EU passport at an uncertain time in British history: “I’ve been thinking about the opportunities afforded to my son and whether he’ll be at a disadvantage.” Alex describes himself as a “proud Brit and a proud Londoner” and he insists he is not planning to up sticks and leave. But he did think about freedom of movement when he made his application in 2016: “Dual nationality is hopefully not a taboo. You can have two parts of your identity expressed through your passports.” Alex has spent about £2,500 on his quest for Portuguese citizenship. The application itself didn’t cost much but he’s had to employ a lawyer in Lisbon and many documents had to be notarised or sent by courier. All that adds up. The process has also taken about two and a half years and it’s still not officially over – he’s waiting to have his details written in the Portuguese birth register. After that, he’ll be able to get a citizenship card and passport. He’s already told me he has no immediate plans to move his growing family. But he wouldn’t rule it out altogether either. “There’s the possibility that this isn’t just a symbolic thing that Portugal is doing and that Jews will move there and rebuild these ancient communities. That would be incredible - an amazing part of Jewish history.” He points out his family was in the Iberian Peninsula and then the Ottoman Empire for longer than it’s been in Britain: “Empires change, cultures move on and identities change too.”He’s still waiting for the actual piece of paper – or email – that tells him he’s officially Portuguese as well as British. What will he do to celebrate when it finally arrives? “I will properly invest in a Portuguese language teacher,” he laughs, “because the app I’m using isn’t that great!” Built with Shorthand"
UK retail sales stall in April,"Scottish shops are outperforming the rest of the UK Retail sales stalled in April, but warmer weather boosted sales of clothing, which offset falls in other areas of spending. The Office for National Statistics said sales in April were flat on March, and higher than the 0.3% fall expected. In the three months to April, sales increased by 1.8%, with a record quarter for the online sector. ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said three-month growth was strong, with warmer weather boosting sales. The data illustrated the changes taking place on the High Street. Sales from online-only retailers rose 9.4% over the three-month period - the highest three-month-on-three-month growth rate since records began, the ONS said, boosted by promotions and sales. ""Elsewhere, department stores continued to see their sales fall,"" Ms Murphy said. Department store sales fell by 0.5% and those in household goods stores declined by 2.9%. Energy bills push inflation to 2019 high UK economy rebounds in first quarter Compared with a year earlier, sales were up by 5.2% aftera 6.7% annual rise in March. The ONS said anecdotal evidence from retailers suggested warm weather in April boosted sales over the period, which included Easter, while economists said the figures showed Brexit was not having an impact on spending. ""April's retail sales figures are a timely reminder that political uncertainty is having no discernible impact on households' overall spending. The stability of volumes in April is a good result, following recent strong gain,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Admittedly, warmer-than-usual weather - average temperatures were 1.1C above their 1970-to-2018 April average - probably temporarily stimulated clothing sales,"" he added. Duncan Brewer, retail partner at management consultants Oliver Wyman, said sales were boosted  ""as consumers went out and spent money over the sunny holiday period"". But, he said, that contrasted to ""continued bad news from our ailing High Streets, which continue to be challenged by the shift to online. Retail used to be simple: consumers went to stores, browsed products, then bought what they wanted"". Consumer spending helped drive the economy in the first quarter of the year and economists look to the retail sales figures as one potential gauge for the impact on economic growth. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said sales volumes might have been weaker if retailers had not discounted over the Easter period and that growth could slow in the second quarter as household spending eased. ""And with other parts of the economy in no position to compensate, this supports our view that growth will moderate a little in [the second quarter] and remain sluggish for the rest of the year,"" she said.

Trump boosts spying inquiry over Mueller report,"US Democrats have accused Mr Barr of acting on behalf of the president US President Donald Trump has ordered US intelligence agencies to co-operate with an investigation into whether he was spied on during the 2016 election. The probe, headed by Attorney General William Barr, is examining the origins of the Russia investigation. It has long been requested by Mr Trump, who often labels the inquiry into Russian interference a ""witch hunt"". On Thursday he announced a directive that gave Mr Barr sweeping new powers, including to declassify documents. Mr Barr is already subject to intense scrutiny and criticism by Democrats - who have accused him of acting on the president's behalf and not in the national interest. The president has repeatedly suggested his campaign was spied on and accused intelligence agencies of abusing their power. Five looming fights between Congress and Trump Eight things we learned from Mueller report He has also said this could amount to ""treason"" and has suggested those involved should be criminally prosecuted.

In April, the attorney general told Congress that ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign, and said he wanted to ensure that any intelligence-gathering had been legitimate. Earlier this month, Mr Barr assigned a federal prosecutor to look at the origins of the Russia investigation. Mr Trump has denied asking Mr Barr to do so. Thursday's memorandum directs the heads of intelligence agencies to ""promptly provide"" information to Mr Barr upon his request. ""Today's action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred, and the actions that were taken, during the last presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions,"" press secretary Sarah Sanders said. After almost two years, a redacted version of the report compiled by special counsel Robert Mueller was released in April. The report concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election ""in sweeping and systematic fashion"" but did not find there had been a criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign. It did, however, detail 10 instances where Mr Trump had possibly attempted to impede the investigation. After the report was released, Mr Barr was accused of mischaracterising its findings in a previously released summary. This video can not be played Why did the chicken go to Congress? He has since failed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee and has been held in contempt for failing to provide them an unredacted version of the report. Mr Mueller himself said he was ""frustrated"" by Mr Barr's summary, saying it lacked context. Anthony Zurcher, North America reporter, BBC News Now comes the counter-attack For nearly two years, Donald Trump was buffeted by an investigation into his presidential campaign conducted from within his own justice department. Now that the Robert Mueller inquiry has concluded, the administration's investigatory powers - heralded by the attorney general - are being directed at those who began the investigation. The president has long railed against the Russia inquiry as an illegitimate hoax designed to ""spy"" on him and his associates. On Thursday he stood by his accusation that senior intelligence agency officials involved in the investigation had committed ""treason"" - even after being reminded by a reporter that the punishment for treason is death. Just what, if anything, Attorney General Barr will unearth with his newly granted powers to request and declassify intelligence agency documents is an open question. He speculated during recent congressional hearings that what the public knows about government surveillance of members of the Trump 2016 campaign team may not be the whole story. At the very least, however, the president can now claim that he has turned the tables on his long-time antagonists. His supporters will be thrilled. Democrats will call it a distraction. And the political battles rage on. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is among those who have criticised the expanded power announcement. ""Trump and Barr conspire to weaponise law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies,"" Adam Schiff said on Twitter. ""The cover-up has entered a new and dangerous phase. This is un-American,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Did Theresa May solve her 'burning injustices'?,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to ""build a better Britain"" When Theresa May became prime minister in July 2016 she promised to build a better Britain and lead a government that worked for everyone rather than being ""driven by the interests of the privileged few"". As part of that, she identified seven ""burning injustices"". Since the speech, she and the government have been pre-occupied with Brexit - something Mrs May has called ""the biggest peacetime challenge any government has faced"". Three years on, the Reality Check team assesses how she has fared in tackling the domestic policy goals she set out in Downing Street. In recent years, the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived people in England has worsened - by three months for men and seven months for women. At the time of Mrs May's speech,the most recent figures on life expectancy inequality,externalwere for 2012-14, and showed a 9.1 and 6.9 year gap for men and women respectively. This had grown to 9.3 years and 7.5 years respectively by 2015-17. Has life expectancy fallen in Britain? We're looking at England because some key decisions for the rest of the UK, for example around education and health, are devolved to the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments and are not in Mrs May's power. Theresa May gave her ""burning injustices"" speech straight after being asked to form a government by the Queen Establishing how far Theresa May has acted to address this ""burning injustice"" is tricky, since life expectancy isn't determined by a single factor. But there are a few things we know influence how long people are expected to live: lifestyle factors, like smoking and drinking alcohol, and social factors like income, access to good healthcare services and education. During her premiership, the prime ministerpledged an extra Â£20bn to the NHS in Englandspread over five years. Globally (with thenotable exception of the United States), higher health spending is linked to longer life expectancies. NHS long-term plan: Are there enough staff to make it happen? NHS plan: What it means for you The benefit of this money hasn't been felt yet, but we could mark this down as an action taken to address this particular injustice in the future. On the other hand,spending on public health,external- including things like smoking cessation and substance misuse services - has fallen since 2016. Social care didn't get any extra money alongside the NHS's ""70th birthday present"", and education spending is flat-lining. Benefits cuts pledged before Mrs May became prime minister have continued to be rolled out and food-bank use and homelessness have continued to rise since the summer of 2016. Since deprivation is the driver of this inequality in life expectancy, all of these things could play a role longer-term. Mrs May has taken steps to make this inequality more transparent, but there has been less in the way of action to directly alter it. Sheordered a Race Disparity Audit,externalwith the explicit motivation of ""tackling burning injustices"". This was designed to show how people of different ethnic backgrounds are treated by a range of public bodies, including the criminal justice system. It highlighted the fact that, for example, black defendants were more likely than white defendants to be remanded in custody rather than let out on bail while waiting for their cases to go to trial. These disparities are largely unchanged, and in some cases have worsened. It's hard to say from this alone that black people are being treated more harshly by the criminal justice system as it doesn't tell us anything about disparities in offending behaviour. But we can also look at the sentences being handed out for the same offences. Black people were given longer sentences, on average, than white people for the same category of offence in most cases, excluding fraud and criminal damage. And average custodial sentences for black people have increased over the past couple of years, while for white people they have remained the same. In June 2016,42% of under-18s in custody were from a black,externalor minority ethnic background, with 22.8% describing themselves as black. By March 2019, the proportion of young people in custody from a minority ethnic, or specifically from a black background, had risen to 49% and 27.8% respectively. Dr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said while the statistics were helpful, ""highlighting the gaps doesn't address the gaps"". Areview into the higher education system,externaland its funding is imminent, which could have implications for poorer students. There's been an upward trend in university participation for many years, and this has continued under Theresa May's supervision. The number of people going to university for the first time from the neighbourhoods with the lowest higher education participation has increased by 3% since 2016 -  a faster rate than the average for all neighbourhoods. But this is part of a much longer-term trend - it's difficult to point to any of Mrs May's policies that would have particularly driven this. The key data in this area comes fromthe Sutton Trust,external, which focuses on social mobility. It looked in 2016 at the proportion of people from private schools holding top jobs in a selection of professions. There is little sign of improvement in this area, although the one area over which Theresa May has direct control - the cabinet - currently has 41% of members who attended independent schools, down from 50% in 2016. The Social Mobility Commission, which reports to the government on this issue, releasedits annual report,externalin April saying that social mobility had been virtually stagnant for the past four years. It also found that people from professional backgrounds are 80% more likely to get into a professional job than their less privileged peers. Social mobility: The worst places to grow up poor State of the Nation report: Inequality 'entrenched from birth' ""At a time when our country needs to be highly productive and able to carve out a new role in a shifting political and economic landscape, we must find a way to maximise the talent of all our citizens, especially those that start the furthest behind,"" said commission chairwoman Dame Martina Milburn. But there was some optimism from Russell Hobby, chief executive of Teach First: ""Over recent years, we've definitely seen a welcome vigour across the education sector and government when it comes to solving the puzzle of inequality,"" he said. ""At the government level, this includes a welcome commitment to the pupil premium, new efforts to recruit teachers in poorer areas, and much needed emphasis on careers education in schools."" During her time in office, Mrs May extended the dutyto report gender pay gaps,externalto more companies. A duty on larger companies to report their pay gaps had already been promised before she took office. Gender pay gap: What is the pay gap at your company? The gender pay gap has continued to narrow since she became prime minister, although this forms part of a longer-term trend. Women on average still earn 18% less than men. Of the Â£20bn Mrs May pledged to the NHS, Â£2bn is earmarked to be spent on mental health. Despite the investment, there are clear signs services are struggling to cope. The number of out-of-area placements for people needing hospital treatment have risen by a third. Children's community services are particularly strained. Just 16% of children referred for help last year were seen in six weeks - the rest had to wait longer or were turned away. The children's commissioner Anne Longfield has said she is worried about the state of these services. Mental health spending varies widely across England Is young people's mental health getting worse? But the NHS's talking therapy programme has continued to grow, with more than a million new starts on a course of therapy in the year ending March 2018, compared with 953,522 in 2015-16. This is largely a culmination of many years of investment in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme, launched in 2006. Mrs May did take other steps to show her dedication to mental health care. She appointed the first minister for suicide prevention, launched an annual review of children's mental health in England and ordered an independent review of the Mental Health Act after concerns over the use of force and detention. During her tenure, Mrs May introduced a new stamp duty relief for first-time buyers and an additional Â£10bn for the Help to Buy loan scheme, both aimed at helping people on to the property ladder. Home ownership among 25-34 year-olds has fallen steadily over the past two decades as property prices have soared, according to research by think tank the Resolution Foundation - but there's been a small uptick in home ownership among young people since 2016. The think tank put this in large part down to banks being more willing to offer larger mortgages as post-financial crisis conditions have eased, as well as a slowing in the growth of house prices. But it did also point to stamp duty relief as a factor.

SpaceX puts up 60 internet satellites,"This video can not be played The Falcon-9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida The SpaceX company has begun the roll-out of its orbiting broadband system. A Falcon-9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida late on Thursday, packed with 60 satellites capable of giving users on the ground high-speed connections to the internet. Entrepreneur Elon Musk's firm aims eventually to loft nearly 12,000 spacecraft for its ""Starlink"" network. SpaceX is one of several commercial outfits with permission to fly an internet mega-constellation. Others include the UK-based start-up OneWeb, which began its roll-out in February with six operational spacecraft. Online retailer Amazon also has ambitions in this market. It's working on a 3,200-satellite proposal known as Project Kuiper. All the concepts envisage flying spacecraft in a low-Earth orbit less than 2,000km above the planet. This will minimise the delay, or latency, in the internet connections. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

SpaceX has kept secret much of the development activity on its multi-billion-dollar broadband plan. The company launched a couple of technology demonstrators, Tintin-A and Tintin-B, in February 2018, but the ""first production spacecraft"" that went up on Thursday look very different. These have a ""flat-pack"" design. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 Each satellite weighs 227kg, has multiple high-throughput antennas and a single solar array, the SpaceX CEO explained in a briefing last week. The platforms are also equipped with electric propulsion - a system that expels electrically charged atoms of krypton to provide thrust. The engine is needed to lift a Starlink from its drop-off altitude of 440km to its operational height of 550km. The propulsion system will also act to maintain the satellite's correct position in the sky, and to bring it down at the end of its service life. Mr Musk said the newly launched Starlinks were an iterative design and later platforms would have a higher specification, featuring for example inter-satellite links. It was ""one of the hardest engineering projects I've ever seen done,"" he said, and cautioned that much could go wrong in the early phases of the roll-out. There is increasing unease about the number of satellites that could be launched in the next few years - for many purposes, not just broadband delivery - and how this might potentially clog up the space environment. To give context to what is about to happen - there are just 2,000 operational satellites in orbit today,according to the Union of Concerned Scientists,external' database. SpaceX's ambitions alone, if fully realised, would dwarf this population. The great fear is that congested orbital highways will result in collisions and the production of debris that then initiates further destructive encounters. SpaceX said it intended to be a responsible actor and had given its satellites the ability themselves to track orbital debris and to autonomously avoid it. What is more, it added, all the Starlinks were 95% constructed from components that would burn up rapidly on re-entry to the atmosphere when decommissioned - exceeding all current safety standards. It will be some time before SpaceX can actually offer connections to the internet. For that it must launch many more than the 60 spacecraft on Thursday's Falcon. Six further rocket flights will have to take place before minor broadband coverage is achieved. A dozen launches are required for moderate coverage, says Mr Musk. He hopes ultimately that revenue from the telecommunications network can fund some of his other ideas: ""We think this is a key stepping stone on the way towards establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars and a base on the Moon.""

We wish to extend our thoughts and condolences to all of Leo's family and friends at this saddest of times. ""Leo was a sparkle in our school. His face lit up the classroom and his mischievous blue eyes made us all smile. ""He was an avid scientist, who only on Wednesday was in his element hunting for bugs on the school field. ""Leo was always keen to share his model-building and wowed the class when he brought in the finished masterpieces.

Mixed reaction to PM's resignation,"Mrs May became emotional as she announced her intention to quit Theresa May's resignation puts Brexit in a new phase that may be ""very dangerous for Ireland"", Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar said the PM's departure could lead to the election of a ""Eurosceptic"" prime minister. Mrs May saidshe would quit as Conservative leader on 7 June, paving the way for a leadership contest. The taoiseach said her successor may scrap the Brexit withdrawal agreement. What does PM's resignation mean for NI? LIVE reaction as May signals her departure Brush with May signposted Brexit maze ""We may see the election of a Eurosceptic prime minister who wants to repudiate the withdrawal agreement and go for no-deal, or we may even see a new British government that wants a closer relationship with the EU and goes for a second referendum,"" said Mr Varadkar. But the taoiseach said that whatever happens, the Irish government will ""hold its nerve"". ""We are going to build and strengthen our alliances across the European Union and we will make sure that we see Ireland through this,"" he added. Mr Varadkar said Mrs May was ""principled, honourable, and deeply passionate about doing her best for her country"". ""Politicians throughout the EU have admired her tenacity, her courage, and her determination during what has been a difficult and challenging time,"" he said. Leo Varadkar's deputy Simon Coveney (right), warned the UK would not get a better Brexit deal than that negotiated with Theresa May However, TanÃ¡iste (Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney warned the European Union would not offer Mrs May's successor a better Brexit deal. ""This idea that a new prime minister will be a tougher negotiator and will put it up to the EU and get a much better deal for Britain? That's not how the EU works,"" Mr Coveney told Ireland's Newstalk radio station. He said a further Article 50 extension, delaying Brexit, was ""possible and may be likely"". Political leaders from across the island have been giving their reaction to Mrs May's resignation announcement. Here are some of them: Karen Bradley said she was ""deeply saddened to see the prime minister step down from the job she loved"". She said Mrs May was an ""extremely courageous and dedicated public servant"" who ""always does what she believes is in the best interest"" of the whole of the UK. Mrs Bradley added that Mrs May ""worked tirelessly to deliver Brexit that works for all parts of the UK"" and ""passionately believed in working with all parties and parts of the community in NI ""to restore devolution and build a stronger, shared society for all"". DUP leader Arlene Foster,whose 10 MPs prop up the Conservative government in Westminster, paid tribute to Mrs May's ""selfless service in the interests of the United Kingdom"". She also thanked the prime minister for ""her willingness to recognise Northern Ireland's need for additional resources through confidence-and-supply arrangements"". She told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme Theresa May had discovered that ""when you try to bounce the DUP it simply doesn't work"". Mrs Foster said Mrs May had fundamentally misjudged the DUP's position on Brexit throughout the negotiations. The DUP leader said she hopes the next Conservative leader has ""an understanding of what makes the DUP tick"". Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said the ""chaos at Westminster"" cannot be allowed to distract from ""the very real threat that Brexit poses to Ireland"". She also said the talks process should not be pushed off course. Ms McDonald accused Mrs May of having prioritised a deal with the DUP at Westminster over re-establishing the power-sharing institutions. ""An agreement can be reached and a deal can be done. But the process must not be derailed nor responsibility abdicated in respect of people's rights and agreements."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the prime minister's resignation showed that Brexit was ""fundamentally undeliverable"". ""A new prime minister should recognise the mistakes made by Theresa May, revoke Article 50 and put an end to this political, diplomatic and economic car crash,"" he said. Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said that while Mrs May had been a dignified prime minister, she had ""left the UK in a worse place than when she took up the role"". ""While she attempted several times to get her withdrawal agreement through Parliament, she had her hands tied through mutually contradictory red lines over Brexit,"" he said. He said Mrs May had also squandered a chance to build a consensus around a softer version of Brexit with a special deal for Northern Ireland. ""No matter who now replaces her, the same problems will still persist . They will face stark choices regarding Brexit and its consequences, and they need to approach them with honesty and realism."" Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said Mrs May's successor ""should have an absolute commitment to the maintenance of the union and the prosperity of all its people"". Mr Swann said ""the bind"" in which the prime minister's government found itself ""was of its own making"". ""A change of Conservative Party leader will not necessarily solve the problem unless there is a change in approach. ""The backstop is the problem that needs dealt with and it ultimately broke Theresa May's premiership,"" he added.

Three more die on Everest amid overcrowdingSeven have died climbing the world's highest peak in a week - more than for the whole of last year.Asia,"The summit of Everest stands at 8,848m (29,029ft) Three more climbers have died on Mount Everest, taking the death toll to seven in a week - more than the total for the whole of last year. The three died of exhaustion while descending on Thursday. It comes amid traffic jams near the summit as record numbers make the ascent, despite calls to limit the number of climbing permits. Nepal has issued 381 permits at $11,000 (Â£8,600) each for the spring climbing season at the world's highest peak. Two Indian climbers - Kalpana Das, 52, and Nihal Bagwan, 27 - died while scaling back down the mountain on Thursday. Why Everest's summit gets so crowded How deadly is Mount Everest? Sherpa climbs Everest twice in a week, setting record 24 ascents Local tour organiser Keshav Paudel told AFP news agency that Bagwan had been ""stuck in the traffic for more than 12 hours and was exhausted"". A 65-year-old Austrian climber died on the northern Tibet side of the mountain. An Indian and an American lost their lives on the mountain on Wednesday, while an Irish professor, SÃ©amus Lawless, is presumed dead after falling on 16 May. Conditions this year have also been worse than usual, with high winds leaving a large number of climbers a narrow time frame to reach the summit. Five people are known to have died on Everest and one in Lhotse in the spring season last year. The number of people climbing Everest in 2019 could exceed last year's record of 807 people reaching the summit. The rising numbers of people climbing - and dying - on Everest has led for calls for permits to be limited. Ben Fogle, the adventurer and television presenter who climbed the mountain last year, called for ""London Marathon style lottery for climbing permits"" in a Twitter post. Nirmal Purja has climbed six of the world's highest summits in just over four weeks Mountaineer Nirmal Purja's photo of queues at Mount Everest has attracted attention around the world this week. The photo shows the last ridge Mount Everest's summit, from the southern, Nepali side. Climbers can also reach the summit via the northern, Tibetan side, but the southern route is much busier. If you look carefully, you'll see there are two rows of climbers. Because there is only one fixed rope at the summit, climbers ascending and descending the summit all have to share the same rope. The vast majority of Everest climbers use oxygen masks and cylinders at the summit - oxygen levels there are only about 30% what they are at sea level.

"Students walk out in global climate strikeFrom Australia to Europe, school children are skipping classes to call for action on climate change.","This video can not be played Belgium students among one million expected in more than 100 countries School students around the world have gone on strike to demand action on climate change. Organisers said more than a million people were expected to join the action in at least 110 countries on Friday. They are calling on politicians and businesses to take urgent action to slow global warming. The strikes are inspired by student Greta Thunberg, who has become a global figurehead since protesting outside Sweden's parliament in 2018. Carrying a ""school strike for climate change"" sign, the then 15-year-old said she was refusing to attend classes until Swedish politicians took action. This video can not be played The Swedish teen behind the climate strikes The solo protest led to various movements across Europe, the US and Australia, known as Fridays for Future or School Strike for Climate. The last co-ordinated international protest took place on 15 March, with an estimated 1.6 million students from 125 countries walking out of school. Sea level rise could be much larger than expected The schoolgirls seeking to save the world Climate change- Answers to your most asked questions The action on Friday began in Australia and New Zealand. In Melbourne, 13-year-old Nina Pasqualini said she was joining the strike because she was worried about ""weather disasters"". ""Every time we have huge a bushfire here another animal might go extinct,"" she told Reuters news agency. Organisers are expecting more than a million students around the world to walk out Australia just had its hottest summer on record and climate change is seen as the cause of the increasing frequency and severity of droughts, heat waves, floods and the melting of glaciers around the world. In 2018, global carbon emissions hit a record high and UN-backed panel on climate change last October warned that to stabilise the climate,emissions will have to be slashed over the next 12 years. Earlier this month, a UN report warned thatone million animal and plant species were now threatened with extinction. Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate claims? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Sophie Hanford, a national organiser in New Zealand, said Friday's strike was ""only the beginning"". The protesting students have vowed to continue boycotting classeson Fridays until their countries adhere to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which aims to prevent global temperatures from rising 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. As countries around the world woke up, the action spread. Strikes were held in Asian nations including India, Afghanistan Thailand and Japan. In Europe - where the movement first gained traction - images of mass strikes were shared on social media. ""Inaction equals extinction"" and ""save the world not your money"" read some of the placards on display. Greta Thunberg led a march in Stockholm on Friday Protesters in Brussels warned that time is running out to take action Students in Frankfurt were among those calling for policies to save the planet Climate protesters blocked the entrance to Norway's central bank, demanding that it stop investing in companies that burn coal Demonstrators in the Austrian capital said governments needed to act to ""stop climate change now"" In London, scores of protesters congregated outside parliament, chanting ""climate change has got to go"". ""Act now or burn later"" and ""change the system not the government"" read some of the signs held up by participants, as they called for urgent action. Student protesters want the government to reform the national curriculum to include more material on climate change. Organisers said strikes had been organised in about 125 towns and cities across the UK. Student protesters joined the global movement outside parliament in London Young people are calling on their governments to ""act now"" on climate change In an open letter published in Germany's SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung on the eve of Friday's strike, Ms Thunberg and prominent German climate activist Luisa Neubauer, 22, called on older generations to join the action in September.

The Theresa May storyHow Brexit led to the downfall of the UK's second female prime minister.UK Politics,"Celebrating her elevation to the Tory leadership with husband, Philip Britain's second female prime minister, like the first, has ultimately been brought down by Conservative in-fighting over Europe. But Theresa May is unlikely to join Margaret Thatcher in the annals of leaders who left an indelible mark on their country. At least not in the way she might have wanted when she entered Downing Street in July 2016. Whatever ambitions she had - to reach out to the forgotten parts of the nation, or correct the ""burning injustices"" in British society - were overshadowed by a single word: Brexit. Her almost three years in office were entirely defined by Britain's decision to leave the European Union, and her increasingly desperate efforts to deliver on the outcome of the referendum called by her predecessor David Cameron. Even her sternest critics had to marvel at her ability to soak up the punishment that came, in wave after wave, from all sides. Theresa May to resign as prime minister Ministerial resignations and parliamentary rebellions that would have spelled the end for a prime minister in normal times seemed to bounce off her. She ploughed on, seemingly oblivious to the chaos around her, telling MPs ""nothing has changed"" and promising to deliver on the ""will"" of British people, even as her power over Parliament and control of her warring party drained away to nothing. It might have been different had she managed to win the 2017 general election. Theresa May takes part in a Q&A at a business in Leeds But instead of returning to Downing Street with a huge mandate of her own, as she had expected, she lost her Commons majority and had to rely on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. She never really recovered from this self-inflicted wound, with a sense that many of her MPs were only keeping her in office until she had delivered Brexit before jettisoning her in favour of a more voter-friendly alternative. At one point, she had to promise she would quit before the next scheduled election in 2022, as she battled to win a no-confidence vote organised by her own MPs. And then, as the end neared - and she had alienated many MPs by blaming them for the deadlock over Brexit - she was forced, finally, to accept that the party, which had never elected her as leader, did not want her to serve any more. She offered her own departure as the final sacrifice to her internal critics, telling them she would stand down if they voted for her EU withdrawal deal. A venerable Tory colleague oncedescribed Theresa May as a ""bloody difficult woman"". She wore the label as a badge of honour. She was said to have a dry wit in private, but her public persona, even when she was trying to lighten up, could be wooden and forced, and even close colleagues were said to have difficulty working out what she was really thinking. Her single-minded, unshowy and diligent approach to politics enabled her to steadily navigate her way to the very top of a party that had traditionally favoured men from more privileged backgrounds than her own when she had first joined it in the late 1970s. And despite what it must feel like right now, Brexit will not be her only political epitaph. Theresa May married her husband Philip in 1980 Date of birth:1 October 1956 (aged 62) Jobs:MP for Maidenhead since 1997. Became prime minister in 2016 after serving as home secretary for six years. Education:Mainly state-educated at Wheatley Park Comprehensive School with a brief time at an independent school; St Hugh's College, Oxford Family:Married to Philip May Hobbies:Cooking - she says she owns more than 150 recipe books. Mountain-walking holidays with her husband.  On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2014, she chose Abba's Dancing Queen and Walk Like A Man, from the musical Jersey Boys, among her picks, alongside Mozart and Elgar. Shechose a subscription to Vogue as her luxury item, reflecting her lifelong love of high fashion. The daughter of a Church of England vicar, Hubert, who died from injuries sustained in a car crash when she was 25, Mrs May said her father had taught her to ""take people as you find them"" and ""treat everyone equally"". Born in Eastbourne, East Sussex, but raised largely in Oxfordshire, she attended a state primary, an independent convent school and then a grammar school in the village of Wheatley, which became the Wheatley Park Comprehensive School during her time there. The young Theresa Brasier, as she was then, threw herself into village life, taking part in a pantomime that was produced by her father and working in the bakery on Saturdays to earn pocket money. Friends recall a tall, fashion-conscious young woman who, from an early age, spoke of her ambition to be the first woman prime minister. In 1976, in her third year at Oxford University, she met her husband Philip, who was two years younger than her and president of the Oxford Union, a well-known breeding ground for future political leaders. They were introduced at a Conservative Association disco by future Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Both claim it was ""love at first sight"". They married in 1980. The young Theresa Brasier at a function in the village hall There are no tales of drunken student revelry from Mrs May's time at Oxford, but friends say she was not the austere figure she would later come to be seen as, suggesting she had a sense of fun and a full social life. After graduating with a degree in geography, May went to work in the City, initially starting work at the Bank of England and later rising to become head of the European Affairs Unit of the Association for Payment Clearing Services. Theresa May seen here as a child with parents Zaidee and Hubert She first dipped her toe in the political water in 1992, when she stood in the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, coming a distant second. Her fellow candidates in that contest also included a very youthful Tim Farron, who went on to become a Lib Dem leader. Two years later, she stood in Barking, east London, in a by-election where - with the Conservative government at the height of its unpopularity - she got fewer than 2,000 votes and saw her vote share dip more than 20%. But her luck was about to change. The Conservatives' electoral fortunes may have hit a nadir in 1997, when Tony Blair came to power in a Labour landslide, but there was a silver lining for the party and for the aspiring politician when she won the seat of Maidenhead in Berkshire, having beaten her future chancellor Philip Hammond to be selected as the candidate. It's a seat she has held ever since. Mrs May first stood for Parliament in 1992 in North West Durham An early advocate of Conservative ""modernisation"" in the wilderness years that followed, Mrs May quickly joined the shadow cabinet in 1999, under William Hague, as shadow education secretary and in 2002 she became the party's first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith. Shelaunched a drive to get more women selected,externalas Conservative candidates in winnable seats but antagonised the party's grass roots by telling them in a conference speech that they were still seen by some as ""the nasty party"" and had to change their ways. Some activists struggled to forgive her for that but it was an early sign of her willingness to deliver unpalatable home truths. As home secretary, she was booed offstage by angry officers at the Police Federation annual conference, after she had told them they should welcome her reforms and ""stop pretending"" they were being ""picked on"" by the government. After Iain Duncan Smith's brief, chaotic reign as Tory leader, Mrs May held a range of senior posts under his successor Michael Howard. But she was conspicuously not part of the ""Notting Hill set"" which grabbed control of the party after its third successive defeat in 2005 and laid David Cameron and George Osborne's path to power. Theresa May, back row, right, in the 1999 shadow cabinet She was initially appointed shadow leader of the House of Commons, but gradually raised her standing and by 2009 had become shadow work and pensions secretary. Nevertheless, her promotion to the job of home secretary when the Conservatives joined with the Lib Dems to form the first coalition government in 70 years was still something of a surprise - given that Chris Grayling had been shadowing the brief in opposition. The Home Office had proved to be the kiss of death for many a promising political career, but Mrs May refused to let this happen to her. Theresa May initially fell down the pecking order under David Cameron but worked her way back up She became the longest-serving occupant of the office in recent history, staying in the post for six years, and developing a reputation as a tough operator who would always fight her corner. Despite her liberal instincts in some policy areas, such as stop and search powers for the police, she frequently clashed with the then deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, particularly over her plan to increase internet surveillance to combat terrorism, dubbed the ""snooper's charter"" by the Lib Dems. After one ""difficult"" meeting with Mr Clegg, he reportedly told Lib Dem minister David Laws: ""You know, I've grown to rather like Theresa May... She's a bit of an ice maiden and has no small talk whatsoever - none. I have quite difficult meetings with her. Cameron once said, 'She's exactly like that with me too!'"" Crime levels fell and she successfully deported radical cleric Abu Qatada - something she listed as one of her proudest achievements, along with preventing the extradition to America of computer hacker Gary McKinnon. There was abitter public row with cabinet colleague Michael Govein June 2014 over the best way to combat Islamist extremism, which ended with Mr Gove having to apologise to the prime minister and Mrs May having to sack a long-serving special adviser. Mrs May faced constant criticism over the government's failure to meet its promise to get net migration down to below 100,000 a year, She persisted with this target when she entered Downing Street, even though she had never come close to meeting it and had faced repeated calls from Tory colleagues to drop it. Her decision to make life more difficult for illegal immigrants by restricting access to the NHS and accommodation - and vowing to ""deport first and hear appeals later"" - would also come back to haunt her when she became prime minister. The Windrush scandal - which saw Commonwealth citizens who had lived in the UK legally for decades being harassed and even deported because they did not have the correct paperwork - led to the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd, although the minister would later return to the cabinet after an inquiry blamed officials for the Windrush fiasco. Mrs May's taste in footwear has kept photographers interested for more than a decade She became Conservative leader and prime minister in July 2016 without a general election, following the resignation of David Cameron. Like Mr Cameron, she had been against Brexit but she cleverly managed to keep the Eurosceptics in her party on side during the referendum campaign by keeping a low profile. She reaped her reward byemerging as the unchallenged successor to Mr Cameron, as other potential rivals fell by the wayside - portraying herself as a steady pair of hands who would deliver the will of the people and take Britain out of the EU in as orderly a fashion as possible. At 59, she was the oldest leader to enter Downing Street since James Callaghan in 1976 and was the first prime minister since Ted Heath not to have children. Mrs May has rarely opened up about her private life although she revealed in 2013 that she had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and would require insulin injections twice a day for the rest of her life - something she said she had come to terms with and which would not affect her career. Mrs May promised an ambitious domestic agenda when she took office Shortly before becoming prime minister, in July 2016, she spoke tothe Mail on Sunday,externalabout the impact that being told they could not have children had had on the couple's marriage. One of her first acts, on entering Downing Street, was to sack Chancellor George Osborne, which seemed to signal a clean break with the past. He would go on to get his revenge in his new, post-politics job as Evening Standard editor with a string of hostile front pages. To the surprise of many, she also rescued Boris Johnson's career by appointing him foreign secretary, a decision she may have come to regret when he quit the cabinet two years later in protest at her Brexit plans. She announced that her government would focus on the more neglected parts of Britain and try to help people on modest incomes who were ""just about managing"" - seen by some as a grab for traditional Labour territory. She had always insisted it was not in the national interest to seek a mandate of her own in a general election. Westminster was stunned, then, when on a quiet Tuesday morning in April a lectern was set up in Downing Street for a prime ministerial announcement. This video can not be played Watch Theresa May's full announcement, explaining her reasons for calling a snap election She would be holding a snap election after all, because, she said, the country needed certainty, stability and ""strong leadership"" following the EU referendum. Her change of heart had, apparently, come on a walking holiday in Wales, with husband Philip. With a commanding 20-point lead over Labour in the opinion polls, she saw an opportunity to ""strengthen her hand"" in the upcoming Brexit negotiations with Brussels. Despite her evident discomfort with personality politics, she was placed front and centre as the campaign headed out across the country. There was no mention of the Conservatives on the Theresa May battle bus There was an early mis-step as she was forced to do a U-turn on one of her key manifesto pledges - social care charges for the elderly in England. She had to cap the amount of money one individual could be asked to pay, following claims people would have to sell their homes. Ata testy press conference she insisted ""nothing had changed"". The Conservatives had underestimated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who came across on television as a more genial figure than the dangerous extremist that he had been painted by Tory MPs and their supporters in the press. Mrs May refused to take part in televised debates with him, and her attempts to project a more human side in interviews sometimes fell flat. She was mercilessly mocked on social media when she told an ITV interviewer the naughtiest thing she had done as a child was to ""run through fields of wheat"". Nevertheless, no-one seriously expected her to lose the election. The shock at Tory HQ, when the exit poll was announced, pointing towards a hung Parliament, with the Conservatives as the largest party but without an overall majority, rapidly turned to disbelief. But it turned out to be broadly accurate, unlike the opinion polls in the run up to election day. Mrs May had won the biggest share of the vote for the Conservative Party since Margaret Thatcher's 1983 post-Falklands election victory. But Labour had seen the biggest percentage increase in their vote since 1945, drawing in millions of anti-Tory voters from smaller parties, in a surprise return to two-party politics. The DUP's Arlene Foster agreed to help keep May in power after the election So instead of returning to Downing Street in triumph, Mrs May was forced tostrike a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs agreed to support her in key Commons votes, sweetened by a Â£1bn public spending boost for Northern Ireland. The DUP was staunchly Brexit-supporting and it would go on to play a pivotal role in the Brexit dramas she would face as she tried to get her withdrawal deal through Parliament. Mrs May had backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, although she was barely visible during the campaign. Downing Street aides had reportedly nicknamed her ""submarine May"" for her alleged habit of going missing when Mr Cameron wanted her public backing for the Remain campaign. Nevertheless, many Leave-voting Tory MPs suspected she did not believe in Brexit, and viewed it as a ""damage-limitation"" exercise at best. She did her best to dispel these doubts with her constant mantra ""Brexit means Brexit"" and her vow to deliver on the ""will"" of the people as expressed in the referendum. To the delight of Brexiteer colleagues, and the dismay of pro-Europeans, she set out a harder-than-expected vision for Brexit in a speech at Lancaster House in January 2017. This video can not be played Theresa May sets out her negotiation priorities for Brexit Three months later she triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, starting the formal two-year process to take Britain out of the 28-nation bloc. She stressed that Britain would be leaving the EU single market and customs union - and repeatedly declared that Britain would be prepared to walk away from talks with the EU without a deal. ""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" joined her list of favourite Brexit phrases, repeated ad infinitum. But negotiations in Brussels, led by Brexit Secretary David Davis, ran into the sand over the issue of how to prevent the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland. Hopes of striking a trade deal by Brexit day had also evaporated and there was now talk of a 21-month transition period, to allow more time for negotiations. The PM cut an increasingly frustrated figure on her trips to Brussels Things came to a head in July 2018 when the Cabinet met at her country retreat, Chequers, to hammer out a joint position on Brexit that would see the UK establish a ""common rulebook"" with the EU after Brexit. Within a few days of Mrs May announcing that she had full cabinet backing, Boris Johnson and David Davis had both quit saying this was not the Brexit they had been promised in her Lancaster House speech. She also had to endure the humiliation of seeing her Chequers deal publicly rejected - and mocked - by EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg, Austria. There was a brief respite from the grim Brexit grind in the autumn, when she shimmied on stage at the Conservative Party conference to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen. This video can not be played The Dancing Queen: Theresa May opens her 2018 conference speech It helped to dispel the memory of the previous year's conference speech, which had been one of the most disastrous on record, with letters falling off the slogan behind her, an interruption from a comedian and a hacking cough that threatened to derail it altogether. By now, Brexit had largely pushed all her other domestic priorities to one side, although the prime minister did agree a Â£20bn long-term funding settlement for the NHS. This video can not be played Five things that went wrong with Theresa May's 2017 speech In November 2018, she unveiled a draft EU withdrawal agreement, announcing, after a marathon cabinet meeting, that she had the backing of her top team, only to be faced with a string of resignations hours later. The withdrawal agreement, with an accompanying statement on future relations, was the best and only deal available, she said. And it would take the UK out of the EU in an ""orderly fashion"", with the minimum of disruption for businesses and citizens of EU countries in the EU as well as British expats in EU countries. But one clause, known as the Irish ""backstop"", was proving too much for the increasingly vocal and angry Brexiteer wing of her party, who feared the Remain-voting prime minister was betraying the 17.4 million who had voted to leave the EU. The backstop was meant to prevent the return of a ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland if no trade deal had been agreed by the end of the transition period but there was no time-limit on it and no way for the UK to halt it without the EU's say-so. Opposition to the backstop was led by the DUP and a previously obscure group of Tory backbenchers, the European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg. Mrs May had to get her deal through Parliament but her plans for a vote on 10 December were pulled at the last minute, when it became clear she would have suffered a heavy defeat. The prime minister survived a vote of confidence in 2018 Two days later, she faced an attempt to remove her as Conservative leader, and prime minister, in a no-confidence vote orchestrated by the ERG. Shesurvived by 200 votes to 117. But it was just the beginning of a seemingly never-ending cycle of political torture she would go on to suffer at the hands of her mutinous MPs. When she did eventually put her deal to a vote in the Commons, it was rejected by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a government in parliamentary history. A total of 118 Tory MPs defied orders and voted against the deal but all of them voted to keep her in No 10 24 hours later, when Labour tabled a vote of no confidence in her government. The Conservatives in Westminster had now splintered into a bewildering array of factions, from those who wanted to stop Brexit, via another EU referendum, to those who wanted a softer Brexit, to those who wanted the UK to leave without a deal at the earliest opportunity. The one thing that united them was dislike of Theresa May's deal. When she returned to the Commons with a slightly tweaked version of it, MPs rejected it again, by a reduced but still hefty margin of 149. Power was now visibly ebbing away from her, as her divided cabinet openly discussed alternatives to her deal and junior ministers resigned with such regularity that they barely made the news. Parliament was also flexing its muscles - MPs voted to reject a no-deal Brexit, something Mrs May had always insisted must stay on the table in negotiations with Brussels. She had to hold a Commons vote on delaying Brexit, something she had repeatedly insisted she would never do. And she had to rely on the votes of Labour MPs to get it through, after most of the Conservative contingent defied the whip. She then had to go to Brussels to ask for a delay to Brexit - another thing she had said she would never do - as MPs rejected her deal for a third time. Britain's departure date from the EU was written into UK law as 29 March - and Mrs May had insisted, more than 100 times according to some, that it would not change. Mrs May is the shortest-serving Conservative prime minister for more than 40 years She laid the blame for the delay squarely at the door of MPs, in a late evening speech from Downing Street, in which she tried to position herself as being on the side of the public who, she said, were ""tired of infighting and political games"" over Brexit. It proved to be another misjudgement, antagonising many of the MPs she was trying to persuade to back her deal and leading to accusations she was behaving like a demagogue. She had to climb down the following day, offering something close to an apology, as she announced the new timetable for Brexit that had been imposed on her by Brussels. In an attempt to negotiate a Brexit compromise that could pass muster in the Commons, she also reached out to Jeremy Corbyn. But six weeks of talks with Labour ended without an agreement, an outcome many Tory MPs said was depressingly predictable. A further humiliation followed when she had to agree to the UK participating in European Parliament elections - something she had previously said would be unacceptable. The Conservatives barely mounted a campaign to speak of, in contrast to Nigel Farage's boisterous new Brexit Party. With the party's European poll ratings dropping into single figures and would-be successors openly touting their leadership credentials, she made one final attempt to get MPs on side. She promised them they would get a binding vote on whether to hold another referendum during the passage of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and would also get to decide on different options for the UK's future customs arrangements with the EU. Brexit could be lost if her deal was rejected, she added. But by now many MPs had given up listening, having reached the conclusion that she was an impediment to the kind of Brexit they craved - or any kind of Brexit. Well and truly cornered, Mrs May finally had to accept she could not continue ""in the job she loved"" and her time in Downing Street - barring a brief transition period - was now over. ""I have done my best,"" she said, as she announced the resignation from behind a podium outside Number 10.

"Mothercare sales plunge as losses widenThe baby goods retailer says it is on a ""sounder footing"", even though UK sales fell nearly 9%.BusinessComments","Sales in the UK arm of baby goods retailer Mothercare plunged almost 9% last year as its losses widened to Â£87.3m. The firm said its sales had fallen following reduced consumer confidence after last year's restructuring. That led to it closing almost a third of its stores. It is now left with 79 and will develop its online sales. But boss Mark Newton-Jones said the firm was on a ""sounder footing"" after the sale of the Early Learning Centre. The results for the year to 30 March - delayed from Thursday - detail the attempt by the retailer to rebound from what it describes as last year's ""acute financial distress"". It underwent a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which allowed it to shut 55 shops in the space of a year,  rather than the four it would have taken without the CVA. It also sold the ELC to the Entertainer for Â£11.5m and its Watford head office for Â£14.5m. There was also a ""fracture in the relationship"" with the non-executive directors and directors, the company said. ""We remain determined to differentiate Mothercare as a textbook recovery case, in parallel demonstrating that boards can and should foster a greater alignment between their debt and equity providers,"" said chairman Clive Whiley. Even so, the results detail a worst-case scenario - of further falls in sales and margins - under which it could renegotiate its debt, which has been cut from Â£44m to Â£7m, Mr Newton-Jones  - who left last year, only to be rehired a little over a month later - said: ""Whilst this major restructuring activity has resulted in significant headline losses for the year, the business is now on a sounder financial footing."" The Â£87.3m of losses include Â£47.3m of costs associated with the restructuring, including store closures and 800 job losses, and the discontinued operations of the ELC. Losses in the previous financial year were Â£72.8m. Its shares rose 19% to 24p, although they traded at 245p in 2015. Like-for-like sales - stripping out the impact of store changes - fell 8.9% in the UK. Online sales were down 8% and store sales down 15.8% because of what Mothercare described as declining footfall and nervousness from suppliers during the restructuring. International sales, largely in China, India, Indonesia, the Middle East and Russia, fell 4.7% - less than the 5.9% a year earlier. Operations are also being expanded in Vietnam, where there are six stores, with three more to open. ""The next phase of our strategic transformation plan is to develop Mothercare as a global brand, maximising the opportunities we see across many international markets,"" said Mr Newton-Jones. Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, said that sales would have fallen because of the store closures, but added that Mothercare was a ""me-too"" type of business, with similar products to rivals. ""There are so many better competitors for baby care and children's clothes. Supermarkets are so strong, Next has got very strong children's range and on the nursery side, there is JoJo Maman Bebe and John Lewis,"" she said.

Even so, the results detail a worst-case scenario - of further falls in sales and margins - under which it could renegotiate its debt, which has been cut from Â£44m to Â£7m, Mr Newton-Jones  - who left last year, only to be rehired a little over a month later - said: ""Whilst this major restructuring activity has resulted in significant headline losses for the year, the business is now on a sounder financial footing."" The Â£87.3m of losses include Â£47.3m of costs associated with the restructuring, including store closures and 800 job losses, and the discontinued operations of the ELC. Losses in the previous financial year were Â£72.8m. Its shares rose 19% to 24p, although they traded at 245p in 2015. Like-for-like sales - stripping out the impact of store changes - fell 8.9% in the UK. Online sales were down 8% and store sales down 15.8% because of what Mothercare described as declining footfall and nervousness from suppliers during the restructuring. International sales, largely in China, India, Indonesia, the Middle East and Russia, fell 4.7% - less than the 5.9% a year earlier. Operations are also being expanded in Vietnam, where there are six stores, with three more to open. ""The next phase of our strategic transformation plan is to develop Mothercare as a global brand, maximising the opportunities we see across many international markets,"" said Mr Newton-Jones. Maureen Hinton, retail research director at GlobalData, said that sales would have fallen because of the store closures, but added that Mothercare was a ""me-too"" type of business, with similar products to rivals. ""There are so many better competitors for baby care and children's clothes. Supermarkets are so strong, Next has got very strong children's range and on the nursery side, there is JoJo Maman Bebe and John Lewis,"" she said. Added to that are the second-hand sales through online forums such as eBay, she said.

The Theresa May storyHow Brexit led to the downfall of the UK's second female prime minister.Election 2017,"Celebrating her elevation to the Tory leadership with husband, Philip Britain's second female prime minister, like the first, has ultimately been brought down by Conservative in-fighting over Europe. But Theresa May is unlikely to join Margaret Thatcher in the annals of leaders who left an indelible mark on their country. At least not in the way she might have wanted when she entered Downing Street in July 2016. Whatever ambitions she had - to reach out to the forgotten parts of the nation, or correct the ""burning injustices"" in British society - were overshadowed by a single word: Brexit. Her almost three years in office were entirely defined by Britain's decision to leave the European Union, and her increasingly desperate efforts to deliver on the outcome of the referendum called by her predecessor David Cameron. Even her sternest critics had to marvel at her ability to soak up the punishment that came, in wave after wave, from all sides. Theresa May to resign as prime minister Ministerial resignations and parliamentary rebellions that would have spelled the end for a prime minister in normal times seemed to bounce off her. She ploughed on, seemingly oblivious to the chaos around her, telling MPs ""nothing has changed"" and promising to deliver on the ""will"" of British people, even as her power over Parliament and control of her warring party drained away to nothing. It might have been different had she managed to win the 2017 general election. Theresa May takes part in a Q&A at a business in Leeds But instead of returning to Downing Street with a huge mandate of her own, as she had expected, she lost her Commons majority and had to rely on the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. She never really recovered from this self-inflicted wound, with a sense that many of her MPs were only keeping her in office until she had delivered Brexit before jettisoning her in favour of a more voter-friendly alternative. At one point, she had to promise she would quit before the next scheduled election in 2022, as she battled to win a no-confidence vote organised by her own MPs. And then, as the end neared - and she had alienated many MPs by blaming them for the deadlock over Brexit - she was forced, finally, to accept that the party, which had never elected her as leader, did not want her to serve any more. She offered her own departure as the final sacrifice to her internal critics, telling them she would stand down if they voted for her EU withdrawal deal. A venerable Tory colleague oncedescribed Theresa May as a ""bloody difficult woman"". She wore the label as a badge of honour. She was said to have a dry wit in private, but her public persona, even when she was trying to lighten up, could be wooden and forced, and even close colleagues were said to have difficulty working out what she was really thinking. Her single-minded, unshowy and diligent approach to politics enabled her to steadily navigate her way to the very top of a party that had traditionally favoured men from more privileged backgrounds than her own when she had first joined it in the late 1970s. And despite what it must feel like right now, Brexit will not be her only political epitaph. Theresa May married her husband Philip in 1980 Date of birth:1 October 1956 (aged 62) Jobs:MP for Maidenhead since 1997. Became prime minister in 2016 after serving as home secretary for six years. Education:Mainly state-educated at Wheatley Park Comprehensive School with a brief time at an independent school; St Hugh's College, Oxford Family:Married to Philip May Hobbies:Cooking - she says she owns more than 150 recipe books. Mountain-walking holidays with her husband.  On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2014, she chose Abba's Dancing Queen and Walk Like A Man, from the musical Jersey Boys, among her picks, alongside Mozart and Elgar. Shechose a subscription to Vogue as her luxury item, reflecting her lifelong love of high fashion. The daughter of a Church of England vicar, Hubert, who died from injuries sustained in a car crash when she was 25, Mrs May said her father had taught her to ""take people as you find them"" and ""treat everyone equally"". Born in Eastbourne, East Sussex, but raised largely in Oxfordshire, she attended a state primary, an independent convent school and then a grammar school in the village of Wheatley, which became the Wheatley Park Comprehensive School during her time there. The young Theresa Brasier, as she was then, threw herself into village life, taking part in a pantomime that was produced by her father and working in the bakery on Saturdays to earn pocket money. Friends recall a tall, fashion-conscious young woman who, from an early age, spoke of her ambition to be the first woman prime minister. In 1976, in her third year at Oxford University, she met her husband Philip, who was two years younger than her and president of the Oxford Union, a well-known breeding ground for future political leaders. They were introduced at a Conservative Association disco by future Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Both claim it was ""love at first sight"". They married in 1980. The young Theresa Brasier at a function in the village hall There are no tales of drunken student revelry from Mrs May's time at Oxford, but friends say she was not the austere figure she would later come to be seen as, suggesting she had a sense of fun and a full social life. After graduating with a degree in geography, May went to work in the City, initially starting work at the Bank of England and later rising to become head of the European Affairs Unit of the Association for Payment Clearing Services. Theresa May seen here as a child with parents Zaidee and Hubert She first dipped her toe in the political water in 1992, when she stood in the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, coming a distant second. Her fellow candidates in that contest also included a very youthful Tim Farron, who went on to become a Lib Dem leader. Two years later, she stood in Barking, east London, in a by-election where - with the Conservative government at the height of its unpopularity - she got fewer than 2,000 votes and saw her vote share dip more than 20%. But her luck was about to change. The Conservatives' electoral fortunes may have hit a nadir in 1997, when Tony Blair came to power in a Labour landslide, but there was a silver lining for the party and for the aspiring politician when she won the seat of Maidenhead in Berkshire, having beaten her future chancellor Philip Hammond to be selected as the candidate. It's a seat she has held ever since. Mrs May first stood for Parliament in 1992 in North West Durham An early advocate of Conservative ""modernisation"" in the wilderness years that followed, Mrs May quickly joined the shadow cabinet in 1999, under William Hague, as shadow education secretary and in 2002 she became the party's first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith. Shelaunched a drive to get more women selected,externalas Conservative candidates in winnable seats but antagonised the party's grass roots by telling them in a conference speech that they were still seen by some as ""the nasty party"" and had to change their ways. Some activists struggled to forgive her for that but it was an early sign of her willingness to deliver unpalatable home truths. As home secretary, she was booed offstage by angry officers at the Police Federation annual conference, after she had told them they should welcome her reforms and ""stop pretending"" they were being ""picked on"" by the government. After Iain Duncan Smith's brief, chaotic reign as Tory leader, Mrs May held a range of senior posts under his successor Michael Howard. But she was conspicuously not part of the ""Notting Hill set"" which grabbed control of the party after its third successive defeat in 2005 and laid David Cameron and George Osborne's path to power. Theresa May, back row, right, in the 1999 shadow cabinet She was initially appointed shadow leader of the House of Commons, but gradually raised her standing and by 2009 had become shadow work and pensions secretary. Nevertheless, her promotion to the job of home secretary when the Conservatives joined with the Lib Dems to form the first coalition government in 70 years was still something of a surprise - given that Chris Grayling had been shadowing the brief in opposition. The Home Office had proved to be the kiss of death for many a promising political career, but Mrs May refused to let this happen to her. Theresa May initially fell down the pecking order under David Cameron but worked her way back up She became the longest-serving occupant of the office in recent history, staying in the post for six years, and developing a reputation as a tough operator who would always fight her corner. Despite her liberal instincts in some policy areas, such as stop and search powers for the police, she frequently clashed with the then deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, particularly over her plan to increase internet surveillance to combat terrorism, dubbed the ""snooper's charter"" by the Lib Dems. After one ""difficult"" meeting with Mr Clegg, he reportedly told Lib Dem minister David Laws: ""You know, I've grown to rather like Theresa May... She's a bit of an ice maiden and has no small talk whatsoever - none. I have quite difficult meetings with her. Cameron once said, 'She's exactly like that with me too!'"" Crime levels fell and she successfully deported radical cleric Abu Qatada - something she listed as one of her proudest achievements, along with preventing the extradition to America of computer hacker Gary McKinnon. There was abitter public row with cabinet colleague Michael Govein June 2014 over the best way to combat Islamist extremism, which ended with Mr Gove having to apologise to the prime minister and Mrs May having to sack a long-serving special adviser. Mrs May faced constant criticism over the government's failure to meet its promise to get net migration down to below 100,000 a year, She persisted with this target when she entered Downing Street, even though she had never come close to meeting it and had faced repeated calls from Tory colleagues to drop it. Her decision to make life more difficult for illegal immigrants by restricting access to the NHS and accommodation - and vowing to ""deport first and hear appeals later"" - would also come back to haunt her when she became prime minister. The Windrush scandal - which saw Commonwealth citizens who had lived in the UK legally for decades being harassed and even deported because they did not have the correct paperwork - led to the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd, although the minister would later return to the cabinet after an inquiry blamed officials for the Windrush fiasco. Mrs May's taste in footwear has kept photographers interested for more than a decade She became Conservative leader and prime minister in July 2016 without a general election, following the resignation of David Cameron. Like Mr Cameron, she had been against Brexit but she cleverly managed to keep the Eurosceptics in her party on side during the referendum campaign by keeping a low profile. She reaped her reward byemerging as the unchallenged successor to Mr Cameron, as other potential rivals fell by the wayside - portraying herself as a steady pair of hands who would deliver the will of the people and take Britain out of the EU in as orderly a fashion as possible. At 59, she was the oldest leader to enter Downing Street since James Callaghan in 1976 and was the first prime minister since Ted Heath not to have children. Mrs May has rarely opened up about her private life although she revealed in 2013 that she had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and would require insulin injections twice a day for the rest of her life - something she said she had come to terms with and which would not affect her career. Mrs May promised an ambitious domestic agenda when she took office Shortly before becoming prime minister, in July 2016, she spoke tothe Mail on Sunday,externalabout the impact that being told they could not have children had had on the couple's marriage. One of her first acts, on entering Downing Street, was to sack Chancellor George Osborne, which seemed to signal a clean break with the past. He would go on to get his revenge in his new, post-politics job as Evening Standard editor with a string of hostile front pages. To the surprise of many, she also rescued Boris Johnson's career by appointing him foreign secretary, a decision she may have come to regret when he quit the cabinet two years later in protest at her Brexit plans. She announced that her government would focus on the more neglected parts of Britain and try to help people on modest incomes who were ""just about managing"" - seen by some as a grab for traditional Labour territory. She had always insisted it was not in the national interest to seek a mandate of her own in a general election. Westminster was stunned, then, when on a quiet Tuesday morning in April a lectern was set up in Downing Street for a prime ministerial announcement. This video can not be played Watch Theresa May's full announcement, explaining her reasons for calling a snap election She would be holding a snap election after all, because, she said, the country needed certainty, stability and ""strong leadership"" following the EU referendum. Her change of heart had, apparently, come on a walking holiday in Wales, with husband Philip. With a commanding 20-point lead over Labour in the opinion polls, she saw an opportunity to ""strengthen her hand"" in the upcoming Brexit negotiations with Brussels. Despite her evident discomfort with personality politics, she was placed front and centre as the campaign headed out across the country. There was no mention of the Conservatives on the Theresa May battle bus There was an early mis-step as she was forced to do a U-turn on one of her key manifesto pledges - social care charges for the elderly in England. She had to cap the amount of money one individual could be asked to pay, following claims people would have to sell their homes. Ata testy press conference she insisted ""nothing had changed"". The Conservatives had underestimated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who came across on television as a more genial figure than the dangerous extremist that he had been painted by Tory MPs and their supporters in the press. Mrs May refused to take part in televised debates with him, and her attempts to project a more human side in interviews sometimes fell flat. She was mercilessly mocked on social media when she told an ITV interviewer the naughtiest thing she had done as a child was to ""run through fields of wheat"". Nevertheless, no-one seriously expected her to lose the election. The shock at Tory HQ, when the exit poll was announced, pointing towards a hung Parliament, with the Conservatives as the largest party but without an overall majority, rapidly turned to disbelief. But it turned out to be broadly accurate, unlike the opinion polls in the run up to election day. Mrs May had won the biggest share of the vote for the Conservative Party since Margaret Thatcher's 1983 post-Falklands election victory. But Labour had seen the biggest percentage increase in their vote since 1945, drawing in millions of anti-Tory voters from smaller parties, in a surprise return to two-party politics. The DUP's Arlene Foster agreed to help keep May in power after the election So instead of returning to Downing Street in triumph, Mrs May was forced tostrike a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs agreed to support her in key Commons votes, sweetened by a Â£1bn public spending boost for Northern Ireland. The DUP was staunchly Brexit-supporting and it would go on to play a pivotal role in the Brexit dramas she would face as she tried to get her withdrawal deal through Parliament. Mrs May had backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, although she was barely visible during the campaign. Downing Street aides had reportedly nicknamed her ""submarine May"" for her alleged habit of going missing when Mr Cameron wanted her public backing for the Remain campaign. Nevertheless, many Leave-voting Tory MPs suspected she did not believe in Brexit, and viewed it as a ""damage-limitation"" exercise at best. She did her best to dispel these doubts with her constant mantra ""Brexit means Brexit"" and her vow to deliver on the ""will"" of the people as expressed in the referendum. To the delight of Brexiteer colleagues, and the dismay of pro-Europeans, she set out a harder-than-expected vision for Brexit in a speech at Lancaster House in January 2017. This video can not be played Theresa May sets out her negotiation priorities for Brexit Three months later she triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, starting the formal two-year process to take Britain out of the 28-nation bloc. She stressed that Britain would be leaving the EU single market and customs union - and repeatedly declared that Britain would be prepared to walk away from talks with the EU without a deal. ""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" joined her list of favourite Brexit phrases, repeated ad infinitum. But negotiations in Brussels, led by Brexit Secretary David Davis, ran into the sand over the issue of how to prevent the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland. Hopes of striking a trade deal by Brexit day had also evaporated and there was now talk of a 21-month transition period, to allow more time for negotiations. The PM cut an increasingly frustrated figure on her trips to Brussels Things came to a head in July 2018 when the Cabinet met at her country retreat, Chequers, to hammer out a joint position on Brexit that would see the UK establish a ""common rulebook"" with the EU after Brexit. Within a few days of Mrs May announcing that she had full cabinet backing, Boris Johnson and David Davis had both quit saying this was not the Brexit they had been promised in her Lancaster House speech. She also had to endure the humiliation of seeing her Chequers deal publicly rejected - and mocked - by EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg, Austria. There was a brief respite from the grim Brexit grind in the autumn, when she shimmied on stage at the Conservative Party conference to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen. This video can not be played The Dancing Queen: Theresa May opens her 2018 conference speech It helped to dispel the memory of the previous year's conference speech, which had been one of the most disastrous on record, with letters falling off the slogan behind her, an interruption from a comedian and a hacking cough that threatened to derail it altogether. By now, Brexit had largely pushed all her other domestic priorities to one side, although the prime minister did agree a Â£20bn long-term funding settlement for the NHS. This video can not be played Five things that went wrong with Theresa May's 2017 speech In November 2018, she unveiled a draft EU withdrawal agreement, announcing, after a marathon cabinet meeting, that she had the backing of her top team, only to be faced with a string of resignations hours later. The withdrawal agreement, with an accompanying statement on future relations, was the best and only deal available, she said. And it would take the UK out of the EU in an ""orderly fashion"", with the minimum of disruption for businesses and citizens of EU countries in the EU as well as British expats in EU countries. But one clause, known as the Irish ""backstop"", was proving too much for the increasingly vocal and angry Brexiteer wing of her party, who feared the Remain-voting prime minister was betraying the 17.4 million who had voted to leave the EU. The backstop was meant to prevent the return of a ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland if no trade deal had been agreed by the end of the transition period but there was no time-limit on it and no way for the UK to halt it without the EU's say-so. Opposition to the backstop was led by the DUP and a previously obscure group of Tory backbenchers, the European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg. Mrs May had to get her deal through Parliament but her plans for a vote on 10 December were pulled at the last minute, when it became clear she would have suffered a heavy defeat. The prime minister survived a vote of confidence in 2018 Two days later, she faced an attempt to remove her as Conservative leader, and prime minister, in a no-confidence vote orchestrated by the ERG. Shesurvived by 200 votes to 117. But it was just the beginning of a seemingly never-ending cycle of political torture she would go on to suffer at the hands of her mutinous MPs. When she did eventually put her deal to a vote in the Commons, it was rejected by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a government in parliamentary history. A total of 118 Tory MPs defied orders and voted against the deal but all of them voted to keep her in No 10 24 hours later, when Labour tabled a vote of no confidence in her government. The Conservatives in Westminster had now splintered into a bewildering array of factions, from those who wanted to stop Brexit, via another EU referendum, to those who wanted a softer Brexit, to those who wanted the UK to leave without a deal at the earliest opportunity. The one thing that united them was dislike of Theresa May's deal. When she returned to the Commons with a slightly tweaked version of it, MPs rejected it again, by a reduced but still hefty margin of 149. Power was now visibly ebbing away from her, as her divided cabinet openly discussed alternatives to her deal and junior ministers resigned with such regularity that they barely made the news. Parliament was also flexing its muscles - MPs voted to reject a no-deal Brexit, something Mrs May had always insisted must stay on the table in negotiations with Brussels. She had to hold a Commons vote on delaying Brexit, something she had repeatedly insisted she would never do. And she had to rely on the votes of Labour MPs to get it through, after most of the Conservative contingent defied the whip. She then had to go to Brussels to ask for a delay to Brexit - another thing she had said she would never do - as MPs rejected her deal for a third time. Britain's departure date from the EU was written into UK law as 29 March - and Mrs May had insisted, more than 100 times according to some, that it would not change. Mrs May is the shortest-serving Conservative prime minister for more than 40 years She laid the blame for the delay squarely at the door of MPs, in a late evening speech from Downing Street, in which she tried to position herself as being on the side of the public who, she said, were ""tired of infighting and political games"" over Brexit. It proved to be another misjudgement, antagonising many of the MPs she was trying to persuade to back her deal and leading to accusations she was behaving like a demagogue. She had to climb down the following day, offering something close to an apology, as she announced the new timetable for Brexit that had been imposed on her by Brussels. In an attempt to negotiate a Brexit compromise that could pass muster in the Commons, she also reached out to Jeremy Corbyn. But six weeks of talks with Labour ended without an agreement, an outcome many Tory MPs said was depressingly predictable. A further humiliation followed when she had to agree to the UK participating in European Parliament elections - something she had previously said would be unacceptable. The Conservatives barely mounted a campaign to speak of, in contrast to Nigel Farage's boisterous new Brexit Party. With the party's European poll ratings dropping into single figures and would-be successors openly touting their leadership credentials, she made one final attempt to get MPs on side. She promised them they would get a binding vote on whether to hold another referendum during the passage of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and would also get to decide on different options for the UK's future customs arrangements with the EU. Brexit could be lost if her deal was rejected, she added. But by now many MPs had given up listening, having reached the conclusion that she was an impediment to the kind of Brexit they craved - or any kind of Brexit. Well and truly cornered, Mrs May finally had to accept she could not continue ""in the job she loved"" and her time in Downing Street - barring a brief transition period - was now over. ""I have done my best,"" she said, as she announced the resignation from behind a podium outside Number 10.

"UK retail sales stall in AprilThe ONS said sales were flat in April, as clothing sales offset declines in other sectors.Business","Scottish shops are outperforming the rest of the UK Retail sales stalled in April, but warmer weather boosted sales of clothing, which offset falls in other areas of spending. The Office for National Statistics said sales in April were flat on March, and higher than the 0.3% fall expected. In the three months to April, sales increased by 1.8%, with a record quarter for the online sector. ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said three-month growth was strong, with warmer weather boosting sales. The data illustrated the changes taking place on the High Street. Sales from online-only retailers rose 9.4% over the three-month period - the highest three-month-on-three-month growth rate since records began, the ONS said, boosted by promotions and sales. ""Elsewhere, department stores continued to see their sales fall,"" Ms Murphy said. Department store sales fell by 0.5% and those in household goods stores declined by 2.9%. Energy bills push inflation to 2019 high UK economy rebounds in first quarter Compared with a year earlier, sales were up by 5.2% aftera 6.7% annual rise in March. The ONS said anecdotal evidence from retailers suggested warm weather in April boosted sales over the period, which included Easter, while economists said the figures showed Brexit was not having an impact on spending. ""April's retail sales figures are a timely reminder that political uncertainty is having no discernible impact on households' overall spending. The stability of volumes in April is a good result, following recent strong gain,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Admittedly, warmer-than-usual weather - average temperatures were 1.1C above their 1970-to-2018 April average - probably temporarily stimulated clothing sales,"" he added. Duncan Brewer, retail partner at management consultants Oliver Wyman, said sales were boosted  ""as consumers went out and spent money over the sunny holiday period"". But, he said, that contrasted to ""continued bad news from our ailing High Streets, which continue to be challenged by the shift to online. Retail used to be simple: consumers went to stores, browsed products, then bought what they wanted"". Consumer spending helped drive the economy in the first quarter of the year and economists look to the retail sales figures as one potential gauge for the impact on economic growth. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said sales volumes might have been weaker if retailers had not discounted over the Easter period and that growth could slow in the second quarter as household spending eased. ""And with other parts of the economy in no position to compensate, this supports our view that growth will moderate a little in [the second quarter] and remain sluggish for the rest of the year,"" she said.

Long journeys to court 'hit vulnerable',"Magistrates' court closures mean defendants, lawyers and witnesses can have long distances to travel Court closures have left vulnerable detainees at a greater risk of self-harm as they face long journeys in caged police vans, it has been claimed. There are now 14 magistrates' courts in Wales, down from 36 in 2010, and fewer police custody suites. A support worker said the situation was ""ludicrous"" and added to mental health problems. The Ministry of Justice said closure decisions were only taken when there was access to a reasonable alternative. David Morgan works as an ""appropriate adult"" - someone who officially assists children and vulnerable people who are suspected of a criminal offence. He said many people now faced long drives in caged police vans, and a considerable wait for a duty solicitor to arrive. ""Detainees have to travel long distances - some have mental health problems, a broad range of health problems, from anxiety, to depression, they're on the autistic spectrum, they could have PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), they could have drink or drug-related problems, and they're in the cells, some of them could have claustrophobia, and they self-harm,"" he said. ""The [magistrates and custody suites] are in the wrong areas, they're really impacting on people's lives."" As for custody suites: North Wales Police has mothballed two, relocated one, and permanently closed one South Wales Police has reduced its custody suites from 16 to four by closing some and relocating others Gwent Police numbers are unchanged, while Dyfed-Powys has closed one suite Katy Hanson is a duty solicitor whose firm Welch & Co is based in Cardigan, where the magistrates' court closed in 2011. She routinely makes a 40-mile journey to the nearest custody suite and magistrates' court in Aberystwyth. ""It's a good hour's drive. Public transport is two hours each way, and that causes issues not just for defendants or people attending the family court, it causes issues for people coming to court to be a witness,"" she said. ""It is often people who have limited income or who have difficulties that end up in the court system."" Meet Wales' shelf-stacking magistrate 'Severe shortage' of magistrates Court closures 'hitting magistrate numbers' Dr Daniel Newman, from Cardiff Law School, has been studying the impact of austerity on access to justice. ""I think it's emblematic of how these decisions are made in London: let's close the court in Pontypridd and expect you to go an extra 15 miles,"" he said. ""It might not be that far on a map, but to people already struggling it's a real expense they can't handle."" Virtually all criminal court cases start in a magistrates' court, and more than 90% will be completed there. Magistrates deal with less serious cases, such as motoring offences and minor assaults, and ""either-way"" offences such as theft or handling stolen goods which can be dealt with either by magistrates or before a judge and jury at the crown court. The HM Courts and Tribunals Service said it was investing Â£1bn to modernise the justice system, making it easier to use and providing better value for the taxpayer. ""We're moving more services online and the benefits are already being felt, with 150,000 users last year with high satisfaction rates,"" a spokesman said. ""To date, courts that have closed have either been underused, dilapidated or too close to another court. The decision to close a court is not taken lightly and only happens where there is access to a reasonable alternative and after the public have been consulted.""

PM's withdrawal bill delayed,"Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal bill will not be published or debated until early June, the government says. The prime minister is under pressure to resign following a backlash from her own MPs against her pledged ""new deal"" on Brexit. Andrea Leadsom quit as Commons Leader, saying she could not announce the bill which had ""new elements that I fundamentally oppose"". She has been replaced by Treasury minister Mel Stride. Downing Street has confirmed that the prime minister met Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid at No 10 on Thursday morning and would ""give full consideration their views"" about the bill. Mrs May hadtold the Commons,externalthat the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation needed to implement the agreement between the UK and EU - would be published on Friday so MPs would have ""the maximum possible time to study its detail"". This video can not be played Government delays Brexit bill publication Mrs Leadsom had been due to announce when it would be introduced to Parliament on Thursday, but resigned on Wednesday night. Standing in for her, government whip Mark Spencer told MPs: ""We will update the House on the publication and introduction of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on our return from the Whitsun recess."" He added that the government planned to publish the bill in the first week of June. ""We had hoped to hold second reading on Friday 7 June,"" he added. ""At the moment, we have not secured agreement to this in the usual channels. Of course we will update the House when we return from recess."" Second reading is when MPs get a first chance to debate legislation, before deciding whether it should proceed to detailed scrutiny. Responding for Labour, shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said: ""The prime minister has once again put her own political survival ahead of the national interest. ""It is clear that the prime minister does not command a majority in her approach to Brexit and she has failed to accept this political reality."" US President Donald Trump is due to make a three-day state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Asked who would be in 10 Downing Street when he arrives, Mr Hunt said: ""Theresa May will be prime minister to welcome him and rightly so."" It is possible for Mrs May to quit as Conservative leader before Mr Trump's visit, but continue as prime minister on a caretaker basis. Mrs Leadsom said on Thursday she had ""no doubts that I made the right decision"" adding: ""I felt I couldn't, in all conscience, stand up and deliver the business statement today with a Withdrawal Agreement Bill in it that I couldn't support elements of."" She did not answer questions about whether she was planning to run for the leadership. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. In a mini-reshuffle prompted by Mrs Leadsom's resignation, Mel Stride, who had been Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has replaced her as Commons leader. He has been replaced on the Treasury team by Jesse Norman, whose previous role as a transport minister has been filled by Michael Ellis. Rebecca Pow has been made a junior minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, replacing Mr Ellis. On Wednesday, members of the Conservatives' backbench 1922 Committee held a secret ballot on whether to change party rules, to allow the prime minister to face a vote of no confidence immediately. Mrs May is due to meet the chairman of the committee, Sir Graham Brady, on Friday. The results, in sealed envelopes, will be opened if Mrs May does not agree to stand down by 10 June. Mrs May survived ano-confidence vote of Conservative MPs in December.Under existing rules, she cannot be challenged again until December this year.

Organisers said more than a million people were expected to join the action in at least 110 countries on Friday. They are calling on politicians and businesses to take urgent action to slow global warming. The strikes are inspired by student Greta Thunberg, who has become a global figurehead since protesting outside Sweden's parliament in 2018. Carrying a ""school strike for climate change"" sign, the then 15-year-old said she was refusing to attend classes until Swedish politicians took action. This video can not be played The Swedish teen behind the climate strikes The solo protest led to various movements across Europe, the US and Australia, known as Fridays for Future or School Strike for Climate. The last co-ordinated international protest took place on 15 March, with an estimated 1.6 million students from 125 countries walking out of school. Sea level rise could be much larger than expected The schoolgirls seeking to save the world Climate change- Answers to your most asked questions The action on Friday began in Australia and New Zealand. In Melbourne, 13-year-old Nina Pasqualini said she was joining the strike because she was worried about ""weather disasters"". ""Every time we have huge a bushfire here another animal might go extinct,"" she told Reuters news agency. Organisers are expecting more than a million students around the world to walk out Australia just had its hottest summer on record and climate change is seen as the cause of the increasing frequency and severity of droughts, heat waves, floods and the melting of glaciers around the world. In 2018, global carbon emissions hit a record high and UN-backed panel on climate change last October warned that to stabilise the climate,emissions will have to be slashed over the next 12 years. Earlier this month, a UN report warned thatone million animal and plant species were now threatened with extinction. Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate claims? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Sophie Hanford, a national organiser in New Zealand, said Friday's strike was ""only the beginning"". The protesting students have vowed to continue boycotting classeson Fridays until their countries adhere to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which aims to prevent global temperatures from rising 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. As countries around the world woke up, the action spread. Strikes were held in Asian nations including India, Afghanistan Thailand and Japan. In Europe - where the movement first gained traction - images of mass strikes were shared on social media. ""Inaction equals extinction"" and ""save the world not your money"" read some of the placards on display. Greta Thunberg led a march in Stockholm on Friday Protesters in Brussels warned that time is running out to take action Students in Frankfurt were among those calling for policies to save the planet Climate protesters blocked the entrance to Norway's central bank, demanding that it stop investing in companies that burn coal Demonstrators in the Austrian capital said governments needed to act to ""stop climate change now"" In London, scores of protesters congregated outside parliament, chanting ""climate change has got to go"". ""Act now or burn later"" and ""change the system not the government"" read some of the signs held up by participants, as they called for urgent action. Student protesters want the government to reform the national curriculum to include more material on climate change. Organisers said strikes had been organised in about 125 towns and cities across the UK. Student protesters joined the global movement outside parliament in London Young people are calling on their governments to ""act now"" on climate change In an open letter published in Germany's SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung on the eve of Friday's strike, Ms Thunberg and prominent German climate activist Luisa Neubauer, 22, called on older generations to join the action in September. ""This is a task for all humanity. We young people can contribute to a bigger fight, and that can make a big difference.But that only works if our action is understood as a call,"",externalthey wrote. ""This is our invitation. On Friday, 20 September, we will start an action week for the climate with a worldwide strike. We ask you to join us...

The sick children swimming with mermaids,"Swimming is said to be Alannah's best option for exercise Two-year-old Alannah has a rare lung condition that means she cannot use public pools - but thanks to the work of one woman, she has been able to swim with mermaids. Alannah's condition means she has to have a 24/7 supply of oxygen and needs to be fed through a tube. She is unable to walk distances, and has to use a wheelchair. Each week, Alannah and her family make the 30-mile journey from their home in Boddam, Aberdeenshire, to Aberdeen to take part in special swimming sessions run by Love Rara. The experience with the mermaids and the swimming lessons that follow are free. Zara Grant, the company's managing director, and her mermaids donate their own time to children who are unwell. Staff who work on the mermaid swim donate their own time, and there is no cost for the families of seriously ill or disabled children ""It was a part of a lot of children's bucket lists to swim with the mermaids,"" Zara toldBBC Scotland's The Nine. ""That's why I first started it, so I could create these magical memories that parents can have forever. ""It allows children to come in and have memories or even just a day out at the pool with their family to have that normality while they're going through their treatment."" Zara undertook training as a swimming instructor so she would be able to safely work with the children in the water. Alannah is only able to get into a special area of the pool. Due to the oxygen supply that she needs constantly, she would be at risk if people pulled on her tube, so the area is closed to the public while Alannah is in the water. Watching Alannah swim, her mother Lauren Norris says: ""It's amazing to see, considering a couple of years ago we didn't think we'd ever get her in the water. It helps her a lot, she's getting exercise for her hyper-mobility. ""She can't go running or do gymnastics or dancing or other things kids her age can do, so I think swimming is the definitely the best option for Alannah."" The business has a number of donated dry suits that allow children like Eileidh to be able to swim safely The first sessions took place in 2017, after a child with cancer, Eileidh Paterson, made a bucket list when her illness became terminal. Swimming with mermaids was on it. ""It's obviously upsetting for Eileidh's family because she's passed but at least they have this memory now that they can keep forever,"" says Zara. ""It's really hard, because I do get close to the families. I used to see Eileidh a lot so you do get a really good connection with the children, but I look at the positives - the fact I got to give them those memories."" Alannah's family is grateful to Zara for the time they can now spend in the pool. ""The bond between Zara and Alannah is amazing. Zara goes above and beyond to make sure everything's safe for Alannah,"" says mum Lauren. ""It's amazing to see how far Alannah's come over the last two years. She's proved everyone wrong so far. I don't even think about half the things we do now. But when you look back a year ago, we struggled. ""We don't know what the future holds - if she's going to be on oxygen for the rest of her life, if she's going to be tube-fed for the rest of her life, if she's going to need a wheelchair for the rest of her life - we just don't know. ""We're just taking each day as it comes."" Alannah's mum Lauren blogs about her daughter's illness using a Facebook page, Alannah's Diary Call for joint effort to tackle St Giles Centre closure blow Snow warning extended following widespread disruption St Giles Centre closure: Locals cite 'scared staff' and 'little to no investment' Fresh plans for derelict Stonehaven gasworks could see affordable homes built near harbour St Giles closure would âtake the heart out of townâ Power cut affects town centre properties 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Making an emotional statement in Downing Street, Mrs May became tearful as she said serving as PM had been ""the honour of my life"". Attention has now turned to who will replace her, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt today becoming the latest MP to indicate he would stand. He joins declared candidates Boris Johnson, Esther McVey and Rory Stewart, with more than a dozen others also believed to be considering throwing their hats into the ring. The Conservative party says it hopes a new leader can be in place by the end of July - which is also when Sir Vince Cable wants tostep down as Lib Dem leader.

She says  ""as far as we can tell there is a large minority - not a majority - among that group for a no-deal Brexit."" ""The other members seem to be spread along the spectrum - but they are definitely to the right of Conservative MPs.

Jayne McCormackBBC News NI DUP leader Arlene Foster has told BBC Northern Ireland
she hopes the next Conservative leader has âan understanding of what makes the
DUP tickâ. She said Theresa May had discovered that âwhen you try to bounce
the DUP it simply doesnât workâ. Mrs Foster said the PM had fundamentally misjudged her party's position on Brexit throughout negotiations. Although the party has refused to be drawn on who it would
back as the next PM, Mrs Foster said the DUP would be âlistening carefullyâ to
leadership pitches in relation to how they view the Irish border backstop. The confidence and supply arrangement the DUP shares with
the Conservatives is due to expire next month. Mrs Foster dismissed suggestions that signing up to a
renewed agreement would damage the prospect of restoring devolution in Northern
Ireland. She also refused to be drawn on whether the DUP would seek
to exact a certain price in exchange for support â but said Mrs May
had recognised the importance of extra money for Northern Ireland, in the
absence of a devolved government â and added that she wanted to see money for
vital services reflected in any future DUP-Tory pact. BBC News ""Britain is in a state of paralysis,"" says the veteran Conservative politician Lord Heseltine The former deputy prime minister said: ""The domestic agenda has been frozen, the civil service is obsessed with coping with the uncertainty and British industry is reducing its investment plans. ""I don't see how you get out of that position without a general election or a second referendum."" Lord Heseltine was suspended from the Conservative parliamentary party earlier this week when he said he would be voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections. BBC political editor tweets...

Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry,  has told Sky News that a no-deal Brexit has ""never felt more likely"". She said: ""The compromise deal that was on the table has now evaporated and the clock is ticking. ""Businesses are looking at that date [31 October]. It is a new cliff edge. ""All of the issues we had before around the cost of tariffs, the challenges of no deal, remain. ""So, things have not changed for business."" Scottish National Party MP Ian Blackford - who is the party's Westminster leader - has told the BBC that Mrs May's resignation has been ""expected for some time"" - but that it now causes problems with regards to the Brexit timeline. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. ""The tragedy of all of this is that we're going to spend the next two months in an internal Tory leadership election,"" he said ""We'll have a new prime minister by the end of July, but of course Parliament then goes on recess. We're not going to come back until September, we're back for a couple of weeks, we're then back on recess again. ""We'll come back in the middle of October and we'll have very little time left to bring this whole Brexit chaos to a conclusion."" Asked about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit now being more likely, Mr Blackford added: ""Parliament would have to take its own responsibilities if that is the case and I would remind everyone that we have that option of revoking Article 50 and stopping this process. ""Leaving the EU with no deal would be absolutely disastrous."" The leader of Sinn FÃ©in has reacted to Theresa May's resignation. Speaking in Dublin, Mary Lou McDonald said: ""The chaos at Westminster cannot be allowed to distract from the very real threat that Brexit poses to Ireland."" She also said the deal agreed for the DUP to support Theresa May's minority government has had ""a negative influence on the political process"". And Mrs May came in for criticism from Sinn FÃ©in's leader for setting ""unrealisable red lines"" in the Brexit negotiations. BBC News Channel Former Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps says he thinks the contest to replace the PM will be between someone who voted Remain and someone who voted Leave. ""I think that's probably quite a good outcome for the party"", he says. He adds that he would guess the contest could come down to Remain-voting Jeremy Hunt facing down either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab, who were both Leavers. He says Mr Johnson ""looks a lot more serious as a candidate"" than after the Brexit referendum in 2016. Mr Juncker said he would ""equally respect and establish working relations with any new Prime Minister."" Theresa May's impending departure as prime ministerleaves EU leaders wondering how finishing the Brexit process will be affected. The race to be Conservative leader isn't the only show in town. Today, the Liberal Democrats have opened nominations for a new party leader after incumbent Sir Vince Cable confirmed he would be stepping down on 23 July. In an email to party members, he said the Lib Dems were ""in an excellent position"" to lead a ""powerful, liberal, green, and social democratic force in the centre ground of
British politics"". Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The resignation of Theresa May has clear consequences for the Conservative Party - the starting gun on a leadership contest has been fired. But what does it mean for Brexit? The short answer is that both No Deal and No Brexit are now both more likely. With Mrs May's ""bold new Brexit plan"" in tatters, there is no vehicle for leaving with the EU with a deal, and the default is that the UK's membership will expire on Halloween. Continue reading here. BBC News Channel Theresa May's former speechwriter, Chris Wilkins, says he thought the PM's statement in Downing Street this morning was a ""speech of two halves"". After a first part which recounted her ""greatest hits"" in office, he says the second half was more about her ""personal mission"" in politics. ""That was a much more personal and emotional section"", he says. ""Maybe if we'd heard a bit more of that over the past few years, then she might have done rather better - but of course Brexit simply drowned all of that out."" To help visualise the timetable of when we'll get a new PM, here's how it fits in to this summer's music festival schedule. The Conservative Party hopes a new leader could be in place by the end of July. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And does this mean Theresa May would be free to go to Boardmaster's, Cornwall's music and surf festival? Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The EU establishment, like everyone, marvelled at Theresa May's amazing ability to stay standing. ""If you're a lion tamer you're going to get bitten,"" said one diplomat this morning. They were grateful that she respected the rules of the negotiations and didn't rock the boat on other EU business. EU leaders would bolster her position when things got tough - a photo-op here, some complimentary words there. But they weren't prepared to compromise on the big one - the backstop to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - because they think it's already a compromise. They think it took her too long to realise - or admit - that the UK's economy required something that looked like a customs union. And they were amazed at her regular misreading of her own party and parliament. EU Brexit negotiators have been war-gaming potential replacements for weeks and the scenario that seems to have been considered most seriously is a Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for changes to the backstop that cannot be granted, and then blaming the EU. But there's been no formal discussion about what comes next. That will probably happen at a summit of leaders next week, supposedly about appointments to the EU's top jobs and now inevitably about Brexit. Speaking in Brussels, European Union Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said: ""I just want to express my full respect for Theresa May and for her determination in working towards an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom. ""And on our side we would work exactly in that direction in the next few weeks and months. Asked if a new prime minister could change things, he said: ""That it is for the UK to decide. Nobody else."" ITV political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no deal.â Our correspondent added that Mr Johnson is the person that ""everybody else has got to beat"". ""Why is that? Lots of Conservatives recognise his foibles and the downsides of Boris Johnson. ""But the thing that gets mentioned over and over again by Conservative MPs and Conservative activists is that they think, politically, he is someone who can beat Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, and can also beat Nigel Farage,the leader of The Brexit Party. ""They are the two prominent opponents for the Conservatives in the coming months and years, particularly if we head into a general election which might be tempting for a new Conservative prime minister who wouldn't have a majority in Parliament and wouldn't have anything that they can call their own as far as a mandate.

she hopes the next Conservative leader has âan understanding of what makes the

the DUP it simply doesnât workâ. Mrs Foster said the PM had fundamentally misjudged her party's position on Brexit throughout negotiations. Although the party has refused to be drawn on who it would
back as the next PM, Mrs Foster said the DUP would be âlistening carefullyâ to

to exact a certain price in exchange for support â but said Mrs May
had recognised the importance of extra money for Northern Ireland, in the

The Royal Mint says the George III sovereign was one of 3,574 to be struck in 1819 and there are around only 10 left in the world, It says the coin is being offered via a ballot on 12 July at the fixed price, reflecting its rarity and high quality. Potential purchasers will need to apply online before 28 June. They will also need to have their application approved before the winner is selected at random. The Royal Mint said the sovereign - minted in the year Queen Victoria was born - has been sourced and verified by its historic coin experts. Why the Mint stopped making 20p coins New Â£2 coin released to remember D-Day Samuel Pepys celebrated with new coin Nicola Howell, director of consumer business at the Royal Mint, said the coin was an ""incredible opportunity for those who want to own a piece of history"". She said: ""We know there are people in the UK and beyond who value such treasures."" The Royal Mint, based in Llantrisant, South Wales, is a company owned by the Treasury. It produces coins for circulation in the UK and overseas countries, as well as commemorative editions and investment products. Before it is sold, the 1819 sovereign will be on display at the Royal Mint Experience visitor centre in Llantrisant from 10 June.

US lays new charges against Assange,"Assange was arrested last month after spending seven years inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London The US justice department has filed 17 new charges against Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange, who is facing extradition from the UK. The latest charges accuse him of receiving and unlawfully publishing the names of classified sources. He was previously charged last month with one count of conspiring with ex-intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to the Pentagon network. Assange is serving a jail sentence in the UK for jumping bail. It was while he was on bail facing sexual assault allegations in Sweden that he sought asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012. He has always denied the accusations. The 47-year-old was arrested on 11 April after Ecuador abruptly withdrew his asylum, and later jailed for 50 weeks for skipping bail. The new indictment accuses Assange of violating the US espionage act,externalby publishing classified military and diplomatic documents in 2010. It said Assange had ""repeatedly encouraged sources with access to classified information to steal and provide it to Wikileaks to disclose"". Is he a campaigner or attention-seeker? A timeline of the Assange saga Once Manning started sharing such material, Assange, it said, encouraged her ""to continue her theft of classified documents and agreed to help her crack a password hash to a military computer"". Assange ""revealed the names of human sources and created a grave and imminent risk to human life"" - including the names of local Afghans, Iraqis, Chinese and Iranians. Many of the charges would carry jail terms of five to 10 years, meaning that he could face many decades in prison if convicted. This video can not be played Video footage shows Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy Wikileaks hit back after the announcement,external, tweeting: ""This is madness. It is the end of national security journalism and the first amendment,"" which guarantees free speech. What is unusual about the charges is that most cases involving the theft of classified information have targeted government workers and not the people who published it, correspondents say. Assistant Attorney General John Demers said the department took ""seriously the role of journalists in our democracy"" but that Assange was ""no journalist"". ""Indeed, no responsible act of journalism would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers,"" he added. Australian-born Assange is currently being held at Belmarsh prison in London. Swedish authorities are also seeking his extraditionafter reopening an investigation into a rape allegation against him made in 2010. The decision as to which of the two countries take precedence in their requests will be made by UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Mr Javid is under ""enormous pressure to protect the rights of the free press in the UK and elsewhere,"" Wikileaks said. Manning was found guilty in 2013 of charges including espionage for her role in leaking secret military files to Wikileaks, but her 35-year sentence was later commuted by then-President Barack Obama in 2017. Former military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has already served seven years in prison for her role in the leaks The leak was one of the largest breaches of classified material in US history. She is currently back in jailafter refusing to testify to a grand jury that is investigating Wikileaks. How likely is an Assange conviction in US?

SpaceX puts up 60 internet satellitesThe California firm launches the first spacecraft in its multi-billion-dollar broadband project.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played The Falcon-9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida The SpaceX company has begun the roll-out of its orbiting broadband system. A Falcon-9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida late on Thursday, packed with 60 satellites capable of giving users on the ground high-speed connections to the internet. Entrepreneur Elon Musk's firm aims eventually to loft nearly 12,000 spacecraft for its ""Starlink"" network. SpaceX is one of several commercial outfits with permission to fly an internet mega-constellation. Others include the UK-based start-up OneWeb, which began its roll-out in February with six operational spacecraft. Online retailer Amazon also has ambitions in this market. It's working on a 3,200-satellite proposal known as Project Kuiper. All the concepts envisage flying spacecraft in a low-Earth orbit less than 2,000km above the planet. This will minimise the delay, or latency, in the internet connections. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

SpaceX has kept secret much of the development activity on its multi-billion-dollar broadband plan. The company launched a couple of technology demonstrators, Tintin-A and Tintin-B, in February 2018, but the ""first production spacecraft"" that went up on Thursday look very different. These have a ""flat-pack"" design. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 Each satellite weighs 227kg, has multiple high-throughput antennas and a single solar array, the SpaceX CEO explained in a briefing last week. The platforms are also equipped with electric propulsion - a system that expels electrically charged atoms of krypton to provide thrust. The engine is needed to lift a Starlink from its drop-off altitude of 440km to its operational height of 550km. The propulsion system will also act to maintain the satellite's correct position in the sky, and to bring it down at the end of its service life. Mr Musk said the newly launched Starlinks were an iterative design and later platforms would have a higher specification, featuring for example inter-satellite links. It was ""one of the hardest engineering projects I've ever seen done,"" he said, and cautioned that much could go wrong in the early phases of the roll-out. There is increasing unease about the number of satellites that could be launched in the next few years - for many purposes, not just broadband delivery - and how this might potentially clog up the space environment. To give context to what is about to happen - there are just 2,000 operational satellites in orbit today,according to the Union of Concerned Scientists,external' database. SpaceX's ambitions alone, if fully realised, would dwarf this population. The great fear is that congested orbital highways will result in collisions and the production of debris that then initiates further destructive encounters. SpaceX said it intended to be a responsible actor and had given its satellites the ability themselves to track orbital debris and to autonomously avoid it. What is more, it added, all the Starlinks were 95% constructed from components that would burn up rapidly on re-entry to the atmosphere when decommissioned - exceeding all current safety standards. It will be some time before SpaceX can actually offer connections to the internet. For that it must launch many more than the 60 spacecraft on Thursday's Falcon. Six further rocket flights will have to take place before minor broadband coverage is achieved. A dozen launches are required for moderate coverage, says Mr Musk. He hopes ultimately that revenue from the telecommunications network can fund some of his other ideas: ""We think this is a key stepping stone on the way towards establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars and a base on the Moon.""

"Royal Mint selling rare coin for Â£100,000","An ""extremely rare"" 200-year-old gold sovereign is being sold by the Royal Mint for Â£100,000 - but collectors will hope their luck is in. The Royal Mint says the George III sovereign was one of 3,574 to be struck in 1819 and there are around only 10 left in the world, It says the coin is being offered via a ballot on 12 July at the fixed price, reflecting its rarity and high quality. Potential purchasers will need to apply online before 28 June. They will also need to have their application approved before the winner is selected at random. The Royal Mint said the sovereign - minted in the year Queen Victoria was born - has been sourced and verified by its historic coin experts. Why the Mint stopped making 20p coins New Â£2 coin released to remember D-Day Samuel Pepys celebrated with new coin Nicola Howell, director of consumer business at the Royal Mint, said the coin was an ""incredible opportunity for those who want to own a piece of history"". She said: ""We know there are people in the UK and beyond who value such treasures."" The Royal Mint, based in Llantrisant, South Wales, is a company owned by the Treasury. It produces coins for circulation in the UK and overseas countries, as well as commemorative editions and investment products. Before it is sold, the 1819 sovereign will be on display at the Royal Mint Experience visitor centre in Llantrisant from 10 June.

Facebook plans to launch crypto-currency,"Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg met Bank of England governor Mark Carney Facebook is finalising plans to launch its own crypto-currency next year. It is planning to set up a digital payments system in about a dozen countries by the first quarter of 2020. The social media giant wants to start testing its crypto-currency, which has been referred to internally as GlobalCoin, by the end of this year. Facebook is expected to outline plans in more detail this summer, and has already spoken to Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Founder Mark Zuckerberg met Mr Carney last month to discuss the opportunities and risks involved in launching a crypto-currency. Facebook has also sought advice on operational and regulatory issues from officials at the US Treasury. The firm is also in talks with money transfer firms including Western Union as it looks for cheaper and faster ways for people without a bank account to send and receive money. Facebook wants to create a digital currency that provides affordable and secure ways of making payments, regardless of whether users have a bank account. The social networking site, which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, is hoping to disrupt existing networks by breaking down financial barriers, competing with banks and reducing consumer costs. JP Morgan creates crypto-currency Facebook bans all crypto-currency ads Nicknamed Project Libra, Facebook's plans for a digital currency network werefirst reported last December,external. The project will see it join forces with banks and brokers that will enable people to change dollars and other international currencies into its digital coins. A small group of co-founders are expected to launch the Swiss-based association in the coming weeks. Facebook is also reportedly in talks,externalwith a number of online merchants to accept the currency as payment in return for lower transaction fees. Virtual currencies can be used to pay for things in the real world, such as a hotel room, food or even a house. Digital tokens are held in online wallets, and can be sent anonymously between users. Crypto-currencies run on blockchain technology. A blockchain is a ledger of blocks of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. This information is stored chronologically, can be viewed by a community of users, and is not usually managed by a central authority such as a bank or a government. The concept was designed to ensure security and anonymity for users, by preventing tampering or hijacking of the network. Facebook has come under fire in recent years over its handling of users' personal data, and regulators are likely to examine the launch closely. Earlier this month, the US Senate and Banking committeewrote an open letter,externalto Mr Zuckerberg questioning how the currency will work, what consumer protection will be offered and how data will be secured. Facebook has also discussed the process of identity checks and how to reduce money laundering risks with the US Treasury. It is believed that Facebook and its partners want to prevent wild swings in the coin's value by pegging it to a basket of established currencies, including the US dollar, euro and Japanese yen. It's not the first time Facebook has dabbled in digital currencies.  A decade ago, it created Facebook Credits, a virtual currency that enabled people to purchase items in apps on the social networking site. However,Facebook ended the projectafter less than two years after it failed to gain traction. The company will also have to navigate a myriad of regulations in the countries it wants to launch in. India, a rumoured target for Facebook, has recently clamped down on digital currencies. However, the biggest test is likely to be whether people will trust the social networking giant enough to start changing their cash for the digital coin. Facebook is in the initial phase of engaging with governments, central banks and regulators, and insiders admit that launching any crypto currency network by the start of next year is ambitious. Facebook, Western Union and the Bank of England declined to comment. The biggest attraction of digital currencies to banks and big firms is the technology that underpins them. Blockchain technology can help to slash the time and cost of sending money across borders by bypassing banking networks. Lord King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, warned two decades ago that central banks could become ""irrelevant"" if people started to use digital currencies as pounds and pennies are used today. Blockchain expert David Gerard said that Facebook would gain access to valuable spending data by creating its own payment system. However, he questioned why the social media giant needed to mint its own crypto-currency to harvest that data. Instead, he said, Facebook could create a platform like PayPal, which allows users to transfer traditional currencies. Crypto-currencies are vulnerable to fluctuations in value, which Gerard said could create a barrier to the success of Facebook's so-called GlobalCoin. ""Normal people don't want to deal with a currency that's going up and down all the time,"" he explained. But Garrick Hileman, a researcher at London School of Economics, said the GlobalCoin project could be one of the most significant events in the short history of crypto-currencies. Conservatively, he estimated that around 30 million people use crypto-currencies today. That compares to Facebook's 2.4 billion monthly users.

Your climate change questions - answered,"During the last worldwide school strikes in March, BBC News asked for your questions on climate change. Since then, thousands of you have been talking to ourclimate change chatboton Facebook Messenger. Below are some of the topics that came up many times - with some answers from science and our climate team. You can chat to our climate bothere,external. Humans are already adapting. In South Korea,farmers are growing different cropsto future-proof themselves against changing temperatures. London's Thames Barrier was designed to help the city deal with an increasing risk of flooding. And the United Nations has made adaptation a key part of its strategy, alongside measures to curb rising global average temperatures. Under the Paris climate agreement, richer countries have agreed to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to help them adapt. Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact. Cutting these from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds,according to one Oxford study,external. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Beef and lamb have a big environmental impact, as the digestive systems of livestock produce methane - a powerful greenhouse gas. The UN says we need to eat more locally-sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away. How and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have very different impacts. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more emissions than cows reared on natural pastures. Lots. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the world cannot meet its emissions targets without changes by individuals. It says: Buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter and more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away Change how you get around. Drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances. Take trains and buses instead of planes Use video-conferencing instead of business travel Use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer Insulate homes Demand low carbon in every consumer product Research reported by the IPCC alsosaid,externalpeople tend to overestimate the energy-saving potential of lighting, and underestimate the energy used to heat water. It also says people don't think a lot about the energy used for the creation of products they buy. In 2013, the governmentset out plansfor a consistent ""traffic light"" food labelling system to help people easily understand what's in their food. But we don't have a similar system for the carbon footprint or environmental impact. It would involve considering things such as air freight versus importing food by sea, the use of water in food production, as well as the impact on land and forests. Tesco did try it in 2007 - it started calculating the carbon footprint of every one of its 70,000 products. But five years later the supermarket gave up, saying it was ""a minimum of several months' work"" for each product. In 2007, Walkers Crispswas the first,externalUK firm to put carbon footprint figures on its products. But the company confirmed to the BBC that it has since removed them. Human-induced climate change is happening. Andthe UN estimates,externalthe world has added approximately one billion humans since 2005. But depending on where in the world you live - and your lifestyle - a person's emissions can be very different. Generally, people living in countries like the UK depend heavily on fossil fuels. According toone study,external, having one fewer child is the single most effective thing you can do to reduce your emissions. But this result is contentious and leads to many philosophical and ethical questions which we're not going to wade into here. Like, if you are responsible for your children's emissions, are your parents responsible for yours? Individual governments are choosing to tackle climate change in various ways. But the one thing that has pulled the world together is the Paris agreement. What is in the Paris climate agreement? 'Trump effect' threatens Paris agreement The deal has united nearly 200 countries in a single agreement on tackling climate change for the first time ever. Nations pledged to keep global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. However, scientists point out that the agreement must be stepped up if it is to have any chance of curbing dangerous climate change. Global temperatures rises are generally compared to ""pre-industrial times"". Many researchers define that as 1850-1900 - before the world was chugging out greenhouse gases on a global scale. The world is now about 1C warmer than it was back then, according to the IPCC. For decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts. But scientists now argue that keeping below 1.5C is a far safer limit for the world. What does 1.5C mean in a warming world? It's hard to know much hotter the world will get. But if current trends continue,the World Meteorological Organization saystemperatures may rise by 3-5C by 2100. Covering climate change and its impact on people around the world is a top priority for BBC News. We know climate change is an increasingly important subject. Younger audiences in particular tell us they would like to see more journalism on the issue, the BBC says. There has been a significant increase in the number and range of stories across our output. This includes prominent coverage of the latest scientific research, extreme weather events, climate protests, how climate change is affecting people's lives and the search for solutions to this enormous global challenge. These stories are resonating with our audiences and it is a subject we are committed to covering in depth across BBC News. Being climate conscious can often feel very expensive, from changing your food habits to buying an electric car. But there are some things that will save you money - like eating wonky vegetables instead of red meat and cycling to work instead of driving. AndÂ making your home more energy efficient should actually bring down your bills.
