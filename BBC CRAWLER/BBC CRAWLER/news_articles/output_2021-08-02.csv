Fighting rages as Taliban attack key Afghan city,"Afghan government forces are battling the Taliban in three key cities Ferocious fighting is taking place in a major Afghan city, amid fears it could be the first provincial capital to fall to the Taliban. Lashkar Gah in southern Helmand province is under heavy assault from the militants, despite persistent US and Afghan air strikes. The Taliban are said to have seized a TV station. Thousands of people fleeing rural areas took shelter in buildings. ""There is fighting all around,"" a doctor told the BBC from his hospital. Hundreds of Afghan reinforcements have been deployed to battle the militants.The Taliban have made rapid advancesin recent months as US forces have withdrawn after 20 years of military operations in the country. Helmand was the centrepiece of the US and British military campaign, and Taliban gains there would be a blow for the Afghan government. If Lashkar Gah fell, it would be the first provincial capital won by the Taliban since 2016. It is one of three provincial capitals under attack. An Afghan military commander in the city warned that a Taliban victory would have a ""devastating effect on global security"". ""This is not a war of Afghanistan, this is a war between liberty and totalitarianism,"" Maj Gen Sami Sadaat told the BBC. On Monday, the Afghan information ministry announced that 11 radio and four television networks in Helmand province had stopped broadcasting due to what it described as Taliban ""attacks and threats"". Attempts by the militants to captureKandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, have continued after rocket strikes hit its airport on Sunday. Seizing control of Kandahar would be a hugely symbolic victory for the Taliban, giving them a grip on the south of the country. In a third besieged city,Herat, in the west, government commandos are battling the insurgents after days of fierce fighting. Government forces have taken back some areas after a UN compound was attacked on Friday. Videos shared on social media appeared to show residents on the streets and rooftops of Herat shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is greatest"") in support of the government's gains. As government forces struggled to contain Taliban advances, President Ashraf Ghani blamed the sudden withdrawal of US troops for the increase in fighting. ""The reason for our current situation is that the decision was taken abruptly,"" he told parliament. Mr Ghani said he had warned Washington that the withdrawal would have ""consequences"". Although nearly all its military forces have left, the US has continued its air offensive in support of government troops. Strikes targeting Lashkar Gah continued late on Monday. President Biden's administration announced on Monday that because of the increase in violence, it wouldtake in thousands more Afghan refugees who worked with US forces. The US and UK have accused the Taliban of committing possible war crimes by ""massacring civilians"" in a town captured near the Pakistan border. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had seen reports of ""deeply disturbing and totally unacceptable"" Taliban atrocities. Gruesome videos that emerged from Spin Boldak apparently showed revenge killings. The Taliban have rejected the accusations.

Goldman raises pay after 95-hour week complaint,"Xavier Rolet, a former banker at Goldman Sachs, led the London Stock Exchange for eight years Goldman Sachs has increased its salaries for younger bankers following complaints of long working hours. It is understood that first-year investment bank analysts globally will get a pay rise this year to $110,000 (Â£80,000) from a previous $86,000. As first reported in the Financial Times,external, the pay increase does not include bonuses. Basic pay will rise to $125,000 in the second year. It comes as a top banker criticised recruits for being ""entitled"". Xavier Rolet, who ran the London Stock Exchange for eight years, said the younger generation of bankers should stop complaining about long working hours or find another job. He suggested banks should hire ""poor hungry kids who managed to put themselves through college"" instead of ""entitled"" graduates. Mr Rolet, who worked at Goldman Sachs in New York and in London early on in his career,said on LinkedIn,externalthat he would regularly work 130 hours a week, seven days a week in the 1980s. He claimed: ""We'd work the whole New York trading day in the office, have dinner on the desk then trade Asia and Tokyo from 8:00pm until 10:00pm, go home during the half-day recess and trade the Tokyo afternoon session from home from 12:00pm to 2:00am. ""Grab some shut-eye until 4:00am to put our orders in the European markets in time for the openingâ¦ quick commute to 40 Wall to be in the office by 6:30am to continue to trade our European orders in time for the pre-opening in New York. Tokyo was open on Saturdays and half day every other Sunday in those days."" This year, a group of young Goldman Sachs bankers complained of 95-hour working weeks and and asked for theirworking week to be capped at 80 hours. They said conditions were ""inhumane"". Goldman Sachs, which recently reported a sharp rise in second quarter revenue, has declined to comment on the pay increases. Long working hours killing 745,000 people a year, study finds Working from home: Call to ban out-of-hours emails from bosses In February, a group of 13 first year US-based investment banking analysts at Goldman Sachs, provided apresentation to management,externalwhich commented on working conditions. ""The sleep deprivation, the treatment by senior bankers, the mental and physical stressâ¦ I've been through foster care and this is arguably worse,"" said one. Another remarked: ""This is beyond the level of 'hard-working', this is inhumane/abuse."" However, Mr Rolet asked people on LinkedIn: ""How many single working mothers trying to put several kids through school do you think work less than 130 hours a week?"" Earlier this year, the young Goldman Sachs bankers warned that they would have to leave unless conditions improved. But Mr Rolettold Financial New,externals: ""It's a free world. If you don't love what you're doing or think the hours don't suit your lifestyle, by any means do something else."" He added: ""Junior bankers are paid very well compared to other industries or sectors: ask a young entrepreneur drawing no salary how they would like to make $100,000-plus straight out of college?"" Commenting his own experience at Goldman Sachs in the 1980s, he said: ""Pay was good for a broke kid from a Parisian sink estate."" Mr Rolet grew up in Algiers - his father was in the military - and near Paris in an impoverished area called Sarcelles, which he described to the Evening Standard as ""concrete, concrete, concrete, everywhere you looked"". After a long career in finance, Mr Rolet led the LSE from 2009 until 2017 and he is currently chairman of PhosAgro, a Russian fertiliser company. What are the new working from home rules?

Families reunited as quarantine rules relaxed,"This video can not be played Covid: US family reunited with Scottish relatives after 20 months Families have been reunited as restrictions are eased on fully-vaccinated visitors from the EU and US arriving in Scotland. People who have been double-jabbed in the EU and US no longer have to quarantine. The change, which began at 04:00, affects those arriving from countries on the amber list - except France. The Scottish government said it was possible due to the success of the vaccine roll-out. However, people are still being urged to ""think very carefully about whether your trip abroad is necessary"" before they travel. There were emotional scenes at Glasgow Airport, just hours after the restrictions were eased. First people arrive in UK after travel rules eased Elaine Burt, 55, a senior nurse with the NHS, was waiting for her sister and nephews to arrive from Boston, USA, for their first meeting in 20 months. After the reunion Ms Burt, from Newton Mearns, said: ""It was an absolute relief, it just felt as if it was never going to happen and it's just the best present ever. ""We never thought it was going to happen with all of the different restrictions, but we left it to the last minute to see what was possible."" Her sister Michelle Bolger, 50, and her nephews Kaie, 17, and Taran, 12, who were all double vaccinated in the US, were visiting Scotland to spend time with her mother Jean, who has been unwell. Ms Bolger said: ""It's been so long. It's been really hard, but we're here, we made it. ""We booked the flight just a week past Monday. It's been a rollercoaster trying to get here. ""We still have to test on day two but it's great, absolutely amazing, I didn't think I would see this day."" There were emotional scenes at Glasgow airport as families were reunited Another person enjoying isolation-free travel was Colin Morton, 56. The engineer, who moved to Italy in his mid-20s and had both his vaccinations in Italy, said he had returned to Scotland to visit his mother, who has been unwell. He said: ""My mother and father live here and they are both elderly and my mother has been unwell, so I'm looking forward to being able to see her. There would have been no point coming if I had to quarantine."" Meanwhile, among those looking forward to visiting Scotland without having to quarantine is avid golfer Bill Luyk, from Michigan, USA. He said he felt like ""a four-year-old on Christmas morning"" thinking about his forthcoming trip. Mr Luyk told BBC Scotland: ""Golfers in the US are just chomping at the bit to play the courses we're going to play. ""We're really, really looking forward to it and hopefully things will remain open."" Under thenew rules,external, people who were fully vaccinated in the following countries will not have to isolate for 10 days on arrival in Scotland: UK EU member states (except France) Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City USA People travelling from amber list countries will need to show a negative test before departure and produce a negative PCR test result on day two after arrival. And they will have to show either the EU Digital Covid Certificate or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's white card -  known as a CDC card - to prove they are fully vaccinated. The change does not apply to people who have been in France in the 10 days prior to their arrival, due to concerns over the Beta variant. Julie Clarke lives in Prague in the Czech Republic and will fly into Edinburgh on Monday night. Before the pandemic the teacher would return to Scotland up to seven times a year to visit her mother, who is disabled and housebound. But she has only been home once the UK went into lockdown in March last year, and said the restrictions have led to a ""lot of frustration"". Ms Clarke told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""It was very stressful. I went in December. Amsterdam shut their entry to Scotland, I then had to go to London. Czech Republic then shut to London, I then had to fly to Poland. Took me 23 hours to get home."" She added she is ""very excited"" about her flight which she booked last Wednesday - the day before the new restrictions were announced. Ms Clarke said: ""I've been double vaccinated since April and have the same vaccinations as many of my family and friends in Scotland and was very frustrated I couldn't travel."" But she can only stay for a week so she is safe to return to school for the new term. The teacher said: ""I want to keep myself safe, the children safe, my colleagues at work safe so I'm more than happy if I have to quarantine when I get back here."" The change to the rules has been largely welcomed by the travel industry with Karen Musgrave, of Barrhead Travel, describing the move as ""really positive"". She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland: ""We have definitely seen pent up demand released over the last couple of weeks, particularly when we had the news that the fully vaccinated travellers did not have to quarantine when coming back from amber destinations. ""We are also seeing more confidence for further out in the year, so October school holidays and getaways over Christmas and new year are proving really popular just now as well."" What are the latest rules for summer holidays abroad? Do I need a vaccine certificate to travel? Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean Karen Dee, of the Airport Operators Association, said she would like to see the UK and Scottish governments go further. Asked about the advice that people should only go abroad if they have to, she said: ""It is a bit confusing and, from our perspective, very damaging particularly given the vaccination roll out and the success of that in the UK. ""We would have expected, I think, to have seen us opening up more quickly than others to take advantage of the benefits we have had. ""That has not been the case and we are lagging behind many countries in Europe who are opening up more quickly despite not having so many people vaccinated.""

Professor of public health at Edinburgh University Linda Bauld said she does not think the new rules will lead to a spike in case numbers. She said: ""This is about parity. People can already travel from the UK to other countries and come back if they have had vaccines here. ""There was a lot of concern about the fact that we were not recognising other countries' vaccination programmes to this is really that shift."" Prof Bauld also cautioned against the removal of the travel testing regulations and said the current system provides ""reassurance"". RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

NHS Covid-19 app tweaked to notify fewer contacts,"This video can not be played 'Fewer will be contacted' by NHS Covid-19 app The NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales is being tweaked so fewer contacts will be advised to self-isolate following a close contact with a positive case. The app will look for contacts two days prior, rather than five, when someone without symptoms tests positive. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it would reduce disruption but still protect those at risk. The government is urging the public to continue using the app. It comes as the UK recorded another 21,952 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, compared to 24,950 cases last Monday. Another 24 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, higher than the 14 recorded on the same day last week. What's changing on the NHS Covid app? What are the latest changes to the Covid rules? Almost 700,000 alerts were sent by the app to users in England and Wales for the week to July 21, a record since it was launched, which has caused staffing issues in many industries. It led to the government allowing some key workers -such as those working in food distribution- to be exempt from having to self-isolate if pinged. Instead they have to take daily tests. There had been speculation that the app could bemade less sensitiveto the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes. But the DHSC said the update ""does not impact the sensitivity of the app, or change the risk threshold"". There was speculation when Sajid Javid became the new health secretary just as the word ""pingdemic"" was entering the language that he would order changes to make the app less sensitive. That was ruled out - but it seems Mr Javid asked what else could be done and was advised that the option unveiled on Monday would be wiser. Cutting the period the app hunts back through the close contacts of an asymptomatic person before a positive test from five days to two could mean a substantial fall in the numbers sent into isolation. There has been huge pressure for change from businesses which have seen their operations disrupted by thousands of pings - but at the same time the team behind the app believes it now has strong evidence that it is working. The government will hope it has found a middle way, reducing the burden on businesses and making it less likely that people will delete the app while still alerting those in most danger of becoming infected with the virus and passing it on. But, as with so much about this project, this is an experiment in human behaviour because for the app to work, people have to trust it. Announcing the change, Mr Javid said: ""We want to reduce the disruption that self-isolation can cause for people and businesses, while ensuring we're protecting those most at risk from this virus. ""This update to the app will help ensure that we are striking the right balance."" Dr Jenny Harries, of the UK Health Security Agency, said the app was ""the simplest, easiest and fastest way to find out whether you have been exposed to the virus,"" and it had saved thousands of lives. She said she would ""strongly encourage everyone, even those fully vaccinated, to continue using the app"". It is unclear how many people will be affected by the tweak. Scientists have estimated the app prevented up to 2,000 cases per day in the three weeks to 21 July when the number of self-isolation alerts - known as ""pings"" - rose by over 70,000 toa new record of 689,313. And their analysis, which assumed 60% compliance with instructions to self-isolate, suggested another 50,000 Covid cases were prevented by including chains of transmission. This was estimated to have prevented 1,600 hospitalisations, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Around 40% of the eligible population regularly use the app and around 50% of all reported tests are being inputted, it said, saying usage remains ""high"". Labour's shadow health minister Liz Kendall accused the government of ""leaving hundreds of thousands of people forced to self-isolate every day"" and quietly changing the app, rather than driving infections down. Trade union Unite said the change did not go far enough and repeated a call from the automotive and steel sectors for workers to be exempt from self-isolation rules. But the move has been welcomed by the British Beer and Pub Association, which said its research found up to 1,000 pubs had been forced to close temporarily due to staff being pinged by the app. Its chief executive Emma McClarkin said: ""On average, each pub forced to temporarily close due to staff being pinged costs Â£9,500 in lost trade per week and our larger venues much, much more at a critical time in their recovery."" From 16 August, fully vaccinated contacts in Englandwill be exempt from isolationand instead will be advised to take a PCR test. Those who are not fully vaccinated will still be required to isolate, and it will remain a legal obligation to isolate if you test positive. On 7 August, Wales will become the first UK nation tostop asking fully vaccinated adults to self-isolateafter close contact with a positive Covid case. Meanwhile, a further 118,184 people received their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine on Sunday, meaning nearly 38.5 million people - or 72.7% of the UK population - are now fully vaccinated. But just 21,266 people received first doses, as the numbers coming forward for vaccination continued to slow down. A total of almost 46.9 million people, or 88.6% of adults, have had at least one jab.

What's changing on the app?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

PM defends approach to international travel,"Boris Johnson says the government wants a ""balanced approach"" to travel, but warns the UK must try to stop new Covid variants being imported from abroad. Responding to speculation about a new amber watch-list of nations that could join the red list at short notice, he said he wanted advice to be ""simple"". Mr Johnson said he understood ""people care very much about their holidays"" but that Covid remained ""dangerous"". The next update to the travel list system is due on Thursday. During a visit to Airbus in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, the prime minister said: ""On travel, we have had to balance it because of the anxiety that I think a lot of people have - I have - about importing new variants, bringing back the disease. ""We also have to recognise that people want, badly, to go on their summer holidays, we need to get the travel industry moving again, we need to get our city centres open again and so we want an approach that is as simple as we can possibly make it."" Boris Johnson spoke to reporters during a visit to Airbus in Stevenage Tory MPs have raised concerns about the prospect of a so-called amber watch-list. Under current rules people who were fully vaccinated in the UK, US, EU (except France) or Switzerland do not have to isolate for 10 days when arriving from amber list countries. But people coming to the UK from red list countries are required to isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel regardless of their vaccine status.

Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that the potential new travel category would ""be viewed as a massive red flag"" that would ""likely"" cause bookings to those countries to ""collapse"". Asked about the possibility of a new watch-list Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds told Times Radio the opposition did not want to see ""additional confusion and chaos"" and that the government needed to be ""open and transparent"". But government minister Matt Warman defended the idea of travel watch-lists, telling Sky News that warnings over potential quarantine changes gave people ""really important information when they're making significant financial decisions"". Airline bosses had welcomed a change in rules, which came into force earlier on Monday, but said the UK aviation sector was not on the path to recovery ""due to the continued restrictions that are being imposed on international travel"". In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps they called for more countries to be added to the green list, saying that countries should be green by default. Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the UK's current travel rules were ""still quite complicated"" and needed to be simplified to make it easier for people to travel, as well as reducing some of the extra costs. He said the requirement for everyone to have a PCR test could be reduced to a ""cheaper lateral flow test as a first line of defence"". On Monday, the UK reported 21,952 new Covid cases while a further 24 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test as of Sunday.

What's changing on the NHS Covid app?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external.

LiveLiveFamilies reunite as UK travel rule change kicks in6 minutes ago,"The NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales is being tweaked so fewer contacts of a positive case will be advised to self-isolate Health Secretary Sajid Javid says this will reduce self-isolation disruption and protect those at risk Travel rule changes mean people fully vaccinated in the US or EU no longer have to isolate when arriving in the UK from an amber list country However, those coming from France will still have to quarantine due to concerns over the circulation of the Beta variant Travel bosses and MPs have criticised plans for a so-called amber watchlist of countries, which could then move to the red list at short notice Network Rail says tests have found no traces of Covid-19 in swabs and air samples of four major railway stations and intercity train services A fresh Covid outbreak in China has spread to more locations, raising concerns over the country's vulnerability to the Delta variant The UK reported 21,952 new Covid cases on Monday as well as a further 24 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Lauren Turner That's all from us today. We'll be back with more live news from the pandemic tomorrow morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Lauren Turner, George Bowden, Hamish Mackay, Hazel Shearing, Alexandra Fouche, Laurence Peter and Joseph Lee. There were emotional scenes at Heathrow Airport as travel restrictions were eased and loved ones reunited We're bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. But before we go, here's a look back at some of today's main stories:  A Pfizer vaccination in Madrid Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have raised
the prices of their Covid vaccines delivered to the EU, France says, confirming
an earlier Financial Times report. Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune said the two
pharma firms had had to adapt their vaccines to the new variants, so ânot just
for the European Union, but for all the buyers itâll be a bit more expensiveâ. He was speaking on French radio. Last week the EU said 57% of the
blocâs adult population had been fully vaccinated. More than 455m doses have
been administered in the EU. The EU is co-ordinating vaccine
purchases for the 27 member states. It has not disclosed how much it is paying
for the doses. But the FT said the new price for
a Pfizer dose was â¬19.5 (Â£17; $23), against â¬15.5 previously. And a Moderna dose
would cost â¬21.5, against â¬19 previously. Contractually they are the
biggest vaccine suppliers to the EU: Pfizer has pledged 600m doses and Moderna
460m. The EU is also vaccinating with Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen
(Johnson & Johnson).  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There are now clear signs that the number of people being admitted into hospital with Covid has started falling in England following the drop in detected cases. Infections have been falling for well over a week. But there is always a lag between a change in cases and hospitalisations as it tends to take a week to 10 days for someone who is infected to become ill enough to require hospital treatment. On Saturday there were 593 hospitalisations - that followed 650 on Friday and 758 on Thursday. On the same days the previous week there were 734, 725 and 827 admissions respectively. Your Questions Answered Earlier, the BBC News Channel asked viewers for their coronavirus questions. Annabelasked whether changes to travel rules - meaning people fully vaccinated in the US or EU no longer have to isolate when arriving in the UK from an amber list country - apply to people who are currently quarantining. Sean Tipton of travel agents' association, Abta, replied: ""That must be very frustrating for Annabel but unfortunately as she arrived before the change was made she's going to have to remain and self- isolate."" And viewerAnnawanted to know when the US will lift its ban on people entering from the UK. Lisa Minot, travel editor for the Sun, replied: ""At the moment, the presidential proclamation was put in place by President Trump at the start of the pandemic remains in place and we don't yet have a date for that to be lifted."" She said there are ""serious concerns"" about the Delta variant, with rising cases in places like Florida - especially with vaccine take-up low in some parts of the country. Alanasked if there are any updates for people who received the Indian-made AstraZeneca vaccine, which some countries in the EU were refusing to accept for travel. Sean Tipton replied there is good news for people caught in this bureaucratic mishap, caused because the Indian-made vaccine has a different name despite being identical. He said ""it shouldnât be problem"" and the issue has been resolved. Countries such as Spain said ""from day one they didn't mind where it was made"", he added. AndLeosaid he's planning to travel from Brussels to London on the Eurostar, which passes through France. Will he have to quarantine? Unfortunately, yes, Lisa replied. ""As much as you might not get off the train, it doesnât prevent people getting on,"" she added. Dr Jenny Harries said the government wants to strike a balance with the changes to the app Dr Jenny Harries, CEO of the UK Health Security Agency, has been speaking to reporters to explain the decision to make changes to England and Wales' NHS Covid-19 app, which was alerting record numbers of people and asking them to self-isolate. She says the government has had some ""very good data"" about the app, showing it has been preventing about 2,000 cases a day, or 50,000 in the month of July. But she said ""we want the public to continue having confidence in the app"" so they were changing it so that it contacts fewer people who are close to a person who tests positive during the days when they are less likely to be infectious. ""What we are doing In this new context of opening up is trying to get the balance right between the public health advice and the way people are living their lives and the social and economic factors affecting them,"" Dr Harries says. ""So we are altering the logic of the app, which will mean that fewer contacts will be advised to isolate. That is because we will only be contacting those at higher risk, who had very close contact in the most infectious period of the positive case."" A further 118,184 people received their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine yesterday, bringing the proportion of the adult population who are fully vaccinated to 72.7% - nearly 38.5 million people. But just 21,266 people received first doses, as the numbers coming forward for vaccination continued to slow down. A total of almost 46.9 million people, or 88.6% of adults, have had at least one jab. After complaints about the number of people forced to self-isolate due to alerts from the NHS Covid-19 app, the government says it is updating the software so it will notify fewer people. It aims to address what became known as the ""pingdemic"", but the Department of Health urged the public to continue to use the app and to self-isolate if they receive an alert. Currently the app looks for people who were close contacts of someone who tested positive - but have had no symptoms - in the five days before their test. The updated app will only look back two days instead, ""based on public health advice"", the department said. It said the change means the app will focus on the days when the person was at their most infectious. It does not change the sensitivity of the app, or its risk threshold, and will mean the same number of high-risk contacts will be asked to isolate, the department said. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: âWe want to reduce the disruption that self-isolation can cause for people and businesses, while ensuring weâre protecting those most at risk from this virus. This update to the app will help ensure that we are striking the right balance. âItâs so important that people isolate when asked to do so in order to stop the spread of the virus and protect their communities.â Read more. The UK has recorded another 21,952 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, as infections appear to be continuing their fall. It means that during the past seven days the nation has had 27% fewer positive tests than in the previous week. Another 24 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, which means deaths have risen 20% week on week. The delay between infections reaching their peak and the peak of hospital admissions and deaths is the likely explanation for why deaths continue to rise despite the fall in cases. A fresh Covid outbreak in China has spread to 15 provinces, raising concerns over the country's vulnerability to the highly contagious Delta variant. With more than 300 cases detected in 10 days, the government has imposed fresh travel restrictions and is testing millions. It's the largest outbreak in China for months - the Global Times newspaper has called the outbreak the""most serious since Wuhan"",external. The country was largely successful in controlling the virus within its borders last year, but cases of the Delta variant emerged in July in Nanjing Airport, among workers who had cleaned a plane that arrived from Russia. Authorities promptly tested 9.2 million residents of Nanjing and imposed lockdown on hundreds of thousands of people. Health officials have zeroed in on a theatre in Zhangjiajie in Hunan province, where many of the latest cases have been confirmed, and are now trying to track down about 5,000 people who attended performances and then travelled back to their home cities. The virus has also reached Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid-19 first emerged, with seven people there testing positive for the virus. Read more about the outbreak here. The change of rules to allow people fully vaccinated in the US and EU to avoid quarantining when they come to the UK is the latest example of international travel opening up. But where are cases highest around the world? Well, Covid-19 is continuing to spread globally, with more than 198 million confirmed cases and more than 4.2 million deaths across nearly 200 countries. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Russia, the UK and Turkey. Our Visual and Data Journalism Team has put together an interactive table that allows you to see countries by deaths, death rate and total cases.Head over here to take a look. The prime minister said the UK economy was one of the most open in Europe Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been speaking to reporters on a visit to the new Airbus HQ in Stevenage, where he was tackled about the possibility of an ""amber watchlist"" being added to the traffic light system for travel. Amid criticism that it would make the system too complicated and hinder the tourist industry's recovery, he said: ""I understand people care very much about their holidays, people want to go abroad."" But he said ""weâve also got to remember this is still a dangerous virus"" and it was important to ""try and stop variants coming into the country"". He said the government was planning to take a ""balanced approach"" which would be ""simple and user-friendly"". ""Double vaccinations really do offer the way forward,"" he added. Asked whether the UK was ""squandering"" its progress in vaccinations by being slow to open up, Johnson said the UK economy and society is ""just about the most open in Europe"". He said IMF figures showed the UK economy rebounding, but on travel they had to balance the desire to open up with ""anxiety"" about variants.  The MP whose constituency covers Gatwick said the UK risked ""squandering"" its vaccine success A Conservative MP who leads the all-party group on the future of aviation has called for the government to think again over plans to add an ""amber watchlist"" of countries at risk of being downgraded to red in the traffic light system for international travel. Henry Smith, MP for Crawley where Gatwick Airport is based, told the PA News agency it risked âsquandering the successful vaccine rolloutâ. Making the system more complex âwill just put more people off from booking international travel and will mean that there isnât an August of meaningful travel to save travel and aviation sector jobs,"" he said. Mr Smith said the UK was already at a disadvantage to other places such as the US and some European countries, which had opened up more to international travel. Diana Holland, from the Unite union which represents air travel workers, said the industry had ""haemorrhaged jobs"" and needed greater financial support, as in France and Germany. She said the current traffic light system was not working, there was disagreement about how to proceed and support was needed while the situation remained unclear. Calum O'Flynn said hospitality workers faced losing vital income in tips while self-isolating While exemptions have been arranged for some critical workers at large companies, the record numbers of self-isolation alerts being issued by the NHS Covid-19 app are still hitting small businesses and their workers. Calum O'Flynn, an assistant bar manager at London's Head + Tails pub in Hampstead, says: ""About 25% of my income comes from tips, so if you get pinged on a Thursday or Friday, you're missing a huge amount - it could be two-thirds' rent for most of us."" He said on one shift, three workers were ""pinged"" by the app just before opening, while another got an alert during the shift. Calum says they were left with half a team working twice as hard - and still not able to serve customers as well as they would want. ""We've had burnout and it's been really stressful, we're all just exhausted,"" he said. Mursal Saiq, director of London-based restaurant and BBQ delivery service Cue Point, said he had been forced to employ friends at the last minute to cover gaps in staffing. ""You just can't rely on having staff at the moment. Operationally it's nearly impossible to run events right now,"" he said. The government says it is working with hospitality firms to enable safe re-opening, but self-isolation is an essential tool. Read more Joss Croft said the inbound tourist industry still needed financial support Joss Croft, CEO of UKinbound, which represents the domestic tourism industry, has been speaking to the BBC News Channel about the impact of today's easing of quarantine for US and EU travellers. He says: ""It's the first piece of good news that the 500,000 people employed in inbound tourism will have had in months."" But he says it's unlikely to help the industry recover much more rapidly, as most of the UK's tourism is very seasonal - only 22% of US visitors come between September and December, he says. Additional barriers such as the continuing quarantine requirements for France are also keeping visitors away, closing the UK to its second-largest market and also blocking coach trips from other European countries that have to pass through France. A father and son who live on opposite sides of the Atlantic have been reunited for the first time since February 2020 - as quarantine rules ease for those fully-jabbed in the US. Thomas Walters, 47, flew from the US to London's Heathrow earlier to surprise his dad Julian ahead of his 70th birthday tomorrow. âI had tears in my eyes when I clicked purchase and realised I was able to come,"" he tells the BBC. âIâve been grumpy with my family because our family vacation in Michigan was going to fall in the middle of my dadâs 70th. When I realised that the rules had changed I found flights that were reasonable and realised I could actually do this."" Thomas was born in London but now lives in Livonia, New York. Before the pandemic, he would see his dad every two or three months. Julian says he wasn't expecting Thomas to show up at all. âIâve not seen my family for 17 months other than on Zoom, not just my son but his family and my daughter too. Itâs nice to have some parts of the family here and be together again,"" he says. âI did say no surprises for my birthday but this is a welcome one.â Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she has asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for a meeting when he visits Scotland later this week. ""We differ politically, but our governments must work together where we can,"" Sturgeon posted on Twitter, along with an image of the letter she has written to him. In it, she proposes they meet ""for a discussion on the current Covid situation and our respective plans for recovery"". She has invited Johnson to Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh.

New Zealand is addressing a shortage of seasonal workers by allowing in some foreign workers who won't have to undergo two weeks in quarantine. They'll be drawn from the Pacific nations of Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, which have largely kept the pandemic at bay. ""Our closed border has been critical to keeping Covid out and keeping our economy running but... we know our agriculture sector is experiencing challenges,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday. The arrangement is due to begin in September,external. New Zealand closed its borders last year, cutting off its traditional source of seasonal workers from small Pacific countries, while island nations have suffered from the drop in workersâ remittances. New Zealandâs strict quarantine control has seen the country go without any community transmission of the coronavirus since February. ""I don't want to let her go,"" said Sue, meeting her daughter for the first time in more than 19 months âOh my goodness!â That was the moment Naomi Hooper, who lives with her husband and two children in San Diego, laid eyes on her parents for the first time since December 2019. She rushed into the arms of mother Sue Johns and father Peter, hugging them tightly as they sobbed behind their masks. Naomi briefly broke off with a laugh to say: ""Stiff upper lip!"". But the tears soon flowed again. The BBC had travelled to meet Sue and Peter at Heathrow Airport to catch their reunion as the UK relaxed quarantine rules on people fully vaccinated in the US and EU. Sue said she hadn't been able to sleep with excitement. She had previously launched a diplomatic campaign to try and visit her grandson and granddaughter in the US, which still bans UK travellers. She wrote to the president and vice-president, along with the governor of California and the UK transport secretary. ""This isnât tourism, I donât want to go for a holiday, I want to go and see my family,"" she said. ""Weâll quarantine, weâll take tests every day, weâll do whatever we need to do. And I know Iâm not alone."" ""Thank goodness for the masks,"" said Naomi Hooper. ""Not too much ugly crying."" Peter said it had been ""torturous"" missing key moments in their grandchildren's lives. ""The granddaughter just lost her first tooth and I think last time we saw her she had gained her first tooth,"" he said. Naomi said: ""I really didnât think it was possible to come home until I stepped off the plane, I didnât think it was going to happen."" She said she hoped the US would open up travel for vaccinated British travellers so her parents could spend time with her son and daughter, who had to stay home with her husband. In the meantime, she was looking forward to hugging her grandmother and meeting her niece, who is almost two years old, for the first time. ""I probably wonât want to leave in eight days,"" she said. Her father replied: ""Itâs quite cold, so you might.""

NHS Covid-19 app tweaked to notify fewer contactsThe app in England and Wales will now only alert contacts from the previous two days in asymptomatic cases.,"This video can not be played 'Fewer will be contacted' by NHS Covid-19 app The NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales is being tweaked so fewer contacts will be advised to self-isolate following a close contact with a positive case. The app will look for contacts two days prior, rather than five, when someone without symptoms tests positive. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it would reduce disruption but still protect those at risk. The government is urging the public to continue using the app. It comes as the UK recorded another 21,952 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, compared to 24,950 cases last Monday. Another 24 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, higher than the 14 recorded on the same day last week. What's changing on the NHS Covid app? What are the latest changes to the Covid rules? Almost 700,000 alerts were sent by the app to users in England and Wales for the week to July 21, a record since it was launched, which has caused staffing issues in many industries. It led to the government allowing some key workers -such as those working in food distribution- to be exempt from having to self-isolate if pinged. Instead they have to take daily tests. There had been speculation that the app could bemade less sensitiveto the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes. But the DHSC said the update ""does not impact the sensitivity of the app, or change the risk threshold"". There was speculation when Sajid Javid became the new health secretary just as the word ""pingdemic"" was entering the language that he would order changes to make the app less sensitive. That was ruled out - but it seems Mr Javid asked what else could be done and was advised that the option unveiled on Monday would be wiser. Cutting the period the app hunts back through the close contacts of an asymptomatic person before a positive test from five days to two could mean a substantial fall in the numbers sent into isolation. There has been huge pressure for change from businesses which have seen their operations disrupted by thousands of pings - but at the same time the team behind the app believes it now has strong evidence that it is working. The government will hope it has found a middle way, reducing the burden on businesses and making it less likely that people will delete the app while still alerting those in most danger of becoming infected with the virus and passing it on. But, as with so much about this project, this is an experiment in human behaviour because for the app to work, people have to trust it. Announcing the change, Mr Javid said: ""We want to reduce the disruption that self-isolation can cause for people and businesses, while ensuring we're protecting those most at risk from this virus. ""This update to the app will help ensure that we are striking the right balance."" Dr Jenny Harries, of the UK Health Security Agency, said the app was ""the simplest, easiest and fastest way to find out whether you have been exposed to the virus,"" and it had saved thousands of lives. She said she would ""strongly encourage everyone, even those fully vaccinated, to continue using the app"". It is unclear how many people will be affected by the tweak. Scientists have estimated the app prevented up to 2,000 cases per day in the three weeks to 21 July when the number of self-isolation alerts - known as ""pings"" - rose by over 70,000 toa new record of 689,313. And their analysis, which assumed 60% compliance with instructions to self-isolate, suggested another 50,000 Covid cases were prevented by including chains of transmission. This was estimated to have prevented 1,600 hospitalisations, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Around 40% of the eligible population regularly use the app and around 50% of all reported tests are being inputted, it said, saying usage remains ""high"". Labour's shadow health minister Liz Kendall accused the government of ""leaving hundreds of thousands of people forced to self-isolate every day"" and quietly changing the app, rather than driving infections down. Trade union Unite said the change did not go far enough and repeated a call from the automotive and steel sectors for workers to be exempt from self-isolation rules. But the move has been welcomed by the British Beer and Pub Association, which said its research found up to 1,000 pubs had been forced to close temporarily due to staff being pinged by the app. Its chief executive Emma McClarkin said: ""On average, each pub forced to temporarily close due to staff being pinged costs Â£9,500 in lost trade per week and our larger venues much, much more at a critical time in their recovery."" From 16 August, fully vaccinated contacts in Englandwill be exempt from isolationand instead will be advised to take a PCR test. Those who are not fully vaccinated will still be required to isolate, and it will remain a legal obligation to isolate if you test positive. On 7 August, Wales will become the first UK nation tostop asking fully vaccinated adults to self-isolateafter close contact with a positive Covid case. Meanwhile, a further 118,184 people received their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine on Sunday, meaning nearly 38.5 million people - or 72.7% of the UK population - are now fully vaccinated. But just 21,266 people received first doses, as the numbers coming forward for vaccination continued to slow down. A total of almost 46.9 million people, or 88.6% of adults, have had at least one jab.

PM wants 'balanced and simple' approach to travel,"Boris Johnson says the government wants a ""balanced approach"" to travel, but warns the UK must try to stop new Covid variants being imported from abroad. Responding to speculation about a new amber watch-list of nations that could join the red list at short notice, he said he wanted advice to be ""simple"". Mr Johnson said he understood ""people care very much about their holidays"" but that Covid remained ""dangerous"". The next update to the travel list system is due on Thursday. During a visit to Airbus in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, the prime minister said: ""On travel, we have had to balance it because of the anxiety that I think a lot of people have - I have - about importing new variants, bringing back the disease. ""We also have to recognise that people want, badly, to go on their summer holidays, we need to get the travel industry moving again, we need to get our city centres open again and so we want an approach that is as simple as we can possibly make it."" Boris Johnson spoke to reporters during a visit to Airbus in Stevenage Tory MPs have raised concerns about the prospect of a so-called amber watch-list. Under current rules people who were fully vaccinated in the UK, US, EU (except France) or Switzerland do not have to isolate for 10 days when arriving from amber list countries. But people coming to the UK from red list countries are required to isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel regardless of their vaccine status. Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean No quarantine for fully jabbed EU and US arrivals The government already hasa green watch-list,,externalwhich features more than half the countries on the green list and signals they are at risk of moving to amber. Green country:When returning from a country on the green list you must take a Covid-19 test before departure and have proof of a negative result. You also need to book a test for day two after your return Amber country:A Covid test is needed three days before returning, and a PCR test two days after arriving. People who are not fully vaccinated in the approved countries need to self-isolate for 10 days, although this can be shortened for people in England by usingthe Test to Release scheme,external- paying for a test on day five Red country:Regardless of your vaccination status you must take a test before departure and, on arrival, self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel Read morehere. Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that the potential new travel category would ""be viewed as a massive red flag"" that would ""likely"" cause bookings to those countries to ""collapse"". Asked about the possibility of a new watch-list Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds told Times Radio the opposition did not want to see ""additional confusion and chaos"" and that the government needed to be ""open and transparent"". But government minister Matt Warman defended the idea of travel watch-lists, telling Sky News that warnings over potential quarantine changes gave people ""really important information when they're making significant financial decisions"". Airline bosses had welcomed a change in rules, which came into force earlier on Monday, but said the UK aviation sector was not on the path to recovery ""due to the continued restrictions that are being imposed on international travel"". In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps they called for more countries to be added to the green list, saying that countries should be green by default. Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the UK's current travel rules were ""still quite complicated"" and needed to be simplified to make it easier for people to travel, as well as reducing some of the extra costs. He said the requirement for everyone to have a PCR test could be reduced to a ""cheaper lateral flow test as a first line of defence"". On Monday, the UK reported 21,952 new Covid cases while a further 24 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test as of Sunday.

Breaking|Breaking newsNHS Covid-19 app tweaked to notify fewer contactsNHS Covid App being tweaked so fewer contacts will be advised to self-isolate following a close contact with a positive caseUK,"This video can not be played 'Fewer will be contacted' by NHS Covid-19 app The NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales is being tweaked so fewer contacts will be advised to self-isolate following a close contact with a positive case. The app will look for contacts two days prior, rather than five, when someone without symptoms tests positive. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it would reduce disruption but still protect those at risk. The government is urging the public to continue using the app. It comes as the UK recorded another 21,952 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, compared to 24,950 cases last Monday. Another 24 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, higher than the 14 recorded on the same day last week. What's changing on the NHS Covid app? What are the latest changes to the Covid rules? Almost 700,000 alerts were sent by the app to users in England and Wales for the week to July 21, a record since it was launched, which has caused staffing issues in many industries. It led to the government allowing some key workers -such as those working in food distribution- to be exempt from having to self-isolate if pinged. Instead they have to take daily tests. There had been speculation that the app could bemade less sensitiveto the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes. But the DHSC said the update ""does not impact the sensitivity of the app, or change the risk threshold"". There was speculation when Sajid Javid became the new health secretary just as the word ""pingdemic"" was entering the language that he would order changes to make the app less sensitive. That was ruled out - but it seems Mr Javid asked what else could be done and was advised that the option unveiled on Monday would be wiser. Cutting the period the app hunts back through the close contacts of an asymptomatic person before a positive test from five days to two could mean a substantial fall in the numbers sent into isolation. There has been huge pressure for change from businesses which have seen their operations disrupted by thousands of pings - but at the same time the team behind the app believes it now has strong evidence that it is working. The government will hope it has found a middle way, reducing the burden on businesses and making it less likely that people will delete the app while still alerting those in most danger of becoming infected with the virus and passing it on. But, as with so much about this project, this is an experiment in human behaviour because for the app to work, people have to trust it. Announcing the change, Mr Javid said: ""We want to reduce the disruption that self-isolation can cause for people and businesses, while ensuring we're protecting those most at risk from this virus. ""This update to the app will help ensure that we are striking the right balance."" Dr Jenny Harries, of the UK Health Security Agency, said the app was ""the simplest, easiest and fastest way to find out whether you have been exposed to the virus,"" and it had saved thousands of lives. She said she would ""strongly encourage everyone, even those fully vaccinated, to continue using the app"". It is unclear how many people will be affected by the tweak. Scientists have estimated the app prevented up to 2,000 cases per day in the three weeks to 21 July when the number of self-isolation alerts - known as ""pings"" - rose by over 70,000 toa new record of 689,313. And their analysis, which assumed 60% compliance with instructions to self-isolate, suggested another 50,000 Covid cases were prevented by including chains of transmission. This was estimated to have prevented 1,600 hospitalisations, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Around 40% of the eligible population regularly use the app and around 50% of all reported tests are being inputted, it said, saying usage remains ""high"". Labour's shadow health minister Liz Kendall accused the government of ""leaving hundreds of thousands of people forced to self-isolate every day"" and quietly changing the app, rather than driving infections down. Trade union Unite said the change did not go far enough and repeated a call from the automotive and steel sectors for workers to be exempt from self-isolation rules. But the move has been welcomed by the British Beer and Pub Association, which said its research found up to 1,000 pubs had been forced to close temporarily due to staff being pinged by the app. Its chief executive Emma McClarkin said: ""On average, each pub forced to temporarily close due to staff being pinged costs Â£9,500 in lost trade per week and our larger venues much, much more at a critical time in their recovery.""

First people arrive in UK after travel rules eased,"This video can not be played There were hugs and tears at Heathrow as families reunited The first passengers have been arriving in the UK after rules changed to allow people fully vaccinated in the US and EU to avoid quarantine. The change, which came in at 04:00 BST, affects those arriving from countries on the UK's amber list - except France. The UK government said the change would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad. Airline bosses have welcomed the move but are calling for more countries to be added to the UK's green travel list. Thomas Walters, 47, was among some of the first arrivals from the US after flying from New York to London to surprise his father for his 70th birthday. He bought his plane ticket last Wednesday after realising the rules had changed and he could see his father for the first time since February 2020. ""All throughout the summer I've had a really strong longing to come back to the UK. Not being able to see each other for so long has been very difficult."" Thomas Walters said his father Julian was ""confused... then so happy"" after he arrived unexpectedly from the US Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or PCR test pre-departure, and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age. Since 19 July, people who have been double-jabbed in the UK have not had to isolate when arriving from amber list countries, but all other travellers vaccinated elsewhere are required to quarantine for 10 days. Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean No quarantine for fully jabbed EU and US arrivals Tougher rules also remain in place for France,with travellers still required to quarantine even if they have been double jabbed.

Elaine Burt (centre) greets her family after they land in Scotland Others to welcome the change included nurse Elaine Burt, 55, who met her sister and nephews at Glasgow Airport after they arrived from Boston in the US - their first meeting in 20 months. ""We never thought it was going to happen with all of the different restrictions but we left it to the last minute to see what was possible,"" she said. Her sister, Michelle Bolger, said it had been ""a rollercoaster trying to get here"", adding: ""I didn't I think I would see this day."" Naomi Hooper, who lives in San Diego, said she booked a flight back to the UK as soon as the rules changed so she could see her parents for the first time since December 2019. She said she was ""so grateful"" at getting the opportunity to come home. ""I probably won't want to leave in eight days but I'm hoping this is the beginning of the travel opportunity - for mum and dad to come and see the kids in America."" Naomi Hooper, who left her husband and children in the US, had a tearful reunion with her parents at Heathrow Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the UK's current travel rules were ""still quite complicated"" and needed to be simplified to make it easier for people to travel, as well as reducing some of the extra costs. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to get rid of the requirement for everyone to have a PCR test and replace it with a simpler, cheaper lateral flow test as a first line of defence."" The leaders of UK airlines described Monday's easing of the rules as a ""positive step"" but said they were concerned that the UK aviation sector was not on the path to recovery ""due to the continued restrictions that are being imposed on international travel"". In a letter to Mr Shapps, they wrote that green status should ""increasingly become a default"" for countries, citing falling case numbers and the proportion of the UK population now vaccinated. As part of the changes, international cruise ships will beable to depart from Englandfrom Monday - after a 16-month pause. International cruises have been allowed from Northern Ireland since Saturday. Meanwhile, Tory MPs have raised concerns about the prospect of a so-called amber watch-list of countries that holidaymakers would be warned could move to the red list at short notice.

Kane absent from Spurs' training ground,"Kane won the Premier League golden boot last season, scoring 23 goals Harry Kane, a transfer target for Manchester City, did not return to the Tottenham training ground as expected on Monday morning amid speculation over his future. The striker was scheduled to have coronavirus testing on Monday before starting training on Tuesday. Kane has had a three-week break after helping England reach the Euro 2020 final. Spurs have offered no explanation for why the 28-year-old did not turn up. It is understood Kane felt he hada gentleman's agreementwith Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy that he could leave the club this summer. A pre-Euro 2020 move did not materialise as he hoped, but Manchester City remain keen on signing the England captain. Kane's international's team-mate Jack Grealish is also a target for City, who have amade a Â£100m bidfor the Aston Villa midfielder, andhe turned up for pre-season training,externalwith the Midlands club on Monday. Kane, new boss and European third tier - can Spurs emerge from confusion? Kane's contract with Spurs runs until 2024 after he signed a six-year deal in 2018. He scored 23 top-flight goals last season to claim the Premier League Golden Boot for a third time, having previously won the award in 2015-16 and 2016-17. He also has 221 Tottenham goals to his name, which puts him second in their all-time goalscorers' list behind Jimmy Greaves, who scored 266 times for the club between 1961 and 1970. Spurs play Chelsea and Arsenal in high-profile friendlies this week, and new manager Nuno Espirito Santo has already spoken optimistically about the prospect of working with Kane. Speaking at his first news conference after being appointed as manager,Nuno said last month:""Harry is our player. Period. No need to talk about anything else, I am looking forward to him joining the group. ""Harry is one of the best players in the world. That is all I need to say."" Without official clarification over why Harry Kane failed to turn up, there is room for misinterpretation. Did Kane have an agreement from his club to stay away or was it his own doing? However, given he was expected to be at Tottenham for Covid testing and there has been no legitimate reason put forward for why he wasn't, it seems clear Kane wants out of Tottenham - and he wants in at Manchester City. City won trophies last season - Premier League and Carabao Cup - which is the attraction for Kane. He supplies guaranteed goals as a number nine, which is the attraction for City. Evidently, the fee is not a problem. Neither are the wages. City have operated well within Financial Fair Play limits for some time now. And while Sergio Aguero had been reduced to a peripheral figure in Pep Guardiola's squad by the end of last season, he remained one of their highest earners. In addition, it is expected at least one senior squad member - probably Bernardo Silva - will leave this summer if, as seems highly likely, Kane and Grealish arrive. The big unknown is the thoughts of Tottenham chairman Levy. Of all Premier League executives, he is the least obvious candidate to cave in to player power. But Levy did say in June that Tottenham had to be 'sensible' in the transfer market this summer. They have already spent Â£20m on one player, are set for another near Â£50m outlay on another in Atalanta defender Cristian Romero, and have been strongly linked with Fiorentina's Dusan Vlahovic, even though the 21-year-old Serbian striker would also cost over Â£40m. Is that the kind of sensible spending Levy was talking about - or is it getting new arrivals in ahead of a significant departure? Without clarification on his absence, it is impossible to know for certain, but the debate around Kane will only get louder for the fact he is not there.

Grenfell model bonfire accused to face retrialPaul Bussetti will face a new trial after the High Court quashed his previous acquittal.London,"The model was burned at a bonfire party in south London on 3 November 2018 A father who filmed a cardboard model of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire will face a second trial, the High Court has ruled. The clip was recorded at a party in south London a year after the fire, which killed 72 people. Paul Bussetti was cleared of posting the ""grossly offensive"" video in August 2019, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) appealed against the verdict. In a judgement on Friday, the High Court quashed Mr Bussetti's acquittal. The clip of the cardboard building, which had ""Grenfell Tower"" written on it, was recorded at a party attended by about 30 people in south London on 3 November 2018, Westminster Magistrates' Court previously heard. It was later uploaded to YouTube and sparked outrage, with a relative of one of the people who died in the blaze calling it ""revolting"". During his previous trial Paul Bussetti told the court the incident was a ""joke"" Mr Bussetti, of South Norwood, was accused of sending ""grossly offensive"" material via a public communications network. He was found not guilty after a two-day trial. Magistrates said they could not be sure the film was taken by Mr Bussetti after it was revealed a second video from the party had also been shared on WhatsApp. The then 47-year-old also told magistrates the effigy had been created by his friend and the characters featured on the model were meant to represent ""the majority of people that were at the party"", not people who died in the disaster. In his ruling, Lord Justice Bean said that he did not accept Mr Bussetti's argument - that the figures in the bonfire were his friends - as a defence. He also said the trial judge should have found that the two videos of the bonfire were similar. Mr Bussetti will face a retrial at Westminster Magistrates' Court in front of a different judge and was also ordered to pay the CPS' costs of Â£6,095 within 28 days.

First people arrive in UK after travel rules easedPeople vaccinated in the EU or US do not need to isolate when coming to the UK from an amber country.UKComments,"This video can not be played There were hugs and tears at Heathrow as families reunited The first passengers have been arriving in the UK after rules changed to allow people fully vaccinated in the US and EU to avoid quarantine. The change, which came in at 04:00 BST, affects those arriving from countries on the UK's amber list - except France. The UK government said the change would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad. Airline bosses have welcomed the move but are calling for more countries to be added to the UK's green travel list. Thomas Walters, 47, was among some of the first arrivals from the US after flying from New York to London to surprise his father for his 70th birthday. He bought his plane ticket last Wednesday after realising the rules had changed and he could see his father for the first time since February 2020. ""All throughout the summer I've had a really strong longing to come back to the UK. Not being able to see each other for so long has been very difficult."" Thomas Walters said his father Julian was ""confused... then so happy"" after he arrived unexpectedly from the US Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or PCR test pre-departure, and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age. Since 19 July, people who have been double-jabbed in the UK have not had to isolate when arriving from amber list countries, but all other travellers vaccinated elsewhere are required to quarantine for 10 days. Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean No quarantine for fully jabbed EU and US arrivals Tougher rules also remain in place for France,with travellers still required to quarantine even if they have been double jabbed. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said this will be reviewed at the end of the week at the next review of the travel lists. Green country:When returning from a country on the green list you must take a Covid-19 test before departure and have proof of a negative result. You also need to book a test for day two after your return Amber country:A Covid test is needed three days before returning, and a PCR test two days after arriving. People who are not fully vaccinated in the approved countries need to self-isolate for 10 days, although this can be shortened for people in England by usingthe Test to Release scheme,external- paying for a test on day five Red country:Regardless of your vaccination status you must take a test before departure and, on arrival, self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel Read morehere. Elaine Burt (centre) greets her family after they land in Scotland Others to welcome the change included nurse Elaine Burt, 55, who met her sister and nephews at Glasgow Airport after they arrived from Boston in the US - their first meeting in 20 months. ""We never thought it was going to happen with all of the different restrictions but we left it to the last minute to see what was possible,"" she said. Her sister, Michelle Bolger, said it had been ""a rollercoaster trying to get here"", adding: ""I didn't I think I would see this day."" Naomi Hooper, who lives in San Diego, said she booked a flight back to the UK as soon as the rules changed so she could see her parents for the first time since December 2019. She said she was ""so grateful"" at getting the opportunity to come home. ""I probably won't want to leave in eight days but I'm hoping this is the beginning of the travel opportunity - for mum and dad to come and see the kids in America."" Naomi Hooper, who left her husband and children in the US, had a tearful reunion with her parents at Heathrow Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the UK's current travel rules were ""still quite complicated"" and needed to be simplified to make it easier for people to travel, as well as reducing some of the extra costs. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to get rid of the requirement for everyone to have a PCR test and replace it with a simpler, cheaper lateral flow test as a first line of defence."" The leaders of UK airlines described Monday's easing of the rules as a ""positive step"" but said they were concerned that the UK aviation sector was not on the path to recovery ""due to the continued restrictions that are being imposed on international travel"". In a letter to Mr Shapps, they wrote that green status should ""increasingly become a default"" for countries, citing falling case numbers and the proportion of the UK population now vaccinated. As part of the changes, international cruise ships will beable to depart from Englandfrom Monday - after a 16-month pause. International cruises have been allowed from Northern Ireland since Saturday. Meanwhile, Tory MPs have raised concerns about the prospect of a so-called amber watch-list of countries that holidaymakers would be warned could move to the red list at short notice. People coming to the UK from red list countries are required to isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel regardless of their vaccine status. The government already hasa green watch-list,,externalwhich features more than half the countries on the green list and signals they are at risk of moving to amber. Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that the potential new travel category would ""be viewed as a massive red flag"" that would ""likely"" cause bookings to those countries to ""collapse"". But government minister Matt Warman defended the idea of travel watchlists, telling Sky News that warnings over potential quarantine changes gave people ""really important information when they're making significant financial decisions"". While US citizens will be able to avoid quarantine in the UK they are still being urged not to travel to the UK by their country's health protection agency andthe US border is currently closed to many countries, including the UK, except to US citizens. On Sundaythe UK reported,external24,470 new Covid cases as well as a further 65 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Additional reporting by Doug Faulkner.

Banking giant HSBC sees profit more than doubleThe UK-based firm said the jump in profits was driven by an economic rebound in Britain and Hong Kong.,"The figures come as the global economy emerges from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic Profits at banking giant HSBC more than doubled in the first half of the year as it benefited from an economic rebound in Britain and Hong Kong. Europe's biggest bank by assets saw pre-tax profit for the period rise to $10.8bn (Â£7.8bn), compared to $4.3bn for the same time last year. The UK-based bank said all regions had been profitable in the period. The figures come as the global economy emerges from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. ""I'm pleased with the momentum generated around our growth and transformation plans, with good delivery against all four pillars of our strategy. In particular, we have taken firm steps to define the future of our US and continental Europe businesses"", said HSBC chief executive Noel Quinn. The lender highlighted that its UK bank had reported profit before tax of more than $2.1bn in the period. Boosted by the economic rebound in its two biggest markets, Britain and Hong Kong, the bank reinstated dividend payments to shareholders. It plans to pay an interim dividend of seven cents a share after the Bank of England last month scrapped curbs on such pay-outs to investors. HSBC boss to hot-desk as executive floor abolished However, Laura Foll, manager of UK income funds at Janus Henderson Investors, told the BBC that the key factor behind the rise in HSBC's profits had been the lower-than-expected losses on loans during the pandemic. She said that last year most banks set aside money based on estimates of how much they could potentially lose if loans went bad and its customers were unable to repay them. In HSBC's case, it set aside $700m. ""In all cases, the banks are now rolling back on that number... and it is that number that has boosted the profitability at HSBC more than any other improvement."" HSBC said its restructuring programme remains on track after announcing in February last year that it would shed 35,000 jobs as part of a plan to cut $4.5bn of costs by 2022. In February, HSBC had signalled a ""pivot to Asia"", outlining plans to invest about $6bn in the region. It said it would target wealth management and commercial banking to drive ""double-digit growth"" and has singled out Asian markets such as Singapore, China and Hong Kong. HSBC already generates the bulk of its revenues from Asia. In January, UK MPs accused HSBC - a Hong Kong founded bank - of ""aiding and abetting"" China's crackdown in Hong Kong. HSBC faced accusations of acting in a political manner and being too close to the Chinese authorities after it emerged that the bank had frozen accounts belonging to Hong Kong pro-democracy politician Ted Hui and members of his family. Appearing before the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Quinn was told the bank was turning a blind eye to the situation. Mr Quinn mounted a robust defence of the bank, saying: ""I can't cherry-pick which laws to follow.""

No quarantine for vaccinated EU and US visitors,"This video can not be played Covid: US family reunited with Scottish relatives after 20 months Families have been reunited as restrictions are eased on fully-vaccinated visitors from the EU and US arriving in Scotland. People who have been double-jabbed in the EU and US no longer have to quarantine. The change, which began at 04:00, affects those arriving from countries on the amber list - except France. The Scottish government said it was possible due to the success of the vaccine roll-out. However, people are still being urged to ""think very carefully about whether your trip abroad is necessary"" before they travel. There were emotional scenes at Glasgow Airport, just hours after the restrictions were eased. First people arrive in UK after travel rules eased Elaine Burt, 55, a senior nurse with the NHS, was waiting for her sister and nephews to arrive from Boston, USA, for their first meeting in 20 months. After the reunion Ms Burt, from Newton Mearns, said: ""It was an absolute relief, it just felt as if it was never going to happen and it's just the best present ever. ""We never thought it was going to happen with all of the different restrictions, but we left it to the last minute to see what was possible."" Her sister Michelle Bolger, 50, and her nephews Kaie, 17, and Taran, 12, who were all double vaccinated in the US, were visiting Scotland to spend time with her mother Jean, who has been unwell. Ms Bolger said: ""It's been so long. It's been really hard, but we're here, we made it. ""We booked the flight just a week past Monday. It's been a rollercoaster trying to get here. ""We still have to test on day two but it's great, absolutely amazing, I didn't think I would see this day."" There were emotional scenes at Glasgow airport as families were reunited Another person enjoying isolation-free travel was Colin Morton, 56. The engineer, who moved to Italy in his mid-20s and had both his vaccinations in Italy, said he had returned to Scotland to visit his mother, who has been unwell. He said: ""My mother and father live here and they are both elderly and my mother has been unwell, so I'm looking forward to being able to see her. There would have been no point coming if I had to quarantine."" Meanwhile, among those looking forward to visiting Scotland without having to quarantine is avid golfer Bill Luyk, from Michigan, USA. He said he felt like ""a four-year-old on Christmas morning"" thinking about his forthcoming trip. Mr Luyk told BBC Scotland: ""Golfers in the US are just chomping at the bit to play the courses we're going to play. ""We're really, really looking forward to it and hopefully things will remain open."" Under thenew rules,external, people who were fully vaccinated in the following countries will not have to isolate for 10 days on arrival in Scotland: UK EU member states (except France) Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City USA People travelling from amber list countries will need to show a negative test before departure and produce a negative PCR test result on day two after arrival. And they will have to show either the EU Digital Covid Certificate or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's white card -  known as a CDC card - to prove they are fully vaccinated. The change does not apply to people who have been in France in the 10 days prior to their arrival, due to concerns over the Beta variant. Julie Clarke lives in Prague in the Czech Republic and will fly into Edinburgh on Monday night. Before the pandemic the teacher would return to Scotland up to seven times a year to visit her mother, who is disabled and housebound. But she has only been home once the UK went into lockdown in March last year, and said the restrictions have led to a ""lot of frustration"". Ms Clarke told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""It was very stressful. I went in December. Amsterdam shut their entry to Scotland, I then had to go to London. Czech Republic then shut to London, I then had to fly to Poland. Took me 23 hours to get home."" She added she is ""very excited"" about her flight which she booked last Wednesday - the day before the new restrictions were announced. Ms Clarke said: ""I've been double vaccinated since April and have the same vaccinations as many of my family and friends in Scotland and was very frustrated I couldn't travel."" But she can only stay for a week so she is safe to return to school for the new term. The teacher said: ""I want to keep myself safe, the children safe, my colleagues at work safe so I'm more than happy if I have to quarantine when I get back here."" The change to the rules has been largely welcomed by the travel industry with Karen Musgrave, of Barrhead Travel, describing the move as ""really positive"". She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland: ""We have definitely seen pent up demand released over the last couple of weeks, particularly when we had the news that the fully vaccinated travellers did not have to quarantine when coming back from amber destinations. ""We are also seeing more confidence for further out in the year, so October school holidays and getaways over Christmas and new year are proving really popular just now as well."" What are the latest rules for summer holidays abroad? Do I need a vaccine certificate to travel? Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean Karen Dee, of the Airport Operators Association, said she would like to see the UK and Scottish governments go further. Asked about the advice that people should only go abroad if they have to, she said: ""It is a bit confusing and, from our perspective, very damaging particularly given the vaccination roll out and the success of that in the UK. ""We would have expected, I think, to have seen us opening up more quickly than others to take advantage of the benefits we have had. ""That has not been the case and we are lagging behind many countries in Europe who are opening up more quickly despite not having so many people vaccinated.""

Professor of public health at Edinburgh University Linda Bauld said she does not think the new rules will lead to a spike in case numbers. She said: ""This is about parity. People can already travel from the UK to other countries and come back if they have had vaccines here. ""There was a lot of concern about the fact that we were not recognising other countries' vaccination programmes to this is really that shift."" Prof Bauld also cautioned against the removal of the travel testing regulations and said the current system provides ""reassurance"". RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Your travel guide to summer holidays in Europe,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Instead, they must  present a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. You must have received your final vaccine dose no earlier than 270 days (about nine months) before travelling. If it was earlier than this, you must be able to show proof of having received a booster jab. There is no requirement for 14 days to have passed between receiving your booster and entering Spain. Spain (like all EU countries) will accept as proof theNHS Covid Pass,Scotland's NHS Covid Status PassorNorthern Ireland's COVIDCert NI app- these can be presented either in digital form on a phone, or printed (as long as it's dated after 1 November 2021).

If you have not been fully vaccinated, you can only enter Spain if your journey is classed as""essential""by the Spanish Ministry of Health. If your journey qualifies, you will need to present either a negative PCR test taken within the previous 72 hours, or a negative antigen test/LFT taken within the previous 24 hours, or else a medical certificate to say that you have recovered from Covid in the previous six months.

First people arrive in UK after rules relaxedPeople vaccinated in the EU or US do not need to isolate when coming to the UK from an amber country.UK,"This video can not be played There were hugs and tears at Heathrow as families reunited The first passengers have been arriving in the UK after rules changed to allow people fully vaccinated in the US and EU to avoid quarantine. The change, which came in at 04:00 BST, affects those arriving from countries on the UK's amber list - except France. The UK government said the change would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad. Airline bosses have welcomed the move but are calling for more countries to be added to the UK's green travel list. Thomas Walters, 47, was among some of the first arrivals from the US after flying from New York to London to surprise his father for his 70th birthday. He bought his plane ticket last Wednesday after realising the rules had changed and he could see his father for the first time since February 2020. ""All throughout the summer I've had a really strong longing to come back to the UK. Not being able to see each other for so long has been very difficult."" Thomas Walters said his father Julian was ""confused... then so happy"" after he arrived unexpectedly from the US Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or PCR test pre-departure, and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age. Since 19 July, people who have been double-jabbed in the UK have not had to isolate when arriving from amber list countries, but all other travellers vaccinated elsewhere are required to quarantine for 10 days. Your travel guide to summer holidays in the Mediterranean No quarantine for fully jabbed EU and US arrivals Tougher rules also remain in place for France,with travellers still required to quarantine even if they have been double jabbed. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said this will be reviewed at the end of the week at the next review of the travel lists. Green country:When returning from a country on the green list you must take a Covid-19 test before departure and have proof of a negative result. You also need to book a test for day two after your return Amber country:A Covid test is needed three days before returning, and a PCR test two days after arriving. People who are not fully vaccinated in the approved countries need to self-isolate for 10 days, although this can be shortened for people in England by usingthe Test to Release scheme,external- paying for a test on day five Red country:Regardless of your vaccination status you must take a test before departure and, on arrival, self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel Read morehere. Elaine Burt (centre) greets her family after they land in Scotland Others to welcome the change included nurse Elaine Burt, 55, who met her sister and nephews at Glasgow Airport after they arrived from Boston in the US - their first meeting in 20 months. ""We never thought it was going to happen with all of the different restrictions but we left it to the last minute to see what was possible,"" she said. Her sister, Michelle Bolger, said it had been ""a rollercoaster trying to get here"", adding: ""I didn't I think I would see this day."" Naomi Hooper, who lives in San Diego, said she booked a flight back to the UK as soon as the rules changed so she could see her parents for the first time since December 2019. She said she was ""so grateful"" at getting the opportunity to come home. ""I probably won't want to leave in eight days but I'm hoping this is the beginning of the travel opportunity - for mum and dad to come and see the kids in America."" Naomi Hooper, who left her husband and children in the US, had a tearful reunion with her parents at Heathrow Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the UK's current travel rules were ""still quite complicated"" and needed to be simplified to make it easier for people to travel, as well as reducing some of the extra costs. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to get rid of the requirement for everyone to have a PCR test and replace it with a simpler, cheaper lateral flow test as a first line of defence."" The leaders of UK airlines described Monday's easing of the rules as a ""positive step"" but said they were concerned that the UK aviation sector was not on the path to recovery ""due to the continued restrictions that are being imposed on international travel"". In a letter to Mr Shapps, they wrote that green status should ""increasingly become a default"" for countries, citing falling case numbers and the proportion of the UK population now vaccinated. As part of the changes, international cruise ships will beable to depart from Englandfrom Monday - after a 16-month pause. International cruises have been allowed from Northern Ireland since Saturday. Meanwhile, Tory MPs have raised concerns about the prospect of a so-called amber watch-list of countries that holidaymakers would be warned could move to the red list at short notice. People coming to the UK from red list countries are required to isolate for 10 days in a government-approved hotel regardless of their vaccine status. The government already hasa green watch-list,,externalwhich features more than half the countries on the green list and signals they are at risk of moving to amber. Huw Merriman, chairman of the Transport Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that the potential new travel category would ""be viewed as a massive red flag"" that would ""likely"" cause bookings to those countries to ""collapse"". But government minister Matt Warman defended the idea of travel watchlists, telling Sky News that warnings over potential quarantine changes gave people ""really important information when they're making significant financial decisions"". While US citizens will be able to avoid quarantine in the UK they are still being urged not to travel to the UK by their country's health protection agency andthe US border is currently closed to many countries, including the UK, except to US citizens. On Sundaythe UK reported,external24,470 new Covid cases as well as a further 65 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Additional reporting by Doug Faulkner.

We'll be back with more live news from the pandemic tomorrow morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Lauren Turner, George Bowden, Hamish Mackay, Hazel Shearing, Alexandra Fouche, Laurence Peter and Joseph Lee. There were emotional scenes at Heathrow Airport as travel restrictions were eased and loved ones reunited We're bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. But before we go, here's a look back at some of today's main stories:  A Pfizer vaccination in Madrid Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have raised
the prices of their Covid vaccines delivered to the EU, France says, confirming
an earlier Financial Times report. Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune said the two
pharma firms had had to adapt their vaccines to the new variants, so ânot just
for the European Union, but for all the buyers itâll be a bit more expensiveâ. He was speaking on French radio. Last week the EU said 57% of the
blocâs adult population had been fully vaccinated. More than 455m doses have
been administered in the EU. The EU is co-ordinating vaccine
purchases for the 27 member states. It has not disclosed how much it is paying
for the doses. But the FT said the new price for
a Pfizer dose was â¬19.5 (Â£17; $23), against â¬15.5 previously. And a Moderna dose
would cost â¬21.5, against â¬19 previously. Contractually they are the
biggest vaccine suppliers to the EU: Pfizer has pledged 600m doses and Moderna
460m. The EU is also vaccinating with Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen
(Johnson & Johnson).  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There are now clear signs that the number of people being admitted into hospital with Covid has started falling in England following the drop in detected cases. Infections have been falling for well over a week. But there is always a lag between a change in cases and hospitalisations as it tends to take a week to 10 days for someone who is infected to become ill enough to require hospital treatment. On Saturday there were 593 hospitalisations - that followed 650 on Friday and 758 on Thursday. On the same days the previous week there were 734, 725 and 827 admissions respectively. Your Questions Answered Earlier, the BBC News Channel asked viewers for their coronavirus questions. Annabelasked whether changes to travel rules - meaning people fully vaccinated in the US or EU no longer have to isolate when arriving in the UK from an amber list country - apply to people who are currently quarantining. Sean Tipton of travel agents' association, Abta, replied: ""That must be very frustrating for Annabel but unfortunately as she arrived before the change was made she's going to have to remain and self- isolate."" And viewerAnnawanted to know when the US will lift its ban on people entering from the UK. Lisa Minot, travel editor for the Sun, replied: ""At the moment, the presidential proclamation was put in place by President Trump at the start of the pandemic remains in place and we don't yet have a date for that to be lifted."" She said there are ""serious concerns"" about the Delta variant, with rising cases in places like Florida - especially with vaccine take-up low in some parts of the country. Alanasked if there are any updates for people who received the Indian-made AstraZeneca vaccine, which some countries in the EU were refusing to accept for travel. Sean Tipton replied there is good news for people caught in this bureaucratic mishap, caused because the Indian-made vaccine has a different name despite being identical. He said ""it shouldnât be problem"" and the issue has been resolved. Countries such as Spain said ""from day one they didn't mind where it was made"", he added. AndLeosaid he's planning to travel from Brussels to London on the Eurostar, which passes through France. Will he have to quarantine? Unfortunately, yes, Lisa replied. ""As much as you might not get off the train, it doesnât prevent people getting on,"" she added. Dr Jenny Harries said the government wants to strike a balance with the changes to the app Dr Jenny Harries, CEO of the UK Health Security Agency, has been speaking to reporters to explain the decision to make changes to England and Wales' NHS Covid-19 app, which was alerting record numbers of people and asking them to self-isolate. She says the government has had some ""very good data"" about the app, showing it has been preventing about 2,000 cases a day, or 50,000 in the month of July. But she said ""we want the public to continue having confidence in the app"" so they were changing it so that it contacts fewer people who are close to a person who tests positive during the days when they are less likely to be infectious. ""What we are doing In this new context of opening up is trying to get the balance right between the public health advice and the way people are living their lives and the social and economic factors affecting them,"" Dr Harries says. ""So we are altering the logic of the app, which will mean that fewer contacts will be advised to isolate. That is because we will only be contacting those at higher risk, who had very close contact in the most infectious period of the positive case."" A further 118,184 people received their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine yesterday, bringing the proportion of the adult population who are fully vaccinated to 72.7% - nearly 38.5 million people. But just 21,266 people received first doses, as the numbers coming forward for vaccination continued to slow down. A total of almost 46.9 million people, or 88.6% of adults, have had at least one jab. After complaints about the number of people forced to self-isolate due to alerts from the NHS Covid-19 app, the government says it is updating the software so it will notify fewer people. It aims to address what became known as the ""pingdemic"", but the Department of Health urged the public to continue to use the app and to self-isolate if they receive an alert. Currently the app looks for people who were close contacts of someone who tested positive - but have had no symptoms - in the five days before their test. The updated app will only look back two days instead, ""based on public health advice"", the department said. It said the change means the app will focus on the days when the person was at their most infectious. It does not change the sensitivity of the app, or its risk threshold, and will mean the same number of high-risk contacts will be asked to isolate, the department said. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: âWe want to reduce the disruption that self-isolation can cause for people and businesses, while ensuring weâre protecting those most at risk from this virus. This update to the app will help ensure that we are striking the right balance. âItâs so important that people isolate when asked to do so in order to stop the spread of the virus and protect their communities.â Read more. The UK has recorded another 21,952 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, as infections appear to be continuing their fall. It means that during the past seven days the nation has had 27% fewer positive tests than in the previous week. Another 24 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, which means deaths have risen 20% week on week. The delay between infections reaching their peak and the peak of hospital admissions and deaths is the likely explanation for why deaths continue to rise despite the fall in cases. A fresh Covid outbreak in China has spread to 15 provinces, raising concerns over the country's vulnerability to the highly contagious Delta variant. With more than 300 cases detected in 10 days, the government has imposed fresh travel restrictions and is testing millions. It's the largest outbreak in China for months - the Global Times newspaper has called the outbreak the""most serious since Wuhan"",external. The country was largely successful in controlling the virus within its borders last year, but cases of the Delta variant emerged in July in Nanjing Airport, among workers who had cleaned a plane that arrived from Russia. Authorities promptly tested 9.2 million residents of Nanjing and imposed lockdown on hundreds of thousands of people. Health officials have zeroed in on a theatre in Zhangjiajie in Hunan province, where many of the latest cases have been confirmed, and are now trying to track down about 5,000 people who attended performances and then travelled back to their home cities. The virus has also reached Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid-19 first emerged, with seven people there testing positive for the virus. Read more about the outbreak here. The change of rules to allow people fully vaccinated in the US and EU to avoid quarantining when they come to the UK is the latest example of international travel opening up. But where are cases highest around the world? Well, Covid-19 is continuing to spread globally, with more than 198 million confirmed cases and more than 4.2 million deaths across nearly 200 countries. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Russia, the UK and Turkey. Our Visual and Data Journalism Team has put together an interactive table that allows you to see countries by deaths, death rate and total cases.Head over here to take a look. The prime minister said the UK economy was one of the most open in Europe Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been speaking to reporters on a visit to the new Airbus HQ in Stevenage, where he was tackled about the possibility of an ""amber watchlist"" being added to the traffic light system for travel. Amid criticism that it would make the system too complicated and hinder the tourist industry's recovery, he said: ""I understand people care very much about their holidays, people want to go abroad."" But he said ""weâve also got to remember this is still a dangerous virus"" and it was important to ""try and stop variants coming into the country"". He said the government was planning to take a ""balanced approach"" which would be ""simple and user-friendly"". ""Double vaccinations really do offer the way forward,"" he added. Asked whether the UK was ""squandering"" its progress in vaccinations by being slow to open up, Johnson said the UK economy and society is ""just about the most open in Europe"". He said IMF figures showed the UK economy rebounding, but on travel they had to balance the desire to open up with ""anxiety"" about variants.  The MP whose constituency covers Gatwick said the UK risked ""squandering"" its vaccine success A Conservative MP who leads the all-party group on the future of aviation has called for the government to think again over plans to add an ""amber watchlist"" of countries at risk of being downgraded to red in the traffic light system for international travel. Henry Smith, MP for Crawley where Gatwick Airport is based, told the PA News agency it risked âsquandering the successful vaccine rolloutâ. Making the system more complex âwill just put more people off from booking international travel and will mean that there isnât an August of meaningful travel to save travel and aviation sector jobs,"" he said. Mr Smith said the UK was already at a disadvantage to other places such as the US and some European countries, which had opened up more to international travel. Diana Holland, from the Unite union which represents air travel workers, said the industry had ""haemorrhaged jobs"" and needed greater financial support, as in France and Germany. She said the current traffic light system was not working, there was disagreement about how to proceed and support was needed while the situation remained unclear. Calum O'Flynn said hospitality workers faced losing vital income in tips while self-isolating While exemptions have been arranged for some critical workers at large companies, the record numbers of self-isolation alerts being issued by the NHS Covid-19 app are still hitting small businesses and their workers. Calum O'Flynn, an assistant bar manager at London's Head + Tails pub in Hampstead, says: ""About 25% of my income comes from tips, so if you get pinged on a Thursday or Friday, you're missing a huge amount - it could be two-thirds' rent for most of us."" He said on one shift, three workers were ""pinged"" by the app just before opening, while another got an alert during the shift. Calum says they were left with half a team working twice as hard - and still not able to serve customers as well as they would want. ""We've had burnout and it's been really stressful, we're all just exhausted,"" he said. Mursal Saiq, director of London-based restaurant and BBQ delivery service Cue Point, said he had been forced to employ friends at the last minute to cover gaps in staffing. ""You just can't rely on having staff at the moment. Operationally it's nearly impossible to run events right now,"" he said. The government says it is working with hospitality firms to enable safe re-opening, but self-isolation is an essential tool. Read more Joss Croft said the inbound tourist industry still needed financial support Joss Croft, CEO of UKinbound, which represents the domestic tourism industry, has been speaking to the BBC News Channel about the impact of today's easing of quarantine for US and EU travellers. He says: ""It's the first piece of good news that the 500,000 people employed in inbound tourism will have had in months."" But he says it's unlikely to help the industry recover much more rapidly, as most of the UK's tourism is very seasonal - only 22% of US visitors come between September and December, he says. Additional barriers such as the continuing quarantine requirements for France are also keeping visitors away, closing the UK to its second-largest market and also blocking coach trips from other European countries that have to pass through France. A father and son who live on opposite sides of the Atlantic have been reunited for the first time since February 2020 - as quarantine rules ease for those fully-jabbed in the US. Thomas Walters, 47, flew from the US to London's Heathrow earlier to surprise his dad Julian ahead of his 70th birthday tomorrow. âI had tears in my eyes when I clicked purchase and realised I was able to come,"" he tells the BBC. âIâve been grumpy with my family because our family vacation in Michigan was going to fall in the middle of my dadâs 70th. When I realised that the rules had changed I found flights that were reasonable and realised I could actually do this."" Thomas was born in London but now lives in Livonia, New York. Before the pandemic, he would see his dad every two or three months. Julian says he wasn't expecting Thomas to show up at all. âIâve not seen my family for 17 months other than on Zoom, not just my son but his family and my daughter too. Itâs nice to have some parts of the family here and be together again,"" he says. âI did say no surprises for my birthday but this is a welcome one.â Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she has asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for a meeting when he visits Scotland later this week. ""We differ politically, but our governments must work together where we can,"" Sturgeon posted on Twitter, along with an image of the letter she has written to him. In it, she proposes they meet ""for a discussion on the current Covid situation and our respective plans for recovery"". She has invited Johnson to Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh.

New Zealand is addressing a shortage of seasonal workers by allowing in some foreign workers who won't have to undergo two weeks in quarantine. They'll be drawn from the Pacific nations of Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, which have largely kept the pandemic at bay. ""Our closed border has been critical to keeping Covid out and keeping our economy running but... we know our agriculture sector is experiencing challenges,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday. The arrangement is due to begin in September,external. New Zealand closed its borders last year, cutting off its traditional source of seasonal workers from small Pacific countries, while island nations have suffered from the drop in workersâ remittances. New Zealandâs strict quarantine control has seen the country go without any community transmission of the coronavirus since February. ""I don't want to let her go,"" said Sue, meeting her daughter for the first time in more than 19 months âOh my goodness!â That was the moment Naomi Hooper, who lives with her husband and two children in San Diego, laid eyes on her parents for the first time since December 2019. She rushed into the arms of mother Sue Johns and father Peter, hugging them tightly as they sobbed behind their masks. Naomi briefly broke off with a laugh to say: ""Stiff upper lip!"". But the tears soon flowed again. The BBC had travelled to meet Sue and Peter at Heathrow Airport to catch their reunion as the UK relaxed quarantine rules on people fully vaccinated in the US and EU. Sue said she hadn't been able to sleep with excitement. She had previously launched a diplomatic campaign to try and visit her grandson and granddaughter in the US, which still bans UK travellers. She wrote to the president and vice-president, along with the governor of California and the UK transport secretary. ""This isnât tourism, I donât want to go for a holiday, I want to go and see my family,"" she said. ""Weâll quarantine, weâll take tests every day, weâll do whatever we need to do. And I know Iâm not alone."" ""Thank goodness for the masks,"" said Naomi Hooper. ""Not too much ugly crying."" Peter said it had been ""torturous"" missing key moments in their grandchildren's lives. ""The granddaughter just lost her first tooth and I think last time we saw her she had gained her first tooth,"" he said. Naomi said: ""I really didnât think it was possible to come home until I stepped off the plane, I didnât think it was going to happen."" She said she hoped the US would open up travel for vaccinated British travellers so her parents could spend time with her son and daughter, who had to stay home with her husband. In the meantime, she was looking forward to hugging her grandmother and meeting her niece, who is almost two years old, for the first time. ""I probably wonât want to leave in eight days,"" she said. Her father replied: ""Itâs quite cold, so you might."" Sue and Peter Johns said they hope the US opens up to vaccinated UK travellers Ahmed RouabaBBC News The north African country is struggling to cope with a spike in cases Algerian students in France

We'll be back with more live news from the pandemic tomorrow morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Lauren Turner, George Bowden, Hamish Mackay, Hazel Shearing, Alexandra Fouche, Laurence Peter and Joseph Lee. There were emotional scenes at Heathrow Airport as travel restrictions were eased and loved ones reunited We're bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. But before we go, here's a look back at some of today's main stories:  A Pfizer vaccination in Madrid Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have raised
the prices of their Covid vaccines delivered to the EU, France says, confirming
an earlier Financial Times report. Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune said the two
pharma firms had had to adapt their vaccines to the new variants, so ânot just
for the European Union, but for all the buyers itâll be a bit more expensiveâ. He was speaking on French radio. Last week the EU said 57% of the
blocâs adult population had been fully vaccinated. More than 455m doses have
been administered in the EU. The EU is co-ordinating vaccine
purchases for the 27 member states. It has not disclosed how much it is paying
for the doses. But the FT said the new price for
a Pfizer dose was â¬19.5 (Â£17; $23), against â¬15.5 previously. And a Moderna dose
would cost â¬21.5, against â¬19 previously. Contractually they are the
biggest vaccine suppliers to the EU: Pfizer has pledged 600m doses and Moderna
460m. The EU is also vaccinating with Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen
(Johnson & Johnson).  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There are now clear signs that the number of people being admitted into hospital with Covid has started falling in England following the drop in detected cases. Infections have been falling for well over a week. But there is always a lag between a change in cases and hospitalisations as it tends to take a week to 10 days for someone who is infected to become ill enough to require hospital treatment. On Saturday there were 593 hospitalisations - that followed 650 on Friday and 758 on Thursday. On the same days the previous week there were 734, 725 and 827 admissions respectively. Your Questions Answered Earlier, the BBC News Channel asked viewers for their coronavirus questions. Annabelasked whether changes to travel rules - meaning people fully vaccinated in the US or EU no longer have to isolate when arriving in the UK from an amber list country - apply to people who are currently quarantining. Sean Tipton of travel agents' association, Abta, replied: ""That must be very frustrating for Annabel but unfortunately as she arrived before the change was made she's going to have to remain and self- isolate."" And viewerAnnawanted to know when the US will lift its ban on people entering from the UK. Lisa Minot, travel editor for the Sun, replied: ""At the moment, the presidential proclamation was put in place by President Trump at the start of the pandemic remains in place and we don't yet have a date for that to be lifted."" She said there are ""serious concerns"" about the Delta variant, with rising cases in places like Florida - especially with vaccine take-up low in some parts of the country. Alanasked if there are any updates for people who received the Indian-made AstraZeneca vaccine, which some countries in the EU were refusing to accept for travel. Sean Tipton replied there is good news for people caught in this bureaucratic mishap, caused because the Indian-made vaccine has a different name despite being identical.

""This isnât tourism, I donât want to go for a holiday, I want to go and see my family,"" she said. ""Weâll quarantine, weâll take tests every day, weâll do whatever we need to do. And I know Iâm not alone."" ""Thank goodness for the masks,"" said Naomi Hooper. ""Not too much ugly crying."" Peter said it had been ""torturous"" missing key moments in their grandchildren's lives. ""The granddaughter just lost her first tooth and I think last time we saw her she had gained her first tooth,"" he said. Naomi said: ""I really didnât think it was possible to come home until I stepped off the plane, I didnât think it was going to happen."" She said she hoped the US would open up travel for vaccinated British travellers so her parents could spend time with her son and daughter, who had to stay home with her husband. In the meantime, she was looking forward to hugging her grandmother and meeting her niece, who is almost two years old, for the first time. ""I probably wonât want to leave in eight days,"" she said. Her father replied: ""Itâs quite cold, so you might."" Sue and Peter Johns said they hope the US opens up to vaccinated UK travellers Ahmed RouabaBBC News The north African country is struggling to cope with a spike in cases Algerian students in France
have raised more than â¬600,000 ($713,000; Â£513,000) to buy medical equipment and supplies for
hospitals battling coronavirus in their home country. The Algerian Medical Network
launched a fundraiser on 20 July to help save lives as the health
system in the north African country struggled to cope with a rapid spike in
infections. The campaign has been
supported by celebrities including actress Leila Bekhti and former footballer Frank RibÃ©ry. By the end of the month, they were able to
raise â¬627,900. The money will be used to buy
oxygen concentrators and medicines. The network intends to launch
a new fundraiser in a few days to collect more money and send more medical
equipment to the country. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

We'll be back with more live news from the pandemic tomorrow morning. Today's coverage was brought to you by Lauren Turner, George Bowden, Hamish Mackay, Hazel Shearing, Alexandra Fouche, Laurence Peter and Joseph Lee. There were emotional scenes at Heathrow Airport as travel restrictions were eased and loved ones reunited We're bringing our live coverage to a close shortly. But before we go, here's a look back at some of today's main stories:  A Pfizer vaccination in Madrid Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have raised
the prices of their Covid vaccines delivered to the EU, France says, confirming
an earlier Financial Times report. Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune said the two
pharma firms had had to adapt their vaccines to the new variants, so ânot just
for the European Union, but for all the buyers itâll be a bit more expensiveâ. He was speaking on French radio. Last week the EU said 57% of the
blocâs adult population had been fully vaccinated. More than 455m doses have
been administered in the EU. The EU is co-ordinating vaccine
purchases for the 27 member states. It has not disclosed how much it is paying
for the doses. But the FT said the new price for
a Pfizer dose was â¬19.5 (Â£17; $23), against â¬15.5 previously. And a Moderna dose
would cost â¬21.5, against â¬19 previously. Contractually they are the
biggest vaccine suppliers to the EU: Pfizer has pledged 600m doses and Moderna
460m. The EU is also vaccinating with Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen
(Johnson & Johnson).  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent There are now clear signs that the number of people being admitted into hospital with Covid has started falling in England following the drop in detected cases. Infections have been falling for well over a week. But there is always a lag between a change in cases and hospitalisations as it tends to take a week to 10 days for someone who is infected to become ill enough to require hospital treatment. On Saturday there were 593 hospitalisations - that followed 650 on Friday and 758 on Thursday. On the same days the previous week there were 734, 725 and 827 admissions respectively. Your Questions Answered Earlier, the BBC News Channel asked viewers for their coronavirus questions. Annabelasked whether changes to travel rules - meaning people fully vaccinated in the US or EU no longer have to isolate when arriving in the UK from an amber list country - apply to people who are currently quarantining. Sean Tipton of travel agents' association, Abta, replied: ""That must be very frustrating for Annabel but unfortunately as she arrived before the change was made she's going to have to remain and self- isolate."" And viewerAnnawanted to know when the US will lift its ban on people entering from the UK. Lisa Minot, travel editor for the Sun, replied: ""At the moment, the presidential proclamation was put in place by President Trump at the start of the pandemic remains in place and we don't yet have a date for that to be lifted."" She said there are ""serious concerns"" about the Delta variant, with rising cases in places like Florida - especially with vaccine take-up low in some parts of the country. Alanasked if there are any updates for people who received the Indian-made AstraZeneca vaccine, which some countries in the EU were refusing to accept for travel. Sean Tipton replied there is good news for people caught in this bureaucratic mishap, caused because the Indian-made vaccine has a different name despite being identical. He said ""it shouldnât be problem"" and the issue has been resolved. Countries such as Spain said ""from day one they didn't mind where it was made"", he added. AndLeosaid he's planning to travel from Brussels to London on the Eurostar, which passes through France. Will he have to quarantine? Unfortunately, yes, Lisa replied. ""As much as you might not get off the train, it doesnât prevent people getting on,"" she added. Dr Jenny Harries said the government wants to strike a balance with the changes to the app Dr Jenny Harries, CEO of the UK Health Security Agency, has been speaking to reporters to explain the decision to make changes to England and Wales' NHS Covid-19 app, which was alerting record numbers of people and asking them to self-isolate. She says the government has had some ""very good data"" about the app, showing it has been preventing about 2,000 cases a day, or 50,000 in the month of July. But she said ""we want the public to continue having confidence in the app"" so they were changing it so that it contacts fewer people who are close to a person who tests positive during the days when they are less likely to be infectious. ""What we are doing In this new context of opening up is trying to get the balance right between the public health advice and the way people are living their lives and the social and economic factors affecting them,"" Dr Harries says. ""So we are altering the logic of the app, which will mean that fewer contacts will be advised to isolate. That is because we will only be contacting those at higher risk, who had very close contact in the most infectious period of the positive case."" A further 118,184 people received their second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine yesterday, bringing the proportion of the adult population who are fully vaccinated to 72.7% - nearly 38.5 million people. But just 21,266 people received first doses, as the numbers coming forward for vaccination continued to slow down. A total of almost 46.9 million people, or 88.6% of adults, have had at least one jab. After complaints about the number of people forced to self-isolate due to alerts from the NHS Covid-19 app, the government says it is updating the software so it will notify fewer people. It aims to address what became known as the ""pingdemic"", but the Department of Health urged the public to continue to use the app and to self-isolate if they receive an alert. Currently the app looks for people who were close contacts of someone who tested positive - but have had no symptoms - in the five days before their test. The updated app will only look back two days instead, ""based on public health advice"", the department said. It said the change means the app will focus on the days when the person was at their most infectious. It does not change the sensitivity of the app, or its risk threshold, and will mean the same number of high-risk contacts will be asked to isolate, the department said. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: âWe want to reduce the disruption that self-isolation can cause for people and businesses, while ensuring weâre protecting those most at risk from this virus. This update to the app will help ensure that we are striking the right balance. âItâs so important that people isolate when asked to do so in order to stop the spread of the virus and protect their communities.â Read more. The UK has recorded another 21,952 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, as infections appear to be continuing their fall. It means that during the past seven days the nation has had 27% fewer positive tests than in the previous week. Another 24 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, which means deaths have risen 20% week on week. The delay between infections reaching their peak and the peak of hospital admissions and deaths is the likely explanation for why deaths continue to rise despite the fall in cases. A fresh Covid outbreak in China has spread to 15 provinces, raising concerns over the country's vulnerability to the highly contagious Delta variant. With more than 300 cases detected in 10 days, the government has imposed fresh travel restrictions and is testing millions. It's the largest outbreak in China for months - the Global Times newspaper has called the outbreak the""most serious since Wuhan"",external. The country was largely successful in controlling the virus within its borders last year, but cases of the Delta variant emerged in July in Nanjing Airport, among workers who had cleaned a plane that arrived from Russia. Authorities promptly tested 9.2 million residents of Nanjing and imposed lockdown on hundreds of thousands of people. Health officials have zeroed in on a theatre in Zhangjiajie in Hunan province, where many of the latest cases have been confirmed, and are now trying to track down about 5,000 people who attended performances and then travelled back to their home cities. The virus has also reached Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid-19 first emerged, with seven people there testing positive for the virus. Read more about the outbreak here. The change of rules to allow people fully vaccinated in the US and EU to avoid quarantining when they come to the UK is the latest example of international travel opening up. But where are cases highest around the world? Well, Covid-19 is continuing to spread globally, with more than 198 million confirmed cases and more than 4.2 million deaths across nearly 200 countries. The US, India and Brazil have seen the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by France, Russia, the UK and Turkey. Our Visual and Data Journalism Team has put together an interactive table that allows you to see countries by deaths, death rate and total cases.Head over here to take a look. The prime minister said the UK economy was one of the most open in Europe Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been speaking to reporters on a visit to the new Airbus HQ in Stevenage, where he was tackled about the possibility of an ""amber watchlist"" being added to the traffic light system for travel. Amid criticism that it would make the system too complicated and hinder the tourist industry's recovery, he said: ""I understand people care very much about their holidays, people want to go abroad."" But he said ""weâve also got to remember this is still a dangerous virus"" and it was important to ""try and stop variants coming into the country"". He said the government was planning to take a ""balanced approach"" which would be ""simple and user-friendly"". ""Double vaccinations really do offer the way forward,"" he added. Asked whether the UK was ""squandering"" its progress in vaccinations by being slow to open up, Johnson said the UK economy and society is ""just about the most open in Europe"". He said IMF figures showed the UK economy rebounding, but on travel they had to balance the desire to open up with ""anxiety"" about variants.  The MP whose constituency covers Gatwick said the UK risked ""squandering"" its vaccine success A Conservative MP who leads the all-party group on the future of aviation has called for the government to think again over plans to add an ""amber watchlist"" of countries at risk of being downgraded to red in the traffic light system for international travel. Henry Smith, MP for Crawley where Gatwick Airport is based, told the PA News agency it risked âsquandering the successful vaccine rolloutâ. Making the system more complex âwill just put more people off from booking international travel and will mean that there isnât an August of meaningful travel to save travel and aviation sector jobs,"" he said. Mr Smith said the UK was already at a disadvantage to other places such as the US and some European countries, which had opened up more to international travel. Diana Holland, from the Unite union which represents air travel workers, said the industry had ""haemorrhaged jobs"" and needed greater financial support, as in France and Germany. She said the current traffic light system was not working, there was disagreement about how to proceed and support was needed while the situation remained unclear. Calum O'Flynn said hospitality workers faced losing vital income in tips while self-isolating While exemptions have been arranged for some critical workers at large companies, the record numbers of self-isolation alerts being issued by the NHS Covid-19 app are still hitting small businesses and their workers. Calum O'Flynn, an assistant bar manager at London's Head + Tails pub in Hampstead, says: ""About 25% of my income comes from tips, so if you get pinged on a Thursday or Friday, you're missing a huge amount - it could be two-thirds' rent for most of us."" He said on one shift, three workers were ""pinged"" by the app just before opening, while another got an alert during the shift. Calum says they were left with half a team working twice as hard - and still not able to serve customers as well as they would want. ""We've had burnout and it's been really stressful, we're all just exhausted,"" he said. Mursal Saiq, director of London-based restaurant and BBQ delivery service Cue Point, said he had been forced to employ friends at the last minute to cover gaps in staffing. ""You just can't rely on having staff at the moment. Operationally it's nearly impossible to run events right now,"" he said. The government says it is working with hospitality firms to enable safe re-opening, but self-isolation is an essential tool. Read more Joss Croft said the inbound tourist industry still needed financial support Joss Croft, CEO of UKinbound, which represents the domestic tourism industry, has been speaking to the BBC News Channel about the impact of today's easing of quarantine for US and EU travellers. He says: ""It's the first piece of good news that the 500,000 people employed in inbound tourism will have had in months."" But he says it's unlikely to help the industry recover much more rapidly, as most of the UK's tourism is very seasonal - only 22% of US visitors come between September and December, he says. Additional barriers such as the continuing quarantine requirements for France are also keeping visitors away, closing the UK to its second-largest market and also blocking coach trips from other European countries that have to pass through France. A father and son who live on opposite sides of the Atlantic have been reunited for the first time since February 2020 - as quarantine rules ease for those fully-jabbed in the US. Thomas Walters, 47, flew from the US to London's Heathrow earlier to surprise his dad Julian ahead of his 70th birthday tomorrow. âI had tears in my eyes when I clicked purchase and realised I was able to come,"" he tells the BBC. âIâve been grumpy with my family because our family vacation in Michigan was going to fall in the middle of my dadâs 70th. When I realised that the rules had changed I found flights that were reasonable and realised I could actually do this."" Thomas was born in London but now lives in Livonia, New York. Before the pandemic, he would see his dad every two or three months. Julian says he wasn't expecting Thomas to show up at all. âIâve not seen my family for 17 months other than on Zoom, not just my son but his family and my daughter too. Itâs nice to have some parts of the family here and be together again,"" he says. âI did say no surprises for my birthday but this is a welcome one.â Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she has asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for a meeting when he visits Scotland later this week. ""We differ politically, but our governments must work together where we can,"" Sturgeon posted on Twitter, along with an image of the letter she has written to him. In it, she proposes they meet ""for a discussion on the current Covid situation and our respective plans for recovery"". She has invited Johnson to Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh.

New Zealand is addressing a shortage of seasonal workers by allowing in some foreign workers who won't have to undergo two weeks in quarantine. They'll be drawn from the Pacific nations of Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, which have largely kept the pandemic at bay. ""Our closed border has been critical to keeping Covid out and keeping our economy running but... we know our agriculture sector is experiencing challenges,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday. The arrangement is due to begin in September,external. New Zealand closed its borders last year, cutting off its traditional source of seasonal workers from small Pacific countries, while island nations have suffered from the drop in workersâ remittances. New Zealandâs strict quarantine control has seen the country go without any community transmission of the coronavirus since February. ""I don't want to let her go,"" said Sue, meeting her daughter for the first time in more than 19 months âOh my goodness!â That was the moment Naomi Hooper, who lives with her husband and two children in San Diego, laid eyes on her parents for the first time since December 2019. She rushed into the arms of mother Sue Johns and father Peter, hugging them tightly as they sobbed behind their masks. Naomi briefly broke off with a laugh to say: ""Stiff upper lip!"". But the tears soon flowed again. The BBC had travelled to meet Sue and Peter at Heathrow Airport to catch their reunion as the UK relaxed quarantine rules on people fully vaccinated in the US and EU. Sue said she hadn't been able to sleep with excitement. She had previously launched a diplomatic campaign to try and visit her grandson and granddaughter in the US, which still bans UK travellers. She wrote to the president and vice-president, along with the governor of California and the UK transport secretary.

Asked whether the UK was ""squandering"" its progress in vaccinations by being slow to open up, Johnson said the UK economy and society is ""just about the most open in Europe"". He said IMF figures showed the UK economy rebounding, but on travel they had to balance the desire to open up with ""anxiety"" about variants.  The MP whose constituency covers Gatwick said the UK risked ""squandering"" its vaccine success A Conservative MP who leads the all-party group on the future of aviation has called for the government to think again over plans to add an ""amber watchlist"" of countries at risk of being downgraded to red in the traffic light system for international travel. Henry Smith, MP for Crawley where Gatwick Airport is based, told the PA News agency it risked âsquandering the successful vaccine rolloutâ. Making the system more complex âwill just put more people off from booking international travel and will mean that there isnât an August of meaningful travel to save travel and aviation sector jobs,"" he said. Mr Smith said the UK was already at a disadvantage to other places such as the US and some European countries, which had opened up more to international travel. Diana Holland, from the Unite union which represents air travel workers, said the industry had ""haemorrhaged jobs"" and needed greater financial support, as in France and Germany. She said the current traffic light system was not working, there was disagreement about how to proceed and support was needed while the situation remained unclear. Calum O'Flynn said hospitality workers faced losing vital income in tips while self-isolating While exemptions have been arranged for some critical workers at large companies, the record numbers of self-isolation alerts being issued by the NHS Covid-19 app are still hitting small businesses and their workers. Calum O'Flynn, an assistant bar manager at London's Head + Tails pub in Hampstead, says: ""About 25% of my income comes from tips, so if you get pinged on a Thursday or Friday, you're missing a huge amount - it could be two-thirds' rent for most of us."" He said on one shift, three workers were ""pinged"" by the app just before opening, while another got an alert during the shift. Calum says they were left with half a team working twice as hard - and still not able to serve customers as well as they would want. ""We've had burnout and it's been really stressful, we're all just exhausted,"" he said. Mursal Saiq, director of London-based restaurant and BBQ delivery service Cue Point, said he had been forced to employ friends at the last minute to cover gaps in staffing. ""You just can't rely on having staff at the moment. Operationally it's nearly impossible to run events right now,"" he said. The government says it is working with hospitality firms to enable safe re-opening, but self-isolation is an essential tool. Read more Joss Croft said the inbound tourist industry still needed financial support Joss Croft, CEO of UKinbound, which represents the domestic tourism industry, has been speaking to the BBC News Channel about the impact of today's easing of quarantine for US and EU travellers. He says: ""It's the first piece of good news that the 500,000 people employed in inbound tourism will have had in months."" But he says it's unlikely to help the industry recover much more rapidly, as most of the UK's tourism is very seasonal - only 22% of US visitors come between September and December, he says. Additional barriers such as the continuing quarantine requirements for France are also keeping visitors away, closing the UK to its second-largest market and also blocking coach trips from other European countries that have to pass through France. A father and son who live on opposite sides of the Atlantic have been reunited for the first time since February 2020 - as quarantine rules ease for those fully-jabbed in the US. Thomas Walters, 47, flew from the US to London's Heathrow earlier to surprise his dad Julian ahead of his 70th birthday tomorrow. âI had tears in my eyes when I clicked purchase and realised I was able to come,"" he tells the BBC. âIâve been grumpy with my family because our family vacation in Michigan was going to fall in the middle of my dadâs 70th. When I realised that the rules had changed I found flights that were reasonable and realised I could actually do this."" Thomas was born in London but now lives in Livonia, New York. Before the pandemic, he would see his dad every two or three months. Julian says he wasn't expecting Thomas to show up at all. âIâve not seen my family for 17 months other than on Zoom, not just my son but his family and my daughter too. Itâs nice to have some parts of the family here and be together again,"" he says. âI did say no surprises for my birthday but this is a welcome one.â Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she has asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for a meeting when he visits Scotland later this week. ""We differ politically, but our governments must work together where we can,"" Sturgeon posted on Twitter, along with an image of the letter she has written to him. In it, she proposes they meet ""for a discussion on the current Covid situation and our respective plans for recovery"". She has invited Johnson to Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh.

New Zealand is addressing a shortage of seasonal workers by allowing in some foreign workers who won't have to undergo two weeks in quarantine. They'll be drawn from the Pacific nations of Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, which have largely kept the pandemic at bay. ""Our closed border has been critical to keeping Covid out and keeping our economy running but... we know our agriculture sector is experiencing challenges,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday. The arrangement is due to begin in September,external. New Zealand closed its borders last year, cutting off its traditional source of seasonal workers from small Pacific countries, while island nations have suffered from the drop in workersâ remittances. New Zealandâs strict quarantine control has seen the country go without any community transmission of the coronavirus since February. ""I don't want to let her go,"" said Sue, meeting her daughter for the first time in more than 19 months âOh my goodness!â That was the moment Naomi Hooper, who lives with her husband and two children in San Diego, laid eyes on her parents for the first time since December 2019. She rushed into the arms of mother Sue Johns and father Peter, hugging them tightly as they sobbed behind their masks. Naomi briefly broke off with a laugh to say: ""Stiff upper lip!"". But the tears soon flowed again. The BBC had travelled to meet Sue and Peter at Heathrow Airport to catch their reunion as the UK relaxed quarantine rules on people fully vaccinated in the US and EU. Sue said she hadn't been able to sleep with excitement. She had previously launched a diplomatic campaign to try and visit her grandson and granddaughter in the US, which still bans UK travellers. She wrote to the president and vice-president, along with the governor of California and the UK transport secretary. ""This isnât tourism, I donât want to go for a holiday, I want to go and see my family,"" she said. ""Weâll quarantine, weâll take tests every day, weâll do whatever we need to do. And I know Iâm not alone."" ""Thank goodness for the masks,"" said Naomi Hooper. ""Not too much ugly crying."" Peter said it had been ""torturous"" missing key moments in their grandchildren's lives. ""The granddaughter just lost her first tooth and I think last time we saw her she had gained her first tooth,"" he said. Naomi said: ""I really didnât think it was possible to come home until I stepped off the plane, I didnât think it was going to happen."" She said she hoped the US would open up travel for vaccinated British travellers so her parents could spend time with her son and daughter, who had to stay home with her husband. In the meantime, she was looking forward to hugging her grandmother and meeting her niece, who is almost two years old, for the first time. ""I probably wonât want to leave in eight days,"" she said. Her father replied: ""Itâs quite cold, so you might."" Sue and Peter Johns said they hope the US opens up to vaccinated UK travellers Ahmed RouabaBBC News The north African country is struggling to cope with a spike in cases Algerian students in France

Beyond Meat boss backs tax on meat consumption,"The founder of the world's biggest plant-based meat company has suggested that a tax on meat could help tackle some of the problems from growing meat consumption. Asked if he backed a tax on meat, Beyond Meat's Chief Executive, Ethan Brown told the BBC ""the whole notion of a Pigouvian tax, which is to tax negative, you know, things that are high in externalities, I think is an interesting one. I'm not an economist, but overall that type of thing does appeal to me"". Mr Brown added ""I think taxing things we want more of such as income and not taxing things we want less of, I've always wondered about that. So in general, that type of taxation scheme is interesting to me. But I've got to leave it to others to work out the details"". Critics argue that such a levy would raise the cost of living and amount to unnecessary government interference. Even without such a tax Mr Brown thinks that consumers are already starting to make the choice to eat less meat. Meat sector warns of Brexit production squeeze Is a vegan butcher coming to your high street? Shares in vegan firm soar 163% on first day ""If you look at shopper data that we have, 93% of the people that are putting the Beyond burger in their cart are also putting animal protein in,"" he said. ""That says we're getting more and more penetration into the broadest swath of the market, which is people who are consuming animal protein, but again, are hearing this information about their health or maybe hearing about climate, or maybe uncomfortable with factory farming, they're deciding to cut down on their consumption of animal-based products."" Beyond Meat's products are made from ingredients such as peas and mung beans, coloured with substances such as beetroot juice and apple extract. Cost, as well as taste and texture are, according to Mr Brown, the three elements his company has to get right, as plant-based meat can be more expensive than animal meat. But he thinks that over time prices will come down. Plant-based meat is often more expensive, but Beyond Meat boss Ethan Brown says this will change as the company scales and consumers become more aware of alternatives to meat He references the three-year global deal Beyond Meat signed in February with McDonalds and a similar one with Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. ""As we scale, we'll begin to be able to under-price animal protein - if you look at our facilities, and you look at the facilities of say, some of our plant or animal-based competitors, we're still a very small company [but] that's going to change. ""One of the reasons I was so focused on these deals with McDonald's and with Yum is because I believe that's the route to [bringing] costs down and to scaling and to being able to make these products accessible to every consumer that wants them."" A tax on meat consumption would definitely be beneficial to companies such as Beyond Meat because it would make their products cheaper in comparison, says Rebecca Scheuneman, an equity analyst at US financial services firm Morningstar. How much of an advantage it would give ""depends how significant the tax would be"", she told the BBC. However, at the same time research from Morningstar shows the global meat market was worth $1.4tn (Â£1tn) last year and is growing. Is there an economic case for tackling climate change? Beyond Meat's burgers use beetroot juice to give them a similar appearance to real meat Ms Scheuneman points out the price gap is already closing: ""Meat prices now have spiked up in the last couple of years [as] disruption from the pandemic caused a lot of disruption and meat production which caused higher prices. ""And I do think that given the limited resources of the earth, and an increasing demand for meat, as emerging markets become wealthier, it is likely that prices for traditional animal proteins will increase over time."" For consumers, pricing is an important factor. A recent survey of 3,000 US consumers by Citi Bank found that 32% of people were put off of plant-based meat by the cost, saying it was too expensive. This is an improvement, compared to Citi's previous survey in August 2020, when 38% of respondents said they found plant-based meat to be too costly - a reflection of the fact that manufacturers have been trying to cut prices. Beyond Meat's rival Impossible Foods, slashed prices by 20% earlier this year. Citi's Wendy Nicholson said one reason why consumers were not going back to be regular purchasers of plant-based meat was the higher price, so ""this does seem to be a real topic for the companies to address"". Ms Scheuneman says demand is clearly growing for plant-based meats: ""It has really been most popular with younger generations and it's really the younger generations that have the most broad-based concern about our environment."" The UK government's advisory body on climate change says that ministers should beurging people to eat less meatin order to protect the climate. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasruled out a tax,externalon meat consumption as a way to do this. A recent study from theUniversity of Bristol,externalfound the costs would outweigh the benefits to the climate. This video can not be played What is climate change? According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the livestock industry accounts for about 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cutting those would help tackle climate change and Mr Brown says plant-based meat has an important contribution to make. He cites a study from the University of Michigan which he says found that the Beyond burger uses 99% less water than an animal protein burger, emits 90% fewer missions in the production process that an animal protein burger, uses 93% less land and about half the energy. Mr Brown thinks these environmental benefits are important ""particularly for this younger generation, the ones that are flight shaming, and marching on climate, because they're going to have to live in this environment"". ""For a few dollars at the centre of your plate, you can communicate what you're about, you don't have to go and buy that Tesla right away or some other electric vehicle, you can start by just doing something really simple, which is changing the protein at centre of your plate,"" he added.

Smaller firms hit by 'pingdemic' staff shortagesAn ill-timed alert on the NHS Covid app can mean bar staff losing out on tip income at the weekend.,"Calum O'Flynn lost out in tip money after being pinged by the NHS App The coronavirus pandemic dealt a heavy blow to small businesses, which are now feeling the knock-on effects of staff shortages. Many small firms, not eligible for critical worker status, are struggling with the effects of staff being told to isolate by the NHS Covid app. This problem is exacerbated by existing staff shortages in sectors such as hospitality, where industry bodies say one in five workers left during the pandemic. While larger businesses are more able to rely on a broader workforce, smaller companies are being forced to close because of too many staff having to isolate. Employees no longer on furlough are suffering from this loss in earnings. Calum O'Flynn, an assistant bar manager at London's Head + Tails pub in Hampstead, lost out in tip money from having to isolate after being pinged. ""About 25% of my income comes from tips, so if you get pinged on a Thursday or Friday, you're missing a huge amount - it could be two-thirds' rent for most of us,"" he told the BBC. Insurance threat for pinged holidaymakers More pinged workers to get daily Covid tests NHS Covid app pings rise again to new record In total, there are 12 staff at the venue and each typically makes between Â£400 and Â£600 a month in tips.

""On one shift, three were pinged just before and then another while we were working, which is so tough as we're not able to provide service as well as we'd want, with half a team working twice as hard."" Calum was furloughed during the lockdowns, but says it doesn't cover the loss of earnings from having to isolate now.

Many have also had to reduce trading hours and reduce menu choice. ""The government should look to bring in a test-to-release scheme as soon as possible.

Smaller firms hit by 'pingdemic' staff shortagesAn ill-timed alert on the NHS Covid app can mean bar staff losing out on tip income at the weekend.Business,"Calum O'Flynn lost out in tip money after being pinged by the NHS App The coronavirus pandemic dealt a heavy blow to small businesses, which are now feeling the knock-on effects of staff shortages. Many small firms, not eligible for critical worker status, are struggling with the effects of staff being told to isolate by the NHS Covid app. This problem is exacerbated by existing staff shortages in sectors such as hospitality, where industry bodies say one in five workers left during the pandemic. While larger businesses are more able to rely on a broader workforce, smaller companies are being forced to close because of too many staff having to isolate. Employees no longer on furlough are suffering from this loss in earnings. Calum O'Flynn, an assistant bar manager at London's Head + Tails pub in Hampstead, lost out in tip money from having to isolate after being pinged. ""About 25% of my income comes from tips, so if you get pinged on a Thursday or Friday, you're missing a huge amount - it could be two-thirds' rent for most of us,"" he told the BBC. Insurance threat for pinged holidaymakers More pinged workers to get daily Covid tests NHS Covid app pings rise again to new record In total, there are 12 staff at the venue and each typically makes between Â£400 and Â£600 a month in tips.
