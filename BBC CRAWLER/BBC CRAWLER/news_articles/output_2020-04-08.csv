Twitter boss pledges $1bn,"Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter and payment app Square, has said he will donate $1bn (Â£810m) towards efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. According to Mr Dorsey, the donation represented approximately 28% of his wealth. He made the announcement on Twitter, writing that the ""needs are increasingly urgent"". Mr Dorsey did not lay out exactly where the funds would be sent to help in the battle against Covid-19. In the US there is a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment, and business and individuals are also struggling economically. Mr Dorsey will use shares he owns in Square to fund the donations which will be distributed through the Start Small Foundation. The 43-year-old is the chief executive of both Twitter and Square. He said he was using shares of Square and not Twitter because he owned ""a lot more"" of them. The shares will be sold over time, which could impact on their value and the overall size of the donation. Once the Covid-19 pandemic has been ""disarmed"", the funds will go toward girls health and education and research into universal basic income. In a six-part Twitter thread, Mr Dorsey said he wanted to donate to causes where he could see an impact in his lifetime. The donations will be made through a limited liability company. It is a tool many wealth individuals use for donations, but is often criticized for a lack of transparency. Mr Dorsey sought to get ahead of this charge by posting a link to agoogle doc,externalwhich will publicly track the funds donations. The Twitter boss is not the only tech billionaire to pledge part of their wealth towards coronavirus-related efforts. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has committed $30m, the bulk of which is focused on efforts to create a treatment. Amazon's Jeff Bezos has donated $100m to food banks in the US to help those struggling with hunger during this period. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook announced in March the company would donate medical supplies to Italy which has been hit hard by the virus.

WHO chief calls for end of virus 'politicisation',"This video can not be played World Health Organization head: 'Do not politicise this virus' The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged unity, as the agency comes under continued fire from US President Donald Trump. Speaking on Wednesday, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus defended the WHO's work and called for an end to the politicisation of Covid-19. The Ethiopian also said that he had received deaths threats and has been subjected to racist abuse. Mr Trump said he would consider ending US funding for the UN agency. He accused the WHO of being ""very China-centric""and said they ""really blew"" their pandemic response. Dr Tedros has now dismissed the comments, insisting: ""We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind."" After first attacking the WHO the previous day, President Trump renewed his criticism at his news briefing on Wednesday, saying the organisation must ""get its priorities right"". He said the US would conduct a study to decide whether it would continue paying contributions, Also answering questions at the briefing on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the administration was ""re-evaluating our funding"" of the WHO, adding; ""Organisations have to work. They have to deliver the outcomes for which they were intended"". Covid-19 first emerged last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has just ended an 11-week lockdown. An advisor to the WHO chief earlier said their close work with China had been ""absolutely essential"" in understanding the disease in its early stages. Mr Trump's attacks on the WHO come in the context of criticism of his own administration's handling of the pandemic, especially early problems with testing. The WHO approved a coronavirus test in January - but the US decided against using it, developing its own test instead. However, in February, when the testing kits were despatched, some of them didn't work properly and led to inconclusive results. Public health experts say the delay enabled the virus to spread further within the US. ""Please, unity at national level, no using Covid or political points,"" Dr Tedros said. ""Second, honest solidarity at the global level. And honest leadership from the US and China. ""The most powerful should lead the way and please quarantine Covid politics,"" he appealed, in comments seen as a response to Mr Trump, who said on Tuesday the WHO appeared to be ""very biased toward China"".

They really - they missed the call,"" Mr Trump said. ""And we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we're going to see."" The Ethiopian at the heart of the coronavirus fight Coronavirus: Things the US has got wrong - and got right The US is one of the agency's largest voluntary funders, with WHO data suggesting they contribute 15% to its overall budget. This video can not be played President Trump criticises the WHO for the second evening in a row Dr Tedros said that he had been at the receiving end of racist comments for the past two to three months. ""Giving me names, black or negro,"" he said. ""I'm proud of being black, or proud of being negro."" He then said he had got death threats, adding - ""I don't give a damn."" Referring to the abuse, he said it had originated from Taiwan, ""and the foreign ministry didn't disassociate"" itself from it. But Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen dismissed this, saying her country is against discrimination. ""For years, we have been excluded from international organisations, and we know better than anyone else what it feels like to be discriminated against and isolated,"" Reuters quoted her as saying. Taiwan, which is excluded from the WHObecause of China's objections to its membership, has said it has been unable to access important information during the coronavirus outbreak. The WHO denies this. On Wednesday Dr Tedros played down the financial threat, saying he believed that US funding would continue. United Nations Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres had earlier added his voice to the defence of the organisation. He described the outbreak as ""unprecedented"" and said any assessment of how it was handled should be an issue for the future. ""Now is the time for unity, for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus and its shattering consequences,"" he said. French President Emmanuel Macron also reportedly offered his support to the WHO in a call to Dr Tedros on Wednesday. ""He reaffirmed his trust, his support for the institution and refuses to see it locked into a war between China and the USA,"" a French presidency official told Reuters news agency. By David Willis, BBC North America correspondent Facing growing criticism over his handling of this crisis, President Trump is now seeking to pin the blame for the spread of the coronavirus on the World Health Organization. Officials at the UN agency criticised his decision to impose a ban on travellers entering the US from China at the end of January - a move the president has since touted as crucial to controlling the spread of the virus - and with conservative commentators and some Senate Republicans taking to the airwaves to denounce the Geneva-based body, Mr Trump has clearly decided it would be politically expedient to join them. He sees the WHO as being biased towards China, and believes it was too unquestioning of the early information about Covid-19 that came from the Chinese. The WHO is not above criticism, particularly for its early assertion that human transmission had not been proven, and its reticence later on to declare a pandemic. But even some of the president's leading supporters are questioning the timing of his threat to withhold funding for the world's leading health organisation - coming, as it does, at the height of a global pandemic.

Kazakh family win Unexplained Wealth Order battleA High Court judge overturns an order to seize three multimillion-pound London homes.UK,"The mansion at The Bishops Avenue - known as Billionaires' Row - in Hampstead is the family home of Nurali Aliyev Two members of Kazakhstan's political elite have won a High Court challenge against Unexplained Wealth Orders. The orders centred on three multimillion-pound London homes worth more than Â£80m and owned by the daughter and grandson of the former Kazakh president. After winning the court challenge, the pair said they felt ""vindicated"". The National Crime Agency - which obtained the orders to seize their homes last May - said it will appeal. The three London homes are owned for the benefit of Nurali Aliyev and his leading Kazakh politician mother, Dariga Nazarbayeva. Dr Nazarbayeva with The Queen and Prince Andrew in 2015 The National Crime Agency suspected all three of the mega properties in London were bought with riches embezzled by Mr Aliyev's notorious and now dead father, Rakhat Aliyev. Rakhat Aliyev once styled himself ""Godfather-in-law"" and was accused of crimes including murder, before his own death in prison. Mr Aliyev and Dr Nazarbayeva denied all wrongdoing and said they can prove independent and legitimate wealth for their UK property investments. They applied to the High Court to discharge the UWOs. Unexplained Wealth Order focuses on London mansion Giving judgment remotely on Wednesday, Mrs Justice Lang overturned all three of the orders. She ruled that ""the NCA's assumption"" that Rakhat Aliyev was the source of the money used to buy the three properties was ""unreliable"". Unexplained Wealth Orders were powers brought into force in January 2018 in the fight against suspected criminal money invested in property. National Crime Agency investigators can use UWOs to require owners to disclose how they managed to buy a luxury home. If they do not agree with the explanation, they can then ask the courts to confiscate it. UWOs are sometimes known as ""McMafia laws"" - named after the BBC organised crime drama based on a book. The properties were identified in an investigation by BBC News,Finance Uncovered,externalandTransparency International,externalinto the ownership of London property by members of Kazakhstan's political elite. A high security mansion at 33 The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead - one of the most expensive roads in Britain known as ""Billionaires' Row"". The 10-bedroom home has an underground pool, ""tropical showers"", a glass domed roof, a dedicated cinema and separate quarters for staff A mega apartment in a luxury secure development at 21 Manresa Road, Chelsea, constructed following a multi-million pound merger of two already enormous flats Another secure mansion at 32 Denewood Road, Highgate, a private cul-de-sac with views over one of London's most exclusive golf clubs The judge added there was ""cogent evidence"" that Dr Nazarbayeva and Nurali Aliyev had founded the companies which owned the homes, and provided the money to pay for them. In a statement, Nurali Aliyev called the NCA's investigation ""flawed"" and ""entirely without merit"". ""The NCA deliberately ignored the relevant information I voluntarily provided and pursued a groundless and vicious legal action, including making shocking slurs against me, my family and my country,"" he said. A spokesman for Dr Nazarbayeva added: ""Today's judgment has entirely vindicated Dr Nazarbayeva. She is pleased that the court has agreed with her that the NCA's investigations were flawed and that she has not been involved in any wrongdoing. ""It is frustrating and disappointing that she has had to take this action to fight these draconian proceedings and clear her name."" Graeme Biggar, the head of the NCA's national economic crime centre, said they ""always expected there would be significant legal challenge"" over the use of UWOs. ""We disagree with this decision to discharge the UWOs and will be filing an appeal. These hearings will establish the case law on which future judgments will be based, so it is vital that we get this right,"" he said. ""The NCA is tenacious. We have been very clear that we will use all the legislation at our disposal to pursue suspected illicit finance and we will continue to do so.""

PM's condition 'improving' in intensive careThe update on Boris Johnson's health comes as a record 938 UK virus deaths are reported in a day.,"Boris Johnson was moved to intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital in London on Monday Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ""improving"" after two nights in intensive care with coronavirus, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. Mr Johnson was now sitting up in bed and ""engaging positively"" with the clinical team at St Thomas' Hospital in London, the chancellor added. Mr Sunak also said a Cobra meeting on Thursday would discuss ""the approach"" to take in reviewing lockdown measures. It comes as a record 938 daily deaths were reported in UK hospitals. The total number of UK deaths now stands at 7,097, according tothe latest Department of Health figures,external. Coronavirus: How to understand the death toll What is an intensive care unit? Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50? The PM was taken to St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday - 10 days after testing positive for the virus - and was then moved to intensive care on Monday. At the daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Mr Sunak said Mr Johnson was ""receiving excellent care from the NHS team at St Thomas'"". ""The prime minister is not only my colleague and my boss but also my friend and my thoughts are with him and his family,"" he said. Later, Downing Street said the prime minister ""continues to make steady progress"" but remained in intensive care. This video can not be played Boris Johnson ""sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team."" - Sunak Though the daily rise in deaths was larger than the previous highest toll of 786 - on Tuesday - the deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Dame Angela McLean, said new cases were not ""accelerating out of control"". But NHS England medical director Stephen Powis warned now was not the time to become ""complacent"". He said: ""We are beginning to see the benefits, I believe (of the government's lockdown measures), but the really critical thing, I believe, is that we have to continue following instructions, we have to continue following social distancing, because if we don't, the virus will start to spread again."" By Philippa Roxby, BBC health reporter The number of deaths reported today (938) is a new high for the coronavirus epidemic in the UK, but it is still lower than expected if deaths had been following their long-term trend of doubling every three to four days. The daily figure is, however, closing in on Italy's worst day of deaths on 27 March. There are cautious hopes that Italy - which has reached 17,127 total deaths - has turned a corner, and in Spain too - with a total of 14,555 deaths - figures show the death toll is on a downward trend. So what about the UK? Numbers of new daily cases of coronavirus may give us a clue. In the past week, they have stayed relatively constant at around 4-5,000. With more people being tested every day as part of the government's plans to ramp up testing to NHS staff, as well as hospital patients, steady numbers of cases suggest there could be the light at the end of the tunnel. The number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid-19 and being taken to intensive care are also showing signs of levelling off. So it is now hoped, that with nearly three weeks of social distancing behind us, the number of people dying will soon start to show the same pattern. This video can not be played Deputy chief scientific adviser: Coronavirus spread 'not accelerating' Mr Sunak said Thursday's Cobra meeting would discuss the approach the government would be taking towards reviewing lockdown measures. According tothe government's coronavirus legislation,external, the health secretary must review the need for restrictions -announced by Mr Johnson on 23 March- at least once every 21 days, with the first review to be carried out by 16 April. Mr Sunak said the review would happen ""around"" the three-weeks point, which would be based on evidence that will ""only be available next week"". ""I think rather than speculate about the future, I think we should focus very seriously on the here and now and the present,"" he added.

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health The chancellor alsounveiled a Â£750m funding package to keep struggling charities afloatduring the pandemic. The measures, which involve cash grants direct to charities providing key services during the crisis, follow concern that some charities are facing collapse because of enforced shop closures. Mr Sunak added, however, it was ""simply not possible"" to ""save every single job, protect every single business or indeed every single charity"". Karl Wilding, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said the move was an important first step but warned ""it will not be enough to prevent good charities around the country from closing their doors"". He estimated charities were set to lose out on Â£4bn in fundraising between March and June, in addition to facing rising costs. And shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds, who wasappointed to the roleafter Sir Keir Starmer became Labour's new leader, said the announcement was welcome but fell ""far short"" of filling the financial ""black hole"" many organisations were facing. Asked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether the crisis would lead to a recession, Mr Sunak said: ""I have been very honest that this will have a significant impact on our economy."" He added that the government had put in place ""an enormous amount of support to help as many people as possible to get through this"".

Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food,"Tesco has said that most food will still need to be purchased in-store amid the coronavirus pandemic. The supermarket giant said it wasn't able to meet demand as more shoppers stay at home, despite the fact it has increased its online grocery shopping capacity by more than 20%. It said in the first weeks of the virus, there was ""significant panic buying"", with sales up almost a third. Tesco said that had now subsided with food stocks ""returning to normal"". ""Between 85% and 90% of all food bought will require a visit to a store and here significant changes to the store environment have been implemented to maximise safety for colleagues and customers,"" chief executive Dave Lewis said. Mr Lewis said that during its peak week of stockpiling, Tesco sold: 3.1 million containers of liquid soap, an increase of 363% 6 million tins of beans, more than double the usual amount 3.3 million tins of tomatoes, up 115% compared to a typical week 3.6 million packets of toilet roll, an increase of 76% In contrast, he said sales of clothing and fuel both fell by 70%. The chain said it would continue trying to ""prioritise home delivery for the most vulnerable in society"". Mr Lewis said that Tesco normally operates 660,000 home delivery slots but it is now running around 805,000. He said that last Friday night, the government gave Tesco a list of 110,000 names of people it classed as vulnerable. The supermarket has contacted these people and offered them slots. The statement came as the chain reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profit for the year to the end of February, down almost 19% to Â£1.3bn, largely due to restructuring costs in Europe. The chain also said it was impossible to forecast sales for 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tesco said the virus could add almost Â£1bn in extra costs due to extra staff and store expenses. It said it had already experienced a ""significant absence"" of staff amid the virus and had recruited more than 45,000 new staff over the past two weeks to cope with the heightened demand. Mr Lewis said some 50,000 colleagues have been absent out of about 320,000 employees. The supermarket has also agreed to pay a dividend of 6.5p to shareholders, based on its last financial year. Tesco is asking those who can come into store to do so This has attracted some criticism as the grocer has benefitted from a business rates holiday to the tune of Â£585m while seeing record sales during the coronavirus crisis. Tesco also intends to pay a dividend on the current financial year, though at a lower level. The supermarket giant reported group sales up 1.3% to Â£64.8bn. Like-for-like sales, which strips out revenue from new shops opened during the year to February, fell 0.6%. Same store sales in the UK fell by 0.6%. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Some people will ask if [paying dividends] is appropriate"" at the moment. ""If you're seen to be benefitting from emergency measures such as state aid or the furloughing scheme, companies need to be very careful in terms of perception right now."" ""But it's not an entirely straightforward question, there might be some staff who are investors who are looking forward to those dividends,"" he added. All the major supermarkets had restricted customers to buying fixed numbers of individual items to keep shelves full amid stockpiling. Supermarkets have been super busy these last few weeks. Stockpiling and the knock-on effects of pubs, restaurants and cafes in lockdown have seen an unprecedented increase in sales. But the sales bonanza in feeding the nation is coming at a significant cost. Tesco says the full financial impact is impossible to predict but reckons that it could mean nearly Â£1bn in extra costs. Much of that is through staffing, including the bill for the hiring of 45,000 workers to cope with the surge in demand and cover staff who get sick. Tesco thinks if customer behaviour is returned to normal by the end of the summer, these additional expenses could be offset by higher food sales and the Â£585m it will save from not having to pay business rates thanks to the tax relief introduced by the Government last month. However, Tesco and other retailers such as Aldi, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury's have since removed some limits and changed others. Tesco now operates a three-item limit on its most sought-after items including pasta, toilet paper and hand sanitiser.

Trump attacks 'China-centric' UN agency over virus,"This video can not be played Trump offers ventilators to countries ""desperate"" for them US President Donald Trump has attacked the World Health Organization (WHO) for being too ""China-centric"" in its tackling of the coronavirus pandemic. ""The WHO really blew it,"" the president said, adding that he was considering withdrawing funding to the UN agency. The US is one of the agency's largest voluntary contributors. The WHO later rejected Mr Trump's comments, saying that working closely with China was ""absolutely essential"" in understanding the disease. Covid-19 first emerged last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has just ended an 11-week lockdown. LIVE: Wuhan's 11-week lockdown finally ends Coronavirus: Things the US has got wrong - and got right On Tuesday, Mr Trump accused the WHO of being biased towards China in how it issued its guidance during the outbreak. The president has himself faced criticism for his administration's slow response to the pandemic, including problems with early testing. The US decided against using a coronavirus test approved by the WHOin January, in favour of a test being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In February, the CDC despatched testing kits across the US - but some of them did not work properly, and led to inconclusive results. Although the US is now carrying hundreds of thousands of tests a day, critics say that the early testing failures were crucial in allowing the virus to spread more widely. President Trump also often downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak during this period. Speaking during the daily Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said his administration would take ""a good look"" at its contributions to the WHO, while questioning some of the UN agency's advice. ""They called it wrong,"" he said, adding: ""They really, they missed the call. Fortunately, I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?"" On US financial contributions to the WHO, he said: ""We're going to put a hold on money spent... we're going to put a very powerful hold on it and we're going to see."" His remarks came asthe US recorded a daily death toll from Covid-19 of more than 1,800. The country has nearly 400,000 known infections, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. A UN spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, rejected Mr Trump's criticism, saying that the WHO's Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had ""done tremendous work"" in providing guidance as Covid-19 travelled around the world. ""For the Secretary General [Antonio Guterres], it is clear that the WHO... is showing the strength of the international health system,"" Mr Dujarric said, adding that the agency was supporting numerous countries with equipment and training. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Dr Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-Chinese mission on Covid-19, responded to Mr Trump's comments by saying it was ""absolutely essential that we work closely with China to understand this disease"". The WHO's regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Kluge, said that now was ""not the time to cut back funding"" as the pandemic was at its acute phase. The WHO relies on funding from both government and private sources. Its funding is also split into mandatory and voluntary contributions, with the last one becoming increasingly important over the years. In the last financial year, more than 80% of WHO funds came from voluntary contributions made by governments, private organisations like charities, and other UN agencies as well as multilateral bodies like the EU. The US government is the largest of these voluntary contributors, accounting for just under 15% of WHO funding in 2019. But the next biggest was the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, making up nearly 10% of funding. Other countries which made significant voluntary contributions in 2019 include the UK (7.8%) and Germany (5.7%). It is worth adding that the US also owes the WHO most in terms of mandatory contributions. Figures for March 2020 show that the US still had more than $99m (Â£80m) in outstanding payments, much more than anyone else. Read more from Reality Check Mr Trump said the US would have an additional 110,000 ventilators coming ""over a short period of time"". However, he did not provide an exact timeline and went on to say that the majority - 60,000 devices - would not be received until 29 June. He said that this would create a surplus, and that extra ventilators could be distributed to help those ""desperate"" countries fighting the virus, including the UK. The US ""won't need anywhere near"" the additional devices that it will have at its disposal, he said. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently signed an orderallowing the state to redeploy ventilators from ""across the system"". ""There are hospitals that have ventilators, that have PPE equipment... that we are going to need,"" he said. Mr Trump said the UK had already requested 200 devices, adding: ""We're going to work it out, we've got to work it out - they've been great partners, the United Kingdom."" Ventilators are vital in the treatment of some patients suffering from coronavirus, which can cause severe respiratory issues while the infection attacks the lungs. The devices can help keep patients breathing. What are ventilators and why are they important?

Wills 'being signed on car bonnets' amid lockdown,"Normally, two independent witnesses are required to validate a will Documents have been held in place by windscreen wipers and signed on a car bonnet in a novel way for wills to be witnessed during social distancing. Signatures are also being watched through windows and patio doors as current restrictions make 200-year-old will writing laws difficult to uphold. Ministers say there are no plans to relax the strict rules. Solicitors are reporting a ""massive rise"" in demand for wills from people worried about coronavirus. Failing to correctly sign a will in front of two independent witnesses, who are physically present, in England and Wales is likely to lead to a judge ruling the document, and any legacy in it, invalid. In Scotland, the regulations are less formal, and only require one witness. The law is strict onwriting a will and ensuring it is valid,externalin England and Wales. This includes signing it in front of two independent witnesses in person, and having two people signing it in your presence. The existing law dates from 1837, the start of Queen Victoria's reign, to protect individuals at a time of less efficient record keeping, lower levels of literacy, and less advanced technology. Wills in England and Wales require two independent witnesses The witnessing rules have been tested by the lockdown, isolation, and social distancing requirements in place during the coronavirus outbreak - at a time when many people want to finalise a will at relatively short notice. This has led to people witnessing signatures over garden fences and standing in driveways, with solicitors often overseeing from a safe distance. The Law Society, the solicitors' trade body, has called on the Ministry of Justice to make changes to the law, such as allowing the careful use of video conferencing in the process. Millennials 'wrongly relying on inherited money' Coronavirus: 'I was asked for Â£430 a month for my shut nursery' Ian Bond, who chairs the society's wills and equity committee, also called on the government to follow the Australian model, where the law is the same but where judges investigate and show some flexibility in allowing wills to stand. He said there were recommendations from the Law Commission in 2017 on modernising the law that could be used as a template. But the Ministry of Justice said there were no plans to change the rules at present. ""This is a delicate area of law and we absolutely must continue to protect the elderly and vulnerable against potential fraud,"" a spokesman said. ""We will consider all options and keep this under review during the Covid-19 pandemic."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Solicitors are reporting a huge increase in demand for will writing services, as the awareness of mortality amid a pandemic increases and those with debts or legacies want to get paperwork in order. Mr Bond, who works for Talbots Law in the West Midlands, said their cases had almost doubled. Farewill, a company which takes instructions for wills online, although witnessing still needs to be done in person, has seen a 12-fold rise in enquiries from NHS workers. Telephone-based solicitors have also seen a big spike. Anyone thinking of writing a will is being urged to seek professional advice, as do-it-yourself wills from online templates can risk being illegal and invalidated. One particular area of concern is people trying to make a will shortly before they die. In family homes, loved ones named in the will are not permitted to witness a will, otherwise this would void their entitlement and they would have to forfeit their inheritance. That means independent witnesses are needed, which is difficult when someone is confined to bed and visitors should not be calling amid the current restrictions on movement. In hospital, visitors are not permitted at present, doctors and nurses are not allowed to bring potentially tainted documents to bedsides, and these professionals are concentrating on medical treatment anyway, That means someone in hospital and likely to pass away will not be able to write a last-minute will. That should, according to Mr Bond, encourage currently healthy people to get round to the job of writing a will which is often put off to deal with more pressing things at home or work. There are rules about who inherits an estate when somebody dies without a will. These are calledthe rules of intestacy,external, and mean that a husband, wife or civil partner, or children receive it. However, under these rules, a partner who is not married or in a civil partnership with the person who has died gets nothing.

Dr Helen Buglass, head of intensive care, said: ""We are coping at the moment but if people are silly and go to parks or socialise, we don't know if we can cope with that. ""So just please stay at home."" Staff in the emergency services will have the opportunityto play in a newly-formed inter-services football league,once the coronavirus restrictions are lifted. The Emergency Services Football League (ESFL), the idea of two West Yorkshire detectives, will see police, fire brigade, NHS and prison services staff form teams to decide the best in the country. It is hoped the league will bring the services together and increase wellbeing and morale among those involved in frontline work. ""We are hoping this will be a massive stress reliever,"" Det Con Pete Overton said. Â© 2025 BBC.

Kazakh family win Unexplained Wealth Order battleA High Court judge overturns an order to seize three multimillion-pound London homes.,"The mansion at The Bishops Avenue - known as Billionaires' Row - in Hampstead is the family home of Nurali Aliyev Two members of Kazakhstan's political elite have won a High Court challenge against Unexplained Wealth Orders. The orders centred on three multimillion-pound London homes worth more than Â£80m and owned by the daughter and grandson of the former Kazakh president. After winning the court challenge, the pair said they felt ""vindicated"". The National Crime Agency - which obtained the orders to seize their homes last May - said it will appeal. The three London homes are owned for the benefit of Nurali Aliyev and his leading Kazakh politician mother, Dariga Nazarbayeva. Dr Nazarbayeva with The Queen and Prince Andrew in 2015 The National Crime Agency suspected all three of the mega properties in London were bought with riches embezzled by Mr Aliyev's notorious and now dead father, Rakhat Aliyev. Rakhat Aliyev once styled himself ""Godfather-in-law"" and was accused of crimes including murder, before his own death in prison. Mr Aliyev and Dr Nazarbayeva denied all wrongdoing and said they can prove independent and legitimate wealth for their UK property investments. They applied to the High Court to discharge the UWOs. Unexplained Wealth Order focuses on London mansion Giving judgment remotely on Wednesday, Mrs Justice Lang overturned all three of the orders. She ruled that ""the NCA's assumption"" that Rakhat Aliyev was the source of the money used to buy the three properties was ""unreliable"". Unexplained Wealth Orders were powers brought into force in January 2018 in the fight against suspected criminal money invested in property. National Crime Agency investigators can use UWOs to require owners to disclose how they managed to buy a luxury home. If they do not agree with the explanation, they can then ask the courts to confiscate it. UWOs are sometimes known as ""McMafia laws"" - named after the BBC organised crime drama based on a book. The properties were identified in an investigation by BBC News,Finance Uncovered,externalandTransparency International,externalinto the ownership of London property by members of Kazakhstan's political elite. A high security mansion at 33 The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead - one of the most expensive roads in Britain known as ""Billionaires' Row"". The 10-bedroom home has an underground pool, ""tropical showers"", a glass domed roof, a dedicated cinema and separate quarters for staff A mega apartment in a luxury secure development at 21 Manresa Road, Chelsea, constructed following a multi-million pound merger of two already enormous flats Another secure mansion at 32 Denewood Road, Highgate, a private cul-de-sac with views over one of London's most exclusive golf clubs The judge added there was ""cogent evidence"" that Dr Nazarbayeva and Nurali Aliyev had founded the companies which owned the homes, and provided the money to pay for them. In a statement, Nurali Aliyev called the NCA's investigation ""flawed"" and ""entirely without merit"". ""The NCA deliberately ignored the relevant information I voluntarily provided and pursued a groundless and vicious legal action, including making shocking slurs against me, my family and my country,"" he said. A spokesman for Dr Nazarbayeva added: ""Today's judgment has entirely vindicated Dr Nazarbayeva. She is pleased that the court has agreed with her that the NCA's investigations were flawed and that she has not been involved in any wrongdoing. ""It is frustrating and disappointing that she has had to take this action to fight these draconian proceedings and clear her name."" Graeme Biggar, the head of the NCA's national economic crime centre, said they ""always expected there would be significant legal challenge"" over the use of UWOs. ""We disagree with this decision to discharge the UWOs and will be filing an appeal. These hearings will establish the case law on which future judgments will be based, so it is vital that we get this right,"" he said. ""The NCA is tenacious. We have been very clear that we will use all the legislation at our disposal to pursue suspected illicit finance and we will continue to do so.""

"PM's condition 'improving' in intensive careBoris Johnson is ""sitting up in bed"" as he is treated for coronavirus, Chancellor Rishi Sunak says.UK","Boris Johnson was moved to intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital in London on Monday Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ""improving"" after two nights in intensive care with coronavirus, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. Mr Johnson was now sitting up in bed and ""engaging positively"" with the clinical team at St Thomas' Hospital in London, the chancellor added. Mr Sunak also said a Cobra meeting on Thursday would discuss ""the approach"" to take in reviewing lockdown measures. It comes as a record 938 daily deaths were reported in UK hospitals. The total number of UK deaths now stands at 7,097, according tothe latest Department of Health figures,external. Coronavirus: How to understand the death toll What is an intensive care unit? Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50? The PM was taken to St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday - 10 days after testing positive for the virus - and was then moved to intensive care on Monday. At the daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Mr Sunak said Mr Johnson was ""receiving excellent care from the NHS team at St Thomas'"". ""The prime minister is not only my colleague and my boss but also my friend and my thoughts are with him and his family,"" he said. Later, Downing Street said the prime minister ""continues to make steady progress"" but remained in intensive care. This video can not be played Boris Johnson ""sitting up in bed and engaging positively with the clinical team."" - Sunak Though the daily rise in deaths was larger than the previous highest toll of 786 - on Tuesday - the deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Dame Angela McLean, said new cases were not ""accelerating out of control"". But NHS England medical director Stephen Powis warned now was not the time to become ""complacent"". He said: ""We are beginning to see the benefits, I believe (of the government's lockdown measures), but the really critical thing, I believe, is that we have to continue following instructions, we have to continue following social distancing, because if we don't, the virus will start to spread again."" By Philippa Roxby, BBC health reporter The number of deaths reported today (938) is a new high for the coronavirus epidemic in the UK, but it is still lower than expected if deaths had been following their long-term trend of doubling every three to four days. The daily figure is, however, closing in on Italy's worst day of deaths on 27 March. There are cautious hopes that Italy - which has reached 17,127 total deaths - has turned a corner, and in Spain too - with a total of 14,555 deaths - figures show the death toll is on a downward trend. So what about the UK? Numbers of new daily cases of coronavirus may give us a clue. In the past week, they have stayed relatively constant at around 4-5,000. With more people being tested every day as part of the government's plans to ramp up testing to NHS staff, as well as hospital patients, steady numbers of cases suggest there could be the light at the end of the tunnel. The number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid-19 and being taken to intensive care are also showing signs of levelling off. So it is now hoped, that with nearly three weeks of social distancing behind us, the number of people dying will soon start to show the same pattern. This video can not be played Deputy chief scientific adviser: Coronavirus spread 'not accelerating' Mr Sunak said Thursday's Cobra meeting would discuss the approach the government would be taking towards reviewing lockdown measures. According tothe government's coronavirus legislation,external, the health secretary must review the need for restrictions -announced by Mr Johnson on 23 March- at least once every 21 days, with the first review to be carried out by 16 April. Mr Sunak said the review would happen ""around"" the three-weeks point, which would be based on evidence that will ""only be available next week"". ""I think rather than speculate about the future, I think we should focus very seriously on the here and now and the present,"" he added.

The measures, which involve cash grants direct to charities providing key services during the crisis, follow concern that some charities are facing collapse because of enforced shop closures. Mr Sunak added, however, it was ""simply not possible"" to ""save every single job, protect every single business or indeed every single charity"". Karl Wilding, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said the move was an important first step but warned ""it will not be enough to prevent good charities around the country from closing their doors"". He estimated charities were set to lose out on Â£4bn in fundraising between March and June, in addition to facing rising costs. And shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds, who wasappointed to the roleafter Sir Keir Starmer became Labour's new leader, said the announcement was welcome but fell ""far short"" of filling the financial ""black hole"" many organisations were facing. Asked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether the crisis would lead to a recession, Mr Sunak said: ""I have been very honest that this will have a significant impact on our economy.""

Government announces aid for charity sector,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a Â£750m package to keep struggling charities afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. The move follows concern that some charities are facing collapse, with income shrinking because of enforced shop closures. Bigger charities such as Oxfam and Age UK have furloughed two-thirds of staff. The measures involve cash grants direct to charities providing key services during the crisis. As part of the scheme, Â£360m will be directly allocated by government departments to those charities. Another Â£370m will go to small local charities, including those delivering food and essential medicines and providing financial advice. Announcing the move, Mr Sunak said the government could not match every pound of spending that the UK's 170,000 charities would have received this year. He also said charities were eligible for help through the government's job retention scheme. However, he said the government wanted to help the charities that were ""on the front line of fighting the coronavirus"". ""Shutting up shop at this moment would contravene their very purpose,"" he added. Mr Sunak also said the government would match all donations to the BBC's Big Night In fundraising event on 23 April, pledging a minimum of Â£20m. ""We need the gentleness of charity in our lives,"" he said. Jeff Kennedy has been using his own money to sustain the charity he runs Charity organiser Jeff Kennedy, who runs the Community First Aid Corps in Morecambe, says he has yet to study the details of the Treasury's plan, but that his organisation urgently needs help. In normal times, his six-person team provides first aid cover at public events in exchange for donations, but a string of cancellations has left the charity on the brink of going bust. Mr Kennedy said his team had found a new role in the community by collecting shopping for vulnerable people and walking their dogs, but income had dried up, while accommodation and utility bills still needed to be paid. ""We don't know whether we'll be able to come through this,"" Mr Kennedy told the BBC. ""I've been using my life savings, putting money in out of my own pocket, for a few weeks now, just to keep us afloat."" In the run-up to Mr Sunak's announcement, charities including the St John Ambulance Association had warned that they could go bust unless they received state aid. The ambulance association will now receive assistance as part of the package, as will hospices, Citizens Advice and charities dealing with vulnerable children and victims of domestic abuse. Sir John Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation, said the set of measures from the Treasury would ""offer important and welcome support for civil society at this very difficult time for us all"".

Kazakh family win Unexplained Wealth Order battle,"The mansion at The Bishops Avenue - known as Billionaires' Row - in Hampstead is the family home of Nurali Aliyev Two members of Kazakhstan's political elite have won a High Court challenge against Unexplained Wealth Orders. The orders centred on three multimillion-pound London homes worth more than Â£80m and owned by the daughter and grandson of the former Kazakh president. After winning the court challenge, the pair said they felt ""vindicated"". The National Crime Agency - which obtained the orders to seize their homes last May - said it will appeal. The three London homes are owned for the benefit of Nurali Aliyev and his leading Kazakh politician mother, Dariga Nazarbayeva. Dr Nazarbayeva with The Queen and Prince Andrew in 2015 The National Crime Agency suspected all three of the mega properties in London were bought with riches embezzled by Mr Aliyev's notorious and now dead father, Rakhat Aliyev. Rakhat Aliyev once styled himself ""Godfather-in-law"" and was accused of crimes including murder, before his own death in prison. Mr Aliyev and Dr Nazarbayeva denied all wrongdoing and said they can prove independent and legitimate wealth for their UK property investments. They applied to the High Court to discharge the UWOs. Unexplained Wealth Order focuses on London mansion Giving judgment remotely on Wednesday, Mrs Justice Lang overturned all three of the orders. She ruled that ""the NCA's assumption"" that Rakhat Aliyev was the source of the money used to buy the three properties was ""unreliable"". Unexplained Wealth Orders were powers brought into force in January 2018 in the fight against suspected criminal money invested in property. National Crime Agency investigators can use UWOs to require owners to disclose how they managed to buy a luxury home. If they do not agree with the explanation, they can then ask the courts to confiscate it. UWOs are sometimes known as ""McMafia laws"" - named after the BBC organised crime drama based on a book. The properties were identified in an investigation by BBC News,Finance Uncovered,externalandTransparency International,externalinto the ownership of London property by members of Kazakhstan's political elite. A high security mansion at 33 The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead - one of the most expensive roads in Britain known as ""Billionaires' Row"". The 10-bedroom home has an underground pool, ""tropical showers"", a glass domed roof, a dedicated cinema and separate quarters for staff A mega apartment in a luxury secure development at 21 Manresa Road, Chelsea, constructed following a multi-million pound merger of two already enormous flats Another secure mansion at 32 Denewood Road, Highgate, a private cul-de-sac with views over one of London's most exclusive golf clubs The judge added there was ""cogent evidence"" that Dr Nazarbayeva and Nurali Aliyev had founded the companies which owned the homes, and provided the money to pay for them. In a statement, Nurali Aliyev called the NCA's investigation ""flawed"" and ""entirely without merit"". ""The NCA deliberately ignored the relevant information I voluntarily provided and pursued a groundless and vicious legal action, including making shocking slurs against me, my family and my country,"" he said. A spokesman for Dr Nazarbayeva added: ""Today's judgment has entirely vindicated Dr Nazarbayeva. She is pleased that the court has agreed with her that the NCA's investigations were flawed and that she has not been involved in any wrongdoing. ""It is frustrating and disappointing that she has had to take this action to fight these draconian proceedings and clear her name."" Graeme Biggar, the head of the NCA's national economic crime centre, said they ""always expected there would be significant legal challenge"" over the use of UWOs. ""We disagree with this decision to discharge the UWOs and will be filing an appeal. These hearings will establish the case law on which future judgments will be based, so it is vital that we get this right,"" he said. ""The NCA is tenacious. We have been very clear that we will use all the legislation at our disposal to pursue suspected illicit finance and we will continue to do so.""

Drivers survive bridge collapse in Italy,"This video can not be played Italy bridge collapse: Drivers survive on quiet road Two van drivers escaped serious injury when a bridge over a river in northern Italy collapsed on Wednesday. The provincial road would normally have been busy but there was little traffic when the bridge fell, because of coronavirus lockdown measures. Images from the scene show a red courier vehicle apparently still upright on the collapsed road. The driver was hit by falling masonry and airlifted to hospital, but his injuries were described as minor. The driver of a second van was able to clamber out of his vehicle unscathed but suffering from shock, reports said. Firefighters were checking the river in case anyone else was involved. A red, Bartolini courier van was visible from a fire brigade video from the scene The condition of Italy's road bridges has come under close scrutiny ever since 43 people died in the collapse of the giant Morandi bridge in Genoa in August 2018. Cars fell 45m (148ft) as a 200m stretch of the structure serving the busy A10 motorway collapsed. Decaying steel rods suspending the bridge were blamed for the disaster. The bridge was operated by Autostrade per l'Italia, a subsidiary of the Atlantia company. This latest bridge collapse took place 100km further east. The bridge links the regions of Liguria and Tuscany. Italian officials said the structure over the River Magra was some 400m in length and around 7-8m in height. Residents in Caprigliola, the closest town to the bridge, said they heard a loud bang at around 10:20 local time (08:20 GMT) on Wednesday morning, followed by the sound of tumbling masonry. It soon emerged that motorists had reported a crack in the bridge after a period of bad weather last November. One of the van drivers managed to clamber out of his vehicle The bridge was repaired and then inspected by technicians before being given the all clear. It had previously been run by the local authority in Massa Carrara, the province on the Tuscany side, but then placed under the control of Anas, a firm run by state-owned railway group Ferrovie dello Stato. ""It's a sheer stroke of luck that a collapse hasn't turned into a tragedy - because of a lack of traffic caused by the coronavirus emergency,"" said Michele de Pascale, head of the Italian provinces union UPI. He warned that Italy's provinces had been saying for some time that the country's infrastructure was crying out for urgent maintenance. A local mayor, Roberto Valettini, said he had sent three letters to the bridge operator warning about the bridge.

'Drop in global trade to be worse than 2008 crisis',"Coronavirus has halted many global deliveries The World Trade Organization (WTO) is predicting a severe decline in international commerce this year. In a new report the WTO forecasts a contraction of between 13% and 32% this year. The wide range of possibilities reflects the uncertainties about the health crisis. It says the impact on trade is likely to exceed the slump caused by the financial crisis just over a decade ago. The more pessimistic case would amount to a decline in global trade similar to what happened in the great depression 90 years ago but in shorter period of time. The WTO's director general Roberto Azevedo described the figures as ""ugly"". ""There is no getting round that"", he said. He said the situation was first and foremost a health crisis and he acknowledged that governments had to take steps to protect people's lives. ""The unavoidable declines in trade and output will have painful consequences for households and businesses, on top of the human suffering caused by the disease itself,"" he added. A decline of 13% in trade in goods is described in the report as a relatively optimistic scenario. It reflects a steep drop in trade followed by a recovery starting in the second half of 2020. That of course would need to be based on substantial progress over the next few months in getting on top of the health crisis. That is obviously not guaranteed, so the report includes a much more pessimistic case which reflects a steeper initial decline and a more prolonged and incomplete recovery. The report also warns that ""the extent of uncertainty is very high, and it is well within the realm of possibilities that for both 2020 and 2021 the outcomes could be above or below these results"". The report says that the growth in global trade had already stalled towards the end of last year.  By the final quarter of 2019 goods trade was 1% lower than a year earlier. The WTO says this was the result of  ""persistent trade tensions"", a reference that to a large extent reflects the confrontational approach to international commerce taken by the administration of President Donald Trump. Mr Azevedo said trade would be an important ingredient in the economic recovery after the crisis. He said keeping markets open and predictable would be critical.

Marathon talks over EU virus rescue package stall,"Italy has been struggling with huge debt since before the coronavirus crisis EU talks on how to help southern Eurozone countries badly affected by the coronavirus epidemic have stalled after 16 hours. The European Central Bank says the bloc may need up to â¬1.5tn ($1.6 trillion; Â£1.3tn) to tackle the crisis. European finance ministers were close to a deal, but the talks broke down amid a dispute between Italy and the Netherlands over how to apply the recovery fund. Negotiations will resume on Thursday. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep divisions in Europe, where Italy and Spain have accused northern nations - led by Germany and the Netherlands - of not doing enough. European Commission First Vice-President Frans Timmermans criticised the Dutch response, warning that ""the EU as we know it will not survive this"" if the split continued. ""Everyone now needs to appreciate the need for solidarity,"" the former Dutch minister wrote in De Volkskrant, arguing for ""new instrumentsâ¦ [to] show that in Europe too the strongest shoulders bear the heaviest burdens "". Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has similarly warned the bloc could ""fall apart"" if a solution cannot be found. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health The row comes asthe EU's top scientist, Mauro Ferrari, resigned citing Brussels' ""disappointing"" response to the pandemic. The European Research Group's Scientific Council said later that its members had ""unanimously"" called for his resignation nearly two weeks ago, alleging that Prof Ferrari had not taken part in important meetings and had spent too much time in the US. Italy, Spain, France and some other EU states want to share out coronavirus-incurred debt in the form of ""coronabonds"" (or eurobonds) - mutualised debt that all EU nations help to pay off. An all-night teleconference between Eurozone finance ministers to discuss this started on Tuesday and went on for 16 hours, but Italy refused to back down on its demands. The Netherlands opposes the proposal, and wants member states to have repayment conditions phased in over the years. For now, a draft text of what has been agreed states that ""innovative financial agreements"" will need to be used. The meeting's chairman, Portuguese Finance Minister Mario Centeno, said he had suspended the talks until Thursday but was still seeking a strong safety net against the effects of the virus.

Some from these hard-hit nations have been angered by a perceived indifference from other EU states. The Dutch and their allies want to use an existing bailout fund known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). ""Because of the current crisis we have to make an exception and the ESM can be used unconditionally to cover medical costs,"" said Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra. ""For the long term economic support we think it's sensible to combine the use of the ESM with certain economic conditions."" Coronavirus outbreak eats into EU unity Europe ramps up coronavirus support for ailing firms Visual guide to the economic impact of the pandemic Italy remains at the centre of the crisis in Europe, with the highest death toll - more than 17,000; next comes Spain, with nearly 14,000 deaths, Johns Hopkins University data shows. Even before the economic damage of this crisis, Italy's public debt was 133% of its GDP (total output), or about $2.3tn (Â£2tn) - the highest in the eurozone after Greece.

Public opinion has also been shifting in Germany.

Drivers survive bridge collapse in ItalyThe bridge would normally have been busy but lockdown measures meant there was little traffic.,"This video can not be played Italy bridge collapse: Drivers survive on quiet road Two van drivers escaped serious injury when a bridge over a river in northern Italy collapsed on Wednesday. The provincial road would normally have been busy but there was little traffic when the bridge fell, because of coronavirus lockdown measures. Images from the scene show a red courier vehicle apparently still upright on the collapsed road. The driver was hit by falling masonry and airlifted to hospital, but his injuries were described as minor.

Trump says US will have surplus of ventilators,"This video can not be played Trump offers ventilators to countries ""desperate"" for them US President Donald Trump has attacked the World Health Organization (WHO) for being too ""China-centric"" in its tackling of the coronavirus pandemic. ""The WHO really blew it,"" the president said, adding that he was considering withdrawing funding to the UN agency. The US is one of the agency's largest voluntary contributors. The WHO later rejected Mr Trump's comments, saying that working closely with China was ""absolutely essential"" in understanding the disease. Covid-19 first emerged last December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, which has just ended an 11-week lockdown. LIVE: Wuhan's 11-week lockdown finally ends Coronavirus: Things the US has got wrong - and got right On Tuesday, Mr Trump accused the WHO of being biased towards China in how it issued its guidance during the outbreak. The president has himself faced criticism for his administration's slow response to the pandemic, including problems with early testing. The US decided against using a coronavirus test approved by the WHOin January, in favour of a test being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In February, the CDC despatched testing kits across the US - but some of them did not work properly, and led to inconclusive results. Although the US is now carrying hundreds of thousands of tests a day, critics say that the early testing failures were crucial in allowing the virus to spread more widely. President Trump also often downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak during this period. Speaking during the daily Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said his administration would take ""a good look"" at its contributions to the WHO, while questioning some of the UN agency's advice. ""They called it wrong,"" he said, adding: ""They really, they missed the call. Fortunately, I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?"" On US financial contributions to the WHO, he said: ""We're going to put a hold on money spent... we're going to put a very powerful hold on it and we're going to see."" His remarks came asthe US recorded a daily death toll from Covid-19 of more than 1,800. The country has nearly 400,000 known infections, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. A UN spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, rejected Mr Trump's criticism, saying that the WHO's Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had ""done tremendous work"" in providing guidance as Covid-19 travelled around the world. ""For the Secretary General [Antonio Guterres], it is clear that the WHO... is showing the strength of the international health system,"" Mr Dujarric said, adding that the agency was supporting numerous countries with equipment and training. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Dr Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-Chinese mission on Covid-19, responded to Mr Trump's comments by saying it was ""absolutely essential that we work closely with China to understand this disease"". The WHO's regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Kluge, said that now was ""not the time to cut back funding"" as the pandemic was at its acute phase. The WHO relies on funding from both government and private sources. Its funding is also split into mandatory and voluntary contributions, with the last one becoming increasingly important over the years. In the last financial year, more than 80% of WHO funds came from voluntary contributions made by governments, private organisations like charities, and other UN agencies as well as multilateral bodies like the EU. The US government is the largest of these voluntary contributors, accounting for just under 15% of WHO funding in 2019. But the next biggest was the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, making up nearly 10% of funding. Other countries which made significant voluntary contributions in 2019 include the UK (7.8%) and Germany (5.7%). It is worth adding that the US also owes the WHO most in terms of mandatory contributions. Figures for March 2020 show that the US still had more than $99m (Â£80m) in outstanding payments, much more than anyone else. Read more from Reality Check Mr Trump said the US would have an additional 110,000 ventilators coming ""over a short period of time"". However, he did not provide an exact timeline and went on to say that the majority - 60,000 devices - would not be received until 29 June. He said that this would create a surplus, and that extra ventilators could be distributed to help those ""desperate"" countries fighting the virus, including the UK. The US ""won't need anywhere near"" the additional devices that it will have at its disposal, he said. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently signed an orderallowing the state to redeploy ventilators from ""across the system"". ""There are hospitals that have ventilators, that have PPE equipment... that we are going to need,"" he said. Mr Trump said the UK had already requested 200 devices, adding: ""We're going to work it out, we've got to work it out - they've been great partners, the United Kingdom."" Ventilators are vital in the treatment of some patients suffering from coronavirus, which can cause severe respiratory issues while the infection attacks the lungs.

Air pollution plummets across UK amid lockdown,"Pollution from cars has dropped significantly across the UK Air pollution levels in the UK have dropped significantly in the two weeks since the country went into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus. Some cities have seen nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels fall by up to 60% on the same period last year, analysis shows. NO2, released from car exhausts, is a serious air pollutant and also indirectly contributes to the warming of the planet. Campaigners said they hoped it would lead to a permanent change. Jenny Bates, a Friends of the Earth clean air campaigner, said: ""Seeing this drop in air pollution shows that less traffic can quickly lead to cleaner air. ""Once this dreadful situation is over, we don't want to rush to go back to where we were or worse, and we can't have an accelerated return to business as usual. ""We can have a better, cleaner future for ourselves and the planet."" On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged peopleto work from homeand avoid non-essential travel, going on to close schools and instruct people to stay homeexcept for very limited reasons. A week later, Mr Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Daily readings from air quality monitoring stations since 17 March were compared to the same period last year, accounting for weekdays. Analysis by the BBC Shared Data Unit found an even starker drop in air pollution since the lockdown was announced on 23 March compared to the same period last year - halving at some of the most polluted sites, including readings in London, Glasgow, Bristol and Oxford. The A472 in Hafodyrynysin Caerphilly county, Wales, is known for having some of the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide outside of central London. William Bloss, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Birmingham, said: ""What we're seeing in the lockdown... is the reductions in road traffic in our cities translating into much lower levels of NO2. ""We're seeing the reductions are greatest in areas most heavily-influenced by road traffic, so city centres, roads in London, Birmingham and other urban centres."" A roadside station in Chatham, Kent, has seen its pollution readings halve since the same two-week period last year. Ecologist Simon Curry, who also sits on Medway Council, said: ""I'm doing my once-a-day exercise and there's a lot more birdsong that's audible, which is a nice thing to hear."" Ecologist Simon Curry said he was saving an hour in travel time to and from meetings by having them online He said when the lockdown ends people should be asking themselves ""if it's essential for us to drive or if we could walk instead"". ""But there's a definite downside to this data,"" he added. ""There are a lot of businesses that are not going to make it through this."" A Defra spokesperson said: ""As we all make changes to our lives and stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives, it's important that we also understand how these changes will affect air quality and its impact on public health in the UK. ""That is why, while early signs show air pollution has dropped during this unprecedented time, we have launched a call for evidence to ensure we can fully understand the impact that coronavirus is having on air quality.""

US records highest Covid-19 deaths in single day,"The US has the highest number of recorded coronavirus cases in the world The US recorded the most coronavirus deaths in a single day with more than 1,800 fatalities reported on Tuesday. It brings the total number of deaths in the country to nearly 13,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has more than 402,000 confirmed cases, the highest number in the world. Global cases have exceeded 1.4 million. However during a news conference President Donald Trump said the US might be getting to the top of the ""curve"". Meanwhile the city of Wuhan in China, where the infection first emerged,ended its 11-week lockdown. LIVE: Wuhan's 11-week lockdown finally ends This video can not be played Learn how Wuhan dealt with the lockdown The new figures announced on Tuesday are up on the previous record of 1,344 which was recorded on 4 April. But a revised forecast released on Wednesday by the University of Washington has predicted a lower total death count in the US, estimating that around 60,000 Americans could die from Covid-19. The family of American singer-songwriter John Prine has confirmed his death from complications related to coronavirus. Many musicians have paid tribute to John Prine who died on Tuesday from complications related to coronavirus Known for songs such as Angel from Montgomery and Sam Stone, Prine died in Nashville on Tuesday at the age of 73.  His wife tested positive for coronavirus and recovered however Prine was hospitalised last month with symptoms and placed on a ventilator.

Widely considered the epicentre of the outbreak,it recorded 779 deaths on Tuesday. New York City has seen over 4,000 deaths thus far. It is on the cusp of overtaking the entire country of Italy with its number of confirmed cases. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state appeared to be nearing the peak of its pandemic.

It was thought that as many as 240,000 people in the US could die in the pandemic, according to the president's task force. He also said the US might be getting to the top of the ""curve"" of the outbreak. Mr Trump said the US could see fewer deaths than predicted During the briefing, he also attacked the World Health Organization (WHO), saying it had issued bad advice and had been too focused on China. ""The WHO really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,"" he said. He also said the US would be withholding money meant for the WHO. The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres addressed Mr Trump's comments through a spokesman on Wednesday. ""The World Health Organization must be supported as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against Covid-19,"" the spokesman said.

"Twitter boss pledges $1bn for coronavirus reliefJack Dorsey said he would give 28% of his wealth towards efforts to ""disarm"" the pandemic.","Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter and payment app Square, has said he will donate $1bn (Â£810m) towards efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. According to Mr Dorsey, the donation represented approximately 28% of his wealth. He made the announcement on Twitter, writing that the ""needs are increasingly urgent"". Mr Dorsey did not lay out exactly where the funds would be sent to help in the battle against Covid-19. In the US there is a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment, and business and individuals are also struggling economically. Mr Dorsey will use shares he owns in Square to fund the donations which will be distributed through the Start Small Foundation. The 43-year-old is the chief executive of both Twitter and Square. He said he was using shares of Square and not Twitter because he owned ""a lot more"" of them. The shares will be sold over time, which could impact on their value and the overall size of the donation. Once the Covid-19 pandemic has been ""disarmed"", the funds will go toward girls health and education and research into universal basic income. In a six-part Twitter thread, Mr Dorsey said he wanted to donate to causes where he could see an impact in his lifetime. The donations will be made through a limited liability company. It is a tool many wealth individuals use for donations, but is often criticized for a lack of transparency. Mr Dorsey sought to get ahead of this charge by posting a link to agoogle doc,externalwhich will publicly track the funds donations. The Twitter boss is not the only tech billionaire to pledge part of their wealth towards coronavirus-related efforts. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has committed $30m, the bulk of which is focused on efforts to create a treatment. Amazon's Jeff Bezos has donated $100m to food banks in the US to help those struggling with hunger during this period.

"Keep cats indoors during outbreak, vets recommend","Veterinary scientists have recommended cat owners keep their pets indoors to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus among animals. But the British Veterinary Association stressed ""owners should not worry"" about risk of infection from pets. ""There isn't a single case of a pet dog or cat infecting a human with Covid-19,"" Dr Angel Almendros, from City University in Hong Kong, told BBC News. Research has shown cats may be able to catch the virus from other cats. Dr Almendros added that it would be sensible to keep cats indoors - where it is safe and possible to do so - during the outbreak. How the pandemic is putting the spotlight on wildlife trade The race to find the source of coronavirus in wildlife There is no evidence that cats or dogs can become sick or infect people The British Veterinary Association (BVA) president Daniella Dos Santos told BBC News she agreed with that advice. But the association has since clarified that its recommendation to concerned pet-owners is to take the precaution of keeping cats indoors ""only if someone in their own household showed symptoms"". Every pet-owner though should ""practise good hand hygiene,"" she said. ""An animal's fur could carry the virus for a time if a pet were to have come into contact with someone who was sick."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash In a recent paper on the subject, Dr Angel Almendros referred to the case of a 17-year-old pet dog in Hong Kong that tested positive for the Covid-19 virus,external- apparently infected by its owner. ""But even where we have these positive results, the animals are not becoming sick,"" he said. ""As in the previous Sars-Cov outbreak in Hong Kong, in 2003, where a number of pets were infected but never became sick, there is no evidence that dogs or cats could become sick or infect people."" It appears cats may be susceptible to infection from respiratory droplets - virus particles suspended in air that people cough, sneeze or breathe out. Following a case in Belgium where a cat tested positive about a week after its owner showed symptoms,scientists in China carried out lab tests that provided evidence of infected cats transmitting the virus to other cats.,external More recently,the US Centers for Disease Control confirmed that two pet cats in New York that showed mild respiratory symptoms had tested positive for the disease,external. ""It is interesting to note in the experimental evidence that cats can become infected,alongside the apparent infection of a tiger [at Bronx Zoo in New York],""Prof Bryan Charleston, director of the UK's Pirbright Institute, which specialises in the study of infectious disease, said, adding that the ""evidence on the transmissibility"" from humans to other animals was building. One of the Bronx Zoo's Malayan tigers There is also evidence humans can transmit respiratory infections to wild great apes, which makesthe global spread of Covid-19 a concern for conservationists working to protect critically endangered animals, including gorillas. In all of these cases though, it is infected humans that pose the threat to other species. Dr Almendros told BBC News: ""We know that the virus did make the jump from an animal into humans [at the beginning of this crisis]"". But, he explained, that this appeared to be linked to people eating those animals. There is no evidence that domestic animals can pass this disease back to people. ""Treat pets like other people in your household. So if you're feeling sick, it's better not to interact with them,"" said Dr Almendros. ""I hope pet owners can sleep a bit better with the right advice and information,"" he added. ""It isn't easy these days, I know.""

North-South EU divide clouds coronavirus meeting,"This Basque company making rubber gloves may be thriving but the Spanish economy as a whole is in difficulties The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep divides in Europe, with EU member states arguing over how to tackle the economic fallout. Italy and Spain have accused northern nations - led by Germany and the Netherlands - of not doing enough. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has even warned that if the EU fails to come up with an ambitious plan to help member states saddled with debt by the fight against coronavirus, the bloc could ""fall apart"". EU Council and Commission chiefs released a statement on Monday,externalthat said a ""strong package is in the making"". A teleconference between Eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday went on for seven hours and was set to continue through to Wednesday morning after Italy refused to back down on its demands. A similar meeting two weeks ago bore little fruit. As a result, leaders sent their finance ministers back to the drawing board. Italy, Spain, France and some other EU states want to share out coronavirus-incurred debt in the form of ""coronabonds"" (or eurobonds) - mutualised debt that all EU nations help pay off. Some from these hard-hit nations have been angered by a perceived indifference from other EU states. Coronavirus outbreak eats into EU unity Europe ramps up coronavirus support for ailing firms Visual guide to the economic impact of the pandemic Wealthier countries like Germany are not yet digging deeper into their pockets to help out poorer nations like Italy and Spain. Italy remains the epicentre of the crisis in Europe, with the highest death toll - more than 17,000; next comes Spain, with nearly 14,000 deaths, Johns Hopkins University data shows. Even before the economic damage of this crisis, Italy's public debt was 133% of its GDP (total output), or about $2.3tn (Â£2tn) - the highest in the eurozone after Greece. Coronavirus: Italian economy takes a body blow Germany wants to set up an EU rescue fund and lend using mechanisms set up during the financial crisis of a decade ago. This week, a group of Italian mayors and other politicians bought a page in Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper to remind Germany that it was never made to pay back its debts after World War Two. This video can not be played The BBCâs Gavin Lee took a road trip in Europe's Schengen area to see how free movement has changed Public opinion has also been shifting in Germany. Economists, politicians and commentators who once railed against mutualising eurozone debt to bail out Greece amid the last financial crisis are calling for exactly that to help Southern Europe deal with the coronavirus. Even the German tabloid Bild, that led the anti-Greece charge 10 years ago, is now calling for coronabonds. The situation today is more like a natural disaster then a crisis sparked by risky lending, the paper argues. For years some economists have urged the eurozone to issue common bonds, to address the structural fragility that the euro crisis exposed. But others, mainly in northern Europe, argue that taxpayers in wealthier countries should not have to bail out countries whose politicians were fiscally irresponsible. Finance ministers are likely to converge on three ways to prop up the economy - use of the â¬410bn ($443bn; Â£360bn) European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund; the European Investment Fund; and a European Commission scheme called SURE, a new â¬100bn fund to help workers and businesses hit by the crisis. âThere is an agreement emerging on the first three options, but that is not enough,â French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists ahead of Tuesdayâs meeting. Mr Le Maire wants a fund worth âseveral hundred billion eurosâ in joint borrowing to finance economic recovery. But Austria, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands have refused to back joint borrowing, anxious that they could be liable for repaying the debts of member states in the south. The EU will probably agree on economic support through the usual channels, not through new coronabonds. ""There is a lot of room for solidarity within the existing instruments and institutions,"" read a statement from EU Council and Commission chiefs on Monday. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel recommended using the ESM in this crisis, and also praised the European Central Bank (ECB) for launching â¬750bn in bond purchases to calm the sovereign debt markets. A dramatic loss of confidence in southern European sovereign debt - especially that of Greece - threw the eurozone into crisis in 2010, and led to multiple bailouts, at huge cost to taxpayers.
