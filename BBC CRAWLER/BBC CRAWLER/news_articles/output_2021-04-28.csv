Arlene Foster announces resignation as DUP leader,"This video can not be played ""It has been the privilege of my life to serve the people of Northern Ireland"" Arlene Foster has announced her resignation as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and as NI first minister after an internal revolt. Mrs Foster, 50, said she would step down as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister at the end of June. More than 20 DUP NI Assembly members and four MPs signed a letter voicing no-confidence in the leadership. Mrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to serve the people of Northern Ireland. She became leader of the party in December 2015 and, the following month as leader of Stormont's largest party, she was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland. She was the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs. Follow live reaction to resignation Read Mrs Foster's full statementhere,external. Mrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to ""serve the people of Northern Ireland as their first minister and to represent my home constituency of Fermanagh/South Tyrone"". ""My election as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party broke a glass ceiling and I am glad to have inspired other women to enter politics and spurred them on to take up elected office,"" Mrs Foster said. ""I understand the misogynistic criticisms that female public figures have to take and sadly it's the same for all women in public life. ""I want to encourage you to keep going and don't let the online lynch mobs get you down."" This video can not be played A look back at Arlene Foster's political career It is understood there is majority support among the party's Stormont and Westminster ranks - about 80% -  for a change in leadership. It is believed 22 of the DUP's 27 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and four MPs signed a letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster and the party leadership. Only a small number of the DUP membership - MLAs and MPs - will get to vote in a leadership contest. If there is a leadership contest, it will be the first in the DUP's 50-year history. Mrs Foster said it was important to give space over the coming weeks for the party officers to make arrangements for the election of a new leader. From trailblazing leader to party civil war Why did the DUP move against Arlene Foster? 'The DUP has lost touch with ordinary unionists' Mrs Foster has endured a turbulent time as DUP leader and the fall-out from Brexit - which the party supported - has put particular pressure on the party's top brass as it faces having to weather the storm caused bythe Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed a border down the Irish Sea. It has also been suggested recent changes to NI's abortion laws and the commitment to implement an Irish language act were causing concerns with some elected DUP representatives ahead of next year's assembly election. This was inevitable. It was just a question of time. With those numbers against her, there was no way Arlene Foster could hang on. She did not want to go, and if there was a way she could have stayed, she would have stayed. But I imagine she is pretty sad tonight. I know Arlene Foster well. She loved being party leader, she loved being first minister. It's been bruising at times, it's been tough. The DUP, at the minute, looks like a very difficult party to lead. Whoever takes over has a Herculean task to get things back on track. Mrs Foster said she was ""the first to recognise there have been ups and downs over the last five and a half years"" of her leadership. ""The 2016 assembly election result and our party's best ever Westminster result in 2017 stand out among the high points when the electorate sent a clear message that they wanted to keep Northern Ireland moving forward,"" she said. Mrs Foster added that as she prepared to ""depart the political stage"", Northern Ireland would only prosper if built on the ""foundations of successful and durable devolution"". In a social media post, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked Arlene Foster for her ""dedication to the people of Northern Ireland"" and said he hoped she stayed in public service ""for years to come"".

In November 2018, Mr Johnson gave the keynote speech at the DUP's annual conference, in which he said the UK must""junk the backstop"", referring to efforts in the Brexit negotiations to avoid a hard Irish border. This was met with rapturous applause, however, relations would later sour between Mr Johnson and Mrs Foster after he became prime minister when the Brexit deal imposed checks and restrictions to Irish Sea trade. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis also paid tribute to Mrs Foster as a ""truly dedicated public servant"" and said young women in particular would be inspired by her example to follow a path into politics. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - the joint head of the Northern Ireland government along with Mrs Foster - said the incoming DUP leader should recognise that the political landscape across the island had changed. ""The broad community are impatient for social reform and political change which reflects a modern and progressive society where everyone can feel that they belong on an equal basis,"" she said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had a decent if challenging relationship with Mrs Foster Ms O'Neill said she and Mrs Foster had a decent if challenging relationship. She said they had worked well together through the Covid pandemic. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney tweeted his best wishes to Mrs Foster. Allow Twitter content?

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also extended his best wishes to the outgoing first minister. ""We disagree on almost everything but she has clearly been a committed servant to her party for a long time,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said her departure demonstrated how difficult a life in politics could be. He said there was now a place for a ""progressive and modern approach to unionism"". Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said it was a difficult day for Mrs Foster, adding he had found her ""straightforward"" in his dealings with her. Mrs Foster waselected as the first female leader of the DUP in December 2015, taking over from Peter Robinson. She was the only candidate. Her time at the helm has been seen many challenges, having faced Brexit, a botched green energy scandal which subsequently led to the collapse of Stormont for three years and Covid-19. The aftermath of Brexit has also caused friction both internally and between the party and some of its core voters who are unhappy at the deal which led to the Irish Sea border. DUP councillors had called for the resignation of both Mrs Foster and party deputy leader Lord Dodds (pictured right) The DUP has argued that it has never supported the Northern Ireland protocol and has actively tried to have it overthrown. It was not just MLAs and MPs that voiced their discontent in Mrs Foster. Letters from a number of party councillors were also written, calling for Mrs Foster and deputy leader Lord Dodds to resign. A number of issues of concern were listed, ranging from the NI Protocol, abortion legislation, same sex marriage, policing and the recent gay conversion debate at Stormont. Possible contenders to replace Mrs Foster include NI Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson. There has been speculation of a split role, with one person for first minister and then a party leader at Westminster. Mr Poots tweeted that he wanted to thank Mrs Foster for her ""service, sacrifice and commitment to the DUP and country"". Gavin Robinson thanked Mrs Foster for her ""dedicated service to Northern Ireland"" and said there would be ""more to say about what lies ahead in the days to come"". DUP rules say a leadership election should be called by 30 April. Normally this is simply a formality and the existing leader continues in their role, but other candidates are free to challenge them. Only a small number of party members are eligible to vote in such a contest - MPs and NI Assembly members (MLAs). There are 27 MLAs that hold the party whip - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs. Party rules currently state the leader of the party must be an MLA, but there has been talk of changing this rule to allow an MP to hold the role. Boris Johnson and then NI Secretary Julian Smith visited Stormont in January 2020 to mark the restoration of devolution The role of first minister is separate, but as the largest party from the largest grouping (unionism) in the assembly, the DUP is entitled to nominate someone to hold the post of first minister. Once Mrs Foster steps down as first minister, the DUP would then be asked to nominate a replacement within seven days and a vote would be held in the assembly. If a replacement is not nominated, then the Northern Ireland secretary is obliged to call an assembly election. TheNew Decade, New Approach deal,external, which was signed in January 2020 and restored the NI Assembly after a three-year hiatus, included a commitment to extend the time to appoint a new first or deputy first minister after a resignation from seven days to six weeks. However, this has not yet been legislated for. A UK government spokesperson told the BBC that ""good progress"" was being made with the legislation and it would be brought forward during the second parliamentary session.

Biden to pitch child care and free university plan,"President Biden will try to build support for two massive spending packages US President Joe Biden is expected to call for free pre-school and community college in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Speaking on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat will call for the most sweeping revamp of US social benefits since the 1960s. His plan includes $4tn (Â£2.9tn) of spending on education and family leave. History will also be made as two women sit behind the president for the first time during a speech to Congress. US Vice-President Kamala Harris and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi will both wear masks at the rostrum during Wednesday night's primetime address. The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way The US president's State of the Union-style remarks will be followed by the traditional rebuttal speech from the opposing party - delivered on this occasion by Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. Mr Scott, a potential 2024 White House contender who is African American, is a leading voice in his party on race. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Biden will speak at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST on Thursday) from a US Capitol that is still ringed by security fencing and guarded by hundreds of National Guard troops following the storming of the complex on 6 January by pro-Trump protesters. Ahead of his speech, he will meet congressional staff who were trapped in the building during the riot, the White House said. Around 1,600 guests usually attend a president's address to a joint session of Congress. But this time only about 200 people will get invitations because of virus-prevention protocols. Buoyed by solid approval ratings, Mr Biden will look to the tens of millions of Americans that the White House hopes will tune in from home. The president will seek to build public support for two massive packages - theÂ American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan - which analysts project would entail the most far-reaching reform of the US social safety net since the 1960s. The White House says both proposals if passed by Congress would be ""fully paid for"" by tax hikes on the richest Americans and corporations. Security remains tight around the US Capitol The American Families Plan, with a price tag of $1.8tn, aims to provide free pre-school for US children aged three to four, paid family leave and free community college, the White House said on Tuesday. It would also extend until 2025 a child tax credit that was expanded during the pandemic, offering monthly payments to lower-income parents of around $300 per child. Democrats reportedly hope to establish these payments as a permanent government programme. The White House has indicated the package would be funded by almost doubling the capital gains tax rate on incomes above $1 million to 39.6% and hiking the top income tax bracket for households earning more than $400,000 to the same level. Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Reports of Biden plans for an increase in capital gains taxes sparked a stock market sell-off last week. We thought that Joe Biden - all 78 years of him - would be a transitional president. He would be there to lower the political temperature; try to heal a divided nation. Take the absurd politics out of the response to Covid. Improve vaccine roll-out. Drain the poison from the body politic. But that aside, not do too much. He appointed a largely technocratic cabinet, presumably to perform managerial functions. Maybe make the trains run on time a bit better, but not change all the rolling stock, let alone alter the gauge of the railway. A fitting ambition for Amtrak Joe. But maybe we've got that all wrong. Is it possible that far from being transitional, he's transformational? What we all got wrong about Biden The president will also pitch his $2.3tn American Jobs Plan, which the White House unveiled last month. Billed as an infrastructure package, it seeks to invest in public transit, rail, airports, water pipes, high-speed broadband, roads and bridges, veterans' hospitals, childcare centres and combating racial disparities. The proposal also seeks to steer the US economy towards electric cars - which today make up barely 2% of vehicles of America's roads - and clean energy. This video can not be played All the times the US spent big on infrastructure It would be paid for by raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and other taxes on multinational corporations, says the White House. During his speech, Mr Biden is also expected to address cultural flashpoints such as police reform, gun violence and the crisis at the US-Mexico border. Last month he signed the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans. Senator Scott has been a leading voice in his party on race and has talked about times he has been racially profiled by police. He has hinted that his rebuttal speech will not just be about ripping into the president's agenda. ""We face serious challenges on multiple fronts, but I am as confident as I have ever been in the promise and potential of America. ""I look forward to having an honest conversation with the American people and sharing Republicans' optimistic vision for expanding opportunity and empowering working families."" But among his colleagues in Congress there has been widespread opposition to the Biden agenda. The US president's party narrowly controls the House and Senate for the first time in a decade, enabling Democrats to pass that relief bill without a single congressional vote from Republicans. Top Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday: ""President Biden ran as a moderate, but I'm hard pressed to think of anything at all that he's done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation."" In addition to three packages totalling around $6tn, Mr Biden last week also unveiled plans for a $1.5tn federal budget that would significantly expand spending on domestic programmes.

If Joe Biden runs for a second term in 2024, his potential Republican challengers will be ready. Chris Christie, who is rumoured to be considering another 2024 run, wasted no time sharing his reaction to the president's remarks. In his role as a regular contributor to ABC News, Christie commented: ""The words of this speech sounded like what you would hear from a 15 year old if you gave him a credit card with no credit limit on it."" ""Except the words came from an adult who should know better,"" he continued. A former governor of New Jersey and former federal prosecutor, Christie ran for president in 2016 but dropped out early and became a close ally of Donald Trump.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy slammed the president's big spending proposals in a statement released shortly after his speech. Arguing the economy is ""on the verge
of an incredible comeback"", he says Biden is instead focused on ""the most
radical socialist agenda in American history"". McCarthy claims the White House will crush economic opportunity because it is intent on raising taxes, destroying jobs and indebting future generations. ""When you add it all up,
the cost of the Biden Spending Spree is astonishing: over $6,000,000,000,000 in
his first 100 days,"" he writes. ""Republicans will work
with anyone to rebuild America, restore our way of life, and renew the American
Dream,"" he goes on. ""But we cannot tax and spend our way out of our problems, and we cannot
allow the United States to go down the path of socialism."" Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly praised parts of Biden's first address - but says he was left wanting on immigration issues. ""While I share President Bidenâs urgency in fixing our broken immigration system, what I didnât hear tonight was a plan to address the immediate crisis at the border, and I will continue holding this administration accountable to deliver the resources and staffing necessary for a humane, orderly process as we work to improve border security, support local economies, and fix our immigration system."" Kelly's state is in the south-western US and lies along the border with Mexico, meaning many there have experienced the immigration crisis first hand. He is up for re-election next year. Here's the beginning of Biden's speech when he notes a historic first sitting right behind him. This video can not be played 'About time' for Madam Speaker, Madam Vice-President In his rebuttal, Republican Tim Scott is lashing out at the Democratic criticisms of the new Georgia election law. Democrats have said this new law aims to restrict voting in future elections, but Republicans who control the state's government say it expands access and increases election security. Defending Georgiaâs law, he says big majorities of voters support voter ID measures. Scott says it is a mainstream law that makes it easier to vote early than in Democratic New York. He says the president âabsurdly claims this is worse than Jim Crowâ, a reference to historic US racial segregation. ""This is not about civil rights or our racial past, it's about rigging elections in the future,"" Scott says. ""Race is not a political weapon to sell every issue the way one side wants,â he adds. Our Reality Check team took a look at what exactly is in this new election law. The Biden administration has been vocal about the need to follow Covid-19 restrictions, especially wearing a mask and standing at least 6ft apart. That makes the president and his team easy prey for critics when they are not following those rules themselves. During Biden's speech, lawmakers sat spaced apart inside the venue, with their masks on. But, with the speech ending, they gathered together to surround the president and hobnob with fellow legislators. Andrew Clark, an alumnus of the Trump administration, quickly called it out as ""asinine theater"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Carolinian Tim Scott, who is the only black Republican senator (Democrats have two), is now addressing issues of racism in America. ""I know what it feels like to be pulled over for no reason, to be followed around a store for no reason,"" he says. He adds that his grandfather never learned to read, but would hold up the newspaper to set the right example at the breakfast table He says he gets called horrible racial slurs by liberals and progressives. ""Believe me, I know first-hand our healing is not finished."" He accuses Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present."" Scott critiques the American Jobs Plan as the ""most liberal"" in history. ""Republicans support everything you think of when you think of infrastructure,"" Scott tells viewers. ""But again - Democrats want a partisan wishlist. They won't even build bridges to build bridges."" He says Biden's plan is a waste of money and a job-killer that would ""lower wages of the average American worker"". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office has quickly released a statement praising her party's leader for his speech. âTonight,
the American people heard President Joe Biden deliver a unifying message of
resilience, resolve and hope,"" it reads. Touting ""extraordinary progress"" and the president's ""ambitious, transformative vision"", Pelosi calls the moment a once-in-a-century opportunity for the US economy. âThe
Democratic Congress looks forward to working with the Biden-Harris
Administration to enact this historic vision for lower healthcare costs, for
bigger paychecks, for cleaner government, For The People,â it ends. Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent This was a speech to show the world that America is back - and here to stay - in President Bidenâs words. It was also a reminder to strategic competitors like China that the US wonât sit back and let Beijing advance economically or in the key future industries of technology and artificial intelligence. Biden talked about China and Chinese President Xi at least four times during his speech, highlighting the importance of this relationship. He referenced how much time he has spent with the Chinese leader - explaining how President Xi is âdeadly earnestâ about becoming the most consequential nation in the world. Biden said he doesnât want a conflict with the worldâs second largest economy but that the US will stand up for its fundamental trade rights, and fight back against the theft of intellectual property, and subsidies to state owned enterprises. These are consistently the complaints the US has had about the way China and Chinese companies operate, which it says threatens the livelihoods of American workers. He also talked about the need for more investment in American research and development, which has fallen behind other countries like China in recent decades. Just ahead of the customary Republican rebuttal, the head of the party's national committee weighed in. Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Biden's first 100 days ""an unqualified failure"", with ""attacks on energy workers, a humanitarian crisis at the border and an America-last foreign policy agenda"". She also criticised Democratic attempts to end the filibuster (read our North America reporter's analysis on that here) and ""pack"" the nation's top court. ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden."" South Carolina Senator Tim Scott begins the Republican rebuttal to Bidenâs speech. âOur nation is starving for more than empty platitudes,â he says of the presidentâs remarks. ""Three months in, the actions of the president and his party are pulling us further apart."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half. That was all a set-up, however, for the presidentâs pitch for more â more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights. He concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the worldâs autocratic nations. He assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency â one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night. ""We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy â of pandemic and pain â and 'We the People' did not flinch,"" says Biden. ""At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve."" So, after about 65 minutes and 6,000-plus words, concludes the president's first speech to Congress. He's now chatting with lawmakers in the chamber (masks abound, but the social distancing measures that were the rationale for the scaled-down audience have been abandoned). Reality Check President Biden has faced criticism over the increased numbers of migrants crossing into the US over its southern border with Mexico. At a news conference in March, he said: ""There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year."" The US Customs and Border Protection agency releases monthly figures on the number of ""encounters"" at the south-west land border. The number fluctuates widely - but there is not always a significant increase during the winter months. In January and February 2021, 78,442 and 100,441 people were encountered - a significant increase on the figures for the same two months in the previous year, which were each just over 36,000. Since President Biden made the claim, the count for March has been released - 172,331, the highest in recent years. In 2020, encounters at the border fell slightly between January and March. In 2018, they remained relatively steady. Read Reality Check's full fact-check here. Biden tells lawmakers they should take action on - or at least debate -  immigration reform because it would be popular with the American public. ""Letâs end our exhausting war over immigration,"" he says. The administration has struggled with the influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border, turning back adults based on Trump-era policies but taking in record numbers of unaccompanied adults. It has separately proposed a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which would include giving about 11 million undocumented people a legal pathway to US citizenship. The president also makes mention of his deputy, Kamala Harris, who he has asked to address the root causes of the border crisis. He says he has ""absolute confidence she will get the job done"". ""The country supports immigration reform,"" says Biden. ""Congress should act."" Biden's speech draws to a close. He recalls the events of 6 January, when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, and asks lawmakers to prove democracy can rise above such actions. ""Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? Americaâs adversaries â the autocrats of the world â are betting it canât,"" he says. ""They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. ""They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Biden said last year that, if elected, heâd address the issue of police brutality, with a national commission on policing, and âreal actionâ. Weeks passed, and no action. Then, the verdict in Derek Chauvinâs trial focused the nationâs attention on police violence, once again. In terms of action, the president is calling for legislation in his speech, rather than a national commission on policing. Yet it remains unclear whether he has enough political power to usher in new laws on policing, or bring about the broad changes that heâd once promised. Biden says: ""We wonât ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined â the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism."" ""We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America,"" he continues, referring to George Floyd's murder. On police he says: ""Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably."" But he says work must be done ""to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve"". ""To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Apple profits double as it squares up to Facebook,"A surge in iPhone sales, especially in China, has led to a doubling of profits at Apple since the start of the pandemic. The results reflected ""optimism"" about the days ahead, Apple's boss said. Rival tech firm Facebook also reported bumper revenues and profits. But the social media giant warned Apple's latest software release could undermine its prospects later in the year. Apple has seen sales of its phones, apps and other devices rise throughout the pandemic, as consumers spent more time working, shopping and seeking entertainment online. Customers continued to upgrade to Apple's new 5G phones which were rolled out last year, and also bought Mac computers and iPads to tackle working and studying from home, the firm said. Fitness and music apps also saw a lockdown boost. Sales to China nearly doubled, leading to overall revenues for the first three months of this year of $89.6bn (Â£64.2bn), more than 50% up compared to a year earlier. Profit was $23.6bn, up from $11.3bn for the same period last year. ""This quarter reflects both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives, as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead for all of us,"" said chief executive Tim Cook. Facebook v Apple: The ad tracking row heats up Google owner sees record profits in lockdown boom Apple Christmas sales surge to $111bn amid pandemic Paolo Pescatore, analyst with PP Foresight, said it was ""another blowout quarter"" for Apple. ""The iPhone remains a core product and gateway to the Apple universe,"" he added, providing Apple with ""a key launchpad"" to sell further services. Sophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said customers had proved willing to ""splurge on big-ticket items thanks to a global shift to working from home, and the fact people have found comfort in treating themselves"". ""The sheer scale of Apple's sales is testament to the grip that shiny embossed piece of fruit has on global consumers,"" she added. Facebook, which relies on sales of advertising rather than consumer electronics, also saw bumper revenues and profits in the first three months of the year. The time spent by consumers at home, and the spending power that shifted online, translated into revenues of $26.17bn, outpacing analysts predictions. Profit was also higher than expected at $9.5bn. Facebook said in coming months it expected revenue to be stable or grow moderately, and admitted a new feature released this week by Apple - an option for users to prevent apps from collecting user data - could ""significantly"" hurt its business. It's not just Apple and Facebook who have posted astonishing profits this week. Google and Microsoft announced eye-watering quarterly figures yesterday too. That may not be surprising to many. Global lockdowns have made people work and play more online. What's less clear though was whether this was a pandemic bounce? Or have people permanently changed their behaviour? These figures certainly suggest the latter. Apple's figures across multiple sectors, across the world, are exceptional. In places like China, which has mostly been lockdown-free in recent months, sales were up dramatically. Facebook's figures too, show that advertisers are feeling bullish about online spending. Almost all of Facebook's revenue is from ads, so when Facebook is doing well, that usually suggests we're buying more things on the internet. Amazon's quarterly figures are out tomorrow, and they too are expected to have had a bumper quarter. Big Tech's pandemic bounce is increasingly looking like a trend. The two companies are locked in a stand-off after Apple announced the latest version of its iOS operating system this week. A new feature will prompt device users to decide whether they are happy for their data to be collected by apps. Many are likely to say no. But user data is a large reason why Facebook's ad-based business model is so profitable. It allows advertising to be targeted and monitored for efficacy. Facebook saw a rise in monthly active users, however, which were up by 10% at 2.85 billion. On Tuesday Google's parent company Alphabet reported a record profit in the three months to March as its advertising revenue swelled by a third. The firm credited ""elevated consumer activity online"" for its results as populations around the world spent more time indoors at home to avoid the spread of coronavirus.

"'A horror story': India Covid deaths pass 200,000","India has reached the devastating figure of 200,000 coronavirus deaths, with the pressure on many hospitals showing no sign of abating amid a surging second wave. The real number of fatalities is thought to be far greater, with many not being officially recorded. Oxygen supplies remain critically low across the country, with the black market the only option for some people. Crematoriums are operating non-stop, with makeshift pyres in car parks. There have been at least 300,000 new infections every day in the past week, with more than 360,000 new cases in the past 24 hours on Wednesday. Overall, more than 17.9 million cases have been registered. Foreign aid has started to arrive from the UKand Singapore. Russia, New Zealand and France have pledged to send emergency medical equipment, and even regional rivals Pakistan and China have put aside their differences and promised to help. On Thursday,the US said it would start delivering supplies,externalworth more than $100m, in addition to individual US states and private companies also readying oxygen, equipment, and supplies for Indian hospital. However, experts say the aid will only have a limited effect in a nation that has a population of 1.3 billion. As it happened: BBC's live coverage on India's Covid surge Why India's Covid crisis matters to the whole world India's round-the-clock mass cremations A government website where Indians can register for a vaccination programme crashed soon after it launched on Wednesday, as tens of thousands of people tried to access it. And in the state of Assam, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake damaged hospitals which were already under intense strain. People ran from their homes and other buildings in panic. The numbers we are seeing are staggeringly high - but the real number of fatalities are thought to be much higher. Mortality data in India is poor and deaths at home often go unregistered, especially in rural areas. There are reports of journalists counting bodies at morgues themselves, to try to get a more accurate number. In Uttar Pradesh, health officials said 68 people had died on one day earlier this month across the state. But a Hindi newspaper pointed out that officials also said there were 98 Covid funerals in the capital, Lucknow, alone. Crematoriums are working throughout the night and using empty spaces like parks and carparks to build makeshift funeral pyres Crematoriums continue to work throughout the nightto keep up with the number of bodies arriving, and many families are facing long waits before their loved ones can receive funeral rites. Some say they were asked to help speed up the process by piling the wood themselves. In the southern city of Bengaluru, one doctor told the BBC people were panicking. It is one of the worst-hit cities in India, with some estimates saying there are about 300 active Covid cases per square kilometre. ""We were not prepared for this second surge,"" the consultant said. ""For the first surge it was well organised. This time there are more cases, it was more sudden, and the situation was not prepared for."" The World Health Organization (WHO) reported in itsweekly epidemiological update,externalthat there were nearly 5.7 million new cases reported globally last week - and India accounts for 38% of them. It also said that the B.1.617 variant of the virus detected in India has a higher growth rate than other variants in the country, suggesting increased transmissibility. Can India make enough vaccines to meet demand? How is India's vaccination drive going? India is carrying out the world's biggest vaccination drive, but less than 10% of the population has so far received an initial jab and there are concerns about meeting demand. The US is helping India with the raw materials it needs for vaccine production, after India's biggest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India, complained of shortages of specialised imports from the US. Meanwhile, the first batch of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, is set to arrive in India on 1 May,The New Indian Express reports,external. It has not yet been revealed how many doses will be delivered. With most hospitals at capacity, many people are seeking help elsewhere, including this woman outside a Sikh temple in Ghaziabad India is heading towards state elections, and there is increasing anger towards both state authorities and the central government for the handling of the pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of ignoring scientific warnings to participate in election rallies and allowing a massive Hindu festival to go ahead in northern India. Dr Navjot Dahiya, the vice-president of the Indian Medical Association,called Mr Modi a ""super spreader"",externalwho had ""tossed all Covid norms in the air"". The prime minister said he had held three meetings on Tuesday to discuss ways to increase oxygen capacities and medical infrastructure, including the use of trains and military aircraft to speed up transport of oxygen supplies. Why has the situation in India been allowed to escalate so much? India Kumbh festival goes ahead amid Covid surge Have India's rallies helped spread coronavirus? The BBC's Yogita Limaye says many people are asking why the military and disaster response teams have not been put on a war footing to build field hospitals. ""There is a sense of abandonment in the country, of people being left to fend for themselves,"" our correspondent reports. State and union territory governments, from Delhi to Karnataka, have been criticised for allowing Covid protocols to lapse and failing to prepare for what epidemiologists say was an inevitable surge in infections.

Why did the DUP move against Arlene Foster?,"Rumours about bids to remove Arlene Foster from the helm of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had been swirling for months. On many occasions they'd been easily shrugged off by the first minister. But she could shrug no longer, given many of those previously loyal to her abandoned the Foster ship. However questions remain about the move's timing and what has caused it. Firstly, pressure to remove her has come from the outworkings of Brexit and the Irish Sea border. There has been strong unionist opposition to the new Irish Sea border Arlene Foster led the party's campaign in favour of Brexit, but struggled once its ramifications for the union came into view. Feeling betrayed by Boris Johnson when he signed up to the Brexit deal that would mean different trading arrangements for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, Mrs Foster faced accusations of poor judgement for trusting the prime minister. She hardened her stance earlier this year after concerns about the protocol's effects on GB-NI trade became clear, and demanded it be scrapped. The party even published a five-point plan it aimed to use in a bid to replace the protocol and said it would no longer engage with north-south bodies on Brexit. But that was not enough to quash internal unhappiness at how the issue was being managed, with some elected representatives concerned it would affect the party's chances in the next assembly election in May 2022. It may also be that some assembly members who were worried about the prospect of retaining their seats have drawn the conclusion that their own political positions trump loyalty to the leadership at this crucial time, just as election strategies are being devised. Recent rioting in Northern Ireland has mostly involved gangs of youths armed with bricks and petrol bombs Recent scenes of rioting and violence in loyalist communities against the protocol and criticism of unionist politicians have added to the narrative that the current DUP leadership is not reflecting or understanding the views of those it is supposed to represent. It may be a key issue in all of this, but it's not the only factor. Party sources have given strong hints about growing concern that Mrs Foster held a softer stance on some social issues than her predecessors and was willing to move the party in that direction. The DUP's roots are deeply conservative, staunchly opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. Westminster legislated to change NI's laws on those issues in 2019when devolution was suspended - the DUP opposed it at the time, but it did not go down well with many grassroots party members. Then last week, adebate on a motion in the Stormont assembly calling for a ban on gay conversion therapyfurther raised eyebrows when Mrs Foster was one of five DUP assembly members who abstained on it. The majority of the party had voted against the motion, arguing that any legislation to outlaw the practice needed to ensure safeguards for churches. Although it was a free vote, it openly exposed the gulf between Mrs Foster and most of her assembly team at a time when she was already under pressure. For some party members, it was the final straw. There are also those within the DUP who point to Mrs Foster's difficulties in retaining authority, claiming that she was too weak to discipline some of her MPs and assembly members for breaching Covid-19 guidelines or making comments at odds with party policy. To further understand the timing of the leadership challenge, it's important to know how DUP internal rules work. Rule 12 states that a leadership election should take place before 30 April every year - normally it is an informal procedure to simply reappoint the office holder as opposed to an actual contest. However it's understood that this has not happened yet this year, and it's believed those behind the motion challenging Mrs Foster had called on the DUP chairman to invoke the rule and call an election for leader within seven days. A fight for the heart and soul of the DUP is on which may chart the party's course for some time to come. What is behind the violence in Northern Ireland?

Speaking on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat will call for the most sweeping revamp of US social benefits since the 1960s. His plan includes $4tn (Â£2.9tn) of spending on education and family leave. History will also be made as two women sit behind the president for the first time during a speech to Congress. US Vice-President Kamala Harris and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi will both wear masks at the rostrum during Wednesday night's primetime address. The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way The US president's State of the Union-style remarks will be followed by the traditional rebuttal speech from the opposing party - delivered on this occasion by Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. Mr Scott, a potential 2024 White House contender who is African American, is a leading voice in his party on race. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Biden will speak at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST on Thursday) from a US Capitol that is still ringed by security fencing and guarded by hundreds of National Guard troops following the storming of the complex on 6 January by pro-Trump protesters. Ahead of his speech, he will meet congressional staff who were trapped in the building during the riot, the White House said. Around 1,600 guests usually attend a president's address to a joint session of Congress. But this time only about 200 people will get invitations because of virus-prevention protocols. Buoyed by solid approval ratings, Mr Biden will look to the tens of millions of Americans that the White House hopes will tune in from home. The president will seek to build public support for two massive packages - theÂ American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan - which analysts project would entail the most far-reaching reform of the US social safety net since the 1960s. The White House says both proposals if passed by Congress would be ""fully paid for"" by tax hikes on the richest Americans and corporations. Security remains tight around the US Capitol The American Families Plan, with a price tag of $1.8tn, aims to provide free pre-school for US children aged three to four, paid family leave and free community college, the White House said on Tuesday. It would also extend until 2025 a child tax credit that was expanded during the pandemic, offering monthly payments to lower-income parents of around $300 per child. Democrats reportedly hope to establish these payments as a permanent government programme. The White House has indicated the package would be funded by almost doubling the capital gains tax rate on incomes above $1 million to 39.6% and hiking the top income tax bracket for households earning more than $400,000 to the same level. Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Reports of Biden plans for an increase in capital gains taxes sparked a stock market sell-off last week. We thought that Joe Biden - all 78 years of him - would be a transitional president. He would be there to lower the political temperature; try to heal a divided nation. Take the absurd politics out of the response to Covid. Improve vaccine roll-out. Drain the poison from the body politic. But that aside, not do too much. He appointed a largely technocratic cabinet, presumably to perform managerial functions. Maybe make the trains run on time a bit better, but not change all the rolling stock, let alone alter the gauge of the railway. A fitting ambition for Amtrak Joe. But maybe we've got that all wrong. Is it possible that far from being transitional, he's transformational? What we all got wrong about Biden The president will also pitch his $2.3tn American Jobs Plan, which the White House unveiled last month. Billed as an infrastructure package, it seeks to invest in public transit, rail, airports, water pipes, high-speed broadband, roads and bridges, veterans' hospitals, childcare centres and combating racial disparities. The proposal also seeks to steer the US economy towards electric cars - which today make up barely 2% of vehicles of America's roads - and clean energy. This video can not be played All the times the US spent big on infrastructure It would be paid for by raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and other taxes on multinational corporations, says the White House. During his speech, Mr Biden is also expected to address cultural flashpoints such as police reform, gun violence and the crisis at the US-Mexico border. Last month he signed the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans. Senator Scott has been a leading voice in his party on race and has talked about times he has been racially profiled by police. He has hinted that his rebuttal speech will not just be about ripping into the president's agenda. ""We face serious challenges on multiple fronts, but I am as confident as I have ever been in the promise and potential of America. ""I look forward to having an honest conversation with the American people and sharing Republicans' optimistic vision for expanding opportunity and empowering working families."" But among his colleagues in Congress there has been widespread opposition to the Biden agenda. The US president's party narrowly controls the House and Senate for the first time in a decade, enabling Democrats to pass that relief bill without a single congressional vote from Republicans. Top Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday: ""President Biden ran as a moderate, but I'm hard pressed to think of anything at all that he's done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation."" In addition to three packages totalling around $6tn, Mr Biden last week also unveiled plans for a $1.5tn federal budget that would significantly expand spending on domestic programmes.

If Joe Biden runs for a second term in 2024, his potential Republican challengers will be ready. Chris Christie, who is rumoured to be considering another 2024 run, wasted no time sharing his reaction to the president's remarks. In his role as a regular contributor to ABC News, Christie commented: ""The words of this speech sounded like what you would hear from a 15 year old if you gave him a credit card with no credit limit on it."" ""Except the words came from an adult who should know better,"" he continued. A former governor of New Jersey and former federal prosecutor, Christie ran for president in 2016 but dropped out early and became a close ally of Donald Trump. He has disavowed the former president since the riot at the US Capitol in January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy slammed the president's big spending proposals in a statement released shortly after his speech. Arguing the economy is ""on the verge
of an incredible comeback"", he says Biden is instead focused on ""the most
radical socialist agenda in American history"". McCarthy claims the White House will crush economic opportunity because it is intent on raising taxes, destroying jobs and indebting future generations. ""When you add it all up,
the cost of the Biden Spending Spree is astonishing: over $6,000,000,000,000 in
his first 100 days,"" he writes. ""Republicans will work
with anyone to rebuild America, restore our way of life, and renew the American
Dream,"" he goes on. ""But we cannot tax and spend our way out of our problems, and we cannot
allow the United States to go down the path of socialism."" Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly praised parts of Biden's first address - but says he was left wanting on immigration issues. ""While I share President Bidenâs urgency in fixing our broken immigration system, what I didnât hear tonight was a plan to address the immediate crisis at the border, and I will continue holding this administration accountable to deliver the resources and staffing necessary for a humane, orderly process as we work to improve border security, support local economies, and fix our immigration system."" Kelly's state is in the south-western US and lies along the border with Mexico, meaning many there have experienced the immigration crisis first hand. He is up for re-election next year. Here's the beginning of Biden's speech when he notes a historic first sitting right behind him. This video can not be played 'About time' for Madam Speaker, Madam Vice-President In his rebuttal, Republican Tim Scott is lashing out at the Democratic criticisms of the new Georgia election law. Democrats have said this new law aims to restrict voting in future elections, but Republicans who control the state's government say it expands access and increases election security. Defending Georgiaâs law, he says big majorities of voters support voter ID measures. Scott says it is a mainstream law that makes it easier to vote early than in Democratic New York. He says the president âabsurdly claims this is worse than Jim Crowâ, a reference to historic US racial segregation. ""This is not about civil rights or our racial past, it's about rigging elections in the future,"" Scott says. ""Race is not a political weapon to sell every issue the way one side wants,â he adds. Our Reality Check team took a look at what exactly is in this new election law. The Biden administration has been vocal about the need to follow Covid-19 restrictions, especially wearing a mask and standing at least 6ft apart. That makes the president and his team easy prey for critics when they are not following those rules themselves. During Biden's speech, lawmakers sat spaced apart inside the venue, with their masks on. But, with the speech ending, they gathered together to surround the president and hobnob with fellow legislators. Andrew Clark, an alumnus of the Trump administration, quickly called it out as ""asinine theater"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Carolinian Tim Scott, who is the only black Republican senator (Democrats have two), is now addressing issues of racism in America. ""I know what it feels like to be pulled over for no reason, to be followed around a store for no reason,"" he says. He adds that his grandfather never learned to read, but would hold up the newspaper to set the right example at the breakfast table He says he gets called horrible racial slurs by liberals and progressives. ""Believe me, I know first-hand our healing is not finished."" He accuses Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present."" Scott critiques the American Jobs Plan as the ""most liberal"" in history. ""Republicans support everything you think of when you think of infrastructure,"" Scott tells viewers. ""But again - Democrats want a partisan wishlist. They won't even build bridges to build bridges."" He says Biden's plan is a waste of money and a job-killer that would ""lower wages of the average American worker"". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office has quickly released a statement praising her party's leader for his speech. âTonight,
the American people heard President Joe Biden deliver a unifying message of
resilience, resolve and hope,"" it reads. Touting ""extraordinary progress"" and the president's ""ambitious, transformative vision"", Pelosi calls the moment a once-in-a-century opportunity for the US economy. âThe
Democratic Congress looks forward to working with the Biden-Harris
Administration to enact this historic vision for lower healthcare costs, for
bigger paychecks, for cleaner government, For The People,â it ends. Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent This was a speech to show the world that America is back - and here to stay - in President Bidenâs words. It was also a reminder to strategic competitors like China that the US wonât sit back and let Beijing advance economically or in the key future industries of technology and artificial intelligence. Biden talked about China and Chinese President Xi at least four times during his speech, highlighting the importance of this relationship. He referenced how much time he has spent with the Chinese leader - explaining how President Xi is âdeadly earnestâ about becoming the most consequential nation in the world. Biden said he doesnât want a conflict with the worldâs second largest economy but that the US will stand up for its fundamental trade rights, and fight back against the theft of intellectual property, and subsidies to state owned enterprises. These are consistently the complaints the US has had about the way China and Chinese companies operate, which it says threatens the livelihoods of American workers. He also talked about the need for more investment in American research and development, which has fallen behind other countries like China in recent decades. Just ahead of the customary Republican rebuttal, the head of the party's national committee weighed in. Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Biden's first 100 days ""an unqualified failure"", with ""attacks on energy workers, a humanitarian crisis at the border and an America-last foreign policy agenda"". She also criticised Democratic attempts to end the filibuster (read our North America reporter's analysis on that here) and ""pack"" the nation's top court. ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden."" South Carolina Senator Tim Scott begins the Republican rebuttal to Bidenâs speech. âOur nation is starving for more than empty platitudes,â he says of the presidentâs remarks. ""Three months in, the actions of the president and his party are pulling us further apart."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half. That was all a set-up, however, for the presidentâs pitch for more â more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights. He concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the worldâs autocratic nations. He assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency â one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night. ""We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy â of pandemic and pain â and 'We the People' did not flinch,"" says Biden. ""At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve."" So, after about 65 minutes and 6,000-plus words, concludes the president's first speech to Congress. He's now chatting with lawmakers in the chamber (masks abound, but the social distancing measures that were the rationale for the scaled-down audience have been abandoned). Reality Check President Biden has faced criticism over the increased numbers of migrants crossing into the US over its southern border with Mexico. At a news conference in March, he said: ""There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year."" The US Customs and Border Protection agency releases monthly figures on the number of ""encounters"" at the south-west land border. The number fluctuates widely - but there is not always a significant increase during the winter months. In January and February 2021, 78,442 and 100,441 people were encountered - a significant increase on the figures for the same two months in the previous year, which were each just over 36,000. Since President Biden made the claim, the count for March has been released - 172,331, the highest in recent years. In 2020, encounters at the border fell slightly between January and March. In 2018, they remained relatively steady. Read Reality Check's full fact-check here. Biden tells lawmakers they should take action on - or at least debate -  immigration reform because it would be popular with the American public. ""Letâs end our exhausting war over immigration,"" he says. The administration has struggled with the influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border, turning back adults based on Trump-era policies but taking in record numbers of unaccompanied adults. It has separately proposed a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which would include giving about 11 million undocumented people a legal pathway to US citizenship. The president also makes mention of his deputy, Kamala Harris, who he has asked to address the root causes of the border crisis. He says he has ""absolute confidence she will get the job done"". ""The country supports immigration reform,"" says Biden. ""Congress should act."" Biden's speech draws to a close. He recalls the events of 6 January, when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, and asks lawmakers to prove democracy can rise above such actions. ""Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? Americaâs adversaries â the autocrats of the world â are betting it canât,"" he says. ""They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. ""They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Biden said last year that, if elected, heâd address the issue of police brutality, with a national commission on policing, and âreal actionâ. Weeks passed, and no action. Then, the verdict in Derek Chauvinâs trial focused the nationâs attention on police violence, once again. In terms of action, the president is calling for legislation in his speech, rather than a national commission on policing. Yet it remains unclear whether he has enough political power to usher in new laws on policing, or bring about the broad changes that heâd once promised. Biden says: ""We wonât ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined â the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism."" ""We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America,"" he continues, referring to George Floyd's murder. On police he says: ""Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably."" But he says work must be done ""to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve"". ""To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Your live coverage was brought to you by Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Anthony Zurcher and Tara McKelvey, and edited by Jude Sheerin. If Joe Biden runs for a second term in 2024, his potential Republican challengers will be ready. Chris Christie, who is rumoured to be considering another 2024 run, wasted no time sharing his reaction to the president's remarks. In his role as a regular contributor to ABC News, Christie commented: ""The words of this speech sounded like what you would hear from a 15 year old if you gave him a credit card with no credit limit on it."" ""Except the words came from an adult who should know better,"" he continued. A former governor of New Jersey and former federal prosecutor, Christie ran for president in 2016 but dropped out early and became a close ally of Donald Trump. He has disavowed the former president since the riot at the US Capitol in January. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy slammed the president's big spending proposals in a statement released shortly after his speech. Arguing the economy is ""on the verge
of an incredible comeback"", he says Biden is instead focused on ""the most
radical socialist agenda in American history"". McCarthy claims the White House will crush economic opportunity because it is intent on raising taxes, destroying jobs and indebting future generations. ""When you add it all up,
the cost of the Biden Spending Spree is astonishing: over $6,000,000,000,000 in
his first 100 days,"" he writes. ""Republicans will work
with anyone to rebuild America, restore our way of life, and renew the American
Dream,"" he goes on. ""But we cannot tax and spend our way out of our problems, and we cannot
allow the United States to go down the path of socialism."" Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly praised parts of Biden's first address - but says he was left wanting on immigration issues. ""While I share President Bidenâs urgency in fixing our broken immigration system, what I didnât hear tonight was a plan to address the immediate crisis at the border, and I will continue holding this administration accountable to deliver the resources and staffing necessary for a humane, orderly process as we work to improve border security, support local economies, and fix our immigration system."" Kelly's state is in the south-western US and lies along the border with Mexico, meaning many there have experienced the immigration crisis first hand. He is up for re-election next year. Here's the beginning of Biden's speech when he notes a historic first sitting right behind him. This video can not be played 'About time' for Madam Speaker, Madam Vice-President In his rebuttal, Republican Tim Scott is lashing out at the Democratic criticisms of the new Georgia election law. Democrats have said this new law aims to restrict voting in future elections, but Republicans who control the state's government say it expands access and increases election security. Defending Georgiaâs law, he says big majorities of voters support voter ID measures. Scott says it is a mainstream law that makes it easier to vote early than in Democratic New York. He says the president âabsurdly claims this is worse than Jim Crowâ, a reference to historic US racial segregation. ""This is not about civil rights or our racial past, it's about rigging elections in the future,"" Scott says. ""Race is not a political weapon to sell every issue the way one side wants,â he adds. Our Reality Check team took a look at what exactly is in this new election law. The Biden administration has been vocal about the need to follow Covid-19 restrictions, especially wearing a mask and standing at least 6ft apart. That makes the president and his team easy prey for critics when they are not following those rules themselves. During Biden's speech, lawmakers sat spaced apart inside the venue, with their masks on. But, with the speech ending, they gathered together to surround the president and hobnob with fellow legislators. Andrew Clark, an alumnus of the Trump administration, quickly called it out as ""asinine theater"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Carolinian Tim Scott, who is the only black Republican senator (Democrats have two), is now addressing issues of racism in America. ""I know what it feels like to be pulled over for no reason, to be followed around a store for no reason,"" he says. He adds that his grandfather never learned to read, but would hold up the newspaper to set the right example at the breakfast table He says he gets called horrible racial slurs by liberals and progressives. ""Believe me, I know first-hand our healing is not finished."" He accuses Democrats of wanting ""the issue more than they want the solution"". ""America is not a racist country. It's backwards to fight discrimination with different types of discrimination and it's wrong to try to use our painful past to dishonestly shut down debates in the present."" Scott critiques the American Jobs Plan as the ""most liberal"" in history. ""Republicans support everything you think of when you think of infrastructure,"" Scott tells viewers. ""But again - Democrats want a partisan wishlist. They won't even build bridges to build bridges."" He says Biden's plan is a waste of money and a job-killer that would ""lower wages of the average American worker"". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office has quickly released a statement praising her party's leader for his speech. âTonight,
the American people heard President Joe Biden deliver a unifying message of
resilience, resolve and hope,"" it reads. Touting ""extraordinary progress"" and the president's ""ambitious, transformative vision"", Pelosi calls the moment a once-in-a-century opportunity for the US economy. âThe
Democratic Congress looks forward to working with the Biden-Harris
Administration to enact this historic vision for lower healthcare costs, for
bigger paychecks, for cleaner government, For The People,â it ends. Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent This was a speech to show the world that America is back - and here to stay - in President Bidenâs words. It was also a reminder to strategic competitors like China that the US wonât sit back and let Beijing advance economically or in the key future industries of technology and artificial intelligence. Biden talked about China and Chinese President Xi at least four times during his speech, highlighting the importance of this relationship. He referenced how much time he has spent with the Chinese leader - explaining how President Xi is âdeadly earnestâ about becoming the most consequential nation in the world. Biden said he doesnât want a conflict with the worldâs second largest economy but that the US will stand up for its fundamental trade rights, and fight back against the theft of intellectual property, and subsidies to state owned enterprises. These are consistently the complaints the US has had about the way China and Chinese companies operate, which it says threatens the livelihoods of American workers. He also talked about the need for more investment in American research and development, which has fallen behind other countries like China in recent decades. Just ahead of the customary Republican rebuttal, the head of the party's national committee weighed in. Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Biden's first 100 days ""an unqualified failure"", with ""attacks on energy workers, a humanitarian crisis at the border and an America-last foreign policy agenda"". She also criticised Democratic attempts to end the filibuster (read our North America reporter's analysis on that here) and ""pack"" the nation's top court. ""In his inaugural address, Biden called for unity. That was a lie, and our nation is worse off and more divided thanks to Joe Biden."" South Carolina Senator Tim Scott begins the Republican rebuttal to Bidenâs speech. âOur nation is starving for more than empty platitudes,â he says of the presidentâs remarks. ""Three months in, the actions of the president and his party are pulling us further apart."" Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden's speech to Congress started as a victory lap and ended with a warning. He began by touting what has been by all accounts a very successful rollout of vaccinations in the US, paving the way for a return to some semblance of normalcy in the months ahead. He boasted of hundreds of thousands of new jobs created in his first 100 days and a growing economy. He touted recently passed funding that will help cut child poverty in the US in half. That was all a set-up, however, for the presidentâs pitch for more â more spending and more action from Congress. He proposed a trillion-dollar package of universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free college education, family leave and childcare funding. He called for legislation on gun control, immigration, criminal justice reform and voting rights. He concluded, however, by turning to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol and the threat posed to democracy by the worldâs autocratic nations. He assured the nation that the US will prevail. His ending, however, seemed designed to create a sense of urgency â one that, perhaps, he can harness to achieve the ambitious agenda he set out on Wednesday night.

"'A horror story': India Covid deaths pass 200,000There are fears the real number is even higher, as hospitals continue to turn dying patients away.Asia","India has reached the devastating figure of 200,000 coronavirus deaths, with the pressure on many hospitals showing no sign of abating amid a surging second wave. The real number of fatalities is thought to be far greater, with many not being officially recorded. Oxygen supplies remain critically low across the country, with the black market the only option for some people. Crematoriums are operating non-stop, with makeshift pyres in car parks. There have been at least 300,000 new infections every day in the past week, with more than 360,000 new cases in the past 24 hours on Wednesday. Overall, more than 17.9 million cases have been registered. Foreign aid has started to arrive from the UKand Singapore. Russia, New Zealand and France have pledged to send emergency medical equipment, and even regional rivals Pakistan and China have put aside their differences and promised to help. On Thursday,the US said it would start delivering supplies,externalworth more than $100m, in addition to individual US states and private companies also readying oxygen, equipment, and supplies for Indian hospital. However, experts say the aid will only have a limited effect in a nation that has a population of 1.3 billion. As it happened: BBC's live coverage on India's Covid surge Why India's Covid crisis matters to the whole world India's round-the-clock mass cremations A government website where Indians can register for a vaccination programme crashed soon after it launched on Wednesday, as tens of thousands of people tried to access it. And in the state of Assam, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake damaged hospitals which were already under intense strain. People ran from their homes and other buildings in panic. The numbers we are seeing are staggeringly high - but the real number of fatalities are thought to be much higher. Mortality data in India is poor and deaths at home often go unregistered, especially in rural areas. There are reports of journalists counting bodies at morgues themselves, to try to get a more accurate number. In Uttar Pradesh, health officials said 68 people had died on one day earlier this month across the state. But a Hindi newspaper pointed out that officials also said there were 98 Covid funerals in the capital, Lucknow, alone. Crematoriums are working throughout the night and using empty spaces like parks and carparks to build makeshift funeral pyres Crematoriums continue to work throughout the nightto keep up with the number of bodies arriving, and many families are facing long waits before their loved ones can receive funeral rites. Some say they were asked to help speed up the process by piling the wood themselves. In the southern city of Bengaluru, one doctor told the BBC people were panicking. It is one of the worst-hit cities in India, with some estimates saying there are about 300 active Covid cases per square kilometre. ""We were not prepared for this second surge,"" the consultant said. ""For the first surge it was well organised. This time there are more cases, it was more sudden, and the situation was not prepared for."" The World Health Organization (WHO) reported in itsweekly epidemiological update,externalthat there were nearly 5.7 million new cases reported globally last week - and India accounts for 38% of them. It also said that the B.1.617 variant of the virus detected in India has a higher growth rate than other variants in the country, suggesting increased transmissibility. Can India make enough vaccines to meet demand? How is India's vaccination drive going? India is carrying out the world's biggest vaccination drive, but less than 10% of the population has so far received an initial jab and there are concerns about meeting demand. The US is helping India with the raw materials it needs for vaccine production, after India's biggest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India, complained of shortages of specialised imports from the US. Meanwhile, the first batch of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, is set to arrive in India on 1 May,The New Indian Express reports,external. It has not yet been revealed how many doses will be delivered. With most hospitals at capacity, many people are seeking help elsewhere, including this woman outside a Sikh temple in Ghaziabad India is heading towards state elections, and there is increasing anger towards both state authorities and the central government for the handling of the pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of ignoring scientific warnings to participate in election rallies and allowing a massive Hindu festival to go ahead in northern India. Dr Navjot Dahiya, the vice-president of the Indian Medical Association,called Mr Modi a ""super spreader"",externalwho had ""tossed all Covid norms in the air"". The prime minister said he had held three meetings on Tuesday to discuss ways to increase oxygen capacities and medical infrastructure, including the use of trains and military aircraft to speed up transport of oxygen supplies. Why has the situation in India been allowed to escalate so much? India Kumbh festival goes ahead amid Covid surge Have India's rallies helped spread coronavirus? The BBC's Yogita Limaye says many people are asking why the military and disaster response teams have not been put on a war footing to build field hospitals. ""There is a sense of abandonment in the country, of people being left to fend for themselves,"" our correspondent reports. State and union territory governments, from Delhi to Karnataka, have been criticised for allowing Covid protocols to lapse and failing to prepare for what epidemiologists say was an inevitable surge in infections.

Apple profits double as it squares up to FacebookTech rivals both enjoy bumper profits but Apple's latest move could dent Facebook's future sales.Business,"A surge in iPhone sales, especially in China, has led to a doubling of profits at Apple since the start of the pandemic. The results reflected ""optimism"" about the days ahead, Apple's boss said. Rival tech firm Facebook also reported bumper revenues and profits. But the social media giant warned Apple's latest software release could undermine its prospects later in the year. Apple has seen sales of its phones, apps and other devices rise throughout the pandemic, as consumers spent more time working, shopping and seeking entertainment online. Customers continued to upgrade to Apple's new 5G phones which were rolled out last year, and also bought Mac computers and iPads to tackle working and studying from home, the firm said. Fitness and music apps also saw a lockdown boost. Sales to China nearly doubled, leading to overall revenues for the first three months of this year of $89.6bn (Â£64.2bn), more than 50% up compared to a year earlier. Profit was $23.6bn, up from $11.3bn for the same period last year. ""This quarter reflects both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives, as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead for all of us,"" said chief executive Tim Cook. Facebook v Apple: The ad tracking row heats up Google owner sees record profits in lockdown boom Apple Christmas sales surge to $111bn amid pandemic Paolo Pescatore, analyst with PP Foresight, said it was ""another blowout quarter"" for Apple. ""The iPhone remains a core product and gateway to the Apple universe,"" he added, providing Apple with ""a key launchpad"" to sell further services. Sophie Lund-Yates, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said customers had proved willing to ""splurge on big-ticket items thanks to a global shift to working from home, and the fact people have found comfort in treating themselves"". ""The sheer scale of Apple's sales is testament to the grip that shiny embossed piece of fruit has on global consumers,"" she added. Facebook, which relies on sales of advertising rather than consumer electronics, also saw bumper revenues and profits in the first three months of the year. The time spent by consumers at home, and the spending power that shifted online, translated into revenues of $26.17bn, outpacing analysts predictions. Profit was also higher than expected at $9.5bn. Facebook said in coming months it expected revenue to be stable or grow moderately, and admitted a new feature released this week by Apple - an option for users to prevent apps from collecting user data - could ""significantly"" hurt its business. It's not just Apple and Facebook who have posted astonishing profits this week. Google and Microsoft announced eye-watering quarterly figures yesterday too. That may not be surprising to many. Global lockdowns have made people work and play more online. What's less clear though was whether this was a pandemic bounce? Or have people permanently changed their behaviour? These figures certainly suggest the latter. Apple's figures across multiple sectors, across the world, are exceptional. In places like China, which has mostly been lockdown-free in recent months, sales were up dramatically. Facebook's figures too, show that advertisers are feeling bullish about online spending. Almost all of Facebook's revenue is from ads, so when Facebook is doing well, that usually suggests we're buying more things on the internet. Amazon's quarterly figures are out tomorrow, and they too are expected to have had a bumper quarter. Big Tech's pandemic bounce is increasingly looking like a trend. The two companies are locked in a stand-off after Apple announced the latest version of its iOS operating system this week. A new feature will prompt device users to decide whether they are happy for their data to be collected by apps. Many are likely to say no. But user data is a large reason why Facebook's ad-based business model is so profitable. It allows advertising to be targeted and monitored for efficacy. Facebook saw a rise in monthly active users, however, which were up by 10% at 2.85 billion. On Tuesday Google's parent company Alphabet reported a record profit in the three months to March as its advertising revenue swelled by a third. The firm credited ""elevated consumer activity online"" for its results as populations around the world spent more time indoors at home to avoid the spread of coronavirus.

Hundreds of jobs at risk at car parts plants,"Far fewer workers than normal have clocked on at Swansea following the announcement Toyoda Gosei is leaving the UK Hundreds of car parts jobs are set to be axed after a firm announced it was pulling out of the UK. Toyoda Gosei UK's plants at Gorseinon in Swansea and Rotherham in South Yorkshire employ 458 people. The company, which produces components for Toyota, Nissan, Renault and Honda, said it was responding to changes in the global sector and a ""significant reduction"" in UK customer demand. A formal period of consultation with employees is under way. There are 207 people permanently employed at the Swansea site and 251 in Rotherham, the company's UK headquarters. The Swansea site, which opened in 2011, makes moulded and painted car parts, while the Rotherham plant manufactures rubber body sealing products and opened in 1999. Brexit trade change 'challenging' for car industry 'If the steelworks shuts it will destroy Rotherham' ""We understand and regret the uncertainty that this will cause for everyone at the Swansea and Rotherham sites and are doing all we can to support our employees throughout the consultation process,"" said Toyoda Gosei UK (TGUK) managing director Shigenori Matsuo. TGUK originally opened its Swansea plant with 160 workers, before the workforce became 800 strong in 2015. The firm received Â£116,000 from the Welsh government's Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) in December 2020 to help safeguard jobs against the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. TGUK said it was working with its parent company Toyoda Gosei to discuss the future of the UK operation. The company took over the plant in Swansea in 2011 ""There isn't one factor that has resulted in the announcement today,"" added a spokeswoman. One Swansea plant worker, who did not want to be identified, told BBC Wales he was very worried about paying his mortgage and the implications for his family losing his job would have. He did not attend a meeting at which the details were given to employees, but when he arrived at work later many of his colleagues were visibly upset and crying. David Grundy, BBC Wales The 14:00 shift change has just happened at Toyoda Gosei's Gorseinon plant. Hundreds of workers would usually be going home, but this afternoon just 10 workers have left the site. They kept their heads down as they walked through the main gates. Only one worker said anything to me, saying: ""We're not allowed to speak to you."" The company said it had previously reorganised its business in Europe, selling shares in a German subsidiary and moving some production to its main manufacturing site in the Czech Republic. Sarah Champion, MP for Rotherham, said the news had come ""out of the blue"" and was deeply disappointing, adding she would support the workers through ""this hugely stressful time"" and try to secure the plant's future. ""The timing couldn't be worse, people are struggling to cope with the consequences of the pandemic and trying to get back on their feet,"" she said. Toyoda Gosei UK has its headquarters in Rotherham Andrew Denniff, from Rotherham and Barnsley Chamber of Commerce, said the firm was a ""big player"" in the town and its loss would have a huge impact on families, as well as the UK. ""The impact of Brexit has now become an unpleasant reality,"" he added. A Welsh government spokesman said it was a worrying time for the workers, adding: ""We have been in contact with Toyoda Gosei about their plans to consult on the potential closure of the company's Swansea site. ""We will remain in contact with the company during the consultation period."" He said any money from the ERF grant not used for the purpose stated, or in line with the terms and conditions, may need to be repaid in full or in part.

Two Met officers charged over crime scene photos,"Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry had been celebrating Ms Henry's birthday before they were reported missing Two Met Police officers have been charged over photographs allegedly taken at a crime scene where two sisters were stabbed to death. The photographs relate to the deaths of Nicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46, who were found in Fryent Country Park, Wembley, last June. PC Deniz Jaffer and PC Jamie Lewis have each been charged with misconduct in a public office. They will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 27 May. Ms Smallman had been with friends celebrating Ms Henry's birthday on the evening of 5 June. Their bodies were found next to each other at the park two days later. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an inquiry after the officers allegedly took selfies by their dead bodies. In November, the IOPC referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to decide if charges should be brought against PC Jaffer, 47, and PC Lewis, 32. Both officers are based at the Met's North East Command Unit, which covers the boroughs of Waltham Forest and Newham. Cdr Paul Betts described the charges as ""extremely serious"". ""Our thoughts go out to the families of Bibaa and Nicole, as we recognise the renewed grief and pain this development will bring,"" he said. ""We know the public will share our outrage, but I would ask that space is now given to allow the judicial process to run its proper course."" Danyal Hussein, 18, of Blackheath, has been charged with two counts of murder and will go on trial in June.

Biden to pitch child care and free university planThe Democrat will pledge to enact free pre-school and community college in a speech to Congress.US & Canada,"President Biden will try to build support for two massive spending packages US President Joe Biden is expected to call for free pre-school and community college in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Speaking on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat will call for the most sweeping revamp of US social benefits since the 1960s. His plan includes $4tn (Â£2.9tn) of spending on education and family leave. History will also be made as two women sit behind the president for the first time during a speech to Congress. US Vice-President Kamala Harris and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi will both wear masks at the rostrum during Wednesday night's primetime address. The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way The US president's State of the Union-style remarks will be followed by the traditional rebuttal speech from the opposing party - delivered on this occasion by Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. Mr Scott, a potential 2024 White House contender who is African American, is a leading voice in his party on race. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Biden will speak at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST on Thursday) from a US Capitol that is still ringed by security fencing and guarded by hundreds of National Guard troops following the storming of the complex on 6 January by pro-Trump protesters. Ahead of his speech, he will meet congressional staff who were trapped in the building during the riot, the White House said. Around 1,600 guests usually attend a president's address to a joint session of Congress. But this time only about 200 people will get invitations because of virus-prevention protocols. Buoyed by solid approval ratings, Mr Biden will look to the tens of millions of Americans that the White House hopes will tune in from home. The president will seek to build public support for two massive packages - theÂ American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan - which analysts project would entail the most far-reaching reform of the US social safety net since the 1960s. The White House says both proposals if passed by Congress would be ""fully paid for"" by tax hikes on the richest Americans and corporations. Security remains tight around the US Capitol The American Families Plan, with a price tag of $1.8tn, aims to provide free pre-school for US children aged three to four, paid family leave and free community college, the White House said on Tuesday. It would also extend until 2025 a child tax credit that was expanded during the pandemic, offering monthly payments to lower-income parents of around $300 per child. Democrats reportedly hope to establish these payments as a permanent government programme. The White House has indicated the package would be funded by almost doubling the capital gains tax rate on incomes above $1 million to 39.6% and hiking the top income tax bracket for households earning more than $400,000 to the same level. Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Reports of Biden plans for an increase in capital gains taxes sparked a stock market sell-off last week. We thought that Joe Biden - all 78 years of him - would be a transitional president. He would be there to lower the political temperature; try to heal a divided nation. Take the absurd politics out of the response to Covid. Improve vaccine roll-out. Drain the poison from the body politic. But that aside, not do too much. He appointed a largely technocratic cabinet, presumably to perform managerial functions. Maybe make the trains run on time a bit better, but not change all the rolling stock, let alone alter the gauge of the railway. A fitting ambition for Amtrak Joe. But maybe we've got that all wrong. Is it possible that far from being transitional, he's transformational? What we all got wrong about Biden The president will also pitch his $2.3tn American Jobs Plan, which the White House unveiled last month. Billed as an infrastructure package, it seeks to invest in public transit, rail, airports, water pipes, high-speed broadband, roads and bridges, veterans' hospitals, childcare centres and combating racial disparities. The proposal also seeks to steer the US economy towards electric cars - which today make up barely 2% of vehicles of America's roads - and clean energy. This video can not be played All the times the US spent big on infrastructure It would be paid for by raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and other taxes on multinational corporations, says the White House. During his speech, Mr Biden is also expected to address cultural flashpoints such as police reform, gun violence and the crisis at the US-Mexico border. Last month he signed the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans. Senator Scott has been a leading voice in his party on race and has talked about times he has been racially profiled by police. He has hinted that his rebuttal speech will not just be about ripping into the president's agenda. ""We face serious challenges on multiple fronts, but I am as confident as I have ever been in the promise and potential of America. ""I look forward to having an honest conversation with the American people and sharing Republicans' optimistic vision for expanding opportunity and empowering working families."" But among his colleagues in Congress there has been widespread opposition to the Biden agenda. The US president's party narrowly controls the House and Senate for the first time in a decade, enabling Democrats to pass that relief bill without a single congressional vote from Republicans. Top Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday: ""President Biden ran as a moderate, but I'm hard pressed to think of anything at all that he's done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation."" In addition to three packages totalling around $6tn, Mr Biden last week also unveiled plans for a $1.5tn federal budget that would significantly expand spending on domestic programmes.

"More sex, fewer colds drive sales at Durex maker","Condom sales have jumped in countries including China where lockdowns are easing, says consumer goods giant Reckitt. It reported a ""double-digit"" increase in Durex sales in the first quarter of 2021, compared with one year ago. But demand for health products fell overall as fewer customers stocked up on cold and flu medicines. Reckitt's boss pointed out that sales for Lysol and Dettol were strong as hygiene habits improved. At the start of the pandemic last year, the firm said people were having less sex because of the coronavirus crisis, partly due to a ""manifestation of anxiety"". Conversely, the company said sales of Durex jumped when social-distancing rules were relaxed in the summer. In its nutrition division, which includes baby formula brand Enfa, sales in the first quarter fell 12.3%, but with hygiene sales up 21.1%, the overall sales tally for the first three months of the year stood at Â£3.5bn - down 1.1%. Chief executive Laxman Narasimhan said: ""Demand for Lysol and Dettol continues to be strong as consumers remain vigilant to the spread of the virus and see use of our products, and improved hygiene habits, as a way of protecting their health and regaining normality in their lives."" He said that the firm would continue to track changes in consumer behaviour and demand for different products at different stages of the pandemic. Durex condom sales jump after virus rules relaxed The company reported a 16.4% decline in sales for health products like cold and flu relief products such as Nurofen or Strepsils. It estimated that cases of flu were down by as much as 90%, while consumers had already stocked up last year. Mr Narasimhan added that in countries with few coronavirus cases and high vaccination rates, people have eased off on washing their hands or using hand sanitizers, although use was still higher than before the pandemic. For example, sales of Dettol showed strong growth in India, which is currently dealing with soaring cases of Covid, but declined in China. ""Sexual wellness"" products saw a big uptick in sales in countries like China too, as well as parts of the United States and Europe. Bosses said they expect this to grow in other countries as lockdowns and social distancing measures lead to the opportunity for more people to use their products. The results are an illustration of changes in spending habits as lockdown rules loosen. On Tuesday market research firm Kantar said that UK shoppers are making more trips to supermarkets and buying less online as lockdown lifts and the vaccine rollout continues. Its latest figures show that online supermarket sales growth has halved since the height of the pandemic, to 46%. Meanwhile, the number of trips to grocery stores rose by 4% month-on-month in the four weeks to 18 April. Kantar said older shoppers accounted for much of the rise in footfall, with much of the over-65 community now vaccinated. More than 33 million people in the UKhave received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched. Overall supermarket sales rose by 5.7% to Â£31.6 billion in the 12 weeks to 18 April, marking a slowdown in the rate of growth seen a year ago when shoppers panic-bought at the start of the crisis. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""While the market may fluctuate between growth and decline in the months ahead, depending on the year-on-year comparison being made, the fact that trip numbers are up and basket sizes down suggests that habits are slowly returning to normal.""

LiveLiveUK seeing 'very low levels' of Covid-193 minutes ago,"The UK is seeing ""very low levels"" of Covid-19, England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says Lockdown and the vaccine rollout helped with the decline in cases, he tells a Downing Street press conference Health Secretary Matt Hancock says 60m Pfizer doses have been secured by the UK They will be used for a vaccination booster programme in autumn, he says NHS England's Dr Nikki Kanani says nearly two-thirds of adults in England have been given a first dose of the vaccine India's official Covid death toll has passed 200,000 - experts believe the actual number may be higher The UK has pledged to offer further support and equipment to India in response to the spiralling crisis Spain's tourism minister has said it is hoped the country will open up to overseas travellers from June It comes as plans for an EU-wide Covid digital certificate go before the European Parliament Edited by Lauren Turner We're going to leave our live coverage here for today. Today's live page was brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Lauren Turner, Dulcie Lee, Mary O'Connor and Becky Morton. For more on today's news about the pandemic, you can read our coronavirus evening updatehere. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock led a Downing Street press conference alongside England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and Dr Nikki Kanani of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a round-up of what we learned this afternoon: Hamilton - the popular musical about America's founding fathers - is set to return to London's West End this summer, more than a year after it closed due to the pandemic. Its producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the award-winning show would resume at the Victoria Palace Theatre from 19 August. Many shows are making plans to reopen from 17 May with social distancing, and from 21 June with no restrictions. These dates depend on the third and fourth steps on the government's reopening roadmap remaining on track. On Wednesday, Mary Poppins announced it would return on 7 August at London's Prince Edward Theatre. Some West End musicals are planning to open next month with social distancing, including Everybody Loves Jamie, Les Miserables - The Staged Concert, The Mousetrap and Amelie the Musical.

This video can not be played As the vaccine rollout continues in England, with adults aged 42 now able to book online, Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he's looking forward to getting his jab Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online As lockdown eases, many of us will be heading back to the office in the coming months. If you get a chance to pick where you sit then choose wisely, say researchers who have been studying the science behind desk location and productivity. The University College London team visited the HQ of a large global tech company in the city to quiz 172 employees about their experiences of open-plan working. Window desks and more intimate, grouped desk layouts got a big thumbs-up. But sitting in a row with your back to lots of people was most unsettling. The research, in the journalPLoS One,,externalsays businesses should keep this in mind as Covid restrictions ease and more people transition from home to office-based working. Read more.  Louise CullenBBC News NI Covid testing for people in the workplace in Northern Ireland is to be expanded in what Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann describes as a ""significant move"". The workforce asymptomatic testing programme is now open to all organisations with 10 or more employees or volunteers, who cannot work from home. Previously this was open to organisations with more than 50 employees. Eligible organisations will be able to access collection points and a home delivery service to get rapid lateral flow tests. Read the full storyhere. The government says the UK has secured access to 517
million doses of eight of ""the most promising"" Covid-19 vaccines. These are:  Only the first three have so far been approved for use by the medicines regulator in the UK. Rolling reviews are under way by
the regulator to assess the Janssen and Novavax vaccines, the government says, and clinical trials are
ongoing for the Valneva, GSK-Sanofi and CureVac jabs. We just heard from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who announced the UK has ordered 60 million extra doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for its autumn booster programme. Pfizer says it's ""delighted"" to be providing the UK government with the extra doses. Ben Osborn, country manager at Pfizer
UK, says the company is ""more than doubling our supply commitment to the UK"". He adds that, alongside its partner BioNTech, Pfizer believes it can deliver more than 2.5 billion doses of their vaccine globally by the end of 2021. InEngland, people aged 42 and over are being invited to come forward for their vaccine and can book online. Text messages have been sent out with a link to the national booking service, which can also be called on 119.  People aged 45 and over inScotlandare now being invited to get their vaccine. Unpaid carers in Scotland aged 16-64 can also register online to get the vaccine. TheWelshgovernment says vaccines are now being offered to people aged 40 and over, and some health boards have started inviting the 30-39 age group. InNorthern Ireland, people aged 35 and over are now eligible. Find more detailshere. In the last question, David Hughes from the Press Association says the US health regulator has said those who have had two doses of the vaccine can meet up freely. He asks, if the government is guided by the science, why can't that happen here? Matt Hancock says: ""The decision we've taken is to move together."" He says when England moved in different stages in the autumn - under the tier system - cases popped up in areas with fewer restrictions. ""So we took the decision when we wrote the roadmap that we'll move as one,"" he says. Prof Van-Tam says where two people have had both doses of a reputable vaccine, and 14 days have passed since their second dose, he would be ""highly confident scientifically"" that it would be ""incredibly safe"" for those two people to meet. ""The answer to your question though is soon [things will change]... but not quite now,"" he says, reiterating that most people under 42 haven't had the vaccine. ""I know this feels tantalisingly, extremely close... but we just need to make sure we don't have to go backwards again on any of this."" ""Just hold the line for a teeny bit longer."" David Hughes from the Press Association asks whether the health secretary ever heard the prime minister say he would be prepared to let coronavirus ""rip"" or see ""bodies pile high"" rather than impose another lockdown. (If you need a reminder, his question is in reference tothis story- and the prime minister has strongly denied making the comments.) In response, Matt Hancock says: ""No, I didn't."" The Mirror's Ben Glaze asks when the government will set out a timetable for an inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid pandemic. He also asks what sort of issues this inquiry should examine. Hancock says it is ""important"" that an inquiry is held and that ""there will be time"" for one, but adds the ""most important thing"" for decision-makers is that they're ""constantly learning"". On what the inquiry should cover, he adds that it should ""cover everything"". Prof Van-Tam adds that the inquiry is very important but pleads for it not to happen now, as the UK is currently still working hard to cement the gains it has made against the virus. He adds that he hopes the inquiry ""properly explores"" the role of the ""unsung heroes"" in the pandemic, including people who've worked tirelessly at vaccination centres. Chris Smyth from the Times asks what measures may be needed beyondthe current ""roadmap""unveiled by the prime minister. Van-Tam says ""the modelling consensus is clear"", pointing to the UK having a third wave. ""I am personally hopeful that if the vaccine programme continues at pace... the third wave might just be a third upsurge and much less significant,"" he says. He says this should be because of the ""de-linking"" between cases and deaths - given the successful vaccines. But he says it's inconceivable that there will be ""no further bumps in the road"", and they'll probably come in autumn and winter. Matt Hancock adds ""we're going to have to live with coronavirus much like we do with flu"" through infection prevention control and vaccinations. But, like flu, the goal is that Covid won't dominate our lives like it does today, he says. Smyth also asks about the investigation into funding of works on Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat, but Hancock says he'll give that question ""a miss"". The next question comes from LBC's Ben Kentish, who asks that given the positive data shown today - including the news that over 70% of adults in England now have antibodies - he asks whether restrictions on areas such as funerals could be relaxed earlier. He also asks about data on how well current vaccines are working against current variants of the virus; and also how close we might be to herd immunity, given the antibody data we've seen so far. On funerals, Hancock says the data shows that the UK's unlocking roadmap is on track. He adds the dates set out on the roadmap are ""not-before dates"" so the government can see the impact of each step of unlocking before progressing to the next step. Answering the other two questions, Van-Tam says there are some ""twists and turns"" still to come, but we are ""moving at pace"". He adds he doesn't want the nation to run into ""any wet patches"" in the future, adding there will be ""good"" and ""bad"" pressures on the R - or reproduction rate - of the virus in the next few weeks as the UK unlocks restrictions. Channel 4's Krishnan Guru-Murthy asks if the government is reconsidering the ""Britain-first approach"" to vaccines, given the situation in India, or whether the government can release any doses to support the country. Matt Hancock says: ""We are supporting India with what we can. We don't have any excess doses of vaccine in the UK at the moment."" He reiterates that they are sending ventilators ""that we thankfully don't need here anymore"" as well as oxygen production machines being sent from Northern Ireland. First up from the media is BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, whose question is aboutthe funding of works on Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat. She asks: ""If a serving government minister is found to have broken the rules on party funding, or even law, should they resign?"" Matt Hancock doesn't answer the question directly, saying the prime minister has already answered ""lots of questions"" about the matter in the House of Commons earlier. ""Given that this is a coronavirus press conference, you won't be surprised that I'm not going to add to the answers the prime minister has already given very extensive questioning,"" he says before moving on. Another question from the public now, and Melonie from Derbyshire asks how the UK will stay a global leader in biomedical innovation and research. Matt Hancock says the government plans to attract on-shore manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. ""We want to make it an impossible choice for a pharmaceutical company not to invest in the UK,"" he says. ""We will not ever block exports to anywhere around the world of a product made for a market around the world,"" he adds, saying: ""Probably our greatest contribution to saving lives and tackling this pandemic around the world is the Oxford-AztraZeneca vaccine."" Rachel from Derby is the first member of the public to ask a question. She wants to know when people will be able to take their care home relatives out for a walk in the fresh air without them having to isolate on their return. The health secretary says his department is ""working on it right now"" to ensure officials can get the rules right on this. He says he hopes to have some ""good news"" on this soon. Van-Tam says it is very important for people's mental health to get this right, but also important to do it carefully. Nearly three-quarters of a million people booked their vaccine appointments since Monday, Kanani says, as the vaccination programme was rolled out to 42-year-olds this week. That's nearly 250 appointments being booked every
minute, or around 15,000 an hour. ""We'll continue to maintain that as far as supplies allow,"" she says. Nearly two-thirds of the adult population in England have been given a first dose of the vaccine, NHS England's Dr Nikki Kanani says. And more than a quarter of people have been fully vaccinated. Kanani stresses the second dose of the vaccine is ""crucial"" and people still have to follow social distancing. Â© 2025 BBC.

"'A horror story': India Covid deaths pass 200,000There are fears the real number is even higher, as hospitals continue to turn dying patients away.","India has reached the devastating figure of 200,000 coronavirus deaths, with the pressure on many hospitals showing no sign of abating amid a surging second wave. The real number of fatalities is thought to be far greater, with many not being officially recorded. Oxygen supplies remain critically low across the country, with the black market the only option for some people. Crematoriums are operating non-stop, with makeshift pyres in car parks. There have been at least 300,000 new infections every day in the past week, with more than 360,000 new cases in the past 24 hours on Wednesday. Overall, more than 17.9 million cases have been registered. Foreign aid has started to arrive from the UKand Singapore. Russia, New Zealand and France have pledged to send emergency medical equipment, and even regional rivals Pakistan and China have put aside their differences and promised to help. On Thursday,the US said it would start delivering supplies,externalworth more than $100m, in addition to individual US states and private companies also readying oxygen, equipment, and supplies for Indian hospital. However, experts say the aid will only have a limited effect in a nation that has a population of 1.3 billion. As it happened: BBC's live coverage on India's Covid surge Why India's Covid crisis matters to the whole world India's round-the-clock mass cremations A government website where Indians can register for a vaccination programme crashed soon after it launched on Wednesday, as tens of thousands of people tried to access it. And in the state of Assam, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake damaged hospitals which were already under intense strain. People ran from their homes and other buildings in panic. The numbers we are seeing are staggeringly high - but the real number of fatalities are thought to be much higher. Mortality data in India is poor and deaths at home often go unregistered, especially in rural areas. There are reports of journalists counting bodies at morgues themselves, to try to get a more accurate number. In Uttar Pradesh, health officials said 68 people had died on one day earlier this month across the state. But a Hindi newspaper pointed out that officials also said there were 98 Covid funerals in the capital, Lucknow, alone. Crematoriums are working throughout the night and using empty spaces like parks and carparks to build makeshift funeral pyres Crematoriums continue to work throughout the nightto keep up with the number of bodies arriving, and many families are facing long waits before their loved ones can receive funeral rites. Some say they were asked to help speed up the process by piling the wood themselves. In the southern city of Bengaluru, one doctor told the BBC people were panicking. It is one of the worst-hit cities in India, with some estimates saying there are about 300 active Covid cases per square kilometre. ""We were not prepared for this second surge,"" the consultant said. ""For the first surge it was well organised. This time there are more cases, it was more sudden, and the situation was not prepared for."" The World Health Organization (WHO) reported in itsweekly epidemiological update,externalthat there were nearly 5.7 million new cases reported globally last week - and India accounts for 38% of them. It also said that the B.1.617 variant of the virus detected in India has a higher growth rate than other variants in the country, suggesting increased transmissibility. Can India make enough vaccines to meet demand? How is India's vaccination drive going? India is carrying out the world's biggest vaccination drive, but less than 10% of the population has so far received an initial jab and there are concerns about meeting demand. The US is helping India with the raw materials it needs for vaccine production, after India's biggest vaccine maker, the Serum Institute of India, complained of shortages of specialised imports from the US. Meanwhile, the first batch of the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, is set to arrive in India on 1 May,The New Indian Express reports,external. It has not yet been revealed how many doses will be delivered. With most hospitals at capacity, many people are seeking help elsewhere, including this woman outside a Sikh temple in Ghaziabad India is heading towards state elections, and there is increasing anger towards both state authorities and the central government for the handling of the pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of ignoring scientific warnings to participate in election rallies and allowing a massive Hindu festival to go ahead in northern India. Dr Navjot Dahiya, the vice-president of the Indian Medical Association,called Mr Modi a ""super spreader"",externalwho had ""tossed all Covid norms in the air"". The prime minister said he had held three meetings on Tuesday to discuss ways to increase oxygen capacities and medical infrastructure, including the use of trains and military aircraft to speed up transport of oxygen supplies. Why has the situation in India been allowed to escalate so much? India Kumbh festival goes ahead amid Covid surge Have India's rallies helped spread coronavirus? The BBC's Yogita Limaye says many people are asking why the military and disaster response teams have not been put on a war footing to build field hospitals. ""There is a sense of abandonment in the country, of people being left to fend for themselves,"" our correspondent reports. State and union territory governments, from Delhi to Karnataka, have been criticised for allowing Covid protocols to lapse and failing to prepare for what epidemiologists say was an inevitable surge in infections.

From trailblazing leader to party civil war,"Arlene Foster on the steps of Stormont on 11 January 2016, on her first day as first minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster faced unprecedented challenges and monumental political changes during her tenure as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). From Brexit to the Irish Sea border and of course the pandemic, it has been a tough few years for Northern Ireland's first minister, culminating in the revolt that has forced her to step down. Here BBC News NI charts her career. Arlene Foster had to lead NI's response to the pandemic Mrs Foster, a lawyer from County Fermanagh, held the DUP's top job for just over five years. She becameleader of the party in December 2015and, the following month as leader of Stormont's largest party, she was appointedfirst minister of Northern Ireland. She was the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs. When she took on the roles, she was viewed by many as a capable minister and a popular leader whose personal experiences shaped her passion for the unionist cause. This video can not be played Arlene Foster was nominated by her predecessor to take the first minister role Born as Arlene Kelly in 1970, she grew up on a farm in rural County Fermanagh, close to the Irish border. The Troubles played a significant role in her childhood - when she was eight years old, the IRA attempted to kill her father, a reserve police officer, outside her family home. ""My father came in on all fours crawling, with blood coming from his head,"" Mrs Foster told theBelfast Telegraph in 2015.,external Mr Kelly survived the attack, but the family was forced to sell their farm and move away. ""I now know that this was a deliberate tactic of targeting vulnerable border Protestants to drive them from their homes,"" she wrote in theNews Letter in January 2016,externalafter taking Stormont's top job. ""I want to send a very direct message to the victims of the violence: I am one of you, I am on your side and I will not let you down."" As as teenager in 1988 the IRA set off a bomb on her school bus and the future first minister was caught up in the blast. An IRA bomb exploded under Arlene Foster's school bus in 1988 The target of the attack was the bus driver, who was also a part-time soldier in the Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). Arlene Kelly was not hurt in the explosion, but a schoolgirl sitting next to her was seriously injured. When she left grammar school in Enniskillen, the future Mrs Foster became the first member of her family to go to university, studying law at Queen's University, Belfast. She became politically active at university, joining the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and chairing Queen's Ulster Unionist Association. She qualified as a solicitor and began working in private practice in Enniskillen and Portadown, County Armagh. On 24 August 1995, aged 25, she married Brian Foster, and the couple went on to have three children. Arlene Foster worked as a solicitor after taking a law degree at Queen's University, Belfast In 2003, Mrs Foster was elected as a UUP assembly member (MLA) for her home constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. But she vehemently opposed David Trimble's leadership of the UUP and the following year she defected to Ian Paisley's DUP. When the DUP entered a power-sharing government with Sinn FÃ©in in 2007, Mrs Foster was given her first government post - environment minister. She then held posts as minister of enterprise, trade and investment and finance minister. When former DUP leader Peter Robinson stepped down as first minister in late 2015, Mrs Foster was elected unopposed as his successor. She passed her first electoral test in May 2016, when the DUP consolidated its position as thelargest party in Northern Ireland. The following month, Mrs Foster and the DUP were on the winning side of the Brexit debate when theUK voted to leave the European Union. Within a year of taking up her post as DUP leader, she was feeling the heat from a financial controversy at Stormont. TheRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme, which had been set up by Mrs Foster when she was economy minister in 2012, was in danger of a multi-million pound overspend. The RHI boiler scheme was criticised for 'burn more to earn more' incentives When she refused to step aside, saying she had done nothing wrong,the then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuiness resigned. The nature of their joint office meant that when he quit,she lost her jobtoo and a snap assembly election was triggered. The collapse of Stormont's coalition government in January 2017 would lead to a three-year gap in devolution. During a bitter election campaign, Mrs Foster compared Sinn FÃ©in to a ""crocodile"" that would keep coming back for more when she was asked about the party's demand for an Irish language act. Republicans embraced the crocodile comparison during the election campaign In the end, the DUP topped the poll and retained its place as Stormont's biggest party, but Sinn FÃ©in narrowed the gap to a single seat. The result also meant thatfor the first time, unionists did not hold an overall majorityin the Northern Ireland Assembly. But in June 2017, a snap general election produced a dramatic reversal of fortunes for Mrs Foster. Prime Minister Theresa May lost the Conservative's majority at Westminster, forcing her to seek the DUP's support to stay in power. Theresa May's disastrous 2017 snap election thrust DUP leader Arlene Foster into a spotlight rarely enjoyed by Northern Ireland politicians Mrs Foster and her DUP delegation negotiated more than Â£1bn in extra public spending for Northern Ireland, in exchange for a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Tories. As Mrs May tried to strike a Brexit deal with the EU however, the DUP threatened to pull the plug if it did not agree with the eventual arrangements. But Mrs Foster argued there could not be an economic border in the Irish Sea, describing that as a ""blood-red line"" for the DUP. In November 2018, her party placed its trust in the then backbench MP Boris Johnson who gave the keynote speech at the DUP's annual conference. Nigel Dodds, Boris Johnson and Arlene Foster at the 2018 DUP party conference Mr Johnson received rapturous applause when hecalled for the proposed Irish border arrangements to be junked. Several months later, now in office as prime minister, Mr Johnson did the complete opposite and agreed to a trade border down the Irish Sea, in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Unionists felt betrayed by Mr Johnson - but some pointed the finger at the DUP leadership for allowing its influence to be abused. Mrs Foster later joked she had sent the prime minister ""to the naughty step"", with the DUP refusing to uphold its confidence-and-supply commitments with the government. This video can not be played Boris Johnson 'sent to the naughty step' twice by the DUP, says Arlene Foster Boris Johnson won a large majority in the December general election that year, and no longer needed DUP support. The DUP meanwhile lost two of its 10 seats, with its deputy leader Nigel Dodds among the casualties. Out of influence at Westminster, the party was facing calls from an impatient public to return to power-sharing at Stormont. In January 2020, devolution was restored with theNew Decade, New Approach agreementand the DUP formed a new government with Sinn FÃ©in and three smaller parties. Mrs Foster resumed her role as first minister and said it was ""time for Stormont to move forward"". Mrs Foster, along with Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, was tasked with leading the local response to the biggest global crisis since World War Two. Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster held regular joint press conferences in the early days of the pandemic The first few months appeared to be marked by a new spirit of cross-party cooperation, as the pair frequently appeared together to appeal to the public to follow strict lockdown regulations. But by June 2020, political relations were once again at breaking point. Mrs O'Neill, along with other Sinn FÃ©in politicians, was among about 2,000 mourners at thefuneral of senior republican Bobby Storey. Having ordered so many grieving families to forego the usual funeral customs to protect lives, images of the large cortege caused widespread anger. Mrs Foster stopped appearing at joint coronavirus press conferences with Ms O'Neill - a stand-off that continued until a second wave of the virus took hold in the autumn. The Covid crisis was still dominating the news agenda when the new Irish Sea border came into operation on 1 January 2021. Unionist anger over the Irish Sea border has grown and by April, it was cited among the reasons which contributed to a spate of riots. A bus was hijacked in west Belfast and left to freewheel along a road before being set on fire on 7 April Some of Mrs Foster's critics in the DUP were also angered by her decision to abstain ina vote on banning gay conversion therapy in the Northern Ireland Assemblyrather than opposing it with the majority of the party's MLAs. On Tuesday, it emerged thatmore than 20 MLAs, four MPs and a peer had signed a lettercalling for leadership contest. It was clear that her tumultuous tenure as party leader - and NI First Minister - was coming to an end. In her resignation statement, she urged young people to get involved in politics ""to shape Northern Ireland for the better"". ""My election as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party broke a glass ceiling and I am glad inspired other women to enter politics and spurred them on to take up elected office."" Mrs Foster added: ""I have sought to lead the party and Northern Ireland away from division and towards a better path. ""There are people in Northern Ireland with a British identity, others are Irish, others are Northern Irish, others are a mixture of all three and some are new and emerging. We must all learn to be generous to each other, live together and share this wonderful country. ""The future of unionism and Northern Ireland will not be found in division, it will only be found in sharing this place we all are privileged to call home."" As her party met in a Belfast hotel to ratify the election of her successor Edwin Poots as DUP leader, Mrs Foster shared her thoughts about the nature of her ousting with theBBC's Newscast programme. Arlene Foster leaving a Belfast hotel the night her successor was officially ratified as DUP leader ""I think I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards, it was pretty brutal,"" she said. ""I had absolutely no idea and was telephoned by a close colleague that this was happening on Monday evening and then by Tuesday morning, it was all in the papers, so it wasn't particularly pleasant."" She had originally indicated that she intended to stay on as first minister until the end of June, but Mr Poots was anxious to get his new ministerial team in place sooner. In the end, it was agreed thatMrs Foster would stay on to host a British-Irish Council summitin her native County Fermanagh on 11 June. This was her swansong as first minister - her last big political event on her home soil - and it also produced an actual song as Mrs Foster broke into a rendition of a Frank Sinatra classic. ""That's life, that's what all the people say. You're riding high in April, shot down in May,"" she sang at a press conference. This video can not be played Arlene Foster does it her way with a Sinatra classic Her pertinent choice of lyrics meant Mrs Foster bowed out to applause and laughter in Fermanagh. At midday on Monday 14 June, the assembly member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone addressed the Northern Ireland Assembly for the final time as first minister. An hour later, her resignation became official. Over the course of the last few weeks, Mrs Foster has often referred to the end of her ""local"" political career, so as leaves the stage in Belfast it is unlikely to be her final role in public life.

The city of Mumbai - which sits in the state of Maharashtra, India's biggest hotspot - has been in complete lockdown for two weeks. There's a sense of deja vu -  the pictures are eerily reminiscent of a period of time last year when large parts of the entire world went into a state of lockdown. But the pictures are a reminder that for millions in India - this is still their reality. The western state of Maharashtra, which has been India's Covid ground zero from the start of the pandemic, is back at the top after briefly reporting a drop in cases. The state, among Indiaâs richest and home to its financial hub, Mumbai, confirmed more than 66,000 cases  last night. Thatâs more than any other state, adding to an active caseload that is already the highest in India. Maharashtra accounts for more than a quarter of Indiaâs 17.9 million cases and nearly a third of India's 201,000 deaths so far. Mayank Bhagwat of BBC Marathi explains more. This video can not be played Western Maharashtra is India's worst-affected region Ashitha NageshBBC News, London It's widely agreed among experts that both cases and deaths are being under-reported in India right now - and one expert tells me that she thinks the real figures could be as high as 10 times the official numbers in some areas. Dr Amita Gupta is a professor of medicine in international health at the US-based Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and she facilitates the university's partnerships with clinics and labs across India. ""We were estimating that the problem is 10 times worse in places like Maharashtra than the official numbers, based on what we're hearing,"" she says. One of the main problems is that only people with symptoms are being tested, and even then testing labs are already at capacity. ""We've heard from many of the big lab chains around India... they're running 24/7 and are essentially overrun with tests. There's only so many they can test."" Queues of patients and their families have been forming outside hospitals as people get increasingly desperate to access treatment. But Dr Jayesh Lele told BBC World TV that this was causing patients to get sicker and leaving medical staff scared. This video can not be played India Covid: Queues outside hospitals causing anger and harassment, says doctor The surge in cases has meant delays in people getting admitted to hospital. As these pictures from today show, patients have been left waiting in cars or rickshaws in the western city of Ahmedabad.

Neha says she often wonders what would have happened if she had contracted Covid now instead, because there ""just isn't the infrastructure"" to keep people well. Indiaâs hospitals are using 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen a day - equating to 90% of the oxygen supply, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. Thatâs a massive leap, not just from pre-Covid times, when healthcare facilities used just 15% of Indiaâs oxygen supply, but also three times more than was used in the peak of the first wave last September. You can read more about Indiaâs oxygen struggles here. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London Right now Soma is working on getting medical supplies and treatments to people living on the streets of Kolkata. She's just finished an ambulance round with the Hope foundation, and is heading back into the hospital when I speak to her. I ask how her day has been so far, and she replies with one word: ""Hectic."" Her hospital has 45 beds and 40 of them are currently occupied by confirmed Covid patients. The remaining five are suspected to have the virus. On top of that, they're facing the same dire shortages of equipment and oxygen that are hitting medical centres across the country. Vulnerable people, she says, ""are coming here from across West Bengal,"" after failing to get admitted to government hospitals. ""This is because there is no proper treatment for these people from our government."" BBC Radio's Asian Network As part of our special day of India coverage, BBC Asian Network has a  programme on BBC
Sounds asking: Has India been let down by Narendra Modiâs government? You can listen here. We have spoken to the ruling BJP party and campaigners in India, as well as the Asian Network audience. We also hear from our reporters in London, Leicester and Bolton, to find
out how Indian communities there have been affected. A day after the Board of Control for Cricket in India urged players to play on for ""humanity"" we also ask whether the IPL should be

Rashid looks at how Bollywood is responding to the unfolding tragedy. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London In the vast, 1,100 sq km Chilika Lagoon in Odisha lies a group of island villages - cut off from the mainland, and accessible only by boat. Dr Manoranjan Mishra, head of an organisation called Jeevan Rekha Parishad (JRP), says access to food and education there has been limited over the past year because of lockdowns. JRP organises food deliveries to the islands via local volunteers, to avoid people from the mainland travelling over. The impact has been particularly hard on the Dalit community, formerly known as ""untouchables"". ""They have no income, no connectivity, no electricity... because they're completely excluded from the mainstream of society,"" Dr Mishra tells me. But has the virus itself reached the islands? ""Fortunately, you'll not believe, the island people are completely safe,"" Dr Mishra tells me. ""Not a single positive case has been found so far. Nobody is going there, and they're not going out - so they're completely safe."" This video can not be played Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come in for criticism over his handling of the crisis. He is currently working relentlessly with the health ministry and other countries to tackle oxygen shortages, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national spokesperson Shaina Nana Chudasama has said. âIt is most unfortunate that we have lost lives and nobody expected this double mutant to shape up in this particular way,â she told BBC World TV earlier. Harrowing scenes are emerging from India by the hour - some of which we've pictured and reported on in this live page today. The official death toll has exceeded 200,000 - though experts believe the actual total is higher - and people are dying while waiting for hospital beds as oxygen supplies run low and hospitals collapse under the strain. The crisis has also affected those reporting on it every day. Two of the BBC's Delhi-based reporters - Soutik Biswas and Vikas Pandey - have been sharing their experiences of striving to help
family and friends, while also working overtime to report the nightmare
unfolding around them. In the last two weeks, 45 journalists in India have died with Covid-19. Overall, more than 100 have died with the virus, according to Press Emblem Campaign, a Switzerland-based media group. However a group of mental health professionals have raised questions about how some sections of the media have been reporting on the crisis - and the impact on those reading or watching. Experts including Dr BN Gangadhar of New Delhi's National Medical Commission,external, have signed an open letter urging journalists to show ""restraint in their coverage, without compromising upon facts or public interest"". They write that reporting images of ""bodies burning in cremation grounds [and] relatives of the deceased wailing inconsolably"" might ""help garner eyeballs"" but there was a ""steep price to be paid for such coverage"". They warn a ""hidden mental health epidemic"" is already emerging from the Covid-related restrictions on peoples' lives, and that seeing such ""disturbing and depressing visuals"" while stuck at home could push people ""much deeper into the abyss"".

Reporting on shortages of certain supplies is the ""right thing to do so that action can be taken"" but it must include specifics such as exactly where the shortage is. ""Specific information empowers people and prepares them to face any challenge. But panic weakens them,"" the experts say. They stress they are not saying that facts should not be reported but instead that ""hysteria and panic-inducing coverage"" should be avoided. ""In such times the media has great power to inform, educate, and most importantly infuse hope in the people. This includes the sharing of authentic information and allaying of fears. ""These are extremely important weapons in the fight against the pandemic."" Rajini VaidyanathanBBC South Asia Correspondent Patients being treated at a New Delhi hospital Back in January, it was the beginning of Indiaâs vaccination drive. In Delhi, brightly coloured balloons hung over an archway to the hospital entrance. On that day, there was a mood of celebration. The hospitalâs medical director, Suresh Kumar, smiled from under his mask. It was a smile of relief - as he told me how wards which had been dedicated to coronavirus cases were now able to treat other, routine conditions. Covid-19 cases were low, and many thought India was past the worst. Months later, and that couldnât be further from the distressing reality. Gone are the balloons and buoyancy - replaced instead by a sense of desperation. Back then there were around 10,000-15,000 cases reported a day - with under  100 deaths. Now there are more than 300,000 daily cases, and more than 2,000 daily deaths. Scrolling through my social media feeds I see message after message, written by families struggling to find beds for friends and relatives. Indian health experts Iâve talked to believe the numbers dying with, or because of, Covid are far higher than the official statistics.The pyres that burn through the night at some of the crematoriums are visual testament to this. How did India get here? Many say it was a sense of complacency. Mass gatherings had taken place, with no social distancing and few people wearing masks. In my circle of friends in Delhi, almost everyone now knows someone whoâs lost a loved one to Covid-19. A friendâs three-year old son has the virus â doctors say theyâre seeing more younger patients this time round. The joy of that January morning has now turned into sheer horror, which is unfolding across the country. Listen to more from Rajini onBBC Sounds here. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London Shishir Joshi is from Project Mumbai, a non-profit working on Covid relief for people living in the city's slum areas. He tells me that last year they mostly focused on getting food and funds to people below the poverty line who weren't able to work in lockdown - but now, the priority is healthcare. ""We are also now providing what we call oxygen concentrators,"" he says. An oxygen concentrator is a machine that allows someone to have oxygen treatment administered at home - and with hospitals in the city packed to capacity, it is becoming a vital piece of equipment. ""We started a project to provide these machines to people below the poverty line in Mumbai - for free of course.... In the absence of hospital beds, people need oxygen concentrators."" Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi With Covid has also come the ""shadow pandemic"" - a term the UN has used to describe the steep rise in cases of domestic violence. The countryâs National Commission for Women says it received 23,722 complaints of crimes against women in 2020 - the highest in the past six years. Of those, almost a quarter were complaints of domestic violence. The trend has continued into 2021 - with 1,463 complaints of domestic violence reported between 1 January and 25 March. In rural India, many men who returned home from the cities after losing their jobs brought along financial stress and fears of sickness. Some took out their frustrations on their wives and children. The frequency and the brutality of assaults are said to have gone up, says Urvashi Gandhi of charity Breakthrough, with its partner NGOs ""receiving frantic calls to rescue women trapped in unsafe homes"". People in Mumbai waiting to receive a vaccine Dr Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics, has been telling theBBC's Newscast podcastwhat the world needs to do to stop more countries suffering like India. She said: ""Rather than sending donations, we need to stop them getting like that, massively ramping up global distribution and global production of vaccines."" Which country could be next? ""I think Peru is one to look at, the numbers there are getting really scary"", said Dr  Wenham. ""What the last 14 months has taught us, is that if you take your eye off the ball for a second and get complacent, it can happen anywhere.""

Amitabha BhattasaliBBC News, West Bengal This video can not be played Large election rallies worsen West Bengal crisis It was only a couple of weeks ago when the mood in West Bengal state was ""There is no more coronavirus, why use a mask?"" That has now changed. Cases in the state are surging in the wake of huge election rallies - and it's likely to be the next big hotspot. The eastern state in is the middle of a heated election and rallies are continuing. Some of the biggest ones, including those attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have seen throngs of people not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. Although Modi has since cancelled his rallies, amid mounting criticism, local politicians are yet to do so The election commission has now limited them to a maximum of 500 people. There is also no lockdown or curfew in the state - despite a new high of 16,403 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. South Africa's Faf du Plessis takes a catch for Chennai Super Kings against Sunrisers Hyderabad Despite the continued rise in cases and deaths across India, the Indian Premier League - the world's top Twenty20 competition, compromising  the world's best players - is continuing. The tournament has moved to Delhi - where a match is taking place right now - and Ahmedabad, after starting in Mumbai and Chennai. There have been no cases within the tournament, which is taking place in a bubble, but some overseas players have started to leave the tournament because of travel restrictions that their home countries are putting into place. England's Liam Livingstone left Rajasthan Royals, while Australia'sAndrew Tye, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardsonhave all departed. India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has also decided to take a break to ""support his family"". Despite that, the tournament is expected to continue, with a senior IPL official arguing it keeps people's spirits up. ""We should not underestimate the power of sport to spread positivity. It's probably more important now to hold the IPL, when there is so much negativity around,"" the official told Reuters. ""At least fans are absorbed in it at home. Otherwise many of them will step out without masks. ""The league generates considerable money for the economy. It has to be seen from that context too. How does stopping IPL help?"" BBC Radio 5 Live Radhika Howarth lives in London but is currently stuck in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh state, where she has been caring for her 84-year-old mother. Radhika arrived in India on 30 March and was allowed to enter Gwalior after spending a week in quarantine in Delhi. Before that, she had not seen her mother, Shamoli, for 18 months because of the pandemic. Shamoli was in need of support after she recently had a fall and her carer had to stop visiting because of the surge in Covid-19 cases. Radhika told BBC Radio 5 Live in the UK that she did not even want to step out of her front door, for fear of herself or her mother catching coronavirus. ""What I am hearing is very grim, all we can hear outside are the sirens of ambulances up and downâ¦ it just makes your heart sink,"" she said. ""I feel guilty even asking for a test [PCR Covid-19 test] to be able to fly back because I know people are desperate to get the test and get the treatment."" Radhika said hospitals had put out signs saying âNo beds available.â She and her mother have essential supplies but they are currently sticking to one meal a day to try to manage. âI want to come back, but I donât want to come back, because how will people like my mother cope?"" she said. ""In a situation like this you are so disempowered, you have no rights, and thereâs no one around to turn to.

Hamilton musical announces West End return,"There will have been 17 months between the last show and the reopening date Smash hit musical Hamilton is planning to be back in London's West End this summer, more than a year after it closed because of the pandemic. Producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the award-winning show about the USA's founding fathers would resume at the Victoria Palace Theatre from 19 August. He said he was ""delighted"" to give the news after an ""incredibly hard year"". Many shows are making plans to reopen from 17 May with social distancing, and from June 21 with no restrictions. Those dates depend on the third and fourth steps on the government's reopening roadmap remaining on track. This video can not be played The musical about one of the founding fathers of the United States has won seven Olivier Awards Hamilton opened in London in December 2017 and continued to play there until theatres shut last March because of Covid-19. Most stages have been in darkness ever since. Sir Cameron said he was ""moved and inspired by the resilience and camaraderie of so many practitioners from all aspects of our industry who have taken on any job so that they and their families could survive"". From West End Stage to supermarket food delivery The night the theatres went dark London theatres 'devastated' to close again Hamilton is now booking until February 2022, with the cast yet to be announced.

Spears asks to address court over conservatorship,"The singer has been under the legal arrangement for 13 years A lawyer for Britney Spears says she has requested to speak directly about her conservatorship in court. The singer's father, Jamie Spears, was granted control over her personal and business affairs in a court-ordered conservatorship in 2008. The order was originally granted after the star was hospitalised amid concerns over her mental health. A documentary released earlier this year has sparked renewed scrutiny over the arrangement. ""My client has requested a hearing at which she can address the court directly,"" Samuel Ingham told the court on Tuesday, adding that his client had ""asked that it be done on an expedited basis"". The judge set a hearing date for 23 June. It is unclear if Spears will appear in person and, if she does, what she will say. The singer has previously indicated through lawyers that she no longer wants her father to oversee her personal affairs. Jamie Spears was originally made his daughter's temporary conservator after she was admitted to hospital for psychiatric assessment in 2008, following a series of public incidents that raised concerns about her welfare. Exact details of her order have not been made public but a conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Spears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one is for her estate and financial affairs, the other is for her as a person. Why the media is saying sorry to Britney Spears Britney Spears: What is conservatorship? Britney Spears 'cried for weeks' over documentary Her father used to be in control of both, but stepped down as her personal conservator in 2019 for health reasons. Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, replaced him as personal conservator on a temporary basis but Britney Spears has requested this be made permanent. Fans from the ""Free Britney"" movement were outside the Los Angeles court on Tuesday The 39-year-old's lawyer previously told the court she was scared of her father and would not be returning to the stage while he remained in control of her life. A grassroots movement of fans, known as the #FreeBritney campaign, has backed her legal fight to regain her autonomy. The prolonged legal row gained renewed attention following the release of Framing Britney Spears, a documentary which centred on the conflict over the singer's guardianship, earlier this year. The singer said on Instagram in March thatshe had ""cried for two weeks"" over the documentary. Vivian Thoreen, a lawyer for Jamie Spears, has described him as ""a fiercely loving, dedicated and loyal father"" who she said had stopped his daughter being exploited. A judge in February denieda request by Mr Spears to exert greater control over his daughter's financial affairs. He remains a co-conservator of her estate alongside a financial company, the Bessemer Trust. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Shortage of radiologists adds to NHS pressures,"Wales has 38% fewer consultants than needed to keep up with demand, according to The Royal College of Radiologists A ""shocking shortage"" in imaging doctors could risk patient safety and make it ""extremely difficult"" to cut waiting lists built up during the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have warned. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) said Wales had the UK's worst shortage with 38% fewer consultants than needed to keep up with demand. Charities called the figures alarming. Parties fighting to lead the next Welsh government in May's election said they would recruit more staff to the NHS. Radiologists are doctors who specialise in interpreting X-rays, scans and other types of medical images which are vital in detecting and diagnosing injury and disease including cancer. Thelatest figures,externalshow more than 500,000 people were on waiting lists in Wales in February and 20,548 patients had to wait more than eight weeks for a scan following a consultant or GP referral - 33 times higher than at the same time last year. The RCR estimates the Welsh NHS needs to recruit 97 more radiologists to meet growing demand - yet its research suggests there was no increase in the number of consultants here during 2019-20. The situation could be made worse, it warned, with its survey suggesting 11% of radiologists in Wales planning on leaving the NHS next year, with 43% of those staying intending to reduce their hours. A significant proportion of the radiologist workforce, the RCR said, feel ""demoralised"". Senior doctors said they were worried there were not enough consultants to keep patients safe, and the shortage would make it very difficult to deal with the significant backlog of tests and treatments that built up during the pandemic. Swansea consultant radiologist Dr Toby Wells, who represents the RCR in Wales, said the pandemic had piled on the pressure but there had been a ""crisis"" in recruitment for years, leading to a ""shocking shortage"". ""We're trying to catch up that backlog but it's on a background of a shortage of radiologists, a shortage of scanners, a shortage of radiographers,"" he said. Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists There have also been changes in working practices, with radiologists scanning fewer people in a day due to social distancing measures. ""Trying to accommodate that and make any progress, and catching up, is difficult,"" he said. Although the number of patients awaiting scans has reduced since February, he said there was a ""huge backlog of patients waiting to see surgeons"" which would lead to an increase in workload. ""We're trying to catch up,"" says Dr Toby Wells who represents the RCR in Wales Plaid Cymru said: ""Over the past year we have witnessed the frailties and unsustainability of healthcare services and the lack of investment that led to an overdependence on the goodwill and sheer dedication of the health and care workforce. ""A Plaid Cymru government has a five-year plan to recruit and train an additional 1,000 doctors, 4,000 nurses, and 1,000 allied healthcare professionals, including radiologists. ""We will also prioritise the continued roll out of multi disciplinary cancer diagnostic centres across Wales, making access to diagnostic tests easier for patients and GPs."" The Welsh Liberal Democrats said: ""This isn't something which will be solved overnight. ""Training medical staff takes times and that is why our manifesto for next week's election has commitments to boost medical recruitment as well as to improve levels of staff retention. ""We know that many staff leave the NHS due to burnout and stress and that many don't feel they have the mental health support they need to continue."" Welsh Labour said: ""Our Â£3.4m support last term helped open the new state of the artNational Imaging Academy Walesin August 2018 that is training the next generation of radiologists and imaging professionals. ""The National Health Service is our top priority and we've pledged an NHS recovery plan on day one with more than Â£1bn of funding behind it that can support our health service and its staff and sustainably tackle the delayed cases that have built up over the last year. ""That recovery plan will include the development of a new medical school in north Wales so we can train the new professionals we need over the coming years; support for staff wellbeing and costed plans to train the 12,000 doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals we need to support NHS recovery."" The Welsh Conservatives said: ""These are alarming figures and highlight Labour's poor management of our public services over the past two decades. ""Labour have shown they have no plan to fix things and their poor record over the past 22 years has left Wales and the NHS in a perilous position. ""Welsh Conservatives will build a strong economy so we can invest in our NHS and tackle these problems with five new hospitals, 1,200 more doctors and 3,000 more nurses."" ""We need a comprehensive, detailed and long-term plan for cancer services,"" says charity boss Judi Rhys Judi Rhys, chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, said: ""Not once since the start of the pandemic has the number of people being sent for cancer tests matched the pre-pandemic levels. ""This has led to a missing community of 35,755 people, potentially with cancer, who have yet to engage with the health service. ""Tenovus Cancer Care estimates that even if the number of people being sent for scans was 10% higher in future, it would take more than two years to clear this backlog. ""We need a comprehensive, detailed and long-term plan for cancer services, and we urge residents to call on anyone seeking election next month to commit to one as a matter of urgency."" Richard Pugh, head of partnerships for Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, said he was ""concerned at the level of radiology workforce gaps in Wales, which is part of wider gaps across the Welsh cancer workforce that make tackling the cancer backlog caused by the pandemic even harder"". ""Macmillan's analysis of Welsh cancer waiting times shows there were around 1,550 fewer first treatments for cancer in the year since the start of the pandemic compared to the same period a year before. ""It is vital that the next Welsh government prioritises getting cancer services back on track to ensure that people with cancer get a timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance of survival. ""We need the next government to urgently invest in the NHS workforce and to create a long-term strategy for recovery and renewing cancer care so that Wales has the staff and resources to tackle this growing challenge."" The RCR's annual workforce survey highlights key concerns for Wales. It suggests the radiologist workforce is understaffed by 38% - the biggest shortfall in any UK nation. It means Wales lags significantly behind the EU average for the number of radiologists per patient - Wales has 7.8 radiologists per 100,000 people, the UK average is 8.6, the EU average is 12.8. On patient safety, the college said 60% of Wales' imaging directors said they did not have enough consultants to keep patients safe. Wales also has the worst interventional radiology (radiologists undertaking procedures) provision of any UK nation, with 60% of health boards unable to provide 24/7 rotas or transfer arrangements for patients needing interventional care. At the start of April, the RCR polled 1,089 consultants around the UK about their feelings on working in the NHS post-Covid. A total of 37 were from Wales and, of those: 40.5% felt demoralised 43% intended to cut their hours 11% say they planned on leaving the NHS in the next 12 months - that's three times the normal leaving rate, according to the college The RCR has previously warned of""real risk"" to the future of cancer servicesin Wales because of a significant shortage of specialists.

One Covid vaccine dose halves transmission - study,"A single dose of a coronavirus vaccine can reduce household transmission of the virus by up to half, a study shows. Those given a first dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines - and who became infected three weeks later - were between 38% and 49% less likely to pass the virus on than unvaccinated people, PHE found. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the study's results as ""terrific news"". He has urged ""everybody to get their vaccines as soon as they are eligible"". In the study, protection against Covid was seen from about 14 days after vaccination, with similar levels of protection regardless of age of cases or contacts, PHE said in a statement. It added that this protection was on top of the reduced risk of a vaccinated person developing symptomatic infection in the first place, which is around 60 to 65% - four weeks after one dose of either vaccine. When will I get the vaccine? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Covid vaccine offered to 42-year-olds in England Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""Vaccines are vital in helping us return to a normal way of life. Not only do vaccines reduce the severity of illness and prevent hundreds of deaths every day, we now see they also have an additional impact on reducing the chance of passing Covid-19 on to others."" But, while she said the findings were ""encouraging"", she said it was important people continue to act like they have the virus, ""practise good hand hygiene and follow social distancing guidance"". Households are high-risk settings for transmission, meaning the study provides early evidence on the impact of vaccines in preventing onward transmission, PHE said. Similar results could be expected in other settings with similar transmission risks, such as shared accommodation and prisons, it added. University of Warwick epidemiologist Mike Tildesley said the findings were significant but pressed people to continue to take up vaccination offers. ""We need to remember these vaccines are not 100% effective either at preventing severe symptoms or at allowing yourself to be infected but the evidence is suggesting they are providing at least some level of protection from passing the virus on if you do get infected,"" he told BBC's Breakfast. He said the study was extra evidence that as many people as possible needed to be vaccinated, even if they are not at risk of developing severe symptoms, in order to get much higher levels of protection across the population and reduce the number of people who get severely ill and die from the disease. This is the latest piece of evidence to indicate that vaccines are slowing the transmission of the virus as well as saving lives. Households are among the most likely places for infection to spread, so these set of results are particularly encouraging. Public Health England has said it would expect similar results in other high-risk settings, such as shared accommodation and prisons. All this bodes well for the continued easing of restrictions, especially as the vaccination campaign is making good progress into younger age groups - who are more likely to spread the virus. And it also gives further reassurance to those concerned about the fact that children will not be vaccinated - and so might bring infection into households. A cause for concern, though, is whether newer variants of the virus, which might be more resistant to vaccines, might cause a new surge in infections. But the expert opinion is that the current vaccines will provide a significant degree of protection, especially against severe illness. NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? The study, which has yet to be fully peer-reviewed, included more than 57,000 contacts from 24,000 households in which there was a lab-confirmed coronavirus case that had received a vaccination, compared with nearly one million contacts of unvaccinated cases. Contacts were defined as secondary cases of coronavirus if they tested positive two to 14 days after the initial household case. Most of the people in the study were under the age of 60. Previous PHE studies have shown that both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are highly effective in reducing Covid-19 infections among older people, with 10,400 deaths prevented in over-60s by the end of March. PHE is also undertaking separate studies on the effect of vaccination on transmission in the wider population. Who can get an NHS Covid jab this autumn? How many people have had boosters so far?

European Parliament backs Brexit trade dealEuro MPs back the EU-UK trade deal by 660 votes to 5 despite rows over fishing and Northern Ireland.EuropeComments,"EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen oversees trade relations with the UK The European Parliament has ratified the post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal - a key move to ensure that tariff- and quota-free trade continues. The Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) has been operating provisionally since January. MEPs voted in favour by 660 votes to 5, while 32 abstained. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, said the vote ""brings certainty and allows us to focus on the future"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of a ""final step in a long journey"". The trade deal provided ""stability to our new relationship with the EU as vital trading partners, close allies and sovereign equals"", he said. The result, announced on Wednesday after a vote late on Tuesday, was also welcomed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Allow Twitter content?

The parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt described the deal as ""a failure for both sides, but better than nothing"". Lord Frost's opposite number in the Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, was also less than flattering. ""This is a divorce. It is a warning, Brexit. It's a failure of the European Union and we have to learn lessons from it,"" he told MEPs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit tensions remain, including a French threat of ""reprisals"" against the UK over new fishing restrictions. Northern Ireland trade is also a thorny issue. Under a separate protocol, Northern Ireland remains de facto part of the EU's single market, so goods arriving there from Britain have to undergo EU checks. Since Brexit there has been some disruption to that trade. The TCA covers EU-UK trade in goods, but not services. The UK economy is dominated by services - sectors such as banking, insurance, advertising and legal advice. What are the key points of the Brexit deal? 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal The TCA has still resulted in more paperwork, extra costs and less trade between the two sides, since the UK left the EU. A European Parliament resolution,externaldescribed the UK's exit from the EU as ""a historic mistake"". Among the areas not covered by the deal are foreign policy, financial services and student exchanges. Before the MEPs' debate started on Tuesday, French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune accused the UK of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with ""reprisals"" in financial services. ""The United Kingdom is expecting quite a few authorisations from us for financial services. We won't give any for as long as we don't have guarantees on fishing and other issues,"" he said on French news channel BFMTV. French fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Meanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish. Scottish firms account for most of that business, and some now face collapse. EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister The UK made fishing rights a key issue in the negotiations, with control over access to its waters seen as a sign of British sovereignty. Praising the TCAwhen it was agreed in December, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said""we have taken back control of our laws and our destiny"". He described it as ""a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends"". 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump In Tuesday's debate, German MEP David McAllister said Brexit ""will always be a lose-lose situation"", but he backed the TCA. It is a 1,400-page deal which was not clinched until 24 December. The Brexit negotiations began in 2017 and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Common rules remained during the UK's transition period until January 2021. After nearly four years of difficult negotiations on the UK exit from the EU and the post-Brexit relationship, it's hardly surprising that a few bruises are showing. The TCA certainly hasn't solved everything. There are still big questions to resolve on issues like financial services, for example. Monitoring and implementing what has been agreed, in a complex network of committees, will also be a constant feature of the new relationship. But it will take some time before the long-term effect on trade becomes clear. Trade volumes fell sharply in January before rebounding in February. But theUK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex,externalsays UK exports to the EU were still down by 17.2% in February compared to an average of February 2018 to 2020. A significant part is down to Brexit, although Covid is also a factor. The most prominent post-Brexit issue so far this year, though, isn't part of the TCA itself.  Northern Ireland's trading relationship with the rest of the UK, and with the EU, won't change as a result of this agreement being ratified. Both sides say they are working hard to find practical solutions in Northern Ireland, but some checks on trade between NI and Britain will remain in place. This video can not be played Is the point-scoring coming to an end - or have we only seen the first half of this grudge match? The European Commission has launched legal action, accusing the UK of breaching the agreement on Northern Ireland trade and breaking international law - charges Downing Street denies. Brexit also means: Blanket free movement of citizens between the UK and EU no longer applies. Business travellers do not need a visa for short trips, but artists and performers are not covered - so, for example, British rock bands face bureaucracy for gigs in the EU The rights of the roughly one million UK citizens living in the EU, and of EU citizens in the UK, are protected under the TCA. But the UK citizens face varying deadlines for obtaining residence rights; for the three million EU citizens in the UK the deadline for applications is 30 June Government subsidies are now under intense scrutiny on both sides, as the EU insists on a ""level playing field"" in trade. Courts will have to decide in cases where subsidies are allegedly unfair. UK financial services, not covered by the TCA, face new EU bureaucracy - so many City banks have beefed up their EU-based operations. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Euro MPs' vote bolsters EU-UK Brexit trade deal EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister UK exports to European Union drop 40% in January 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas, says No.10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

"Shortage of radiologists adds to NHS pressuresIt could make it ""extremely difficult"" to cut waiting lists built up over the pandemic, experts say.Wales","Wales has 38% fewer consultants than needed to keep up with demand, according to The Royal College of Radiologists A ""shocking shortage"" in imaging doctors could risk patient safety and make it ""extremely difficult"" to cut waiting lists built up during the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have warned. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) said Wales had the UK's worst shortage with 38% fewer consultants than needed to keep up with demand. Charities called the figures alarming. Parties fighting to lead the next Welsh government in May's election said they would recruit more staff to the NHS. Radiologists are doctors who specialise in interpreting X-rays, scans and other types of medical images which are vital in detecting and diagnosing injury and disease including cancer. Thelatest figures,externalshow more than 500,000 people were on waiting lists in Wales in February and 20,548 patients had to wait more than eight weeks for a scan following a consultant or GP referral - 33 times higher than at the same time last year. The RCR estimates the Welsh NHS needs to recruit 97 more radiologists to meet growing demand - yet its research suggests there was no increase in the number of consultants here during 2019-20. The situation could be made worse, it warned, with its survey suggesting 11% of radiologists in Wales planning on leaving the NHS next year, with 43% of those staying intending to reduce their hours. A significant proportion of the radiologist workforce, the RCR said, feel ""demoralised"". Senior doctors said they were worried there were not enough consultants to keep patients safe, and the shortage would make it very difficult to deal with the significant backlog of tests and treatments that built up during the pandemic. Swansea consultant radiologist Dr Toby Wells, who represents the RCR in Wales, said the pandemic had piled on the pressure but there had been a ""crisis"" in recruitment for years, leading to a ""shocking shortage"". ""We're trying to catch up that backlog but it's on a background of a shortage of radiologists, a shortage of scanners, a shortage of radiographers,"" he said. Half a million on record Welsh NHS waiting lists There have also been changes in working practices, with radiologists scanning fewer people in a day due to social distancing measures. ""Trying to accommodate that and make any progress, and catching up, is difficult,"" he said. Although the number of patients awaiting scans has reduced since February, he said there was a ""huge backlog of patients waiting to see surgeons"" which would lead to an increase in workload. ""We're trying to catch up,"" says Dr Toby Wells who represents the RCR in Wales Plaid Cymru said: ""Over the past year we have witnessed the frailties and unsustainability of healthcare services and the lack of investment that led to an overdependence on the goodwill and sheer dedication of the health and care workforce. ""A Plaid Cymru government has a five-year plan to recruit and train an additional 1,000 doctors, 4,000 nurses, and 1,000 allied healthcare professionals, including radiologists. ""We will also prioritise the continued roll out of multi disciplinary cancer diagnostic centres across Wales, making access to diagnostic tests easier for patients and GPs."" The Welsh Liberal Democrats said: ""This isn't something which will be solved overnight. ""Training medical staff takes times and that is why our manifesto for next week's election has commitments to boost medical recruitment as well as to improve levels of staff retention. ""We know that many staff leave the NHS due to burnout and stress and that many don't feel they have the mental health support they need to continue."" Welsh Labour said: ""Our Â£3.4m support last term helped open the new state of the artNational Imaging Academy Walesin August 2018 that is training the next generation of radiologists and imaging professionals. ""The National Health Service is our top priority and we've pledged an NHS recovery plan on day one with more than Â£1bn of funding behind it that can support our health service and its staff and sustainably tackle the delayed cases that have built up over the last year. ""That recovery plan will include the development of a new medical school in north Wales so we can train the new professionals we need over the coming years; support for staff wellbeing and costed plans to train the 12,000 doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals we need to support NHS recovery."" The Welsh Conservatives said: ""These are alarming figures and highlight Labour's poor management of our public services over the past two decades. ""Labour have shown they have no plan to fix things and their poor record over the past 22 years has left Wales and the NHS in a perilous position. ""Welsh Conservatives will build a strong economy so we can invest in our NHS and tackle these problems with five new hospitals, 1,200 more doctors and 3,000 more nurses."" ""We need a comprehensive, detailed and long-term plan for cancer services,"" says charity boss Judi Rhys Judi Rhys, chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, said: ""Not once since the start of the pandemic has the number of people being sent for cancer tests matched the pre-pandemic levels. ""This has led to a missing community of 35,755 people, potentially with cancer, who have yet to engage with the health service. ""Tenovus Cancer Care estimates that even if the number of people being sent for scans was 10% higher in future, it would take more than two years to clear this backlog. ""We need a comprehensive, detailed and long-term plan for cancer services, and we urge residents to call on anyone seeking election next month to commit to one as a matter of urgency."" Richard Pugh, head of partnerships for Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, said he was ""concerned at the level of radiology workforce gaps in Wales, which is part of wider gaps across the Welsh cancer workforce that make tackling the cancer backlog caused by the pandemic even harder"". ""Macmillan's analysis of Welsh cancer waiting times shows there were around 1,550 fewer first treatments for cancer in the year since the start of the pandemic compared to the same period a year before. ""It is vital that the next Welsh government prioritises getting cancer services back on track to ensure that people with cancer get a timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance of survival. ""We need the next government to urgently invest in the NHS workforce and to create a long-term strategy for recovery and renewing cancer care so that Wales has the staff and resources to tackle this growing challenge."" The RCR's annual workforce survey highlights key concerns for Wales. It suggests the radiologist workforce is understaffed by 38% - the biggest shortfall in any UK nation. It means Wales lags significantly behind the EU average for the number of radiologists per patient - Wales has 7.8 radiologists per 100,000 people, the UK average is 8.6, the EU average is 12.8. On patient safety, the college said 60% of Wales' imaging directors said they did not have enough consultants to keep patients safe. Wales also has the worst interventional radiology (radiologists undertaking procedures) provision of any UK nation, with 60% of health boards unable to provide 24/7 rotas or transfer arrangements for patients needing interventional care. At the start of April, the RCR polled 1,089 consultants around the UK about their feelings on working in the NHS post-Covid. A total of 37 were from Wales and, of those: 40.5% felt demoralised 43% intended to cut their hours 11% say they planned on leaving the NHS in the next 12 months - that's three times the normal leaving rate, according to the college The RCR has previously warned of""real risk"" to the future of cancer servicesin Wales because of a significant shortage of specialists.

'A horror story on repeat': India's Covid crisis,"India has seen more Covid cases in the last seven days than any other country A ferocious second wave has seen the official death toll surpass 200,000 - experts believe the actual number may be higher People have died waiting for beds, as oxygen supplies run low and hospitals crumble under the strain Indians are struggling to register online for a mass vaccination programme due to start next month US President Joe Biden says he intends to send vaccines to India The BBC is bringing you a special day of coverage across TV, radio and digital on India's crisis Weâre following families as they search for oxygen for loved ones, and getting updates from areas likely to be hit hardest next Edited by Rebecca Seales and Martha Buckley We're winding up our live coverage of Covid in India, which formed part of a special BBC day of focus on the country's devastating pandemic. Here is a round-up of today's main developments:  The live page was brought to you by: Soutik Biswas, Vikas Pandey, Geeta Pandey, Ayeshea Perera, Rebecca Seales, Martha Buckley, Aparna Alluri, Suranjana Tewari, George Wright, Ashitha Nagesh, Georgina Rannard, Lauren Turner, Hamish Mackay, Mary O'Connor, Tessa Wong, Frances Mao, Andreas Ilmer, Yvette Tan, Callum Matthews, Ritu Prasad, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Emily Wolstencroft. We are grateful to our team of BBC languages reporters in India, Asia-based correspondents, visual journalism team, BBC Reality Check, and contributors in the US and UK. The city of Mumbai - which sits in the state of Maharashtra, India's biggest hotspot - has been in complete lockdown for two weeks. There's a sense of deja vu -  the pictures are eerily reminiscent of a period of time last year when large parts of the entire world went into a state of lockdown. But the pictures are a reminder that for millions in India - this is still their reality. The western state of Maharashtra, which has been India's Covid ground zero from the start of the pandemic, is back at the top after briefly reporting a drop in cases. The state, among Indiaâs richest and home to its financial hub, Mumbai, confirmed more than 66,000 cases  last night. Thatâs more than any other state, adding to an active caseload that is already the highest in India. Maharashtra accounts for more than a quarter of Indiaâs 17.9 million cases and nearly a third of India's 201,000 deaths so far. Mayank Bhagwat of BBC Marathi explains more. This video can not be played Western Maharashtra is India's worst-affected region Ashitha NageshBBC News, London It's widely agreed among experts that both cases and deaths are being under-reported in India right now - and one expert tells me that she thinks the real figures could be as high as 10 times the official numbers in some areas. Dr Amita Gupta is a professor of medicine in international health at the US-based Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and she facilitates the university's partnerships with clinics and labs across India. ""We were estimating that the problem is 10 times worse in places like Maharashtra than the official numbers, based on what we're hearing,"" she says. One of the main problems is that only people with symptoms are being tested, and even then testing labs are already at capacity. ""We've heard from many of the big lab chains around India... they're running 24/7 and are essentially overrun with tests. There's only so many they can test."" Queues of patients and their families have been forming outside hospitals as people get increasingly desperate to access treatment. But Dr Jayesh Lele told BBC World TV that this was causing patients to get sicker and leaving medical staff scared. This video can not be played India Covid: Queues outside hospitals causing anger and harassment, says doctor The surge in cases has meant delays in people getting admitted to hospital. As these pictures from today show, patients have been left waiting in cars or rickshaws in the western city of Ahmedabad.

Neha says she often wonders what would have happened if she had contracted Covid now instead, because there ""just isn't the infrastructure"" to keep people well. Indiaâs hospitals are using 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen a day - equating to 90% of the oxygen supply, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. Thatâs a massive leap, not just from pre-Covid times, when healthcare facilities used just 15% of Indiaâs oxygen supply, but also three times more than was used in the peak of the first wave last September. You can read more about Indiaâs oxygen struggles here. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London Right now Soma is working on getting medical supplies and treatments to people living on the streets of Kolkata. She's just finished an ambulance round with the Hope foundation, and is heading back into the hospital when I speak to her. I ask how her day has been so far, and she replies with one word: ""Hectic."" Her hospital has 45 beds and 40 of them are currently occupied by confirmed Covid patients. The remaining five are suspected to have the virus. On top of that, they're facing the same dire shortages of equipment and oxygen that are hitting medical centres across the country. Vulnerable people, she says, ""are coming here from across West Bengal,"" after failing to get admitted to government hospitals. ""This is because there is no proper treatment for these people from our government."" BBC Radio's Asian Network As part of our special day of India coverage, BBC Asian Network has a  programme on BBC
Sounds asking: Has India been let down by Narendra Modiâs government? You can listen here. We have spoken to the ruling BJP party and campaigners in India, as well as the Asian Network audience. We also hear from our reporters in London, Leicester and Bolton, to find
out how Indian communities there have been affected. A day after the Board of Control for Cricket in India urged players to play on for ""humanity"" we also ask whether the IPL should be
suspended. And Haroon
Rashid looks at how Bollywood is responding to the unfolding tragedy. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London In the vast, 1,100 sq km Chilika Lagoon in Odisha lies a group of island villages - cut off from the mainland, and accessible only by boat. Dr Manoranjan Mishra, head of an organisation called Jeevan Rekha Parishad (JRP), says access to food and education there has been limited over the past year because of lockdowns. JRP organises food deliveries to the islands via local volunteers, to avoid people from the mainland travelling over. The impact has been particularly hard on the Dalit community, formerly known as ""untouchables"". ""They have no income, no connectivity, no electricity... because they're completely excluded from the mainstream of society,"" Dr Mishra tells me. But has the virus itself reached the islands? ""Fortunately, you'll not believe, the island people are completely safe,"" Dr Mishra tells me. ""Not a single positive case has been found so far. Nobody is going there, and they're not going out - so they're completely safe."" This video can not be played Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come in for criticism over his handling of the crisis. He is currently working relentlessly with the health ministry and other countries to tackle oxygen shortages, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national spokesperson Shaina Nana Chudasama has said. âIt is most unfortunate that we have lost lives and nobody expected this double mutant to shape up in this particular way,â she told BBC World TV earlier. Harrowing scenes are emerging from India by the hour - some of which we've pictured and reported on in this live page today. The official death toll has exceeded 200,000 - though experts believe the actual total is higher - and people are dying while waiting for hospital beds as oxygen supplies run low and hospitals collapse under the strain. The crisis has also affected those reporting on it every day. Two of the BBC's Delhi-based reporters - Soutik Biswas and Vikas Pandey - have been sharing their experiences of striving to help
family and friends, while also working overtime to report the nightmare
unfolding around them. In the last two weeks, 45 journalists in India have died with Covid-19. Overall, more than 100 have died with the virus, according to Press Emblem Campaign, a Switzerland-based media group. However a group of mental health professionals have raised questions about how some sections of the media have been reporting on the crisis - and the impact on those reading or watching. Experts including Dr BN Gangadhar of New Delhi's National Medical Commission,external, have signed an open letter urging journalists to show ""restraint in their coverage, without compromising upon facts or public interest"". They write that reporting images of ""bodies burning in cremation grounds [and] relatives of the deceased wailing inconsolably"" might ""help garner eyeballs"" but there was a ""steep price to be paid for such coverage"". They warn a ""hidden mental health epidemic"" is already emerging from the Covid-related restrictions on peoples' lives, and that seeing such ""disturbing and depressing visuals"" while stuck at home could push people ""much deeper into the abyss"".

Reporting on shortages of certain supplies is the ""right thing to do so that action can be taken"" but it must include specifics such as exactly where the shortage is. ""Specific information empowers people and prepares them to face any challenge. But panic weakens them,"" the experts say. They stress they are not saying that facts should not be reported but instead that ""hysteria and panic-inducing coverage"" should be avoided. ""In such times the media has great power to inform, educate, and most importantly infuse hope in the people. This includes the sharing of authentic information and allaying of fears. ""These are extremely important weapons in the fight against the pandemic."" Rajini VaidyanathanBBC South Asia Correspondent Patients being treated at a New Delhi hospital Back in January, it was the beginning of Indiaâs vaccination drive. In Delhi, brightly coloured balloons hung over an archway to the hospital entrance. On that day, there was a mood of celebration. The hospitalâs medical director, Suresh Kumar, smiled from under his mask. It was a smile of relief - as he told me how wards which had been dedicated to coronavirus cases were now able to treat other, routine conditions. Covid-19 cases were low, and many thought India was past the worst. Months later, and that couldnât be further from the distressing reality. Gone are the balloons and buoyancy - replaced instead by a sense of desperation. Back then there were around 10,000-15,000 cases reported a day - with under  100 deaths. Now there are more than 300,000 daily cases, and more than 2,000 daily deaths. Scrolling through my social media feeds I see message after message, written by families struggling to find beds for friends and relatives. Indian health experts Iâve talked to believe the numbers dying with, or because of, Covid are far higher than the official statistics.The pyres that burn through the night at some of the crematoriums are visual testament to this. How did India get here? Many say it was a sense of complacency. Mass gatherings had taken place, with no social distancing and few people wearing masks. In my circle of friends in Delhi, almost everyone now knows someone whoâs lost a loved one to Covid-19. A friendâs three-year old son has the virus â doctors say theyâre seeing more younger patients this time round. The joy of that January morning has now turned into sheer horror, which is unfolding across the country. Listen to more from Rajini onBBC Sounds here. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London Shishir Joshi is from Project Mumbai, a non-profit working on Covid relief for people living in the city's slum areas. He tells me that last year they mostly focused on getting food and funds to people below the poverty line who weren't able to work in lockdown - but now, the priority is healthcare. ""We are also now providing what we call oxygen concentrators,"" he says. An oxygen concentrator is a machine that allows someone to have oxygen treatment administered at home - and with hospitals in the city packed to capacity, it is becoming a vital piece of equipment. ""We started a project to provide these machines to people below the poverty line in Mumbai - for free of course.... In the absence of hospital beds, people need oxygen concentrators."" Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi With Covid has also come the ""shadow pandemic"" - a term the UN has used to describe the steep rise in cases of domestic violence. The countryâs National Commission for Women says it received 23,722 complaints of crimes against women in 2020 - the highest in the past six years. Of those, almost a quarter were complaints of domestic violence. The trend has continued into 2021 - with 1,463 complaints of domestic violence reported between 1 January and 25 March. In rural India, many men who returned home from the cities after losing their jobs brought along financial stress and fears of sickness. Some took out their frustrations on their wives and children. The frequency and the brutality of assaults are said to have gone up, says Urvashi Gandhi of charity Breakthrough, with its partner NGOs ""receiving frantic calls to rescue women trapped in unsafe homes"". People in Mumbai waiting to receive a vaccine Dr Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics, has been telling theBBC's Newscast podcastwhat the world needs to do to stop more countries suffering like India. She said: ""Rather than sending donations, we need to stop them getting like that, massively ramping up global distribution and global production of vaccines."" Which country could be next? ""I think Peru is one to look at, the numbers there are getting really scary"", said Dr  Wenham. ""What the last 14 months has taught us, is that if you take your eye off the ball for a second and get complacent, it can happen anywhere.""

Amitabha BhattasaliBBC News, West Bengal This video can not be played Large election rallies worsen West Bengal crisis It was only a couple of weeks ago when the mood in West Bengal state was ""There is no more coronavirus, why use a mask?"" That has now changed. Cases in the state are surging in the wake of huge election rallies - and it's likely to be the next big hotspot. The eastern state in is the middle of a heated election and rallies are continuing. Some of the biggest ones, including those attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have seen throngs of people not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. Although Modi has since cancelled his rallies, amid mounting criticism, local politicians are yet to do so The election commission has now limited them to a maximum of 500 people. There is also no lockdown or curfew in the state - despite a new high of 16,403 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. South Africa's Faf du Plessis takes a catch for Chennai Super Kings against Sunrisers Hyderabad Despite the continued rise in cases and deaths across India, the Indian Premier League - the world's top Twenty20 competition, compromising  the world's best players - is continuing. The tournament has moved to Delhi - where a match is taking place right now - and Ahmedabad, after starting in Mumbai and Chennai. There have been no cases within the tournament, which is taking place in a bubble, but some overseas players have started to leave the tournament because of travel restrictions that their home countries are putting into place. England's Liam Livingstone left Rajasthan Royals, while Australia'sAndrew Tye, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardsonhave all departed. India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has also decided to take a break to ""support his family"". Despite that, the tournament is expected to continue, with a senior IPL official arguing it keeps people's spirits up. ""We should not underestimate the power of sport to spread positivity. It's probably more important now to hold the IPL, when there is so much negativity around,"" the official told Reuters. ""At least fans are absorbed in it at home. Otherwise many of them will step out without masks. ""The league generates considerable money for the economy. It has to be seen from that context too. How does stopping IPL help?"" BBC Radio 5 Live Radhika Howarth lives in London but is currently stuck in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh state, where she has been caring for her 84-year-old mother. Radhika arrived in India on 30 March and was allowed to enter Gwalior after spending a week in quarantine in Delhi. Before that, she had not seen her mother, Shamoli, for 18 months because of the pandemic. Shamoli was in need of support after she recently had a fall and her carer had to stop visiting because of the surge in Covid-19 cases. Radhika told BBC Radio 5 Live in the UK that she did not even want to step out of her front door, for fear of herself or her mother catching coronavirus. ""What I am hearing is very grim, all we can hear outside are the sirens of ambulances up and downâ¦ it just makes your heart sink,"" she said. ""I feel guilty even asking for a test [PCR Covid-19 test] to be able to fly back because I know people are desperate to get the test and get the treatment."" Radhika said hospitals had put out signs saying âNo beds available.â She and her mother have essential supplies but they are currently sticking to one meal a day to try to manage. âI want to come back, but I donât want to come back, because how will people like my mother cope?"" she said. ""In a situation like this you are so disempowered, you have no rights, and thereâs no one around to turn to.

Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock led a Downing Street press conference alongside England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and Dr Nikki Kanani of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a round-up of what we learned this afternoon: Hamilton - the popular musical about America's founding fathers - is set to return to London's West End this summer, more than a year after it closed due to the pandemic. Its producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the award-winning show would resume at the Victoria Palace Theatre from 19 August. Many shows are making plans to reopen from 17 May with social distancing, and from 21 June with no restrictions. These dates depend on the third and fourth steps on the government's reopening roadmap remaining on track. On Wednesday, Mary Poppins announced it would return on 7 August at London's Prince Edward Theatre. Some West End musicals are planning to open next month with social distancing, including Everybody Loves Jamie, Les Miserables - The Staged Concert, The Mousetrap and Amelie the Musical.

If you get a chance to pick where you sit then choose wisely, say researchers who have been studying the science behind desk location and productivity. The University College London team visited the HQ of a large global tech company in the city to quiz 172 employees about their experiences of open-plan working. Window desks and more intimate, grouped desk layouts got a big thumbs-up. But sitting in a row with your back to lots of people was most unsettling. The research, in the journalPLoS One,,externalsays businesses should keep this in mind as Covid restrictions ease and more people transition from home to office-based working. Read more.  Louise CullenBBC News NI Covid testing for people in the workplace in Northern Ireland is to be expanded in what Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann describes as a ""significant move"". The workforce asymptomatic testing programme is now open to all organisations with 10 or more employees or volunteers, who cannot work from home. Previously this was open to organisations with more than 50 employees. Eligible organisations will be able to access collection points and a home delivery service to get rapid lateral flow tests. Read the full storyhere. The government says the UK has secured access to 517
million doses of eight of ""the most promising"" Covid-19 vaccines. These are:  Only the first three have so far been approved for use by the medicines regulator in the UK. Rolling reviews are under way by
the regulator to assess the Janssen and Novavax vaccines, the government says, and clinical trials are
ongoing for the Valneva, GSK-Sanofi and CureVac jabs. We just heard from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who announced the UK has ordered 60 million extra doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for its autumn booster programme. Pfizer says it's ""delighted"" to be providing the UK government with the extra doses. Ben Osborn, country manager at Pfizer
UK, says the company is ""more than doubling our supply commitment to the UK"". He adds that, alongside its partner BioNTech, Pfizer believes it can deliver more than 2.5 billion doses of their vaccine globally by the end of 2021. InEngland, people aged 42 and over are being invited to come forward for their vaccine and can book online. Text messages have been sent out with a link to the national booking service, which can also be called on 119.  People aged 45 and over inScotlandare now being invited to get their vaccine. Unpaid carers in Scotland aged 16-64 can also register online to get the vaccine. TheWelshgovernment says vaccines are now being offered to people aged 40 and over, and some health boards have started inviting the 30-39 age group. InNorthern Ireland, people aged 35 and over are now eligible. Find more detailshere. In the last question, David Hughes from the Press Association says the US health regulator has said those who have had two doses of the vaccine can meet up freely. He asks, if the government is guided by the science, why can't that happen here? Matt Hancock says: ""The decision we've taken is to move together."" He says when England moved in different stages in the autumn - under the tier system - cases popped up in areas with fewer restrictions. ""So we took the decision when we wrote the roadmap that we'll move as one,"" he says. Prof Van-Tam says where two people have had both doses of a reputable vaccine, and 14 days have passed since their second dose, he would be ""highly confident scientifically"" that it would be ""incredibly safe"" for those two people to meet. ""The answer to your question though is soon [things will change]... but not quite now,"" he says, reiterating that most people under 42 haven't had the vaccine. ""I know this feels tantalisingly, extremely close... but we just need to make sure we don't have to go backwards again on any of this."" ""Just hold the line for a teeny bit longer."" David Hughes from the Press Association asks whether the health secretary ever heard the prime minister say he would be prepared to let coronavirus ""rip"" or see ""bodies pile high"" rather than impose another lockdown. (If you need a reminder, his question is in reference tothis story- and the prime minister has strongly denied making the comments.) In response, Matt Hancock says: ""No, I didn't."" The Mirror's Ben Glaze asks when the government will set out a timetable for an inquiry into the government's handling of the Covid pandemic. He also asks what sort of issues this inquiry should examine. Hancock says it is ""important"" that an inquiry is held and that ""there will be time"" for one, but adds the ""most important thing"" for decision-makers is that they're ""constantly learning"". On what the inquiry should cover, he adds that it should ""cover everything"". Prof Van-Tam adds that the inquiry is very important but pleads for it not to happen now, as the UK is currently still working hard to cement the gains it has made against the virus. He adds that he hopes the inquiry ""properly explores"" the role of the ""unsung heroes"" in the pandemic, including people who've worked tirelessly at vaccination centres. Chris Smyth from the Times asks what measures may be needed beyondthe current ""roadmap""unveiled by the prime minister. Van-Tam says ""the modelling consensus is clear"", pointing to the UK having a third wave. ""I am personally hopeful that if the vaccine programme continues at pace... the third wave might just be a third upsurge and much less significant,"" he says. He says this should be because of the ""de-linking"" between cases and deaths - given the successful vaccines. But he says it's inconceivable that there will be ""no further bumps in the road"", and they'll probably come in autumn and winter. Matt Hancock adds ""we're going to have to live with coronavirus much like we do with flu"" through infection prevention control and vaccinations. But, like flu, the goal is that Covid won't dominate our lives like it does today, he says. Smyth also asks about the investigation into funding of works on Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat, but Hancock says he'll give that question ""a miss"". The next question comes from LBC's Ben Kentish, who asks that given the positive data shown today - including the news that over 70% of adults in England now have antibodies - he asks whether restrictions on areas such as funerals could be relaxed earlier. He also asks about data on how well current vaccines are working against current variants of the virus; and also how close we might be to herd immunity, given the antibody data we've seen so far. On funerals, Hancock says the data shows that the UK's unlocking roadmap is on track. He adds the dates set out on the roadmap are ""not-before dates"" so the government can see the impact of each step of unlocking before progressing to the next step. Answering the other two questions, Van-Tam says there are some ""twists and turns"" still to come, but we are ""moving at pace"". He adds he doesn't want the nation to run into ""any wet patches"" in the future, adding there will be ""good"" and ""bad"" pressures on the R - or reproduction rate - of the virus in the next few weeks as the UK unlocks restrictions. Channel 4's Krishnan Guru-Murthy asks if the government is reconsidering the ""Britain-first approach"" to vaccines, given the situation in India, or whether the government can release any doses to support the country. Matt Hancock says: ""We are supporting India with what we can. We don't have any excess doses of vaccine in the UK at the moment."" He reiterates that they are sending ventilators ""that we thankfully don't need here anymore"" as well as oxygen production machines being sent from Northern Ireland. First up from the media is BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, whose question is aboutthe funding of works on Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat. She asks: ""If a serving government minister is found to have broken the rules on party funding, or even law, should they resign?"" Matt Hancock doesn't answer the question directly, saying the prime minister has already answered ""lots of questions"" about the matter in the House of Commons earlier. ""Given that this is a coronavirus press conference, you won't be surprised that I'm not going to add to the answers the prime minister has already given very extensive questioning,"" he says before moving on. Another question from the public now, and Melonie from Derbyshire asks how the UK will stay a global leader in biomedical innovation and research. Matt Hancock says the government plans to attract on-shore manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. ""We want to make it an impossible choice for a pharmaceutical company not to invest in the UK,"" he says. ""We will not ever block exports to anywhere around the world of a product made for a market around the world,"" he adds, saying: ""Probably our greatest contribution to saving lives and tackling this pandemic around the world is the Oxford-AztraZeneca vaccine."" Rachel from Derby is the first member of the public to ask a question. She wants to know when people will be able to take their care home relatives out for a walk in the fresh air without them having to isolate on their return. The health secretary says his department is ""working on it right now"" to ensure officials can get the rules right on this. He says he hopes to have some ""good news"" on this soon. Van-Tam says it is very important for people's mental health to get this right, but also important to do it carefully. Nearly three-quarters of a million people booked their vaccine appointments since Monday, Kanani says, as the vaccination programme was rolled out to 42-year-olds this week. That's nearly 250 appointments being booked every
minute, or around 15,000 an hour. ""We'll continue to maintain that as far as supplies allow,"" she says. Nearly two-thirds of the adult population in England have been given a first dose of the vaccine, NHS England's Dr Nikki Kanani says. And more than a quarter of people have been fully vaccinated. Kanani stresses the second dose of the vaccine is ""crucial"" and people still have to follow social distancing. Â© 2025 BBC.

Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock led a Downing Street press conference alongside England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, and Dr Nikki Kanani of NHS England. In case you missed it, here's a round-up of what we learned this afternoon: Hamilton - the popular musical about America's founding fathers - is set to return to London's West End this summer, more than a year after it closed due to the pandemic. Its producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the award-winning show would resume at the Victoria Palace Theatre from 19 August. Many shows are making plans to reopen from 17 May with social distancing, and from 21 June with no restrictions. These dates depend on the third and fourth steps on the government's reopening roadmap remaining on track. On Wednesday, Mary Poppins announced it would return on 7 August at London's Prince Edward Theatre. Some West End musicals are planning to open next month with social distancing, including Everybody Loves Jamie, Les Miserables - The Staged Concert, The Mousetrap and Amelie the Musical.

If you get a chance to pick where you sit then choose wisely, say researchers who have been studying the science behind desk location and productivity. The University College London team visited the HQ of a large global tech company in the city to quiz 172 employees about their experiences of open-plan working. Window desks and more intimate, grouped desk layouts got a big thumbs-up. But sitting in a row with your back to lots of people was most unsettling.

Louise CullenBBC News NI Covid testing for people in the workplace in Northern Ireland is to be expanded in what Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann describes as a ""significant move"". The workforce asymptomatic testing programme is now open to all organisations with 10 or more employees or volunteers, who cannot work from home. Previously this was open to organisations with more than 50 employees. Eligible organisations will be able to access collection points and a home delivery service to get rapid lateral flow tests. Read the full storyhere. The government says the UK has secured access to 517
million doses of eight of ""the most promising"" Covid-19 vaccines. These are:  Only the first three have so far been approved for use by the medicines regulator in the UK. Rolling reviews are under way by
the regulator to assess the Janssen and Novavax vaccines, the government says, and clinical trials are
ongoing for the Valneva, GSK-Sanofi and CureVac jabs. We just heard from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who announced the UK has ordered 60 million extra doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for its autumn booster programme. Pfizer says it's ""delighted"" to be providing the UK government with the extra doses. Ben Osborn, country manager at Pfizer
UK, says the company is ""more than doubling our supply commitment to the UK"". He adds that, alongside its partner BioNTech, Pfizer believes it can deliver more than 2.5 billion doses of their vaccine globally by the end of 2021. InEngland, people aged 42 and over are being invited to come forward for their vaccine and can book online. Text messages have been sent out with a link to the national booking service, which can also be called on 119.  People aged 45 and over inScotlandare now being invited to get their vaccine. Unpaid carers in Scotland aged 16-64 can also register online to get the vaccine. TheWelshgovernment says vaccines are now being offered to people aged 40 and over, and some health boards have started inviting the 30-39 age group. InNorthern Ireland, people aged 35 and over are now eligible. Find more detailshere. In the last question, David Hughes from the Press Association says the US health regulator has said those who have had two doses of the vaccine can meet up freely. He asks, if the government is guided by the science, why can't that happen here? Matt Hancock says: ""The decision we've taken is to move together."" He says when England moved in different stages in the autumn - under the tier system - cases popped up in areas with fewer restrictions. ""So we took the decision when we wrote the roadmap that we'll move as one,"" he says. Prof Van-Tam says where two people have had both doses of a reputable vaccine, and 14 days have passed since their second dose, he would be ""highly confident scientifically"" that it would be ""incredibly safe"" for those two people to meet. ""The answer to your question though is soon [things will change]... but not quite now,"" he says, reiterating that most people under 42 haven't had the vaccine.

What is the flat row about?,"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds moved into No 11 Downing Street in July 2019 Further questions have been asked about the funding of home improvements at the prime minister's Downing Street flat, following the release of an exchange of letters with his standards adviser. Lord Geidt complained about not having been shown WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and Tory donor Lord Brownlow, which talked about the refurbishment. Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds had work carried out on their private residence, the flat above 11 Downing Street. The prime minister receives an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on his living quarters. But the work cost considerably more than that - at least Â£112,000 based on the amount we know Lord Brownlow contributed. The work was initially paid for by the Cabinet Office, but Â£52,000 was given to the Conservative Party by Lord Brownlow to cover the bills. Mr Johnson says he has now covered all the costs out of his own pocket. The Conservative Partywas fined Â£17,800after the Electoral Commission found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation. Lord Brownlow was asked in May 2020 to set up a Downing Street trust that would fund renovations to the flat above 11 Downing Street, but that trust was never established. In November 2020, the prime minister approached Lord Brownlow by WhatsApp message to approve payments to the interior designer carrying out the work. The Electoral Commission found in December 2021 that the subsequent Â£52,000 payment from Huntswood Associates Ltd, whose director is Lord Brownlow, had not been properly recorded and that it should not have been described as a loan or as part of a trust. But it said that separate payments of almost Â£60,000 for the refurbishments made by Lord Brownlow directly to suppliers, did not need to be declared. TheElectoral Commission report,externalled to further controversy because it referred to an exchange of WhatsApp messages between the prime minister and Lord Brownlow, which had not been seen by the adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, when he had reported on the case earlier in the year. The prime minister lives in a flat above 11 Downing Street Lord Geidt's report in May hadconcluded,externalthat Mr Johnson did not break the ministerial code over the funding of the renovations. But he said: ""The prime minister - unwisely, in my view - allowed the refurbishment of the apartment at No 11 Downing Street to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded."" Lord Geidt added: ""The record shows no evidence that the prime minister had been informed"" about the payments. His report says that when he found out in February 2021, Mr Johnson ""settled the full amount himself"". But when Lord Geidt found out about the messages to Lord Brownlow, hewrote to the prime minister,externalsaying that while his overall conclusions about the ministerial code were unchanged, had he seen the messages, ""I doubt whether I would have concluded, without qualification... that 'at the point when the prime minister became aware, he took steps to make the relevant declaration and to seek advice'."" Mr Johnson replied, offering a ""humble and sincere apology"" for not giving him the messages, blaming security issues which had forced him to change his phone. If a politician accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public, normally within 28 days. The concern is that if a financial gift is kept secret, it might be used to gain favours or political influence. This is the exchange of messages between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow: At the end of his message, Mr Johnson refers to the ""great exhibition plan"", which was a proposal for a cultural festival, which Lord Brownlow was involved with as a trustee of London's Albert Hall. Lord Brownlow met Oliver Dowden, who was then culture secretary, to discuss the event six weeks after the text exchange with the prime minister, according tothe meeting log,external. In the end, the exhibition did not happen, but Labour says Lord Brownlow's November 2020 text exchanges with the PM are still important. ""Lord Brownlow appears to have access to the prime minister because he was paying for the flat renovations. If that is the case, that is corruption,"" the party said. The BBC has approached Lord Brownlow for comment but he has not yet responded. Business Minister Paul Scully denied that the prime minister was linking support for a Great Exhibition with financial support for flat renovations in his messages. He said the Great Exhibition plan was passed to ""the right channels"" at the culture department and that Mr Johnson ""had no idea"" who would be paying for the flat refurbishments, believing the funding would come through a blind trust. Like several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds are living at No 11 because the four-bedroom flat there is much larger than the one above No 10. Tony Blair was the first prime minister to live at No 11 - he and his wife Cherie turned the space into a family home. The Grade 1-listed flatwas then extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011at a cost of Â£30,000. Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron pictured in the flat at 11 Downing St The latest upgrade for the flat was carried out by interior designer Lulu Lytle.

"Hamilton musical announces West End returnThe hit show is planning to be back on stage in London in August, as theatres aim to open up again.","There will have been 17 months between the last show and the reopening date Smash hit musical Hamilton is planning to be back in London's West End this summer, more than a year after it closed because of the pandemic. Producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said the award-winning show about the USA's founding fathers would resume at the Victoria Palace Theatre from 19 August. He said he was ""delighted"" to give the news after an ""incredibly hard year"". Many shows are making plans to reopen from 17 May with social distancing, and from June 21 with no restrictions.

Fact-checking PMQs,"There were heated exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday as Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Keir Starmer clashed over the controversial refurbishment of the Downing Street flat - among other issues. The prime minister insisted that he paid for work on No 11 Downing Street (where he lives) ""personally"" - but would not be drawn on whether someone else had funded it first. The Electoral Commission has announcedthat it is launching an investigation,because there are ""reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred"". We've looked at some of the claims made in Parliament: The figures for annual spending appear in aparliamentary answer,externalfrom a Cabinet Office minister. The Â£500,000 figure is what you get if you adjust for inflation (ie rising prices) and add up all the spending over the period of Labour governments between 1997 and 2010. If you take the amount of money actually spent at the time, to reflect the annual Â£30,000 allowance, there were several years when the spending was over that level. But the total spending over 13 years was Â£370,000, which is just under Â£30,000 a year. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter We do not yet have the figure for 2020-21, so we do not know whether Mr Johnson took the full Â£30,000 contribution of public money towards the refurbishment of the Downing Street flat. If the prime minister is referring to the vote in the House of Commons that followed the deal then this claim is not correct. The Labour leader voted in favour of the legislation on the agreement, as did the vast majority of Labour MPs. MPs overwhelmingly back post-Brexit deal with EU European Parliament backs Brexit trade deal Mr Starmer had said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". He had criticised a number of aspects of the deal. The vote took place on 30 December and was backed by the Commons by 521 to 73 votes after Parliament was recalled. The prime minister was referring to an exchange in February - over the UK's vaccine rollout - when he said that the Labour leader backed the UK staying in the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This is the EU body which evaluates new medicines and authorises the use of vaccines. Mr Starmer vehemently denied this claim at the time. But as we pointed out back in February,he had actually spoken in favour of staying in the EMA in 2017 on two occasions, in the context of the ongoing Brexit debate back then. Mr Starmer later admitted that he was ""wrong"" to call the prime minister's claim ""complete nonsense"" and acknowledged he had previously expressed support for the EMA. According to thegovernment figures,externalfrom 27 April, more than 33.8 million people in the UK  have had the first dose of the vaccine. That is indeed about half of the population. And on Tuesday, the Department of Health said more than a quarter of adults in the UK - 13.2 million - had been vaccinated with both doses of a Covid-19 jab. So, these figures are correct. The most recent figure for the number of homes built in England was 148,620 for the whole of 2020. The figure of 244,000 is forthe number of net additional dwellings,externalin England between April 2019 and March 2020. That was a record for the last 30 years. But that's not just homes built - net additional dwellings is a broad definition reflecting new houses completed, plus gains or losses from conversions, changes of use and demolitions and even some caravans and house boats. It should also be said that very few of the new homes are being built by government - 82% of the completions were from private enterprise, 17% from housing associations and 1% from local authorities.

Breaking|Breaking newsArlene Foster announces resignation as DUP leader,"This video can not be played ""It has been the privilege of my life to serve the people of Northern Ireland"" Arlene Foster has announced her resignation as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and as NI first minister after an internal revolt. Mrs Foster, 50, said she would step down as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister at the end of June. More than 20 DUP NI Assembly members and four MPs signed a letter voicing no-confidence in the leadership. Mrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to serve the people of Northern Ireland. She became leader of the party in December 2015 and, the following month as leader of Stormont's largest party, she was appointed first minister of Northern Ireland. She was the first woman and the youngest person to hold both jobs. Follow live reaction to resignation Read Mrs Foster's full statementhere,external. Mrs Foster said it had been the privilege of her life to ""serve the people of Northern Ireland as their first minister and to represent my home constituency of Fermanagh/South Tyrone"". ""My election as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party broke a glass ceiling and I am glad to have inspired other women to enter politics and spurred them on to take up elected office,"" Mrs Foster said. ""I understand the misogynistic criticisms that female public figures have to take and sadly it's the same for all women in public life. ""I want to encourage you to keep going and don't let the online lynch mobs get you down."" This video can not be played A look back at Arlene Foster's political career It is understood there is majority support among the party's Stormont and Westminster ranks - about 80% -  for a change in leadership. It is believed 22 of the DUP's 27 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and four MPs signed a letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster and the party leadership. Only a small number of the DUP membership - MLAs and MPs - will get to vote in a leadership contest. If there is a leadership contest, it will be the first in the DUP's 50-year history. Mrs Foster said it was important to give space over the coming weeks for the party officers to make arrangements for the election of a new leader. From trailblazing leader to party civil war Why did the DUP move against Arlene Foster? 'The DUP has lost touch with ordinary unionists' Mrs Foster has endured a turbulent time as DUP leader and the fall-out from Brexit - which the party supported - has put particular pressure on the party's top brass as it faces having to weather the storm caused bythe Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed a border down the Irish Sea. It has also been suggested recent changes to NI's abortion laws and the commitment to implement an Irish language act were causing concerns with some elected DUP representatives ahead of next year's assembly election. This was inevitable. It was just a question of time. With those numbers against her, there was no way Arlene Foster could hang on. She did not want to go, and if there was a way she could have stayed, she would have stayed. But I imagine she is pretty sad tonight. I know Arlene Foster well. She loved being party leader, she loved being first minister. It's been bruising at times, it's been tough. The DUP, at the minute, looks like a very difficult party to lead. Whoever takes over has a Herculean task to get things back on track. Mrs Foster said she was ""the first to recognise there have been ups and downs over the last five and a half years"" of her leadership. ""The 2016 assembly election result and our party's best ever Westminster result in 2017 stand out among the high points when the electorate sent a clear message that they wanted to keep Northern Ireland moving forward,"" she said. Mrs Foster added that as she prepared to ""depart the political stage"", Northern Ireland would only prosper if built on the ""foundations of successful and durable devolution"". In a social media post, Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked Arlene Foster for her ""dedication to the people of Northern Ireland"" and said he hoped she stayed in public service ""for years to come"".

In November 2018, Mr Johnson gave the keynote speech at the DUP's annual conference, in which he said the UK must""junk the backstop"", referring to efforts in the Brexit negotiations to avoid a hard Irish border. This was met with rapturous applause, however, relations would later sour between Mr Johnson and Mrs Foster after he became prime minister when the Brexit deal imposed checks and restrictions to Irish Sea trade. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis also paid tribute to Mrs Foster as a ""truly dedicated public servant"" and said young women in particular would be inspired by her example to follow a path into politics. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - the joint head of the Northern Ireland government along with Mrs Foster - said the incoming DUP leader should recognise that the political landscape across the island had changed. ""The broad community are impatient for social reform and political change which reflects a modern and progressive society where everyone can feel that they belong on an equal basis,"" she said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had a decent if challenging relationship with Mrs Foster Ms O'Neill said she and Mrs Foster had a decent if challenging relationship. She said they had worked well together through the Covid pandemic. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney tweeted his best wishes to Mrs Foster. Allow Twitter content?

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also extended his best wishes to the outgoing first minister. ""We disagree on almost everything but she has clearly been a committed servant to her party for a long time,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said her departure demonstrated how difficult a life in politics could be. He said there was now a place for a ""progressive and modern approach to unionism"". Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said it was a difficult day for Mrs Foster, adding he had found her ""straightforward"" in his dealings with her. Mrs Foster waselected as the first female leader of the DUP in December 2015, taking over from Peter Robinson. She was the only candidate. Her time at the helm has been seen many challenges, having faced Brexit, a botched green energy scandal which subsequently led to the collapse of Stormont for three years and Covid-19. The aftermath of Brexit has also caused friction both internally and between the party and some of its core voters who are unhappy at the deal which led to the Irish Sea border. DUP councillors had called for the resignation of both Mrs Foster and party deputy leader Lord Dodds (pictured right) The DUP has argued that it has never supported the Northern Ireland protocol and has actively tried to have it overthrown. It was not just MLAs and MPs that voiced their discontent in Mrs Foster. Letters from a number of party councillors were also written, calling for Mrs Foster and deputy leader Lord Dodds to resign. A number of issues of concern were listed, ranging from the NI Protocol, abortion legislation, same sex marriage, policing and the recent gay conversion debate at Stormont. Possible contenders to replace Mrs Foster include NI Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson. There has been speculation of a split role, with one person for first minister and then a party leader at Westminster. Mr Poots tweeted that he wanted to thank Mrs Foster for her ""service, sacrifice and commitment to the DUP and country"". Gavin Robinson thanked Mrs Foster for her ""dedicated service to Northern Ireland"" and said there would be ""more to say about what lies ahead in the days to come"". DUP rules say a leadership election should be called by 30 April. Normally this is simply a formality and the existing leader continues in their role, but other candidates are free to challenge them. Only a small number of party members are eligible to vote in such a contest - MPs and NI Assembly members (MLAs). There are 27 MLAs that hold the party whip - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs. Party rules currently state the leader of the party must be an MLA, but there has been talk of changing this rule to allow an MP to hold the role. Boris Johnson and then NI Secretary Julian Smith visited Stormont in January 2020 to mark the restoration of devolution The role of first minister is separate, but as the largest party from the largest grouping (unionism) in the assembly, the DUP is entitled to nominate someone to hold the post of first minister. Once Mrs Foster steps down as first minister, the DUP would then be asked to nominate a replacement within seven days and a vote would be held in the assembly. If a replacement is not nominated, then the Northern Ireland secretary is obliged to call an assembly election. TheNew Decade, New Approach deal,external, which was signed in January 2020 and restored the NI Assembly after a three-year hiatus, included a commitment to extend the time to appoint a new first or deputy first minister after a resignation from seven days to six weeks. However, this has not yet been legislated for. A UK government spokesperson told the BBC that ""good progress"" was being made with the legislation and it would be brought forward during the second parliamentary session.

European Parliament backs Brexit trade deal,"EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen oversees trade relations with the UK The European Parliament has ratified the post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal - a key move to ensure that tariff- and quota-free trade continues. The Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) has been operating provisionally since January. MEPs voted in favour by 660 votes to 5, while 32 abstained. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, said the vote ""brings certainty and allows us to focus on the future"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of a ""final step in a long journey"". The trade deal provided ""stability to our new relationship with the EU as vital trading partners, close allies and sovereign equals"", he said. The result, announced on Wednesday after a vote late on Tuesday, was also welcomed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier Ms von der Leyen said the TCA ""comes with real teeth, with a binding dispute settlement mechanism"". And she warned that the EU would use those teeth if necessary. The parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt described the deal as ""a failure for both sides, but better than nothing"". Lord Frost's opposite number in the Brexit talks, Michel Barnier, was also less than flattering. ""This is a divorce. It is a warning, Brexit. It's a failure of the European Union and we have to learn lessons from it,"" he told MEPs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit tensions remain, including a French threat of ""reprisals"" against the UK over new fishing restrictions. Northern Ireland trade is also a thorny issue. Under a separate protocol, Northern Ireland remains de facto part of the EU's single market, so goods arriving there from Britain have to undergo EU checks. Since Brexit there has been some disruption to that trade. The TCA covers EU-UK trade in goods, but not services. The UK economy is dominated by services - sectors such as banking, insurance, advertising and legal advice. What are the key points of the Brexit deal? 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal The TCA has still resulted in more paperwork, extra costs and less trade between the two sides, since the UK left the EU. A European Parliament resolution,externaldescribed the UK's exit from the EU as ""a historic mistake"". Among the areas not covered by the deal are foreign policy, financial services and student exchanges. Before the MEPs' debate started on Tuesday, French Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune accused the UK of blocking fishing rights. He said the EU could respond with ""reprisals"" in financial services. ""The United Kingdom is expecting quite a few authorisations from us for financial services. We won't give any for as long as we don't have guarantees on fishing and other issues,"" he said on French news channel BFMTV. French fishermen have complained of being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Meanwhile, British seafood exporters have been hit by an EU ban on UK exports of live shellfish. Scottish firms account for most of that business, and some now face collapse. EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister The UK made fishing rights a key issue in the negotiations, with control over access to its waters seen as a sign of British sovereignty. Praising the TCAwhen it was agreed in December, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said""we have taken back control of our laws and our destiny"". He described it as ""a deal which will if anything allow our companies and our exporters to do even more business with our European friends"". 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump In Tuesday's debate, German MEP David McAllister said Brexit ""will always be a lose-lose situation"", but he backed the TCA. It is a 1,400-page deal which was not clinched until 24 December. The Brexit negotiations began in 2017 and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. Common rules remained during the UK's transition period until January 2021. After nearly four years of difficult negotiations on the UK exit from the EU and the post-Brexit relationship, it's hardly surprising that a few bruises are showing. The TCA certainly hasn't solved everything. There are still big questions to resolve on issues like financial services, for example. Monitoring and implementing what has been agreed, in a complex network of committees, will also be a constant feature of the new relationship. But it will take some time before the long-term effect on trade becomes clear. Trade volumes fell sharply in January before rebounding in February. But theUK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex,externalsays UK exports to the EU were still down by 17.2% in February compared to an average of February 2018 to 2020. A significant part is down to Brexit, although Covid is also a factor. The most prominent post-Brexit issue so far this year, though, isn't part of the TCA itself.  Northern Ireland's trading relationship with the rest of the UK, and with the EU, won't change as a result of this agreement being ratified. Both sides say they are working hard to find practical solutions in Northern Ireland, but some checks on trade between NI and Britain will remain in place. This video can not be played Is the point-scoring coming to an end - or have we only seen the first half of this grudge match? The European Commission has launched legal action, accusing the UK of breaching the agreement on Northern Ireland trade and breaking international law - charges Downing Street denies. Brexit also means: Blanket free movement of citizens between the UK and EU no longer applies. Business travellers do not need a visa for short trips, but artists and performers are not covered - so, for example, British rock bands face bureaucracy for gigs in the EU The rights of the roughly one million UK citizens living in the EU, and of EU citizens in the UK, are protected under the TCA. But the UK citizens face varying deadlines for obtaining residence rights; for the three million EU citizens in the UK the deadline for applications is 30 June Government subsidies are now under intense scrutiny on both sides, as the EU insists on a ""level playing field"" in trade. Courts will have to decide in cases where subsidies are allegedly unfair. UK financial services, not covered by the TCA, face new EU bureaucracy - so many City banks have beefed up their EU-based operations. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Euro MPs' vote bolsters EU-UK Brexit trade deal EU shellfish ban indefensible, says minister UK exports to European Union drop 40% in January 'We had a build-up of pigs after Brexit' UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas, says No.10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

Sainsbury's: Cost of Covid has been high,"Sainsbury's has slumped to a Â£261m loss despite bumper food and Argos sales during the coronavirus pandemic. The supermarket giant said that in the year to 6 March Covid costs ""to help keep our colleagues and customers safe"" had been ""high"". However, it said it expected profits to bounce back in the coming year. Rival Tesco reported a sharp fall in profits earlier this month after spending nearly Â£900m to carry on trading during the pandemic. Sainsbury's said it had spent Â£485m on Covid-related costs, including paying colleagues that were required to shield or needed to self-isolate. It also paid back business rates relief on its stores in line with rivals. The supermarket giant also paid out restructuring costs, including to close 170 standalone Argos stores. Sainsbury's Â£261m pre-tax loss for the year was despite like-for-like sales rising 8.1%. Argos did especially well, with total sales rising almost 11% as digital sales boomed. However, Argos standalone stores, rather than those inside the supermarkets, were closed for much of the year during lockdowns. Sainsbury's online sales rose as coronavirus restrictions accelerated internet shopping. Online jumped from 8% of grocery sales to 17% during the year. The retailer has already embarked on a restructuring, and announced in March that 1,150 jobs were at risk. Despite a big jump in food sales Sainsbury's is nursing a Â£261m loss. Supermarkets have been among the big winners during the pandemic but they've also had huge Covid-19 costs, from keeping workers and customers safe to sick pay for staff who've had to shield. Sainsbury's also incurred Â£617m of exceptional costs. Most of this was the result of closing hundreds of standalone Argos stores as it restructures the business. The boss says that like his customers, he's looking forward to things feeling more normal over the coming months. But what is the new normal going to look like for our big grocers? It's not just about the shift to online, grocers are thinking about the future of work, and how to respond if many of us don't return to five days a week in the office. Sainsbury's is pressing ahead with plans to open more convenience stores and new neighbourhood hub shops - mini supermarkets in smaller towns -  which could be a shrewd move if we're going to be working more from home and shopping locally. Chief executive Simon Roberts praised the ""heroic"" efforts of staff to keep the business going during the pandemic, but added: ""The cost of keeping colleagues and customers safe during the pandemic has been high."" Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the costs of operating through the coronavirus crisis have ""seriously dented"" the supermarket giant's bottom line. ""Redesigning layouts to keep customers and staff safe, paying colleagues in full who needed to shield, all added [to costs] with Â£485m spent on Covid related costs,"" she said. Sainsbury's also spent Â£100m on higher staff salaries and special recognition payments to colleagues ""for their efforts during the crisis"", Ms Streeter added. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Interactive Investor, said the results offered ""broad optimism"" for the future. ""[But] intense competition across the sector, including from discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, cannot be ignored,"" he said. On Wednesday Sainsbury's reiterated plans to open 25 to 30 convenience stores per year for three years. Mr Roberts said this would tap into the coronavirus trend of more people working from home. He said the return of people working a five day week in the office ""is not going to happen"". ""As customers find new ways of working it inevitably will mean some of the week working from home,"" he said. ""We believe convenience stores will play a big part in the local community."" Sainsbury's already has more than 800 convenience stores, and those ""acted as mini supermarkets in the crisis with sales up 13% on the year,"" he said. ""Hundreds of these stores will be in in important locations for customers as they work locally,"" he added.

What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about?,"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds moved into No 11 Downing Street in July 2019 Further questions have been asked about the funding of home improvements at the prime minister's Downing Street flat, following the release of an exchange of letters with his standards adviser. Lord Geidt complained about not having been shown WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and Tory donor Lord Brownlow, which talked about the refurbishment. Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds had work carried out on their private residence, the flat above 11 Downing Street. The prime minister receives an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on his living quarters. But the work cost considerably more than that - at least Â£112,000 based on the amount we know Lord Brownlow contributed. The work was initially paid for by the Cabinet Office, but Â£52,000 was given to the Conservative Party by Lord Brownlow to cover the bills. Mr Johnson says he has now covered all the costs out of his own pocket. The Conservative Partywas fined Â£17,800after the Electoral Commission found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation. Lord Brownlow was asked in May 2020 to set up a Downing Street trust that would fund renovations to the flat above 11 Downing Street, but that trust was never established. In November 2020, the prime minister approached Lord Brownlow by WhatsApp message to approve payments to the interior designer carrying out the work. The Electoral Commission found in December 2021 that the subsequent Â£52,000 payment from Huntswood Associates Ltd, whose director is Lord Brownlow, had not been properly recorded and that it should not have been described as a loan or as part of a trust. But it said that separate payments of almost Â£60,000 for the refurbishments made by Lord Brownlow directly to suppliers, did not need to be declared. TheElectoral Commission report,externalled to further controversy because it referred to an exchange of WhatsApp messages between the prime minister and Lord Brownlow, which had not been seen by the adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, when he had reported on the case earlier in the year. The prime minister lives in a flat above 11 Downing Street Lord Geidt's report in May hadconcluded,externalthat Mr Johnson did not break the ministerial code over the funding of the renovations. But he said: ""The prime minister - unwisely, in my view - allowed the refurbishment of the apartment at No 11 Downing Street to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded."" Lord Geidt added: ""The record shows no evidence that the prime minister had been informed"" about the payments. His report says that when he found out in February 2021, Mr Johnson ""settled the full amount himself"". But when Lord Geidt found out about the messages to Lord Brownlow, hewrote to the prime minister,externalsaying that while his overall conclusions about the ministerial code were unchanged, had he seen the messages, ""I doubt whether I would have concluded, without qualification... that 'at the point when the prime minister became aware, he took steps to make the relevant declaration and to seek advice'."" Mr Johnson replied, offering a ""humble and sincere apology"" for not giving him the messages, blaming security issues which had forced him to change his phone. If a politician accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public, normally within 28 days. The concern is that if a financial gift is kept secret, it might be used to gain favours or political influence. This is the exchange of messages between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow: At the end of his message, Mr Johnson refers to the ""great exhibition plan"", which was a proposal for a cultural festival, which Lord Brownlow was involved with as a trustee of London's Albert Hall. Lord Brownlow met Oliver Dowden, who was then culture secretary, to discuss the event six weeks after the text exchange with the prime minister, according tothe meeting log,external. In the end, the exhibition did not happen, but Labour says Lord Brownlow's November 2020 text exchanges with the PM are still important. ""Lord Brownlow appears to have access to the prime minister because he was paying for the flat renovations. If that is the case, that is corruption,"" the party said. The BBC has approached Lord Brownlow for comment but he has not yet responded. Business Minister Paul Scully denied that the prime minister was linking support for a Great Exhibition with financial support for flat renovations in his messages. He said the Great Exhibition plan was passed to ""the right channels"" at the culture department and that Mr Johnson ""had no idea"" who would be paying for the flat refurbishments, believing the funding would come through a blind trust. Like several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds are living at No 11 because the four-bedroom flat there is much larger than the one above No 10. Tony Blair was the first prime minister to live at No 11 - he and his wife Cherie turned the space into a family home. The Grade 1-listed flatwas then extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011at a cost of Â£30,000. Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron pictured in the flat at 11 Downing St The latest upgrade for the flat was carried out by interior designer Lulu Lytle. Mr Johnson and his wife wanted to transform the flat from previous Prime Minister Theresa May's ""John Lewis furniture nightmare"" into a ""high society haven"",according to the society magazine Tatler.,external PM covered flat costs out of own pocket - minister Explain PM flat funding to MPs, says Labour Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Plan to fund Downing Street makeover 'speculation' Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas, says No.10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

Fact-checking PMQS,"There were heated exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday as Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Keir Starmer clashed over the controversial refurbishment of the Downing Street flat - among other issues. The prime minister insisted that he paid for work on No 11 Downing Street (where he lives) ""personally"" - but would not be drawn on whether someone else had funded it first. The Electoral Commission has announcedthat it is launching an investigation,because there are ""reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred"". We've looked at some of the claims made in Parliament: The figures for annual spending appear in aparliamentary answer,externalfrom a Cabinet Office minister. The Â£500,000 figure is what you get if you adjust for inflation (ie rising prices) and add up all the spending over the period of Labour governments between 1997 and 2010. If you take the amount of money actually spent at the time, to reflect the annual Â£30,000 allowance, there were several years when the spending was over that level. But the total spending over 13 years was Â£370,000, which is just under Â£30,000 a year. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter We do not yet have the figure for 2020-21, so we do not know whether Mr Johnson took the full Â£30,000 contribution of public money towards the refurbishment of the Downing Street flat. If the prime minister is referring to the vote in the House of Commons that followed the deal then this claim is not correct. The Labour leader voted in favour of the legislation on the agreement, as did the vast majority of Labour MPs. MPs overwhelmingly back post-Brexit deal with EU European Parliament backs Brexit trade deal Mr Starmer had said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". He had criticised a number of aspects of the deal. The vote took place on 30 December and was backed by the Commons by 521 to 73 votes after Parliament was recalled. The prime minister was referring to an exchange in February - over the UK's vaccine rollout - when he said that the Labour leader backed the UK staying in the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This is the EU body which evaluates new medicines and authorises the use of vaccines. Mr Starmer vehemently denied this claim at the time. But as we pointed out back in February,he had actually spoken in favour of staying in the EMA in 2017 on two occasions, in the context of the ongoing Brexit debate back then. Mr Starmer later admitted that he was ""wrong"" to call the prime minister's claim ""complete nonsense"" and acknowledged he had previously expressed support for the EMA. According to thegovernment figures,externalfrom 27 April, more than 33.8 million people in the UK  have had the first dose of the vaccine. That is indeed about half of the population. And on Tuesday, the Department of Health said more than a quarter of adults in the UK - 13.2 million - had been vaccinated with both doses of a Covid-19 jab. So, these figures are correct. The most recent figure for the number of homes built in England was 148,620 for the whole of 2020. The figure of 244,000 is forthe number of net additional dwellings,externalin England between April 2019 and March 2020. That was a record for the last 30 years. But that's not just homes built - net additional dwellings is a broad definition reflecting new houses completed, plus gains or losses from conversions, changes of use and demolitions and even some caravans and house boats.

Fact-checking Prime Minister's Questions,"There were heated exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday as Boris Johnson and the Labour leader Keir Starmer clashed over the controversial refurbishment of the Downing Street flat - among other issues. The prime minister insisted that he paid for work on No 11 Downing Street (where he lives) ""personally"" - but would not be drawn on whether someone else had funded it first.

Australian jailed for filming dying police officers,"Melbourne man Richard Pusey has admitted to taunting dying police officers An Australian man has received a 10-month jail sentence for filming and mocking police officers as they lay dying at a crash scene. Last month Richard Pusey pleaded guilty to the rare charge of outraging public decency, as well as other offences. The 42-year-old has already been in custody for nearly 300 days, so he will probably complete his sentence within days. The sentencing judge called his actions ""heartless, cruel and disgraceful"". Still, families of the victims were disappointed with the length of the sentence in a case that has stirred huge public anger. Last month, Judge Trevor Wraight said the media had demonised Pusey to the point where he was ""probably the most hated man in Australia"". The mortgage broker had been speeding in his car on a Melbourne freeway last year when he was pulled over by four officers. While they were making his arrest, all four were struck by a lorry that had veered out of its lane. Senior Constables Lynette Taylor and Kevin King, and Constables Glen Humphris and Josh Prestney died at the scene. Pusey had been standing a few metres away and avoided the crash, but afterwards pulled out his phone and began filming numerous videos, some of which ran for more than three minutes. The court had heard that Pusey stood over and taunted Senior Constable Taylor as she remained pinned under the lorry. Experts said she was most likely still alive at the time. (l-r) Kevin King, Josh Prestney, Lynette Taylor and Glen Humphris ""There you go. Amazing, absolutely amazing,"" he said, according to vision from the constable's body-worn camera which was tendered to a court. ""All I wanted was to go home and have some sushi,"" he added, before using expletives to blame the officers for ruining his Porsche sports car. He fled the scene on Melbourne's Eastern Freeway shortly after. The next day he was arrested at his home and initially charged with speeding, drug possession and reckless conduct offences. However, police then also discovered Pusey's video and that he had shared it among friends. The lorry driver, Mohinder Singh, was jailed earlier this month to 22 years for the deaths. A court found that the truck driver had been high on drugs, suffering delusions and hallucinations, and driving erratically when he ploughed his truck into the officers. On Wednesday, Judge Wraight condemned Pusey's behaviour while noting he was only being sentenced for his actions. Pusey hadn't caused the deaths of the officers, contrary to some public opinion, the judge said. ""Your conduct in recording the police officers in their dying moments, together with the words you used as you recorded, was not only derogatory and horrible... but it was also callous and reprehensible conduct,"" Judge Wraight said. He noted that Pusey had a history of mental health problems, including a complex personality disorder ""which may go some way to explaining your behaviour"". But he said it did not excuse his actions. Pusey had previously testified he felt ashamed about the videos and that he often said offensive things ""because that's how [it] comes out of my head"". Pusey was also fined A$1,000 (Â£557; $774), put on a two-year good behaviour bond, and had his drivers licence suspended. Families and supporters of the police officers criticised the sentence after it was handed down in Victoria's County Court. Stuart Schulze, the husband of Constable Taylor, said he felt ""almost unbearable"" pain every time he remembered how his wife was treated in her final moments. ""This sentence is totally inappropriate of this offending,"" Mr Schulze told reporters outside court. He argued it was the court's duty to ""set the appropriate standard"" in penalising such behaviour. The offence of outraging public decency has rarely been prosecuted in Australia, and the charge carries no set penalty. The head of Victoria state's police union also criticised the sentence. ""Four upstanding heroes died on that day andâ¦ one soulless coward lived,"" Wayne Gatt said.

India's deadly second wave,"Indians are waiting for hours to cremate the deceased as cases surge Rajeshwari Devi, 58, died on Sunday after waiting for two days to get uninterrupted oxygen, an ambulance and a bed in a Covid-19 hospital. She kept waiting and gasping but it was too late by the time help arrived. She was taken to a hospital emergency room on 16 April after her oxygen saturation level dropped. Her CT scan showed that she had developed severe pneumonia. But without her Covid report the hospital refused to admit her. She spent around 36 hours in the emergency room on oxygen support in the northern Indian district of Robertsganj. The staff there told her family they were running out of oxygen and she needed to be moved to a bigger hospital but there was no ambulance or any promise of a bed. The desperate family took her in their car to a hospital where a bed had become available after the intervention of a politician. She had no oxygen support in the car - she died minutes before she could be admitted to hospital. This video can not be played What went wrong for India? Ashish Agrahari, her son, says his mother ""would have had a chance at survival if treatment was given in time"". Heartbreaking stories such as this are coming in from across India as a second Covid wave wreaks havoc. Data suggests that this wave is proving to be more infectious and deadlier in some states, although India's death rate from the virus is still relatively low. But the county's healthcare system is crumbling amid the surge in cases - doctors say it's hard for them to""see the light at the end of the tunnel this time"". The rise in case numbers has been exponential in the second wave. On 18 June last year, India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days, it added 35,000 new cases on average every day. On 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases. But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with the daily average reaching 89,800. Experts say this rapid increase shows that the second wave is spreading much faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of Kerala state's Covid taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected given that India let its guard down when daily infections in January fell to fewer than 20,000 from a peak of over 90,000 in September. Big religious gatherings, the reopening of most public places and crowded election ralliesare being blamed for the uptick. Dr Fathahudeen said there were warning signs in February but ""we did not get our act together"". ""I said in February that Covid had not gone anywhere and a tsunami would hit us if urgent actions were not taken. Sadly, a tsunami has indeed hit us now,"" he added. ""A false sense of normalcy crept in and everybody, including people and officials, did not take measures to stop the second wave."" Many Indian cities are reporting a chronic shortage of hospital beds. It's also evident in the desperate cries for help on social media platforms.Disturbing reports of people dying without getting timely treatmentare coming from all over the country. Several state governments say they are creating new facilities but experts say it's going to be hard to keep up with the pace of the rising number of infections. India has been consistently reporting more than 150,000 cases for days now. It reported 273,810 cases on Monday - the biggest daily spike since the pandemic began. Badly-affected cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad have almost run out of hospital beds. The situation is not very different in other cities, such as Lucknow, Bhopal, Kolkata, Allahabad and Surat. Public health expert Anant Bhan says officials did not use the lean period to boost facilities. ""We didn't learn any lesson from the first wave. We had reports of some cities running out of beds even in the first wave and that should have been a good enough reason to be prepared for the second wave,"" he said. He adds that there appears to be a lack of co-ordination between states and the federal government over the supply of oxygen and essential drugs. ""We need a consolidated response and resources should be shared between states."" The situation is much more dire when it comes to ICU beds. Several cities have just a few dozen ICU beds left and they are now frantically trying to build extra capacity in hotels and stadiums. But getting ICU beds up and running quickly is not easy. Dr Fathahudeen says adding beds alone is not enough. ""We need to ensure that most of these beds have oxygen facility. We need more doctors and nurses to manage extra ICU beds,"" he adds. He says it's going to be a ""daunting task"" for the government to get such facilities up and running and ensure good quality of care in a short span of time. The number of daily deaths has risen sharply in the second wave. India reported 1,761 deaths on Monday, taking the toll to over 180,000 since the pandemic began. Crematoriums have been running day and night in several cities, and people have to wait for hours to get the deceased cremated or buried. Experts say this shows that the actual number of deaths could be much higher. Sanjeev Gupta, a photojournalist based in the central Indian city of Bhopal, reached one of the city's crematoriums for what he thought was a usual assignment last week. Bhopal had reported only four Covid-related deaths on that day. But Mr Gupta was surprised to see dozens of funeral pyres burning. Additionally, several bodies were lined up to be cremated in the electric furnace. Mr Gupta says he was moved when a young man asked him to photograph the smoke coming out from the chimney of the electric crematorium. ""He said the smoke represented his mother. It's the most heartbreaking thing I have ever heard."" Another photojournalist in Lucknow, which is the capital of Uttar Pradesh state, told the BBC that he counted nearly 100 funeral pyres burning at one of the city's crematoriums in the city on 14 April. The official death data for the whole state on that day was 85. ""The sky had turned orange near the crematorium. I still get chills thinking about it. We are definitely not getting the right death data from the government,"" he said. This is the picture Mr Gupta took after the young man's request Another photojournalist the BBC spoke to in Varanasi city in Uttar Pradesh state also talked about similar discrepancies in how deaths were being reported. Experts say there are several reasons for this. One of them is that many people are dying at home because they are not getting hospital beds or they are not being able to get tested for Covid. So, they don't find a place as a Covid patient in the database managed by different states. Mr Bhan says testing facilities are still poor in smaller towns and even in some cities and ""it's possible we are missing many Covid-related deaths in these areas"". He adds that there seems to be an issue with recording Covid deaths in some states.There have been reports about administrative oversight as well,externalbut officials deny the allegation. ""We need more transparency in numbers as it helps in managing the situation and also clearly tells you how severe the situation is,"" Mr Bhan adds. India on 25 March announced that a new variant of the coronavirus had been detected from samples collected from different states. Virologist Shahid Jameel explained that a ""double mutation in key areas of the virus's spike protein may make the virus more infectious and allow it to escape the immune system"". He says the change in the virus is the only ""logical explanation"" behind the surge.Health officials in the UK are now investigatingwhether a double mutant spreads more easily and evades vaccines. As things stand there is still not enough evidence to determine any causal relationship with India's deadly second wave, and the variant is not currently listed by Public Health England as a ""variant of concern"" - a term used to describe the UK, Brazilian and South African variants. Crematoriums have been running day and night Dr Jameel adds that India started looking at mutations ""fairly late"". ""By December, India had done genome sequencing of only 5,000 samples. It wasn't a concentrated effort."" In January, India put together a group of labs to speed up sequencing and these labs started functioning in February. ""But unfortunately, the second wave started and the vision of sequencing roughly 5% of the total samples did not come through."" Sequencing becomes important in a pandemic as it allows scientists to monitor changes in the virus. ""If you can catch a more infectious variant early on in a region, you can quickly put in public health measures to stop it from spreading wider in the community,"" he explains. But it's ""never too late"" to take measures. ""We need to strengthen safety protocols and rapidly vaccinate people, and also keep an eye on mutations. If we do all this, we could reduce numbers significantly.""

What is the India Covid variant?,"A coronavirus variant identified in India is being investigated by scientists across the world. However, it is not yet known how far it has spread or whether it is drivingthe deadly second wave of Covid in India itself. Viruses mutate all the time, producing different versions or variants of themselves. Most of these mutations are insignificant - and some may even make the virus less dangerous - but others can make it more contagious and harder to vaccinate against. This variant - officially known as B.1.617 - was first detected in India in October. Sample testing is not widespread enough across India to determine how far or quickly the variant is spreading. It was detected in 220 out of 361 Covid samples collected between January and Marchin the western Indian state of Maharashtra,external. Meanwhile, it has been spotted in at least 21 countries, according tothe GISAID global database.,external International travel appears to have brought the variant to the UK, where 103 cases have been identified since 22 February. Most travellers from India havenow been banned from coming to the UK. Public Health England has listed the India variant as one of several ""variants under investigation"". The BBC has beentold by expertsthat it could soon be added to the ""variant of concern"" list. What are the Brazil, South Africa and UK variants? People queue for Covid testing in Jammu, Kashmir Scientists do not yet know whether this variant is more infectious or resistant to vaccines. Dr Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University, says one of its mutations is similar to those seen in variants identified in South Africa and Brazil. And this mutation may help the virus evade antibodies in the immune system that can fight coronavirus based on experience from prior infection or a vaccine. But what appears to be more worrying at the moment is a variant identified in the UK, which is dominant in Britain and has spread to more than 50 countries. ""I doubt whether the Indian variant is more infectious than the UK variant - and we must not panic,"" Dr Kamil says. Much of the data around the India variant is incomplete, scientists say, with very few samples being shared - 298 in India and 656 worldwide, compared with more than 384,000 sequences of the UK variant. And after the first recorded cases in India, fewer than 400 cases of the variant have been detected worldwide, Dr Kamil says. India has been reporting about 200,000 Covid cases daily since 15 April - well beyond its peak of 93,000 cases a day last year. Deaths too have been rising. ""India's high population and density is a perfect incubator for this virus to experiment with mutations,"" says Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge. However, the wave of cases in India could have been caused by large gatherings, and lack of preventive measures such as mask-wearing or social distancing. Why second Covid wave is devastating India Dr Jeffrey Barrett, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, says it is possible there could also be a cause-and-effect relationship with the new variant, but there is still a lack of evidence. He points out that the India variant has been around since late last year: ""If it is driving the wave in India it has taken several months to get to this point which would suggest it's probably less transmissible than the Kent B117 variant."" Scientists believe existing vaccines will help control the variant when it comes to preventing severe disease. Some variants will inevitably escape the current vaccines, according toa paper published in Nature by Prof Gupta and his fellow researchers.,externalAs a result, changes to vaccine design will be needed to make them more effective. However, the vaccinations now available are still likely to slow down the spread of the disease. ""For most people, these vaccines can mean the difference between little to no disease and ending up in the hospital with a risk of dying,"" says Dr Kamil. ""Please take the first vaccine you are offered. Do not make the mistake of hesitating and waiting for an ideal vaccine."" This video can not be played What went wrong for India?

Running out of oxygen in India,"Hospitals in Delhi have been forced to display signs saying they have run out of oxygen Twenty-five families in India's capital Delhi woke up to the news on Friday morning that someone they loved had died in the city's Sir Ganga Ram hospital, reportedly because coronavirus patients could not get enough oxygen. The hospital's medical director said a severe shortfall had slowed the flow of oxygen to 25 of the sickest patients, who needed a high pressure, stable supply. The tragedy came at the end of a week where several major hospitals in Delhi have repeatedly come close to running out of oxygen, which can help patients with the virus who need support with their breathing stay alive. On Tuesday, it tooka desperate public plea,externalfrom the chief minister and an intervention from the high court for the Indian central government to organise a late night refill. An oxygen tanker eventually arrived at Sir Ganga Ram hospital on Friday morning, shortly after a dire warning that 60 more patients were on the verge of death. But India's rising wave of cases is pushing its healthcare system to the brink - from the country's richest cities to its remotest corners. Maharashtra and Gujarat in the west, Haryana in the north, and Madhya Pradesh in central India are all facing an oxygen shortage. In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, some hospitals have put ""oxygen out of stock"" boards outside, and in the state capital Lucknow hospitals have asked patients to move elsewhere. Smaller hospitals and nursing homes in Delhi are doing the same. Desperate relatives in several cities are lining up outside oxygen refilling centres. One plant in the southern city of Hyderabad hired bouncers to manage the crowd. Many stricken with coronavirus are dying while they wait. Hospitals are struggling to accommodate breathless patients, or even keep alive those who were lucky enough to find a bed. Social media feeds and WhatsApp groups are full of frantic pleas for oxygen cylinders. For a week, India has been reliving this nightmare on repeat, waiting for the terrifying moment when there is no oxygen left at all. This video can not be played Relatives beg for help as oxygen runs out For anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similaroxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. Typically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. That's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year. Then, India was adding about 90,000 cases daily. Just two weeks ago, in early April, the single-day spike was around 144,000. Now, the daily caseload has more than doubled to well more than 300,000. ""The situation is so bad that we had to treat some patients in a cardiac ambulance for 12 hours until they could get an ICU bed,"" said Dr Siddheshwar Shinde, who runs a Covid hospital in Pune, a western district with India's second-highest active caseload and third-highest death toll from the virus. Last week, when there were no ventilators left, Dr Shinde began moving patients to other cities - unheard of in Pune, where patients usually arrive from nearby districts seeking treatment. Relatives of Covid patients have been queuing up in cities to refill cylinders The state of Maharashtra, where Pune is located, is among the worst-affected parts of India, and currently accounts for more than a third of active cases. The state is producing about 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen daily but all of it is already being used for Covid patients. And demand is rising along with cases, and outstripping supply. It shows no signs of letting up. ""Usually hospitals like ours were able to have enough oxygen supply. But in the past fortnight, keeping people breathing has become a task. Patients as young as 22 need oxygen support,"" said Dr Shinde. Doctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave. ""Nobody knows when this is going to end,"" Dr Shinde said. ""I think even the government did not foresee this."" Some governments did. The southern state of Kerala increased supply by monitoring demand closely and planning for a rise in cases. Kerala now has surplus oxygen that it is sending to other states. But Delhi and some other states do not have their own oxygen plants and are relying on imports. The Supreme Court has weighed in, asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration for a national Covid plan that addresses the oxygen crunch. The federal health ministry had invited bids for new oxygen plants in October last year - more than eight months after the beginning of pandemic in India. Of the 162 that were sanctioned, only 33 have been installed so far - 59 will be installed by the end of April and another 80 by the end of May, the ministry has said. A woman with access to oxygen waits for admission at the LNJP Hospital in Delhi The scramble to increase supply points to the lack of any emergency plan. Liquid oxygen, pale blue and extremely cold, with a temperature of around -183C, is a cryogenic gas that can only be stored and transported in special cylinders and tankers. About 500 factories in India extract and purify oxygen from air and send it to hospitals in liquid form. Most of it is supplied through tankers. Major hospitals usually have their own tank where oxygen is stored and then piped directly to beds. Smaller and temporary hospitals rely on steel and aluminium cylinders. Oxygen tankers often queue outside a plant for hours and it takes about two hours to fill one tanker. It takes several hours more for these tankers to travel to various towns within or across states. The tankers also have to follow a specific speed limit - no more than 25mph (40km/h) - and they often don't travel in the night to avoid accidents. The head of one of India's biggest oxygen suppliers has said part of the struggle has been getting oxygen from eastern India, where supply in industrial states such as Orissa and Jharkhand is high, to western or northern India such as Maharashtra or Delhi, where cases are rising fast. And the demand for oxygen at individual facilities is unpredictable, making it difficult to gauge a hospital's requirement and adequately get supply where it is needed. Transporting oxygen has become a huge logistical challenge ""Not every patient needs the same amount of oxygen for the same duration. How many patients need oxygen changes by hour in a hospital,"" said Dr Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases expert at a Mumbai hospital. ""We are taking all the care we can. But I've not seen anything like this. I think nobody here has."" Before the crunch of the oxygen crisis, thefederal government was already facing criticismfor allowing election rallies and a massive Hindu festival, and failing to expand the vaccination drive quickly enough. Critics have accused various state governments of doing too little to prepare for the devastating second wave now washing through the county. Doctors and virologists who spoke to the BBC said the oxygen shortfall was more a symptom than a cause of the crisis - effective safety protocols and strong public messaging could have kept more people at home, and the virus at bay. But a sharp drop in cases by January lulled the country into a false sense of safety, they said, creating the conditions for a terrible second wave. Mr Modi's government has now started an ""oxygen express"", with trains carrying tankers to wherever there is demand, and the Indian Air Force is airlifting oxygen from military bases. They are also mulling plans to import 50,000 metric tonnes of of liquid oxygen. ""We have been telling authorities that we are willing to increase our capacity, but we need financial aid for that,"" said Rajabhau Shinde, who runs a small oxygen plant in Maharashtra. ""Nobody said anything and now suddenly, hospitals and doctors are pleading for more cylinders,"" he said. ""This should not have happened. As the saying goes, dig the well before you're thirsty. But we didn't do that."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised in this story? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"LiveLiveIndia surpasses 200,000 Covid deaths amid surgeLess than a minute ago","India has seen more Covid cases in the last seven days than any other country A ferocious second wave has seen the official death toll surpass 200,000 - experts believe the actual number may be higher People have died waiting for beds, as oxygen supplies run low and hospitals crumble under the strain Indians are struggling to register online for a mass vaccination programme due to start next month US President Joe Biden says he intends to send vaccines to India The BBC is bringing you a special day of coverage across TV, radio and digital on India's crisis Weâre following families as they search for oxygen for loved ones, and getting updates from areas likely to be hit hardest next Edited by Rebecca Seales and Martha Buckley We're winding up our live coverage of Covid in India, which formed part of a special BBC day of focus on the country's devastating pandemic. Here is a round-up of today's main developments:  The live page was brought to you by: Soutik Biswas, Vikas Pandey, Geeta Pandey, Ayeshea Perera, Rebecca Seales, Martha Buckley, Aparna Alluri, Suranjana Tewari, George Wright, Ashitha Nagesh, Georgina Rannard, Lauren Turner, Hamish Mackay, Mary O'Connor, Tessa Wong, Frances Mao, Andreas Ilmer, Yvette Tan, Callum Matthews, Ritu Prasad, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Emily Wolstencroft. We are grateful to our team of BBC languages reporters in India, Asia-based correspondents, visual journalism team, BBC Reality Check, and contributors in the US and UK. The city of Mumbai - which sits in the state of Maharashtra, India's biggest hotspot - has been in complete lockdown for two weeks. There's a sense of deja vu -  the pictures are eerily reminiscent of a period of time last year when large parts of the entire world went into a state of lockdown. But the pictures are a reminder that for millions in India - this is still their reality. The western state of Maharashtra, which has been India's Covid ground zero from the start of the pandemic, is back at the top after briefly reporting a drop in cases. The state, among Indiaâs richest and home to its financial hub, Mumbai, confirmed more than 66,000 cases  last night. Thatâs more than any other state, adding to an active caseload that is already the highest in India. Maharashtra accounts for more than a quarter of Indiaâs 17.9 million cases and nearly a third of India's 201,000 deaths so far. Mayank Bhagwat of BBC Marathi explains more. This video can not be played Western Maharashtra is India's worst-affected region Ashitha NageshBBC News, London It's widely agreed among experts that both cases and deaths are being under-reported in India right now - and one expert tells me that she thinks the real figures could be as high as 10 times the official numbers in some areas. Dr Amita Gupta is a professor of medicine in international health at the US-based Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and she facilitates the university's partnerships with clinics and labs across India. ""We were estimating that the problem is 10 times worse in places like Maharashtra than the official numbers, based on what we're hearing,"" she says. One of the main problems is that only people with symptoms are being tested, and even then testing labs are already at capacity. ""We've heard from many of the big lab chains around India... they're running 24/7 and are essentially overrun with tests. There's only so many they can test."" Queues of patients and their families have been forming outside hospitals as people get increasingly desperate to access treatment. But Dr Jayesh Lele told BBC World TV that this was causing patients to get sicker and leaving medical staff scared. This video can not be played India Covid: Queues outside hospitals causing anger and harassment, says doctor The surge in cases has meant delays in people getting admitted to hospital. As these pictures from today show, patients have been left waiting in cars or rickshaws in the western city of Ahmedabad.

Neha says she often wonders what would have happened if she had contracted Covid now instead, because there ""just isn't the infrastructure"" to keep people well. Indiaâs hospitals are using 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen a day - equating to 90% of the oxygen supply, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. Thatâs a massive leap, not just from pre-Covid times, when healthcare facilities used just 15% of Indiaâs oxygen supply, but also three times more than was used in the peak of the first wave last September. You can read more about Indiaâs oxygen struggles here. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London Right now Soma is working on getting medical supplies and treatments to people living on the streets of Kolkata. She's just finished an ambulance round with the Hope foundation, and is heading back into the hospital when I speak to her. I ask how her day has been so far, and she replies with one word: ""Hectic."" Her hospital has 45 beds and 40 of them are currently occupied by confirmed Covid patients. The remaining five are suspected to have the virus. On top of that, they're facing the same dire shortages of equipment and oxygen that are hitting medical centres across the country. Vulnerable people, she says, ""are coming here from across West Bengal,"" after failing to get admitted to government hospitals. ""This is because there is no proper treatment for these people from our government."" BBC Radio's Asian Network As part of our special day of India coverage, BBC Asian Network has a  programme on BBC
Sounds asking: Has India been let down by Narendra Modiâs government? You can listen here. We have spoken to the ruling BJP party and campaigners in India, as well as the Asian Network audience. We also hear from our reporters in London, Leicester and Bolton, to find
out how Indian communities there have been affected. A day after the Board of Control for Cricket in India urged players to play on for ""humanity"" we also ask whether the IPL should be
suspended. And Haroon
Rashid looks at how Bollywood is responding to the unfolding tragedy. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London In the vast, 1,100 sq km Chilika Lagoon in Odisha lies a group of island villages - cut off from the mainland, and accessible only by boat. Dr Manoranjan Mishra, head of an organisation called Jeevan Rekha Parishad (JRP), says access to food and education there has been limited over the past year because of lockdowns. JRP organises food deliveries to the islands via local volunteers, to avoid people from the mainland travelling over. The impact has been particularly hard on the Dalit community, formerly known as ""untouchables"". ""They have no income, no connectivity, no electricity... because they're completely excluded from the mainstream of society,"" Dr Mishra tells me. But has the virus itself reached the islands? ""Fortunately, you'll not believe, the island people are completely safe,"" Dr Mishra tells me. ""Not a single positive case has been found so far. Nobody is going there, and they're not going out - so they're completely safe."" This video can not be played Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come in for criticism over his handling of the crisis. He is currently working relentlessly with the health ministry and other countries to tackle oxygen shortages, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national spokesperson Shaina Nana Chudasama has said. âIt is most unfortunate that we have lost lives and nobody expected this double mutant to shape up in this particular way,â she told BBC World TV earlier. Harrowing scenes are emerging from India by the hour - some of which we've pictured and reported on in this live page today. The official death toll has exceeded 200,000 - though experts believe the actual total is higher - and people are dying while waiting for hospital beds as oxygen supplies run low and hospitals collapse under the strain. The crisis has also affected those reporting on it every day. Two of the BBC's Delhi-based reporters - Soutik Biswas and Vikas Pandey - have been sharing their experiences of striving to help
family and friends, while also working overtime to report the nightmare
unfolding around them. In the last two weeks, 45 journalists in India have died with Covid-19. Overall, more than 100 have died with the virus, according to Press Emblem Campaign, a Switzerland-based media group. However a group of mental health professionals have raised questions about how some sections of the media have been reporting on the crisis - and the impact on those reading or watching. Experts including Dr BN Gangadhar of New Delhi's National Medical Commission,external, have signed an open letter urging journalists to show ""restraint in their coverage, without compromising upon facts or public interest"". They write that reporting images of ""bodies burning in cremation grounds [and] relatives of the deceased wailing inconsolably"" might ""help garner eyeballs"" but there was a ""steep price to be paid for such coverage"". They warn a ""hidden mental health epidemic"" is already emerging from the Covid-related restrictions on peoples' lives, and that seeing such ""disturbing and depressing visuals"" while stuck at home could push people ""much deeper into the abyss"".

Reporting on shortages of certain supplies is the ""right thing to do so that action can be taken"" but it must include specifics such as exactly where the shortage is. ""Specific information empowers people and prepares them to face any challenge. But panic weakens them,"" the experts say. They stress they are not saying that facts should not be reported but instead that ""hysteria and panic-inducing coverage"" should be avoided. ""In such times the media has great power to inform, educate, and most importantly infuse hope in the people. This includes the sharing of authentic information and allaying of fears. ""These are extremely important weapons in the fight against the pandemic."" Rajini VaidyanathanBBC South Asia Correspondent Patients being treated at a New Delhi hospital Back in January, it was the beginning of Indiaâs vaccination drive. In Delhi, brightly coloured balloons hung over an archway to the hospital entrance. On that day, there was a mood of celebration. The hospitalâs medical director, Suresh Kumar, smiled from under his mask. It was a smile of relief - as he told me how wards which had been dedicated to coronavirus cases were now able to treat other, routine conditions. Covid-19 cases were low, and many thought India was past the worst. Months later, and that couldnât be further from the distressing reality. Gone are the balloons and buoyancy - replaced instead by a sense of desperation. Back then there were around 10,000-15,000 cases reported a day - with under  100 deaths. Now there are more than 300,000 daily cases, and more than 2,000 daily deaths. Scrolling through my social media feeds I see message after message, written by families struggling to find beds for friends and relatives. Indian health experts Iâve talked to believe the numbers dying with, or because of, Covid are far higher than the official statistics.The pyres that burn through the night at some of the crematoriums are visual testament to this. How did India get here? Many say it was a sense of complacency. Mass gatherings had taken place, with no social distancing and few people wearing masks. In my circle of friends in Delhi, almost everyone now knows someone whoâs lost a loved one to Covid-19. A friendâs three-year old son has the virus â doctors say theyâre seeing more younger patients this time round. The joy of that January morning has now turned into sheer horror, which is unfolding across the country. Listen to more from Rajini onBBC Sounds here. Ashitha NageshBBC News, London Shishir Joshi is from Project Mumbai, a non-profit working on Covid relief for people living in the city's slum areas. He tells me that last year they mostly focused on getting food and funds to people below the poverty line who weren't able to work in lockdown - but now, the priority is healthcare. ""We are also now providing what we call oxygen concentrators,"" he says. An oxygen concentrator is a machine that allows someone to have oxygen treatment administered at home - and with hospitals in the city packed to capacity, it is becoming a vital piece of equipment. ""We started a project to provide these machines to people below the poverty line in Mumbai - for free of course.... In the absence of hospital beds, people need oxygen concentrators."" Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi With Covid has also come the ""shadow pandemic"" - a term the UN has used to describe the steep rise in cases of domestic violence. The countryâs National Commission for Women says it received 23,722 complaints of crimes against women in 2020 - the highest in the past six years. Of those, almost a quarter were complaints of domestic violence. The trend has continued into 2021 - with 1,463 complaints of domestic violence reported between 1 January and 25 March. In rural India, many men who returned home from the cities after losing their jobs brought along financial stress and fears of sickness. Some took out their frustrations on their wives and children. The frequency and the brutality of assaults are said to have gone up, says Urvashi Gandhi of charity Breakthrough, with its partner NGOs ""receiving frantic calls to rescue women trapped in unsafe homes"". People in Mumbai waiting to receive a vaccine Dr Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics, has been telling theBBC's Newscast podcastwhat the world needs to do to stop more countries suffering like India. She said: ""Rather than sending donations, we need to stop them getting like that, massively ramping up global distribution and global production of vaccines."" Which country could be next? ""I think Peru is one to look at, the numbers there are getting really scary"", said Dr  Wenham. ""What the last 14 months has taught us, is that if you take your eye off the ball for a second and get complacent, it can happen anywhere.""

Amitabha BhattasaliBBC News, West Bengal This video can not be played Large election rallies worsen West Bengal crisis It was only a couple of weeks ago when the mood in West Bengal state was ""There is no more coronavirus, why use a mask?"" That has now changed. Cases in the state are surging in the wake of huge election rallies - and it's likely to be the next big hotspot. The eastern state in is the middle of a heated election and rallies are continuing. Some of the biggest ones, including those attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have seen throngs of people not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. Although Modi has since cancelled his rallies, amid mounting criticism, local politicians are yet to do so The election commission has now limited them to a maximum of 500 people. There is also no lockdown or curfew in the state - despite a new high of 16,403 new Covid cases over the past 24 hours. South Africa's Faf du Plessis takes a catch for Chennai Super Kings against Sunrisers Hyderabad Despite the continued rise in cases and deaths across India, the Indian Premier League - the world's top Twenty20 competition, compromising  the world's best players - is continuing. The tournament has moved to Delhi - where a match is taking place right now - and Ahmedabad, after starting in Mumbai and Chennai. There have been no cases within the tournament, which is taking place in a bubble, but some overseas players have started to leave the tournament because of travel restrictions that their home countries are putting into place. England's Liam Livingstone left Rajasthan Royals, while Australia'sAndrew Tye, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardsonhave all departed. India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has also decided to take a break to ""support his family"". Despite that, the tournament is expected to continue, with a senior IPL official arguing it keeps people's spirits up. ""We should not underestimate the power of sport to spread positivity. It's probably more important now to hold the IPL, when there is so much negativity around,"" the official told Reuters. ""At least fans are absorbed in it at home. Otherwise many of them will step out without masks. ""The league generates considerable money for the economy. It has to be seen from that context too. How does stopping IPL help?"" BBC Radio 5 Live Radhika Howarth lives in London but is currently stuck in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh state, where she has been caring for her 84-year-old mother. Radhika arrived in India on 30 March and was allowed to enter Gwalior after spending a week in quarantine in Delhi. Before that, she had not seen her mother, Shamoli, for 18 months because of the pandemic. Shamoli was in need of support after she recently had a fall and her carer had to stop visiting because of the surge in Covid-19 cases. Radhika told BBC Radio 5 Live in the UK that she did not even want to step out of her front door, for fear of herself or her mother catching coronavirus. ""What I am hearing is very grim, all we can hear outside are the sirens of ambulances up and downâ¦ it just makes your heart sink,"" she said. ""I feel guilty even asking for a test [PCR Covid-19 test] to be able to fly back because I know people are desperate to get the test and get the treatment."" Radhika said hospitals had put out signs saying âNo beds available.â She and her mother have essential supplies but they are currently sticking to one meal a day to try to manage. âI want to come back, but I donât want to come back, because how will people like my mother cope?"" she said. ""In a situation like this you are so disempowered, you have no rights, and thereâs no one around to turn to.

"More sex, fewer colds drive sales at Durex-maker","Condom sales have jumped in countries including China where lockdowns are easing, says consumer goods giant Reckitt. It reported a ""double-digit"" increase in Durex sales in the first quarter of 2021, compared with one year ago. But demand for health products fell overall as fewer customers stocked up on cold and flu medicines. Reckitt's boss pointed out that sales for Lysol and Dettol were strong as hygiene habits improved. At the start of the pandemic last year, the firm said people were having less sex because of the coronavirus crisis, partly due to a ""manifestation of anxiety"". Conversely, the company said sales of Durex jumped when social-distancing rules were relaxed in the summer. In its nutrition division, which includes baby formula brand Enfa, sales in the first quarter fell 12.3%, but with hygiene sales up 21.1%, the overall sales tally for the first three months of the year stood at Â£3.5bn - down 1.1%. Chief executive Laxman Narasimhan said: ""Demand for Lysol and Dettol continues to be strong as consumers remain vigilant to the spread of the virus and see use of our products, and improved hygiene habits, as a way of protecting their health and regaining normality in their lives."" He said that the firm would continue to track changes in consumer behaviour and demand for different products at different stages of the pandemic. Durex condom sales jump after virus rules relaxed The company reported a 16.4% decline in sales for health products like cold and flu relief products such as Nurofen or Strepsils. It estimated that cases of flu were down by as much as 90%, while consumers had already stocked up last year. Mr Narasimhan added that in countries with few coronavirus cases and high vaccination rates, people have eased off on washing their hands or using hand sanitizers, although use was still higher than before the pandemic. For example, sales of Dettol showed strong growth in India, which is currently dealing with soaring cases of Covid, but declined in China. ""Sexual wellness"" products saw a big uptick in sales in countries like China too, as well as parts of the United States and Europe. Bosses said they expect this to grow in other countries as lockdowns and social distancing measures lead to the opportunity for more people to use their products. The results are an illustration of changes in spending habits as lockdown rules loosen. On Tuesday market research firm Kantar said that UK shoppers are making more trips to supermarkets and buying less online as lockdown lifts and the vaccine rollout continues. Its latest figures show that online supermarket sales growth has halved since the height of the pandemic, to 46%. Meanwhile, the number of trips to grocery stores rose by 4% month-on-month in the four weeks to 18 April. Kantar said older shoppers accounted for much of the rise in footfall, with much of the over-65 community now vaccinated. More than 33 million people in the UKhave received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched. Overall supermarket sales rose by 5.7% to Â£31.6 billion in the 12 weeks to 18 April, marking a slowdown in the rate of growth seen a year ago when shoppers panic-bought at the start of the crisis. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""While the market may fluctuate between growth and decline in the months ahead, depending on the year-on-year comparison being made, the fact that trip numbers are up and basket sizes down suggests that habits are slowly returning to normal.""

Self-driving cars to be allowed on roads this year,"Drivers will be allowed to take their hands off the wheel if ALKS is enabled ""Self-driving"" vehicles could be allowed on UK roads by the end of this year, the government has said. The Department for Transport said automated lane-keeping systems (ALKS) would be the first type of hands-free driving legalised. The technology controls the position and speed of a car in a single lane and it will be limited to 37mph (60km/h) But insurers have warned the government's definition of ALKS as ""self-driving"" is misleading. Previously, the government had said these new laws would be in placeby spring this yearand told the BBC there was no delay in its suggested timeframes. Following a consultation last year, the government has now said that vehicles with ALKS technology can be legally defined as self-driving, âas long as they receive GB type approval and that there is no evidence to challenge the vehicleâs ability to self-drive.â The government confirmed that drivers will not be required to monitor the road or keep their hands on the wheel when the vehicle is driving itself. But the driver will need to stay alert and be able take over when requested by the system within 10 seconds. If a driver fails to respond, the vehicle will automatically put on its hazard lights to warn nearby vehicles, slow down and eventually stop. The Highway Code is now consulting on what rules will be put into new laws to make sure the technology is safely used. This video can not be played What happens if you fall asleep in a self-driving car? âThis is a major step for the safe use of self-driving vehicles in the UK, making future journeys greener, easier and more reliable while also helping the nation to build back better,â said Transport Minister Rachel Maclean. âBut we must ensure that this exciting new tech is deployed safely, which is why we are consulting on what the rules to enable this should look like.â The technology could improve road safety by reducing human error, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. âAutomated driving systems could prevent 47,000 serious accidents and save 3,900 lives over the next decade through their ability to reduce the single largest cause of road accidents â human error,â said chief executive Mike Hawes. âTechnologies such as Automated Lane Keeping Systems will pave the way for higher levels of automation in future â and these advances will unleash Britainâs potential to be a world leader in the development and use of these technologies, creating essential jobs while ensuring our roads remain among the safest on the planet.â Tesla's so-called ""Autopilot"" uses lane technology similar to ALKS. It is considered ""level two"" on the five defined levels of self-driving cars. The next step - level three - would not need the driver's attention at all times, and in theory, the driver could do other things such as check email or even watch a movie - until the car prompts them to take over again. This is would include ALKS. However, there have been several incidents involving this technology when drivers did not pay enough attention to the road. In 2018,a Nottingham resident was banned from drivingafter climbing into the passenger seat of his Tesla on the motorway, letting it do the driving. A fatal crash in the United States was caused, in part, by the driverplaying a video game while leaving his car in ""Autopilot"" mode, before it drove into a concrete barrier. A recent report found that the feature can be âeasily trickedâinto operating without a driver, adding to the mounting criticisms over the marketing of these features as ""self-driving"", and whether that is misleading to customers. Thatcham Research, which conducts safety tests for motor insurers, urged caution over defining ALKS as 'self-driving', as the government has done. ""ALKS as currently proposed by the government are not automated,"" said Matthew Avery, director of research at Thatcham Research. ""They are assisted driving systems as they rely on the driver to take back control. ""Aside from the lack of technical capabilities, by calling ALKS automated our concern also is that the UK government is contributing to the confusion and frequent misuse of assisted driving systems that have unfortunately already led to many tragic deaths. ""Consumers will expect the car to do the job of a driver, which current models can't do."" The autonomous car industry and the UK government share a sunny optimism about progress towards our self-driving future - but in recent years many of their predictions have failed to come to pass. In his 2017 Budget the then Chancellor Philip Hammond promised that driverless cars would be on British roads by 2021. When I emailed a Treasury official to ask whether that really meant an autonomous vehicle with no safety driver the answer came back in block capitals YES - THIS WOULD MEAN FULL SELF-DRIVING CARS WITH NOBODY BEHIND THE WHEEL. That has obviously not happened and even today's announcement takes us only a short way down that road. Systems such as Tesla's Autopilot have been keeping cars in lane on British roads for some years - and at speeds far higher than the 37mph envisaged in the new regulations. The danger is that calling this a ""self-driving"" feature will make motorists over confident. The road to full autonomy has plenty of technical and regulatory challenges - and the trickiest section of the journey is where drivers can begin to let the car take over but still need to stay alert. The government is keen to push the idea that the UK can be a leader in self-driving technology - but safety experts are urging caution about the pace at which the robots can be allowed to take the wheel.

"Demand high as cruises gear up for a restartCruises around England can resume in May, and operator Fred Olsen says it's already sold two thirds of its capacity.","Cathy Rogers is booked for a cruise in May Cruise enthusiast Cathy Rogers doesn't know how many trips she's been on - she stopped counting when it passed 30. From 17 May cruises will be allowed to resume from England under step three of the roadmap out of lockdown and demand is high. Cathy, who runs a Facebook group for enthusiasts, has already booked up and has no qualms. ""I really would feel much safer on board a ship than even in my local supermarket,"" she says. ""There's always higher levels of hygiene than you would get in a normal restaurant or a pub. I'm really looking forward to seeing how they make things as normal as possible for us on board."" Just outside Edinburgh three Fred Olsen cruise ships are being readied for service in anticipation of a rush in demand. After 14 months of standstill, the paint is being retouched, the chairs re-upholstered and the carpets relaid, ready to set sail this summer. Fred Olsen says it has already sold two thirds of tickets for British cruises. They were only launched a few weeks ago. Its hotel operations director, Thomas Rennesland, tells the BBC he has never been busier, but also that the last year has been stressful. ""Unfortunately we had to say goodbye to some really fantastic colleagues as the ships were not moving. Then of course we had to start planning the re-entry into service. No one has ever done anything like this before."" When cruising does restart it will be phased, starting with scenic tours around the UK stopping and starting at the same port, or so called trips to nowhere out to sea. The first ships could set sail from 17 May from England, but the industry hopes that the other UK nations will follow too. What are the rules for holidays? P&O Cruises says travellers will need vaccinations Over-50s rush to book holidays due to vaccine Some operators, like Virgin Voyages, are seeing it as a chance to introduce cruising to a new customer, with 3 or 4-day trips as an alternative to a staycation. Along with testing and cleaning protocols, they are requiring all passengers and crew to be fully vaccinated before they travel onboard. ""I don't know where else you can travel, where else you can go to a restaurant that has this level of protocols in place,"" says Tom McAlpin, boss of Virgin Voyages. ""I think you rebuild trust by creating these protocols so that people feel safe. It's the right thing for us to do to make people feel comfortable."" At the beginning of the pandemic, there were several stories of outbreaks on different international cruise liners. Bob Sanguinetti, boss of the UK Chamber of Shipping, says the industry, like the rest of society, has learned lots of lessons since then. There are now protocols for UK operators that mean all cruise passengers will need to take a test before they embark, as well as guidelines on social distancing, bubbles and how to monitor passengers' health. ""I don't think it will be difficult to persuade passengers back on board,"" says Mr Sanguinetti. ""Cruise companies are doing their utmost to ensure that risk is kept to an absolute minimum."" Chris and Wendy Hignell Chris and Wendy Hignell are booked to travel from Southampton to Liverpool in May. They don't mind that this time it will be closer to home. ""The fact we can't get off is not a problem, just to be able to enjoy the ship itself is the thing,"" says Wendy. They feel reassured by the safety measures too. ""The numbers are greatly reduced so that's a big bonus. Everyone's being tested, there's masks, there's social distancing,"" says Chris. ""It makes us think it's worth having a go and feeling safe whilst we do it."" Still the industry - which has been on pause for more than a year - has work to do to regain lost ground. ""The pandemic has had a massive impact on the industry, not just cruise companies, but tour operators, ports and other destinations where they visit,"" says Mr Sanguinetti. ""The UK cruise sector contributes about Â£10bn to the UK economy every year and supports over 80,000 jobs. A lot of those will have gone.""

Biden to pitch historic spending plans to Congress,"President Biden will try to build support for two massive spending packages US President Joe Biden is expected to call for free pre-school and community college in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Speaking on the eve of his 100th day in office, the Democrat will call for the most sweeping revamp of US social benefits since the 1960s. His plan includes $4tn (Â£2.9tn) of spending on education and family leave. History will also be made as two women sit behind the president for the first time during a speech to Congress. US Vice-President Kamala Harris and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi will both wear masks at the rostrum during Wednesday night's primetime address. The biggest obstacle to Biden getting his way The US president's State of the Union-style remarks will be followed by the traditional rebuttal speech from the opposing party - delivered on this occasion by Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. Mr Scott, a potential 2024 White House contender who is African American, is a leading voice in his party on race. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Biden will speak at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST on Thursday) from a US Capitol that is still ringed by security fencing and guarded by hundreds of National Guard troops following the storming of the complex on 6 January by pro-Trump protesters. Ahead of his speech, he will meet congressional staff who were trapped in the building during the riot, the White House said. Around 1,600 guests usually attend a president's address to a joint session of Congress. But this time only about 200 people will get invitations because of virus-prevention protocols. Buoyed by solid approval ratings, Mr Biden will look to the tens of millions of Americans that the White House hopes will tune in from home. The president will seek to build public support for two massive packages - theÂ American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan - which analysts project would entail the most far-reaching reform of the US social safety net since the 1960s. The White House says both proposals if passed by Congress would be ""fully paid for"" by tax hikes on the richest Americans and corporations. Security remains tight around the US Capitol The American Families Plan, with a price tag of $1.8tn, aims to provide free pre-school for US children aged three to four, paid family leave and free community college, the White House said on Tuesday. It would also extend until 2025 a child tax credit that was expanded during the pandemic, offering monthly payments to lower-income parents of around $300 per child. Democrats reportedly hope to establish these payments as a permanent government programme. The White House has indicated the package would be funded by almost doubling the capital gains tax rate on incomes above $1 million to 39.6% and hiking the top income tax bracket for households earning more than $400,000 to the same level. Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan Reports of Biden plans for an increase in capital gains taxes sparked a stock market sell-off last week. We thought that Joe Biden - all 78 years of him - would be a transitional president. He would be there to lower the political temperature; try to heal a divided nation. Take the absurd politics out of the response to Covid. Improve vaccine roll-out. Drain the poison from the body politic. But that aside, not do too much. He appointed a largely technocratic cabinet, presumably to perform managerial functions. Maybe make the trains run on time a bit better, but not change all the rolling stock, let alone alter the gauge of the railway. A fitting ambition for Amtrak Joe. But maybe we've got that all wrong. Is it possible that far from being transitional, he's transformational? What we all got wrong about Biden The president will also pitch his $2.3tn American Jobs Plan, which the White House unveiled last month. Billed as an infrastructure package, it seeks to invest in public transit, rail, airports, water pipes, high-speed broadband, roads and bridges, veterans' hospitals, childcare centres and combating racial disparities. The proposal also seeks to steer the US economy towards electric cars - which today make up barely 2% of vehicles of America's roads - and clean energy. This video can not be played All the times the US spent big on infrastructure It would be paid for by raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and other taxes on multinational corporations, says the White House. During his speech, Mr Biden is also expected to address cultural flashpoints such as police reform, gun violence and the crisis at the US-Mexico border. Last month he signed the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package that included direct cheques to most Americans. Senator Scott has been a leading voice in his party on race and has talked about times he has been racially profiled by police. He has hinted that his rebuttal speech will not just be about ripping into the president's agenda. ""We face serious challenges on multiple fronts, but I am as confident as I have ever been in the promise and potential of America. ""I look forward to having an honest conversation with the American people and sharing Republicans' optimistic vision for expanding opportunity and empowering working families."" But among his colleagues in Congress there has been widespread opposition to the Biden agenda. The US president's party narrowly controls the House and Senate for the first time in a decade, enabling Democrats to pass that relief bill without a single congressional vote from Republicans. Top Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday: ""President Biden ran as a moderate, but I'm hard pressed to think of anything at all that he's done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation."" In addition to three packages totalling around $6tn, Mr Biden last week also unveiled plans for a $1.5tn federal budget that would significantly expand spending on domestic programmes.

Double trophy will let Brits winners share glory,"If they win, who will Arlo Parks, The Weeknd and Billie Eilish choose to give their mini Brit to? Remember all those awards speeches where an emotional winner said they wanted to share their prize with someone important? Well, pop stars at next month's Brits really can do so. This year's trophy has been revealed - and it comes with a special, second statuette, which recipients can give to someone else as an ""act of kindness"". Artists Es Devlin and Yinka Ilori said lockdown had inspired their design. An audience of 4,000 will watch the 11 May ceremony at London's O2 Arena. Attendees won't need to wear face coverings or be socially distanced - but will need a negative coronavirus test as part of the government's live events pilot scheme. Most of the tickets will go to key workers from London - alongside nominees and the representatives of the music industry. They will witness performances from Dua Lipa, Olivia Rodgrigo, Griff, Arlo Parks and Headie One in one of the biggest UK indoor events since the start of the first nationwide lockdown last March. Brit Awards to be part of Covid event trials Celeste and Dua Lipa among Brit Award frontrunners Brits 2021: Full list of nominees This year's nominees include Parks, for breakthrough artist, The Weeknd, for international male solo artist, and Billie Eilish, for international female solo artist. Run the Jewels face HAIM, Foo Fighters Fontaines D.C. and BTS in the international group category. The design features one larger, multicoloured trophy, as well as a smaller metallic version Artists and designers including Tracey Emin, Dame Vivienne Westwood, Sir David Adjaye and Sir Anish Kapoor have all designed Brit Awards trophies - which now change each year. Devlin said she wanted winners to give their second trophy ""to someone they consider worthy - it might be recognition - or it might be someone that does something entirely unrelated to music"". Ilori said he wanted to capture ""the experience of lockdown, where your neighbour you've lived beside for six years and never say hello to suddenly gave you flowers, foods, acts of kindness"". ""I would describe it as two artists from different disciplines, different inspirations, coming together to design a trophy based around the idea of giving something back,"" he added.

Residents seek help over flats' fire safety costs,"Zoe Griffiths said she and other flat owners were ""being accountable for the remediation work out of our own pockets"" People living in flats with extensive fire safety defects are calling on politicians to commit to helping them pay huge remediation costs. About 50 private residential blocks more than 18m high have combustible cladding and other defects in Wales. Despite work by some developers, some leaseholders still face spiralling costs to pay for the work. Ahead of May's Senedd election, parties are promising plans to improve the situation for leaseholders. Many thousands of flat owners around the UK face huge bills for fire-safety improvements, brought in after2017's Grenfell Tower firewhen flames spread via combustible cladding, killing 72 people. Zoe Griffiths lives at South Quay near Swansea's marina. The majority of the development was built by Carillion, which went bust in 2018. Significant fire safety issues have been identified which affects more than 160 units, including combustible cladding and compartmentation defects. The building's NHBC warranty has expired, which leaves homeowners to pick up the bill of the remediation work. About 160 flats have been affected at South Quay ""We are left being accountable for the remediation work out of our own pockets,"" said Ms Griffiths. ""The insurance costs from 2020-21 have increased by 371%, our service charges have increased by 167%. ""We're left footing the bill for our cladding - in real terms what that means is we are paying for Â£335,000 out of our own pockets to meet the new fire regulations."" She said millions of pounds had been pledged last year by the Welsh government but ""we haven't seen any of it in the private sector"". ""They're very future-focused, but we're seeing no action being present based,"" said Ms Griffiths. ""We'd like to see the next Welsh government come forward and be supportive of the health and wellbeing, and the safety of all their people and the leaseholders, and put as a priority the spending of the money that should be allocated to the cladding."" 'Urgent clarification' over Â£3.5bn cladding cash Student flats to lose cladding after Grenfell fire Earlier this year, the Labour Welsh government explained that money given to Wales from Westminster through theBarnett formulain 2020 had been put into the effort to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. In February it saidÂ£32m would be committedto address fire safety defects during the 2021-22 financial year. In England, disagreement continues between the government, opposition parties and members of the House of Lordsover who should pay for fire safety work there. Building insurance has ""skyrocketed"" at Cardiff's Victoria Wharf development, says Cerys Owen Residents at the Victoria Wharf development in Cardiff Bay claim not to have seen any of that money, despite ongoing problems. Following an ""intrusive survey"" in 2019, the blocks of flats were found to have missing firebreaks and problems with compartmentation, which is when measures are put in place during construction to ensure a fire in one flat is not able to spread. Resident Cerys Owen, who set up Wales Leaseholder Action Group, said the majority of internal remediation work had been undertaken by the developer, Taylor Wimpey, but external cladding problems remained. Interim measures such as new fire alarms and a waking watch - people who continually patrol all floors ready to wake up residents if there was a fire - have been paid for by the leaseholders. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Â£3.5bn for unsafe cladding 'too little, too late' Ms Owen said the building's insurance had ""skyrocketed as a result of the problems, up from Â£65,000 for the development to Â£629,000 this year"". ""Per leaseholder that's just over Â£1,000. So far, I've personally had to pay out around Â£3,000,"" she said. ""The estimate to fix everything else in the development is around Â£28m and that translates to about Â£60,000 per leaseholder. ""The interim measures in themselves are enough to bankrupt people and put them in a really difficult position so it's not feasible at all that we can pay that Â£60,000 bill if it lands on our doorstep."" New fire alarms and a waking watch have been paid for by the leaseholders at Cardiff's Victoria Wharf development Ahead of the Senedd election, Ms Owen said: ""The lack of support from Welsh government to date has been really tough for us to accept. ""It's understandable that Covid has been a huge issue for us all. ""But what we hope to see now, and what we hope to see with whoever is voted in after the election, is a Welsh government willing to step up and support us, willing to work with us on any solutions going forward, and fundamentally put the money they have received in place and use it for its intended purpose - to protect us, to help us with all these costs for the fire safety issues which we're facing. ""You know, we've heard from them many times [that] it's unfair we're in this situation and that leaseholders shouldn't pay. ""But we need to see action from whoever is voted in because it's not enough any more to say leaseholders shouldn't pay because we are paying now, so we need to see that support immediately."" If re-elected on 6 May, Welsh Labour said it would create ""a fire safety fund for existing buildings"". A spokesman said the party was ""committed to the very highest standards of building safety in Wales"", and it was proposing a new fire safety regime ""to move Wales forward with improved safety of high rise and other buildings, including new duty holder roles, a new process for identifying risk and changes to regulation so that we improve the way we design, build, manage and live in buildings across Wales"". The Welsh Conservatives have criticised the current Welsh government, saying it had ""failed to spend monies provided by the UK government to specifically tackle the problem of fire safety in apartment blocks"". The party said if elected it would ""establish a fire safety fund to compensate leaseholders for fire safety works and the scourge of tackling unsafe cladding, guaranteeing any Barnett consequentials from the UK government to the fund"". Plaid Cymru said it would ""seek the powers to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of large developers, and use the proceeds to solve the problems created by poor builds"". ""This will improve safety and avoid owners being trapped into poor quality flats and houses with no recourse, which has been the case with the cladding scandal. We will also improve consumer protection for poor quality in new builds."" The Welsh Liberal Democrats said: ""Many people living in high-rise properties across Wales do not feel confident that their property is safe and are worried about potential fire risks. ""It's high time the Welsh government acted to make these homes safe."" Propel, which has campaigned in support of leaseholders facing rising remediation costs, said it would introduce a Housing Justice Act which would include an annual service charge cap for leaseholders, linked to the Consumer Price Index, and it would ""stipulate not to grant building contracts to existing developers until they have rectified dangerous fire cladding in previous developments"". It said: ""No other party has made this commitment. Propel will not abandon leaseholders living in dangerous flats."" Other parties standing for election, including Reform, have also backed calls to alleviate leaseholders of the financial burden to carry out remediation work.

Life after Covid - how will Wales look in 2026?,"Since the start of the pandemic many of us have been working more flexibly, caring for others and shopping differently. We don't know what ""normal life"" will be like in the future but - with just a week left of campaigning for the Senedd elections - I've been asking politicians from the four main parties what they think it will be like to live and work in Wales in five years' time. Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price says he wants to reverse the trend of past decades when manufacturing firms left Wales to set up in places like China - where wages are lower - leaving jobs axed in Wales. ""Instead of spending money writing large cheques to luxury brands coming in for a short number of years to set up factories,"" he says, during our conversation in the town of Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent. ""We should be using that money to back Welsh businesses, Welsh entrepreneurs and innovators who have ideas and start their businesses in communities like this in the valleys."" But the harsh reality for Mr Price is there are many cases of Welsh firms growing and then selling themselves to large UK or international firms. A lot fewer grow and stay Welsh-owned - and if the ownership moves outside of Wales, so do the profits. Mr Price promises to help firms stay in Welsh hands as they grow. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage The pandemic has been a time for businesses to ""take stock"", according to Russell George of the Welsh Conservatives. ""We need to capture that entrepreneurial spirit and support those businesses to grow - small to medium, medium to large,"" he says. To do that, he proposes setting up an arms-length government body called Innovate Wales. This isn't an original idea - in the 1980s and 1990s the Welsh Development Agency was that sort of organisation. Mr George, talking to me outside the Heart of Wales business park in Llandrindod Wells, Powys, wants that body to give every business in Wales an ""account manager"" to help it grow. With about 250,000 companies in Wales, that's a vast task - a job creator in itself. Mark Drakeford says jobs ""rooted in local communities"" needed protection to avoid being moved abroad ""There will be jobs rooted in the local communities where people live,"" says Welsh Labour's Mark Drakeford, talking to me at Barry Island. ""Jobs that can't be moved overseas - jobs that perhaps we haven't valued that we should have in the past."" He adds there will also be jobs that use Wales' natural resources, and predicts an energy revolution where homes generate as much energy as they use. He also believes there should be support for highly-skilled sectors where Wales is already successful, like cyber security. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, plan to invest in making our houses warmer and cheaper to run, which they say would help smaller firms grow. WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Senedd have?MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. ""If you retrofit a home, it's cheaper to heat, financially better to sell or rent, it contributes to combating climate emergency and you're training to be able to do that,"" says leader Jane Dodds. She says that would benefit small firms to self-employed contractors. Manufacturers would benefit too, she says, as they would make the products needed. The Lib Dems are bringing back a well-worn phrase: ""Brand Wales."" Its message, says Ms Dodds, is that ""we are new Wales and we want people to come here to work with us and for us"". But why would they come here? ""Creating opportunities, development grants, good deals to make sure we get specialist skills and specialist companies,"" she says. Just as I'm starting to feel like we're going back to the '90s, Ms Dodds tells me she doesn't want to be going back to the days of the Welsh Development Agency - instead she wants to see smaller organisations. Before Covid shook up the way we work and live, many thousands of people commuted to offices and call centres miles from where they live. That was a difficult juggle for people caring for children or older relatives. ""If we've learnt one thing from the pandemic, we no longer need people travelling every day to an office location,"" says Mr Drakeford. ""We can work equally successfully closer to home - and at home."" His party would also develop hubs where people from all sorts of employers could work nearer their homes. Is that just useful for professionals in offices? Not according to Mr Drakeford, who says call centres have also shown their teams can work well remotely. Plaid's Adam Price says hubs - where people from different companies work together - could be based near Metro stops Plaid Cymru also wants to develop hubs and Mr Price suggests these could be based near stops on the new Metro. ""Most of us in Wales don't live in cities - we live in towns and villages and valleys and we need to have our economic and transport policies reflecting that,"" he says. The Lib Dems also want these hubs, adding they could help counteract loneliness and mental health issues from isolation, which have been a big issue during the pandemic. With investments in the M4, A55 and A40 a Conservative priority, does the party expect as many of us to commute to work as before the pandemic? Mr George says not. ""You won't just see people going to work, there's haulage moving from one place to another,"" he says. He adds people will still probably have to go into their place of work for a couple of days a week, even with a shift to more home working and ""you're still going to have huge amounts of traffic on the M4"". Russell George said he still expected there to be ""huge amounts"" of traffic on the M4 Mr George believes flexible working benefits businesses ""because you get the best out of workers"". He argues, if employers make it possible for parents to work from home and pick children up from school, for example, a wider number of people will want to work for them. Businesses, he says, ""will continue to think differently about how they can operate differently to get a bigger pool of skills"". Ms Dodds wants the change in working hours to be open to everybody. ""There used to be a massive begging - from mainly women - for condensed working hours, for example, but the whole thing has changed,"" she says. ""But it has to be fair"". Welsh Labour sees high streets as places where people will work, live and be entertained. ""I don't think the future of the high street is trying to recreate what was there in the past,"" says Mr Drakeford. He says centres of towns need a ""vitality that lives beyond the working day"". But hasn't the pandemic highlighted how people cherish more space in their homes - and a garden? He says people want different things at different times in their lives, such as being close to services or entertainment. Mr Drakeford vows to put new jobs from the public sector on high streets, getting ""more people living in the centre of our towns, a mixed approach"". Mr Price, meanwhile, still sees businesses as the heart of high streets - but not large business chains. He talks of a wave of investment involving ""bright people from Wales who have ideas about independent businesses that could transform high streets"". But traditionally Wales has had a relatively low proportion of entrepreneurs. Mr Price says Wales needs a ""business revolution with enterprise and innovation at the core at every level"". He does not need reminding, however, that over the years there have been many programmes to develop an ""entrepreneurial spirit"" in Wales. Lib Dem Jane Dodds says independent shops needed to continue being supported by politicians The Welsh Conservatives aren't suggesting a revolution - instead they would bring in free parking and scrap business rates for small firms. Mr George says people need to realise ""our high streets are changing"". ""What we've seen in Wales is that people are willing to shop more local and again we have to retain that,"" he says. Small businesses have adapted well in the pandemic, says Mr George, because they are more agile and change more easily, developing websites and offering click and collect. So, are ideas like free parking and lower overheads enough to breathe life into struggling town centres? Ms Dodds - standing in Abergavenny's town centre - says some independent shops selling essentials like ""our butchers and small delis"" have done well during the pandemic and need to continue being supported. She has another vision of the future - the ""15-minute city"" - where, she says, we can ""guarantee somebody has the bank, the post office and essential shops within a 15-minute walk of where they are"".

Demand high as cruises gear up for a restart,"Cathy Rogers is booked for a cruise in May Cruise enthusiast Cathy Rogers doesn't know how many trips she's been on - she stopped counting when it passed 30. From 17 May cruises will be allowed to resume from England under step three of the roadmap out of lockdown and demand is high. Cathy, who runs a Facebook group for enthusiasts, has already booked up and has no qualms. ""I really would feel much safer on board a ship than even in my local supermarket,"" she says. ""There's always higher levels of hygiene than you would get in a normal restaurant or a pub. I'm really looking forward to seeing how they make things as normal as possible for us on board."" Just outside Edinburgh three Fred Olsen cruise ships are being readied for service in anticipation of a rush in demand. After 14 months of standstill, the paint is being retouched, the chairs re-upholstered and the carpets relaid, ready to set sail this summer. Fred Olsen says it has already sold two thirds of tickets for British cruises. They were only launched a few weeks ago. Its hotel operations director, Thomas Rennesland, tells the BBC he has never been busier, but also that the last year has been stressful. ""Unfortunately we had to say goodbye to some really fantastic colleagues as the ships were not moving. Then of course we had to start planning the re-entry into service. No one has ever done anything like this before."" When cruising does restart it will be phased, starting with scenic tours around the UK stopping and starting at the same port, or so called trips to nowhere out to sea. The first ships could set sail from 17 May from England, but the industry hopes that the other UK nations will follow too. What are the rules for holidays? P&O Cruises says travellers will need vaccinations Over-50s rush to book holidays due to vaccine Some operators, like Virgin Voyages, are seeing it as a chance to introduce cruising to a new customer, with 3 or 4-day trips as an alternative to a staycation. Along with testing and cleaning protocols, they are requiring all passengers and crew to be fully vaccinated before they travel onboard. ""I don't know where else you can travel, where else you can go to a restaurant that has this level of protocols in place,"" says Tom McAlpin, boss of Virgin Voyages. ""I think you rebuild trust by creating these protocols so that people feel safe. It's the right thing for us to do to make people feel comfortable."" At the beginning of the pandemic, there were several stories of outbreaks on different international cruise liners. Bob Sanguinetti, boss of the UK Chamber of Shipping, says the industry, like the rest of society, has learned lots of lessons since then. There are now protocols for UK operators that mean all cruise passengers will need to take a test before they embark, as well as guidelines on social distancing, bubbles and how to monitor passengers' health. ""I don't think it will be difficult to persuade passengers back on board,"" says Mr Sanguinetti. ""Cruise companies are doing their utmost to ensure that risk is kept to an absolute minimum."" Chris and Wendy Hignell Chris and Wendy Hignell are booked to travel from Southampton to Liverpool in May. They don't mind that this time it will be closer to home. ""The fact we can't get off is not a problem, just to be able to enjoy the ship itself is the thing,"" says Wendy. They feel reassured by the safety measures too. ""The numbers are greatly reduced so that's a big bonus. Everyone's being tested, there's masks, there's social distancing,"" says Chris. ""It makes us think it's worth having a go and feeling safe whilst we do it."" Still the industry - which has been on pause for more than a year - has work to do to regain lost ground. ""The pandemic has had a massive impact on the industry, not just cruise companies, but tour operators, ports and other destinations where they visit,"" says Mr Sanguinetti. ""The UK cruise sector contributes about Â£10bn to the UK economy every year and supports over 80,000 jobs. A lot of those will have gone.""

Business leaders set out plan for Covid recovery,"A commission of 10 of the UK's most powerful executives from firms including Tesco, Vodafone and Astra Zeneca has set out its plan for a post-pandemic economic recovery. It hopes the biggest crisis in over 300 years will reset the relationship between business and government to boost growth and living standards. It also wants more done to support UK suppliers and fight social inequality. Tesco chair John Allan said it went beyond ""purely economic measures"". He told the BBC: ""The pandemic has ensured that those who were worst off to start with have suffered more than those who were relatively well off, so that gap between the comfortably off and the less comfortably off has grown."" Deprived communities exist across the UK, he said. ""They're not just in the north, the Midlands, there are an awful lot of socially deprived communities in London, for example, as well. ""And the view of the business people who've got together for the infrastructure commission was we needed to solve not only for growth but also to try and ensure that at least some of that growth was used to remedy this widening social inequality we're experiencing."" The Covid Recovery Commission calls for the creation of at least one new globally competitive industry hub in every part of the UK by 2030. It also wants to see a radical overhaul of the Apprenticeship Levy with the establishment of Â£10,000 lifelong training allowance for all over-25s and a detailed plan for the decarbonisation of homes over the next 15 years. The relationship between business and government was tested during the Brexit years. Both sides are keen to move on from the prime minister's memorable four letter dismissal of business concerns over splitting from the UK's biggest trade partner.

Mr Allan said: ""I don't think anybody should hold any remarks about business in the past against anyone concerned. ""I think government has changed, business has changed enormously. There's been this growth of the need for business to be purposeful, the need for stakeholder focus not just shareholder focus, so business is ready, I think government is ready. ""I think it's bipartisan. We've shared our conclusions with the shadow cabinet as well as with ministers and seen a lot of interest and support in it, so I think we're at a point in history where this could be made to happen."" Shopping trips set to fuel economic rebound Has the UK economy been hit harder than other countries? The truth is that the business community is still trying to figure out how this particular Conservative government sees the role of business. Over many decades Conservative Party orthodoxy has generally been to set tax levels as low as affordable to the public purse, regulation as light as sensible and let the job and wealth creators get on with it. The argument was that lower taxes would encourage more company formation, more taxable job creation and that would translate to healthy tax receipts and lower benefit bills. Business leaders generally welcomed this approach in the past. At the last budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled plans to reverse over a decade of tax-lowering measures at a stroke by increasing corporation tax to 25% in 2023, saying he needed to be honest with the challenges to the public finances. The Covid Recovery Commission report says the UK also needs to conduct an honest assessment of where its strengths and weaknesses lie, double down on strengths, and help workers migrate from sectors with a less promising future. However, the report does not detail which sectors fall into that category - a tacit admission of how politically difficult some of these ""honest"" conversations may prove. The government says that although it has officially abolished the idea and the label of a specific ""industrial strategy"" (a move privately lamented by the authors of this report) it remains committed to a new partnership with business to ""build back better"". It doesn't matter what you call it. A statement from the business department said: ""Our Plan for Growth will deliver significant public investment in the infrastructure, skills and innovation that businesses need to grow and thrive, and we will continue to build an enterprise economy that spreads opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.""

UK Indians send prayers and aid amid Covid surge,"Worshippers at a temple in Wembley prayed for India as it faces a deadly wave of infections Scenes of people in India begging for oxygen during the nation's record Covid surge have shocked and moved the world. And no-one has been more moved than the global Indian diaspora. So how are those in the UK responding to the crisis? In a Hindu temple in Wembley, north-west London, the small congregation is chanting a special prayer for people thousands of miles away. The Hanuman Chalisa is a devotional hymn believed to have immense power for helping those in need. But for many people in Britain's Indian communities, their minds are on very practical ways to help as well. 'We called 200 people to find a hospital bed' Patients suffer at home as Covid chokes hospitals A visual guide to the Covid crisis in India ""There isn't a member of the diaspora who hasn't been touched by the events going on in India,"" says Manoj Badale, chairman of the British Asian Trust. ""I have plenty of family in India, my sister's a doctor, my niece and nephews are doctors. We're hearing terrible stories. It's really astonishing how the challenge has exponentially increased over the last week."" The trust, run by British Asians to support development projects, is focusing its efforts on ""the single most clear and present danger"" to people in India: lack of oxygen. The Prince of Wales has endorsed the trust's emergency appeal, saying those suffering in India were in his thoughts and prayers. He said Indian aid and ingenuity had been a support to other countries through the pandemic. ""As India has helped others, so now must we help India,"" he said. The prince has made a personal donation to the trust's Oxygen for India campaign. Many people in the British Indian community are raising funds for oxygen equipment The appeal has already raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to buy oxygen concentrators - devices that can provide the enriched gas straight from the air, to treat patients when hospital supplies are under strain. The trust is not alone: another independent Gofundme campaign run by British Indians blew past its initial goal of Â£160,000 - enough to buy 200 oxygen concentrators - in just one day. Its total now stands at more than Â£300,000. Manoj Badale described India's situation as ""really astonishing"" Mr Badale says the British Asian Trust has helped during crises in South Asia for 14 years, but this one seems different. ""It just feels so real - not just to British Asians, but to British people generally. Some of our biggest donations have been from Brits who've been watching the news,"" he says. Others in the UK's extensive Indian medical community have been finding other ways to help. On evenings and weekends in between working as a consultant cardiologist in Bristol, Amardeep Dastidar is on the phone to India offering telemedicine - remote - consultations and supporting overwhelmed colleagues thousands of miles away as they battle with Covid's biggest wave yet. Many British Indians are grieving the loss of family and unable to attend funerals, says temple chairman Naremdra Thakrar ""Any disease's second wave is always difficult, because the mental state is completely different compared with the first wave,"" he says. ""I was personally hit, my brother was infected, had to be hospitalised, was in ICU for seven days. It was a challenging time."" He has been offering support through relatives and friends in India, sharing expertise on treating Covid and translating it into local languages. ""Everyone is coming to the tipping point. I think everyone needs a bit of support,"" Dr Dastidar says. GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Bapio, the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, is working to extend the informal support offered by people like Dr Dastidar with an official programme of telemedicine to help medics in India cope with the colossal workload - alongside fundraising for oxygen equipment. Naremdra Thakrar, chairman of the Shri Vallabh Nidhi Temple in Wembley, says the British Indian community feels the crisis in India very strongly. ""All their relatives are there, some of them want to travel there, they can't see their relatives and some of them can't even attend the funerals,"" he says. People are very scared for loved ones in India, says priest Bhavik Pandya And so, as they fundraise and procure oxygen equipment, the congregation in Wembley prays. ""As a priest it's my duty to pray for the universe, to pray for the world. The whole world is our family and every place is our responsibility,"" says the temple's priest, Bhavik Pandya. The oxygen shortage means ""people are very scared"", he says. ""We are praying, please protect our motherland.""

"1.5 million UK homes without internet, Ofcom finds","About 1.5 million homes in the UK still do not have internet access, a report by Ofcom has found. The regulator has released its annual snapshot of online and media habits in the UK, which this year spans all three lockdowns. It found 20% of children did not always have access to a device for online learning while schools were closed. Ofcom said in total 6% of the homes had no internet access at all, at the time the study was carried out last month. There were also 1% of adults aged over 18 who had internet access but chose not to use it. Those without access were most likely to be either people aged over 65, or households with low incomes or financial vulnerability. Among children, tablets were the most popular device for five to 15-year-olds in 2020, although 91% of 12 to 15-year-olds had their own smartphones. It was also found that 48% of three to four-year-old pre-schoolers had their own tablets. Just over half of 12 to 15-year-olds said they had had a negative experience online in the past year, with the most common being someone they didn't know trying to befriend them. Six out of 10 five to 15-year-olds said they made their own videos online and nearly half said they watched content on TikTok. ""We have seen a big rise in the use of TikTok during last year particularly among girls,"" said Yih-Choung Teh, strategy and research group director at Ofcom. ""The perception among adults is that it's focused on younger people but adults have increasingly taken up TikTok as well."" According to Ofcom, 21% of its adult social media users had TikTok profiles, although Facebook was the most popular overall with 83% of the adults in the study having a presence on the platform. Gaming also became increasingly popular during lockdown, with 62% of adults and seven out of 10 five to 15-year-olds playing online games. The campaign group Which? said it was very concerned about those who were getting left behind. ""It is vital that more is done to address this digital divide and ensure all consumers are able to access broadband connectivity, particularly as new networks roll out across the UK,"" said Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, whose Alliance for Full Employment has released its own report on the digital divide, called for a national digital plan from the government and Ofcom. ""We have a generation that has lost out for more than a year on the education that they need, and will lose out when it comes to workforce qualifications, job prospects, and then income,"" he told the BBC. ""So we've got to heal this digital divide. And I think the government's got to act pretty quickly."" Good news - the year of the pandemic has seen a big fall in the number of homes without any internet connection as the need for services only available online has become more acute. Bad news - those who are still living without the internet find themselves even more disadvantaged than before. And that applies particularly to children. While hardly any now live in homes without any internet connection, a substantial minority had either poor and expensive connections via mobile phones or devices that were inappropriate for online schooling. This digital divide became a hot political issue during lockdown and there will be continued pressure on the government to make sure children have the digital tools they need. But this report also shows that children are providing a forecast of where our media habits are heading. It's a future dominated by video-on-demand and video sharing services such as YouTube and TikTok, with plenty of them creating content rather than being just passive consumers. However, broadcast TV was less and less of a habit - even in lockdown, it seems, fewer families were gathering on the sofa for a big TV moment. But while there are concerns about the dangers in this era of ultra connectivity - half of 12 to 15-year-olds had had a negative online experience such as being contacted by a stranger - there are also signs that this generation is pretty clued up about how the online world works. They were not far behind adults in recognising which results in Google searches were ads, and probably more savvy in realising that when an Instagram influencer plugs a product they are being paid for that.

Wimbledon to scrap middle Sunday break,"Novak Djokovic is the defending Wimbledon men's singles champion Wimbledon will stage matches on its traditional rest day on the middle Sunday of the tournament from 2022. The Grand Slam will instead be played over 14 consecutive days, with All England Lawn Tennis Club chairman Ian Hewitt saying this was possible because of better grass-court maintenance. Organisers also revealed they are hoping to have fans at a minimum of 25% capacity this year. Ticket prices will stay at 2020 levels, with prize money yet to be decided. ""We plan to deliver the best Championships possible in accordance with public safety. It will necessarily be different from Wimbledon as we know it,"" Hewitt said. Fans will make huge difference at Wimbledon - Murray Wimbledon is the only one of the four Grand Slams where there is no play on the middle Sunday. The rest day has meant that the Monday of the second week has always been very busy with all the men's and women's last-16 matches being held on the same day. There has been play four times on the Sunday because of rain disruptions during the week, with the tournament opening its doors in 1991, 1997, 2004 and 2016 and enjoying a carnival-like atmosphere that is different to the other days. All England Lawn Tennis Club chief executive Sally Bolton said Wimbledon wanted to find ways of preserving some of that atmosphere and was carrying out a public consultation to see what fans would like to see. ""Over time Wimbledon has continuously evolved to meet changing demands and behaviours of our fans - always changing, always staying the same is something we talk about often,"" Bolton said. ""We want more of this wonderful event to be available to more people around the world to share in the joy of the Championships. ""Including Middle Sunday permanently in our schedule will allow us to do just that and become a new tradition which we hope we can become immensely proud of. ""It enables us to do more with the second Monday, which is known as 'manic' for good reason."" The last-16 matches will be spread across the Sunday and Monday, with Bolton saying it would give players more of a platform for quality matches and offer fans a better chance to watch more of the action. Wimbledon was cancelled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic and while it will return on 28 June, there are still several aspects to be finalised. Bolton said they were waiting for government guidance based on research it is carrying out at the moment on the return of fans to stadiums before making decisions on capacity. Much will also ride on the government's roadmap for easing lockdown in England, which states all legal limits on social contact will be removed no earlier than 21 June. ""We very much hope that the 25% will be a minimum position that we can build from,"" she said, adding that a decision on ticket distribution would therefore be left ""as late as possible"". Uncertainty over attendances means organisers will not decide on prize money amounts until June. Plans for Henman Hill - where fans without showcourt tickets can sit on the grass to watch the action on a big screen outside Court One - are still being formulated, but Bolton said it could be possible to open it with social distancing still in place. Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam to be cancelled last year and the All England Club received a total of Â£180m from the pandemic insurance it took out. The annual surplus paid to the LTA - British tennis' governing body - fell as expected, but remained at a healthy Â£35.9m. Among the other changes to this year's tournament is that players will be unable to rent private housing and will have to stay in a hotel. The rule applies even to British players who live nearby, including Andy Murray. ""The minimised risk environment we created for the players is a requirement from the government to bring athletes without them going into quarantine upon entry into the UK,"" Bolton said. ""Players enjoy private housing and we hope to bring it back next year but it's just not possible this year."" Unlike at some recent Grand Slams where there were electronic line calls, there will still be line judges at Wimbledon this year but the shot clock - which ensures players serve within 25 seconds - will be used for the first time. All events will take place as usual, with the exception of the invitational (legends') events. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller All eyes are now on the series of test events currently taking place in the UK with fans in attendance. There seems little prospect of capacity crowds at Wimbledon this year, but genuine hope that the capacity will rise above 25%. Manic Monday will be missed, in the way we have missed the excitement of 10 Premier League games all kicking off at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. But we will at least be able to savour each last-16 match a little more. All the players will have to stay in official hotels and will be limited to an entourage of three.

PM's flat funding to be reviewed,"Boris Johnson lives in Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds The UK's top civil servant says Boris Johnson has asked him to review how the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat was paid for. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case was responding to MPs' questions about how the work was funded. The row escalated after Mr Johnson's ex-adviser Dominic Cummings claimed the PM once planned to have donors ""secretly pay"" for the revamp. The PM has said any relevant donations will be declared ""in due course"". Labour has called on the Electoral Commission, which regulates political donations in the UK, to launch a formal investigation. The watchdog has said it is talking to the Conservative Party about whether the spending on the flat falls within its remit. PM's flat refurbishment: What is the row about? Johnson's 'bodies pile high' comments prompt criticism Five questions for the PM and why the answers matter Appearing before a Commons committeeon Monday, Mr Case said a review into the refurbishment would look at ""how this has been done"". Asked repeatedly whether he was aware if private donations covered any of the costs, he said he had ""not been involved directly in this"". ""I do not have all of the facts and details at my disposal,"" he said, adding that his review would probably take ""a matter of weeks"". Another day, another denial.  Another 24 hours when rather than making their arguments, the government is embroiled in arguments about the past. Whether it's the prime minister's alleged frustrations about lockdown, attacks from his former adviser Dominic Cummings, or the mystery over his expensive flat renovation, as one senior Tory put it, it matters, because it all relates to Boris Johnson's judgement. Many Conservatives have been confident however that the prime minister's reputation, his enjoyment for pushing convention, is something that many voters are even attracted to. But there's a risk that confidence could turn to complacency. There is a belief in the Labour Party that the unhappy mess is starting to be noticed by voters. And no one knows when, or what might next emerge. One cabinet minister told me ""there's nothing we can do to control it."" The claims about the flat are contained in a blog posted by Mr Cummings on Friday, his first since leaving his role in No 10. In the blog, Mr Cummingsalso deniedhe was behind the leaking of details of November's second coronavirus lockdown in England. Mr Case told MPs that an internal inquiry into that leak was ongoing, but it was ""probable"" officials working on it would fail to identify any sources. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has denied reports he said he would rather ""let the bodies pile high in their thousands"" than order a third lockdown. TheDaily Mail reported,externalthe prime minister made the remarks during heated conversations within government in the autumn over lockdown restrictions. Sources familiar with the conversationhave told the BBCMr Johnson suggested he would rather see ""bodies pile high"" during the discussions. This video can not be played Simon Case was asked whether private donations funded work at the flat Like several of his recent predecessors, the PM is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, which is larger than the one above No 10. Speaking earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the prime minister had paid for the revamp ""from his own money"" . He said this came ""on top of"" public money from the annual Â£30,000 taxpayer grant available to all prime ministers for the upkeep of their accommodation. In awritten statement on Friday,external, the government said no money from this grant was spent in the 2019/20 financial year. Figures for this year are expected to be published in the summer. ""At all times the prime minister has complied with the rules. He's paid for it out of his own money, "" he said. Michelle Obama visited Samantha Cameron in the 11 Downing St flat back in 2011 Speaking to reporters on Monday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged a ""full and transparent investigation"" into the allegations about the Downing Street flat, arguing they risked undermining trust in government. ""It's all very well the prime minister saying now 'I paid for it', the critical question was: what was the original arrangement - and why is it so complicated?"" ""If there's a straightforward answer, well give it. And if there isn't, then there are very serious questions to be asked,"" he added. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."" Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission. The Conservative Party has previously said that all ""reportable donations"" are ""correctly declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them and comply fully with the law"". The party said ""gifts and benefits received in a ministerial capacity"" are declared in government transparency returns. Mr Case was also asked by MPs about the case of businessman Lex Greensill who was a part-time unpaid government adviser in David Cameron's government. The civil servant boss said that situation was not ""acceptable"" and that it ""looks like there were conflicts"". He added that he didn't think there was anything of that equivalent happening in the civil service now. The prime minister has already appointed the lawyer Nigel Boardman to hold a review into all the issues surrounding Greensill Capital. What is the David Cameron lobbying row about?

What are the political donation rules?,"The Electoral Commission has announced it will investigate the funding of Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat renovation, saying there are ""reasonable grounds to suspect an offence"". Mr Johnson says he covered the cost of the refurbishment himself and has ""conformed in full with the code of conduct"". Conflict of interest Prime ministers are allowed to spend Â£30,000 a year of public money to renovate their accommodation. The final bill for the latest refit is not known but there has been speculation that it could be as much as Â£200,000. The government has refused to say whether Mr Johnson received a loan from the Conservative Party to pay for the renovations that were above the annual allowance. If this was the case, Mr Johnson would need to demonstrate that the arrangement was consistent withthe ministerial code,external- a government document that sets out the ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office. The code makes clear there should be""no actual or perceived conflicts of interest"". Hannah White, from the Institute for Government think tank, says there could be ""a problem of perception"". ""There's no legal problem with the PM having taken a loan from a political party... it's more about whether there's a sense the prime minister might have a conflict if he wanted to reorganise the Conservative Party or sack the treasurer or something like that. ""He then has a financial obligation with the Conservative Party."" Watchdog to investigate PM's flat renovations What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat? Five questions for the PM Declarations There are numerous registers where political donations need to be declared, depending on who is sending and receiving the funds. Each one has its own rules about what needs to be declared and when. Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500must be reported to the Electoral Commission,external- the organisation which regulates political donations in the UK. This register is updated every three months. On 28 April, the Electoral Commission announced it would carry out an investigation about whether any funding should have been declared. In a statement, the commission said: ""We are now satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred"". A second register, tied to the ministerial code, requires ministers to declare any financial benefits received. The government is supposed to publish a list of ministers' financial interests twice a year. However,the last one was released in July 2020,external. The list is overseen by an independent adviser. However, the post was left vacant after Sir Alex Allan - the previous adviser on standards -resigned in Novemberin a row over a bullying inquiry involving Home Secretary Priti Patel. On 28 April thegovernment announced Lord Geidt as the new independent adviser,external. Shortly after the appointment Mr Johnson said he would seek advice from Lord Geidt on whether any further declarations were required. Separately, all MPs must declare - within 28 days - any donations which could influence their actions. This is known as theRegister of Members' Financial Interests,externaland is updated frequently. Alex Thomas - a former principal private secretary to then cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood - believes the prime minister would be required to make a disclosure: ""If you owe someone money in this context, I would say it should be declared on that register."" It depends exactly what the offensive is and which register it relates to. If a party breaks the rules about making declarations to the Electoral Commissiona range of sanctions are available,external- including fines of up to Â£20,000. Very serious offensives can also be referred to the police. If there is a breach of the ministerial code, it would normally be the prime minister who decides the sanction - such as sacking the minister responsible. However, given that Mr Johnson is at the centre of the row on this occasion and wrote the foreword to the code, that exposes an obvious gap that's not easily resolvable. The register of members' financial interests, on the other hand, is regulated by Parliament'sCommittee on Standards,external. The committee, which is chaired by an MP, can carry out investigations for possible rule breaches and impose sanctions. This includes forcing an MP to apologise or a suspension from Parliament. Mr Johnson has previously been in hot water with the standards committee. In 2018 - before he became prime minister - Mr Johnson made a ""full and unreserved"" apology to MPsfor failing to declare more than Â£52,000 in income. At the time, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone ruled that the breaches were ""neither inadvertent nor minor"". Thereport,externalnoted that there had been nine payments registered by Mr Johnson after the required 28-day deadline.
