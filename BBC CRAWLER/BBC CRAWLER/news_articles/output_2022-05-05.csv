Rose Ayling-Ellis to sign CBeebies Bedtime Story,"Actress and Strictly Come Dancing champion Rose Ayling-Ellis is to become the first celebrity to sign a CBeebies bedtime story this Sunday. Ayling-Ellis, 27, who has been deaf since birth, will tell the tale Can Bears Ski? in British Sign Language (BSL), to mark Deaf Awareness Week. The story of a young bear draws on the author's own experience to show how it feels to be deaf in a hearing world. Ayling-Ellis said she hoped it would inspire children to learn to sign. Can Bears Ski? was written by Raymond Antrobus and illustrated by Polly Dunbar, and follows the journey of a son and father as they discover and manage deafness. It will be the first ever BSL-signed story on CBeebies and it will see Ayling-Ellis only speaking twice throughout the entire programme. Once at the beginning to introduce the story, and at the end to wish the audience goodnight. The story will also have subtitles. Ayling-Ellis said: ""I am super excited to read my first CBeebies bedtime story in British Sign Language and it's even more wonderful to share a story written by a deaf writer. ""I hope deaf children enjoy the story and it inspires hearing children to want to learn BSL more."" Ayling-Ellis found fame starring as Frankie Lewis in BBC soap EastEnders and went on to become the first deaf contestant to win Strictly. She was also nominated for the Must See Moment of the Year at the 2022 Bafta Awards for her Couple's Choice dance routine with partner Giovanni Pernice, which included a section where the pair danced without music to honour of the deaf community. While competing in Strictly, Ayling-Ellis performed a touching routine with partner Giovanni Pernice during which they paused the music and danced in silence The actress has actively campaigned for BSL to be recognised as an official language and to be given legal status in the UK. Her story will air on Sunday to mark the end of Deaf Awareness Week, and will be the first of two stories she has recorded for CBeebies. Other readers of the CBeebies Bedtime Story have included Dolly Parton, Tom Hardy and Ed Sheeran - whoread a story about a boy with a stutter, as he did as a child. In 2018, Catastrophe actor Rob Delaney became the first personto tell a CBeebies Bedtime Story in Makaton- which was another first for the programme. The Duchess of Cambridgebecame the first royal to present the show earlier this year. CBeebies Bedtime Stories airs daily at 18:50, with episodes signed by a BSL interpreter shown every Saturday and Sunday.

LiveLiveEvacuation convoy heading to Mariupol 'hellscape' says UN4 minutes ago,"The UN humanitarian chief says a new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol There are thought to be about 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, stuck in the steel plant Vladimir Putin says Ukraine should order its fighters remaining in the Azovstal complex to surrender Capturing the whole of Mariupol would be symbolic for Moscow ahead of its annual 9 May Victory Day celebration Meanwhile, international donors have pledged $6.5bn to support Ukraine during a conference in Poland Edited by Andrew Humphrey Thanks for joining us for today's coverage from Ukraine. We're ending our live posts on this page now, but we'll pick things up again in a few hours. Our writers today were Alys Davies, Alexandra Fouche, Sofia Ferreira Santos, Emily McGarvey and Leo Sands. The editors were Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan, Emma Owen and Andrew Humphrey. You can find any major developing stories and in depth coverage on the BBC Newshome page. Goodnight. This video can not be played Drone footage shows damaged Azovstal steelworks where civilians still remain Just before we go, we wanted to share this drone footage showing the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. It gives an indication of how vast the complex is, and the devastation the industrial works has suffered. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross will attempt to evacuate the civilians still trapped there tomorrow. Once again, the plight of those in Mariupol was the focus of our coverage for much of the day. We'll be pausing our coverage shortly, so here's a recap of what's happened today. In Mariupol...  Internationally...  On Putin... The UN has documented 180 cases of civilians, journalists, and local politicians being arbitrarily detained or disappeared in Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine. Michelle Bachelet, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, said her office had also found eight similar cases in Ukrainian-controlled territory of possible enforced disappearances of pro-Russian individuals. ""In areas around Kyiv, from late February for about five weeks, Russian forces targeted male civilians who they considered suspicious,"" Bachelet said. According to evidence collected by her office, some of those individuals were ""taken to Belarus and Russia, unbeknownst to their families, and
held in pre-trial detention facilities"". Many of their families still do not know what has happened to them, she added. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Away from Ukraine, Nato says it will increase its presence around Sweden and the Baltic sea if Sweden applies to join the alliance, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Swedish broadcaster SVT. The secretary general highlighted the importance of protecting the country's borders while its Nato application is approved, which could take up to a year. ""From the potential moment Sweden is applying, and Nato says
that they want Sweden to join, there is a very strong obligation
from Nato to be able to guarantee Sweden's security,"" Stoltenberg
told SVT. Sweden and neighbouring Finland are expected to make a decision on whether they are applying to join Nato this month, as both countries have considered joining the alliance following the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is asking its Western allies for more weapons before it can launch a counteroffensive on Russia, which is likely to be late June at the earliest, when it expects to receive additional military aid. Here's a look at what aid has been sent so far: Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the possibility of the UK sending long-range weapons to help Ukraine's military - and the UK has already sent Ukraine thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles and some Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. The US sent Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles - andthey are now sending helicopters, long-range artillery and armoured personnel carriers. Slovakia sent its S-300 anti aircraft defence system, which can destroy aircraft up to 400km away. The US and Turkey have both sent drones armed with missiles. Several Nato countries are now supplying Ukraine with heavier weapons, to enable its army to push back against Russia's army, and they areplanning massively to increase the amounts they are spending on military aid. Some more details have emerged on plans for another evacuation attempt to rescue civilians trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol. ""Tomorrow, May 6, there will be an evacuation from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia,"" Ukraine's Deputy PM Iryna Vereshchukwrites in a Facebook post,external. She says residents should gather on Friday at 12:00 local (09:00 GMT) near Mariupol's Port City shopping centre, providing no further details. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross hope that a convoy of its buses intended to evacuate civilians trapped in Mariupol's besieged steelworks will reach the city tomorrow morning. Laura BickerBBC News We're now hearing that another evacuation convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Hundreds of civilians are thought to be trapped in the maze-like tunnels under the plant. Itâs hoped the buses will reach Mariupol by Friday morning. The operation is being run jointly by the UN and the Red Cross. Sarah RainsfordReporting from Makariv Almost every window of Makariv hospital, outside Kyiv, has been
blown out. There are holes from mortar fire in the car park and twisted pieces
of Russian missiles under a tree. Even so, the hospitalâs still working as a day clinic. When Russian tanks first rolled into the town, the hospital
director says staff strung white sheets on the roof marked with red crosses
hoping that would protect them. ""The 5th floor was hit by mortar fire,"" Galina
Romanenko recalls. ""When an ambulance drove out to get diesel, the Russians
shot right at it."" Doctors stacked sacks filled with soil inside the windows of their
operating theatre so they could go on treating the wounded, under fire.The hospital was treating up to two dozen injured people a day at the height of the fighting. They had to help many
others over the phone. ""Theyâd call to say they were wounded but surrounded. We even helped
a woman give birth by phone,"" Galina says. The hospital was evacuated on 7 March.
Ukrainian forces then moved into its grounds, drawing even heavier fire. At
that point an entire clinic was hit, leaving only the filing cabinets standing,
charred, among the wreckage. The UN is trying to organise another evacuation from Mariupol, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said. Speaking at a meeting of the body's Security Council, Guterres said that this was in addition to the two convoys that have already been completed successfully, including one that rescued 101 civilians who had been trapped in the city's massive Azovstal steelworks. The UN chief did not specify whether it applied to civilians in the steelworks or to those in the wider Mariupol area. ""It is our policy not to speak about details of [negotiations] before they are completed to avoid undermining possible success."" Guterres added: ""We must continue
to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes."". The luxury yacht, named 'The Amadea', is one of the largest in the world Sticking with sanctions, and a $300 million (Â£243m) luxury yacht owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov has been seized by authorities in Fiji after the US Justice Department requested it be held for violating sanctions and for alleged ties to corruption. The luxury yacht, the Amadea, which was berthed in Lautoka when it was seized, is 348-feet (105 metres) long and has eight cabins, a VIP stateroom, and a helipad. US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the department wants to make clear that there is ""no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime"". Kerimov is part-owner of Russia's Gazprom and an official of the Russian government. He was described by the US department as part of a group of oligarchs who ""profit from the Russian government through corruption and its malign activity around the globe, including the occupation of Crimea."" The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell speaking on 3 May The EU is close to agreeing on a sixth round of sanctions against Russia, the bloc's foreign policy chief has said. ""They are almost there. And we need this agreement because we have to push still more our economic and financial pressure on Russia,"" Josep Borrell said at an event in Italy. Yesterday the EU Commission proposed that the next round of sanctions includeda phased ban on Russian oil imports, which if approved would be its toughest move against the Russian energy sector to date. The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, is one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies. He has long given his backing to Russia's invasion, allowing troops to advance from his country's border when it began. But he has said he hadn't expected the operation to ""drag on this way"". In an interview with the Associated Press news agency Mr Lukashenko said that Russia's leader had had no choice but to act because Ukraine was ""provoking Russia"". But he said: ""I am not immersed in this problem enough to say whether it goes according to plan, like the Russians say, or like I feel it. ""I want to stress one more time: I feel like this operation has dragged on."" Mr Lukashenko also said he wanted the war to end, saying Belarus had ""done and are doing everything"" to stop it.

Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Civilians are helped over rubble at the steelworks plant There is renewed hope that civilians who are still trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol can be evacuated, as the UN and the Red Cross say a new convoy is expected on Friday. The situation at the site, surrounded by Russian forces, is rapidly deteriorating, with little food and water supplies. Meanwhile, the relatives of the hundreds of fighters who are also holed up there are desperate for an evacuation to include them too. âWeâre worried because the Russian attacks have been happening for three days and we still donât have contact with our fighters there,â Nataliia, whose brother is a fighter currently at the site, told me. âI donât know how our fighters are dealing with it. I cannot get any information.â She urged the Ukrainian government to come up with a plan for their rescue. Russian officials have urged them to lay down their arms. The fighters, however, say they will not surrender. A new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to try to evacuate the remaining civilians there, and is expected to arrive on Friday, the United Nations humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, says. More than 340 civilians were evacuated from different parts of Mariupol yesterday with the help of the UN and the Red Cross, Griffiths said. ""Today, as we speak, a convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning, hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell that they have inhabited for so many weeks and months and take them back to safety,"" Griffiths said. Numerous attempts had previously failed to get civilians out of the besieged city of Mariupol - butthe first successful evacuation of the steelworks happened earlier this week. Around 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, are still believed to be stuck underneath the steel plant. Unverified images posted by Luhansk officials apparently showing damage from Russian shelling In addition to overnight strikes on the city of Kramatorsk, Ukrainian officials say Russian attacks have resumed elsewhere in Ukraine's east. Russian shelling killed a 15-year-old boy in Kharkiv who was helping to evacuate animals from a zoo, the owner of the Feldman Ecopark zoo says. Two other people were badly wounded in the attack, he added. The governor of Mykolaiv says that the region and city ""were bombed all night"" wounding several people. Andin a Telegram post,externalthis afternoon, Luhansk's Ukrainian military commander says that the bodies of four men and one woman - all civilians - have been discovered in towns around the region after ""24 devastating attacks"" by Russian forces. The BBC has not been able to verify these reports. Andrew HardingReporting from Kramatorsk Within hours of the attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from the streets At least 25 people have been injured in a series of overnight explosions in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. Local officials said six civilians were severely wounded. The blasts â at least some believed to be the result of air strikes â damaged apartment blocks and shops in a residential neighbourhood of the city. One air strike appeared to have destroyed a local hot water plant surrounded by apartment blocks, leaving a huge crater perhaps four metres deep, and widespread damage to dozens of residential homes. In a short statement, the Donestsk regionâs military administration said that nine homes and a school were also significantly damaged. Less than a month ago,at least 50 people were killed when a missile hit the cityâs railway station. Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of a âmonstrous war crimeâ following the strike. Within hours of last nightâs attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from Kramatorskâs streets, while mechanical diggers removed larger blocks of concrete that had been torn apart in one blast. The EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulator warned that airlines may be at heightened risk due to the war in Ukraine. In a statement, the regulator said civil planes may be accidentally targeted and airlines could be struck by cyber-attacks while the conflict is ongoing. ""As shown by previous wars, misidentification is easy in
confused arenas of warfare"", the regulator said. In 2014, aMalaysia Airlines flight crashed while flying over conflict-hit eastern Ukraineafter it was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile. ""If we add in the likelihood of jamming
of electronic aids that may be involved with navigation and
or identification tools, then it is easy to see the potential
for innocent aircraft being subject to missiles or radar laid
weapons,"" the EASA added. The regulator also stated that there are potential risks related to military operations using civilian airports throughout the conflict. Paul KirbyBBC News Russia's Victory Day has become an annual event - the military parade in Red Square in Moscow and cities across Russia on 9 May - when the countrymarks its victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Under Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become a show of military strength as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two, when 27 million Soviet citizens died. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Instead of celebrating the overthrow of Ukraine's government, the Kremlin will have to settle for the capture of most of Mariupol. The city may lie in ruins, but Russia has repeatedly talked of ""de-Nazification and demilitarisation"" of Ukraine and it may claim defeat of the Azov battalion, which it has falsely portrayed as Nazi. That would resonate on a day marking World War Two. Read more aboutRussia's Victory Day parade. Vladimir Putin meeting with Israeli PM Naftali Bennett in Sochi last October Some more now from today's phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, which we reported earlier. Bennett has now said that Putin apologised to him forremarks earlier this week by his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovclaiming that Adolf Hitler was part-Jewish. Lavrov made the comments when asked in an interview how Russia could claim to be ""de-Nazifying"" Ukraine when its president is himself Jewish. In the interview, Russia's top diplomat said ""Hitler also had Jewish blood,"" adding: ""wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews."" The comments sparked outrage in Israel, which summoned the country's Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and demanded an apology. Prime Minister Bennett says he has accepted Putin's apology for the remarks and thanked him for clarifying his position. Â© 2025 BBC.

"More evacuations from Mariupol 'hellscapes' - UNRussia says it will give civilians safe passage on Friday, but Ukrainian fighters must surrender.","Smoke rises above the steelworks on Thursday A third operation to pull civilians from Mariupol is due on Friday, the UN says, as more fighting was reported for control of a steelworks where the last Ukrainian defenders are holding out. About 200 civilians are also believed to be hiding in bunkers in the plant. UN chief Antonio Guterres said everything should be done to ""get people out of these hellscapes"". Russia's Vladimir Putin said his forces are ready to give civilians safe passage, but fighters must surrender. The Russian president has already declared victory in Mariupol, ordering his forces to seal off the sprawling industrial site - which was designed during the Cold War to serve as a nuclear bunker and has a network of tunnels deep below ground - rather than try to take control of it. However the remaining Ukrainian forces inside the steelworks - fighters from the Azov regiment, some marines, border guards and police - say Russian attacks are continuing. In his overnight address Ukraine's President Zelensky also said that Russian shelling and attempts to wrest control of the steelworks were ongoing. ""Just imagine this hell. And there are children! More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death nearby,"" he said. The Azov regiment released drone footage showing explosions at the steelworks, but the date of the footage could not be verified. Earlier on Thursday Sviatoslav Palamar, an Azov regiment commander, said Ukrainian defenders were fighting ""difficult, bloody battles"" with Russian troops who had managed to enter part of the complex. But the Kremlin denied its forces had tried to storm the plant and insisted that a humanitarian corridor was open as part of a three-day ceasefire that started on Thursday. Mr Guterres said a third operation to evacuate civilians from the city was under way and would arrive in the city on Friday. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on social media that this would happen at about midday. Mariupol steelworks evacuees reach safety At least 20 children are thought to be among the remaining civilians in the steelworks, and food and water supplies are dwindling fast. On Sunday an initial group of civilians was evacuated from the plant. Footage showed mainly women and children being helped to walk over piles of rubble, and boarding a bus with missing windows. This video can not be played Watch: One woman who left the Azovstal steelworks earlier this week said she did not see any sunlight for two months Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine 10 weeks ago but has not yet gained full control over any of Ukraine's major cities. In other developments: The US provided intelligence that helped Ukraine sink the Russian warship Moskva, multiple US media outlets report. Officials said Ukraine had asked the US about a ship in the Black Sea. The US identified it as the Moskva and helped confirm its location. Ukraine then targeted the ship Israel says Mr Putin has apologisedafter his foreign minister said that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had ""Jewish blood"". Russia's account of the conversation did not mention an apology. Sergei Lavrov made the initial comments to try to justify Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as ""Nazi"" despite the fact that its president is Jewish A key ally of Russia, authoritarian Belarusian leaderAlexander Lukashenko, has indicated that the war in Ukraine has not gone to plan. He told the AP news agency that the operation had ""dragged on"" The EU is close to agreeing on a sixth round of sanctions against Russia, the bloc's foreign policy chief says.

Meanwhile, the relatives of the hundreds of fighters who are also holed up there are desperate for an evacuation to include them too. âWeâre worried because the Russian attacks have been happening for three days and we still donât have contact with our fighters there,â Nataliia, whose brother is a fighter currently at the site, told me. âI donât know how our fighters are dealing with it. I cannot get any information.â She urged the Ukrainian government to come up with a plan for their rescue. Russian officials have urged them to lay down their arms. The fighters, however, say they will not surrender. A new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to try to evacuate the remaining civilians there, and is expected to arrive on Friday, the United Nations humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, says. More than 340 civilians were evacuated from different parts of Mariupol yesterday with the help of the UN and the Red Cross, Griffiths said. ""Today, as we speak, a convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning, hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell that they have inhabited for so many weeks and months and take them back to safety,"" Griffiths said. Numerous attempts had previously failed to get civilians out of the besieged city of Mariupol - butthe first successful evacuation of the steelworks happened earlier this week. Around 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, are still believed to be stuck underneath the steel plant. Unverified images posted by Luhansk officials apparently showing damage from Russian shelling In addition to overnight strikes on the city of Kramatorsk, Ukrainian officials say Russian attacks have resumed elsewhere in Ukraine's east. Russian shelling killed a 15-year-old boy in Kharkiv who was helping to evacuate animals from a zoo, the owner of the Feldman Ecopark zoo says. Two other people were badly wounded in the attack, he added. The governor of Mykolaiv says that the region and city ""were bombed all night"" wounding several people. Andin a Telegram post,externalthis afternoon, Luhansk's Ukrainian military commander says that the bodies of four men and one woman - all civilians - have been discovered in towns around the region after ""24 devastating attacks"" by Russian forces. The BBC has not been able to verify these reports. Andrew HardingReporting from Kramatorsk Within hours of the attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from the streets At least 25 people have been injured in a series of overnight explosions in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. Local officials said six civilians were severely wounded. The blasts â at least some believed to be the result of air strikes â damaged apartment blocks and shops in a residential neighbourhood of the city. One air strike appeared to have destroyed a local hot water plant surrounded by apartment blocks, leaving a huge crater perhaps four metres deep, and widespread damage to dozens of residential homes. In a short statement, the Donestsk regionâs military administration said that nine homes and a school were also significantly damaged. Less than a month ago,at least 50 people were killed when a missile hit the cityâs railway station. Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of a âmonstrous war crimeâ following the strike. Within hours of last nightâs attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from Kramatorskâs streets, while mechanical diggers removed larger blocks of concrete that had been torn apart in one blast. The EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulator warned that airlines may be at heightened risk due to the war in Ukraine. In a statement, the regulator said civil planes may be accidentally targeted and airlines could be struck by cyber-attacks while the conflict is ongoing. ""As shown by previous wars, misidentification is easy in
confused arenas of warfare"", the regulator said. In 2014, aMalaysia Airlines flight crashed while flying over conflict-hit eastern Ukraineafter it was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile. ""If we add in the likelihood of jamming
of electronic aids that may be involved with navigation and
or identification tools, then it is easy to see the potential
for innocent aircraft being subject to missiles or radar laid
weapons,"" the EASA added. The regulator also stated that there are potential risks related to military operations using civilian airports throughout the conflict. Paul KirbyBBC News Russia's Victory Day has become an annual event - the military parade in Red Square in Moscow and cities across Russia on 9 May - when the countrymarks its victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Under Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become a show of military strength as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two, when 27 million Soviet citizens died. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Instead of celebrating the overthrow of Ukraine's government, the Kremlin will have to settle for the capture of most of Mariupol. The city may lie in ruins, but Russia has repeatedly talked of ""de-Nazification and demilitarisation"" of Ukraine and it may claim defeat of the Azov battalion, which it has falsely portrayed as Nazi. That would resonate on a day marking World War Two. Read more aboutRussia's Victory Day parade. Vladimir Putin meeting with Israeli PM Naftali Bennett in Sochi last October Some more now from today's phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, which we reported earlier. Bennett has now said that Putin apologised to him forremarks earlier this week by his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovclaiming that Adolf Hitler was part-Jewish. Lavrov made the comments when asked in an interview how Russia could claim to be ""de-Nazifying"" Ukraine when its president is himself Jewish. In the interview, Russia's top diplomat said ""Hitler also had Jewish blood,"" adding: ""wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews."" The comments sparked outrage in Israel, which summoned the country's Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and demanded an apology. Prime Minister Bennett says he has accepted Putin's apology for the remarks and thanked him for clarifying his position. Â© 2025 BBC.

Knightley joins call to tackle toxic behaviour,"Keira Knightley: ""We are all entitled to work in safe, respectful spaces where dignity for all is upheld"" Actresses Keira Knightly and Naomie Harris have joined the call for an Independent Standards Authority (ISA) to tackle bullying and harassment in the UK entertainment industry. Anti-harassment and bullying campaign group UK Time's Up proposed the idea. Knightley said: ""For anyone to fulfil their creative potential there cannot be fear or disrespect of any kind."" Harris added that ""no-one should go to work fearful of harassment, bullying and abuse"". 'People fear for their jobs if they report bullies' Knightley rules out sex scenes directed by men Watson 'optimistic' at Time's Up progress UK Time's Up is working with Creative UK, which promotes the development of creative companies, to agree a plan of action. They are also speaking with representatives from the music, TV, film, theatre, advertising, video games, and fashion sectors. Naomie Harris: ""Where we work must be safe and respectful"" Dame Heather Rabbatts, chair of UK Time's Up, said it was a ""historic moment"" for the film and TV industry to create a new body. ""Where the complaint is historic in nature, where it relates to conduct outside work, or if there are multiple complaints, there is currently no process,"" she said. ""Only by creating a body which stands fully independent, with processes and investigations informed by legal standards of confidentiality, can there be confidence and trust, and more broadly, for the integrity of the industry to be assured."" Last year singer Rebecca Ferguson met with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to share her experience of bullying, harassment, and discrimination, whilst working in the music industry. The year before she told the BBC that people who speak out about issues like racism or sexual abuse in the creative industries ""get shut down and their careers get ended"". Ferguson said the calls for an ISA are ""an opportunity to change the way creatives are treated in our country"", adding: ""By supporting this you are making history. ""The ISA is a monumental step that will support future creatives, which could include your children, grandchildren or family members. Nobody deserves to go to work in fear."" This video can not be played Rebecca Ferguson says people's careers are ended for speaking out about racism. Time's Up came together with the BFI and Bafta in 2017 to set up guidelines for tackling bullying and harassment, which were then launched the following year. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries also offered her support for the setting up of an ISA, saying: ""No one should experience bullying or harassment - no matter what industry they're in. ""I feel strongly that it is for the creative industries to ensure the welfare of those working in them."" She added that while she welcomed the steps taken so far to improve standards: ""I want to see more. I want there to be a safe and welcoming environment for everyone who wants to work in film, TV, music, and the wider creative sectors - no matter who they are, or where they're from."" Bafta chair Krishnendu Majumdar said: ""In industries that rely on freelancers on short term and informal contracts, we too often hear that there is nowhere to go when contracts have ended. ""This 'grey area' leaves many feeling there is no recourse, other than to go to the media. ""As an arts charity, Bafta supports the proposal of a truly independent, trusted body that has the authority and legal infrastructure to provide a proper process for complainants and those accused. ""We believe the introduction of an Independent Standards Authority is not only a welcome addition to our industries, it is essential.""

Elon Musk lines up $7bn backing for Twitter deal,"Billionaire Elon Musk has lined up 19 new investors to help with his $44bn (Â£35.5bn) purchase of Twitter. The commitments, totalling $7.1bn, will allow Mr Musk to reduce his own risk in the deal which has been approved by Twitter's board but not completed. Oracle co-founder and Mr Musk's friend, Larry Ellison, is the single biggest contributor with $1bn. Other investors include renowned Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital and crypto exchange Binance. There is still some uncertainty that Mr Musk - also chief executive of electric car maker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX - will pull off his planned buyout. Mr Musk, whose rank as the world's richest person is tied to the value of his stake in Tesla, has said he plans to finance the purchase through a mix of loans, investments and cash. In recent weeks, he sold about $8.5bn worth of Tesla shares, money that is expected to be used to fund the deal. He has lined up $13bn in loans from banks and is also borrowing against his Tesla holdings. The new $7.1bn commitment will allow him to reduce that debt from an initially proposed $12.5bn to $6.25bn, according to the government filing. The investment group includes massive firms such as Fidelity, which is known for managing retirement accounts. Meanwhile, Sequoia Capital has backed technology firms since the 1970s, including Apple, Google and Airbnb. Many of the investors also have previous experience with Mr Musk. Larry Ellison, whose fortune is reportedly worth more than $100bn, has agreed to invest $1bn in Twitter Mr Ellison, for example, sits on the board of Tesla, while Dubai-based Vy Capital, which is putting in $800m, has backed Mr Musk's tunnel construction start-up The Boring Company. Binance chief founder Changpeng Zhao shared news of the deal on the social media site, casting it as a step toward ""Crypto Twitter"". He called his $500m investment a ""small contribution to the cause"". Qatar Holding, a sovereign wealth fund, is contributing $375m, while Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who had initially opposed the buyout, also confirmed he would retain his $1.9bn stake in Twitter, writing that Mr Musk would be an ""excellent leader"" for the site. ""Kingdom Holding Company and I look forward to roll our ~$1.9bn in the ""new"" Twitter and join you on this exciting journey,"" he added. Mr Musk will also continue to hold talks with existing shareholders of Twitter, including the company's former chief Jack Dorsey, to contribute shares to the proposed acquisition, according to the filing. Mr Musk, who has more than 90 million followers on Twitter, surprised many in April when it was revealed he was the social media site's largest shareholder. He ultimately rejected a seat on the board in favour of taking it private, saying the move would make it easier to improve the platform. While his plans are unclear, he has floated ideas such as making some pay for the service, increasing transparency over how Tweets appear and cleaning up spam accounts. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was an earlier backer of Twitter CNBC reported on Thursday, citing sources, that he also plans to take on the role of chief executive temporarily. Shares in Twitter rose after the new commitments were revealed, but continue to trade lower than Mr Musk's buyout price of $54.20 - a sign of lingering questions about the deal. Shares in Tesla were down more than 8%. The price has sunk more than 15% over the last month. How Elon Musk might change Twitter Who is Elon Musk? A big decline in their worth could put the purchase at risk, said David Yoffie, professor at Harvard Business School. ""It's by no means a sure thing that he will actually close on this deal,"" he says. ""The financing is a huge risk."" But Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the new investor group will help reduce those fears. ""This was a smart financial and strategic move by Musk that will be well received across the board,"" he wrote, adding that it ""shows the Twitter deal is now on a glide path to get done by the end of this year.""

Turkey's cost of living soars nearly 70%,"Consumer prices in Turkey soared nearly 70% in April from a year ago, hitting a two-decade high, official figures show. Transport, food prices and household furnishings recorded the sharpest rise in annual inflation, with transport costs more than doubling over the year. Countries around the world are dealing with a growing cost of living crisis. But Turkey's problems have been made worse by its president's reluctance to raise interest rates - a commonly used tool to help cool inflation. The cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks saw an annual increase of 89.1%, while furnishings and household equipment were up 77.64%. On a monthly basis, prices jumped 7.25% in April,according to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute,external. Can tourism ease the inflation pressure in Turkey? Why currency crash does not worry Turkey's Erdogan Turkey has seen a collapse in the value of the lira, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan prioritises exports over currency stability. Mr Erdogan has described interest rates as ""the mother and father of all evil,"" and has used more unorthodox policy to try to dampen prices including intervening in foreign exchange markets. Facing pressure from the Turkish president, the country's central bank's has slashed rates to 14% from 19% since September. In April it kept rates steady for the fourth month in a row, despite soaring inflation. Tuba Canpolat says her family is struggling to cope with rising prices Tuba Canpolat, a former healthcare worker living in Istanbul, said her family was struggling to manage with only her husband's salary. He works in construction. She had planned to return to her job after taking three months of maternity leave but with prices so high she was unable to afford childcare. ""I receive what we call unemployment benefits in Turkey but it is such a low number that it doesn't even meet my baby's monthly diaper needs,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm looking for small jobs that can be done online. But right now it's not possible for us to live on a salary of 5,000 Turkish liras while the rents are 3,000-4,000 Turkish liras."" Tuba said she had been forced to buy cheaper nappies for her baby and change them less often, while their food costs have also soared. ""We can't handle it. In fact we survive thanks to the support of our family,"" she added. Charlie Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital, said disruption caused by the war in Ukraine was contributing to higher prices, including for food. However, he said much of the underlying reason for high inflation was ""Turkey's very odd monetary policies"". President Erdogan will be seeking re-election next year But Jason Tuvey, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said there were ""no signs that policymakers are about to shift tack and hike interest rates"" and predicted inflation would remain around the current high rates for much of this year. Prices are rising quickly around the world, due to factors including Covid-related supply shortages and the Ukraine war, which has driven energy and food prices higher. Many countries have responded by raising interest rates to encourage people and companies to borrow and spend less, with the aim of limiting inflation. The Bank of Englandhas raised the interest rateto the highest level since 2009 while on Wednesday the US Federal Reserveannounced its biggest rate increasein more than two decades. Countries including India and Australia have also hiked borrowing costs. Can tourism ease the inflation pressure in Turkey?

How high could interest rates go?,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The first drop in rates for more than four years came in August, followed by another in November. Some analysts predict another cut in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,rose by 2.6% in the 12 months to November 2024which was up from 2.3% in October. That means inflation is back above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The government's plans to borrow and spend billions which were set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgethave changed expectations. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskafter the Budget announcement thatthey will have to pay more National Insurance for their staff, which could also affect the economy. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. How the Budget will affect you and your money Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change would have an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.46%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.23%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row. Its key lending rate is now ina target range of 4.25% to 4.5%,but the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace next year.

LiveLivePolls close in elections across the UK1 minute ago,"Boris Johnson admits the local election results in some parts of England have been ""tough"" for the Tory party The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland The party has lost key London councils to Labour, and southern councils to the Liberal Democrats, who have gained more than 190 seats across England Sir Keir Starmer has hailed a ""really good set of results"" for Labour - however major gains in England have not been made outside London The BBC calculates that based on these results, if the whole country had been voting - Labour would have 35% of the vote, Conservative 30%, Lib Dems 19% and others 16% Labour has become the second largest party in the Scottish council elections, but the SNP continues to dominate In the Northern Ireland Assembly election, Sinn FÃ©in has received the largest number of first preference votes but the count is ongoing The Conservatives have seen heavy losses in Wales, while Plaid Cymru have made gains Emily McGarvey, Natasha Preskey, Richard Morris, Paul Gribben and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thank you for joining us today.

Scotland's counts are now complete,and the full results can be found here. You can alsosearch for results in your local area here. The live coverage of theNorthern Ireland Assembly results continues here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The local elections don't hold up a perfect mirror to the whole country's desires, or exactly what would happen if a general election had just happened. But they are a valuable measure of the state of the battle of the two main parties who seek to govern us all. Caveats aside, the events of the last 24 hours do matter. Spin back a few weeks, and some Conservatives feared these elections would end in absolute calamity after months of extraordinary revelations about what had been going on in Downing Street during lockdown. The party feared an angry public would punish them at the ballot box. And rising anxiety about making ends meet would translate too into a kicking for the government. 
After all the turmoil, the prime minister's allies fretted. And some of Boris Johnson's detractors darkly hoped a meltdown would give them reason to act to oust him. Now that nearly everything has been counted, the Tories have lost nearly 500 seats across the UK. That represents around a quarter of the council seats they contested. Read more from Laura here Tommorrow's newspaper front pages point the finger at the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives for the performances of their parties in the location elections. The Times says the Tories have been ""punished"" in the south on England, reporting that voters in the party's heartlands are questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership. But the Daily Mail says it is Keir Starmer who is ""in crisis"". The paper has headlinedon Durham Police's investigationinto whether the Labour leader breached lockdown rules along with Labour's performance in the northern 'Red Wall', where the party made some gains but perhaps not on the scale that Labour might have hoped. The Guardian's coverage centres on criticism of Boris Johnson by senior Conservative figures, some of whom have blamed the PM for big Tory losses in London and the south. Susan Thomson was one of eight women who stood for election in the Western Isles Here's one story you might have missed in the flurry of updates today: the Western Isles in Scotland has elected female councillors for the first time since 2012. Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected for the SNP, and will be the only two women among the area's 27 councillors. Six other women who stood were not elected. The islands had beenseeking greater female representationon the local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, andheld a workshopearlier this year aimed at encouraging more women to stand. In 2017, for the first time in its history, no women were elected to the comhairle. Seven women stood for election that year. You can read more on this here. It's been a tough day for plenty of would-be councillors, but perhaps even tougher for candidates who lost out through pure chance. In at least three cases, ties for seats were decided through a sophisticated adjudication process - tossing a coin or drawing straws. Independent Andy Solloway won the Skipton West and West Craven division of the newNorth Yorkshireunitary authority after a representative for Labour rival Peter Madeley drew the short straw. Both men had received 503 votes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tippetts, 21, says he hopes his election will help young people who are yet to come out, as well as demonstrating that trans people are ""just normal human beings"". ""For me, it's bigger than just promoting equality and diversity in terms of trans people,"" he added. ""It's promoting the amazing diversity that we've got across our city in all walks of life.""

""Now the hard work really begins."" Let's take a look at what's been happening around the UK. The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland, losing key London councils to Labour, and southern English councils to the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Daveyhailed the results as a ""turning point"" for his party. Boris Johnson said the Tories had faced a ""tough"" time. Labour struggled to make any major breakthroughs outside London, although it was already starting at a high watermark from 2018, when these seats were last contested. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party had had a ""really good set of results today"". In Wales,Labour have had 65 more councillors elected, bringing their total to 522. Plaid Cymru lost nine councillors but the party now has control of three more councils. The Conservatives lost 82 councillors, bringing their total to 110.

There are now 87 Lib Dems, up 20, and the Greens are up 16 at 35. In Northern Ireland, the picture is still emerging, butSinn Fein have the largest first preference vote, followed by the DUP, who have lost around 40,000 first preference votes. Meanwhile, the Alliance party has made big gains. Bury, which made headlines in January whenBury South MP Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour, has seen Labour hold on.

The 33-year-old says people in the city have ""always welcomed"" her. ""I've never given up, and now they've trusted in me,"" she said. ""I can't believe it.

Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Sinn FÃ©in has polled the largest number of first preference votes in the Northern Ireland Assembly election by a long way. The first stage of the count is complete in all 18 constituencies. More than a quarter of a million people gave their â1â vote to the republican party. Sinn FÃ©in won 29% of the first preference vote- with the Democratic Unionists receiving 21.3%. Sinn FÃ©in increased its share by just over 1% - while the DUP has seen a drop of almost 7%. A fall in the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) vote - from 12% to 9% - suggests nationalist voters may have rallied around Sinn FÃ©in. A factor in this may be that pre-election polls suggested Sinn FÃ©in could deliver a nationalist first minister for the first time. The DUP seems to have taken a hit not from the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party - but from the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which takes a more hard-line position. The TUV has seen its vote share almost quadruple - to 7.6% - while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is down 1.7%. The final result will depend on the 2s, 3s 4s and beyond on the ballot paper. Itâs a complicated process, and counting is now expected to pause overnight and resume on Saturday. Most analysts believe Sinn FÃ©in is on course to win the largest number of seats.

Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor The results emerging from Wales confirm the worst fears of the Welsh Conservatives. They were always expecting to suffer losses, but not on a scale that could wipe out all the gains they made in the last council elections five years ago. Their leader, Andrew RT Davies, blames the issues that have plagued Boris Johnson's government in Westminster - the cost of living crisis and partygate. He says he still supports the prime minister but ""he has to use the summer months to build the confidence of the party"" going forward to the next general election. In north-east Wales, where the party routed Welsh Labour in the 2019 election, the Tories have fallen from the largest party in one council, Denbighshire, to fourth. That's a result that will do nothing to calm Welsh Tory nerves about Boris Johnson's ability to keep those 2019 Conservative converts on board. Read more analysis of results in Waleshere. The Conservatives have lost control of their only council in Wales. Labour has become the biggest party in Monmouthshire, with the final results now declared in the county. Labour secured 22 seats (up 12), Conservatives 18 (down 12), Greens one (up one). BBC Wales has been told that the Greens will work with Labour. One seat in the Llanfoist ward had to be settled by a coin toss after the Labour and Conservative candidates finished neck and neck. The coin came down in favour of the Tory. Elsewhere across Wales, Labour gained two councils and Plaid Cymru three. Labour regained Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and held Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport and Torfaen, while Plaid retained Gwynedd and gained Anglesey, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said he accepted things ""might not have gone our way"" in parts of Wales. ""We went into these elections with a difficult national picture and it appears that has had an impact,"" he said.

For all their importance, local elections aren't known for their star power. And Thurrock Council in Essex lost its bit of celebrity sparkle when Conservative councillor and former 80s singer David Van Day - half of pop duo Dollar - lost his seat to Labour by 20 votes. Still, it's not the first time he's bounced back from disappointment. After stepping out of the limelight, Van Day began to build a business career in the 2000s selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams in Brighton - earning him the nickname ""Burger Van Day"". We have been hearing thatSinn FÃ©in has secured the most first-preference votesin Northern Ireland's Assembly election. So how does the system work? While UK general elections allow voters to choose just one candidate in their local area, NI Assembly elections see voters rank multiple candidates. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. For each constituency, a quota of votes is calculated using a mathematical formula, based on the number of seats and the number of votes cast. Candidates who reach this number of votes from 'first preference votes' (where voters choose them as number one) are elected. If these candidates get votes above the quota number, their extra votes are transferred to other candidates - so the candidate marked ""2"" on those ballot papers gets those votes instead. The candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their second preferences get transferred to other candidates. The same process continues round by round with the lowest candidate being knocked out and their votes being transferred to candidates who are still in the race. You can read more on this here. Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes by a wide margin in Northern Ireland's Assembly election. The party received 250,388 first preferences, compared with the 184,002 returned for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - first preference votes for it have dropped by about 40,000.The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, NI voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been vying for top spot in this election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the offices of the first and deputy first minister are equal with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. Read more about the results in Northern Irelandhere. We're about two thirds of the way through this marathon. The final results should be all done by tomorrow evening. The story of the night is that theLiberal Democratshave made big gains while theConservativeshave sustained heavy losses across the country.Labour, entering this fight from an already high watermark in 2018, has made further gains from a strong starting point.

"Warning of economic downturn as interest rates riseRates rise to 1% from 0.75%, their highest level since 2009, in a bid to tackle soaring inflation.","The Bank of England has warned the UK faces a ""sharp economic slowdown"" this year as it raises interest rates to try to stem the pace of rising prices. Rates rose to 1% from 0.75%, their highest level since 2009 and the fourth consecutive increase since December. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 30-year high and set to hit 10% by the autumn as the Ukraine war drives up fuel and energy prices. As a result, households are reining in their spending which is hitting growth. Following the latest rise in interest rates, two million homeowners will see an immediate increase in their monthly mortgage repayments with other loans potentially getting more expensive too. But Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey defended raising rates at a time when the cost of living is increasing, saying that the risk of letting inflation get out of control was higher. Inflation reached 7% in March - more than three times the Bank's target of 2%. ""We are in a very difficult position at the moment,"" Mr Bailey told the BBC. ""We're walking a very narrow path now between inflation on the one side, which is much higher than we want it to be, and on the other side very big external shocks which are causing a big loss of real income for people and businesses in this country."" As a result of the soaring prices, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - which sets rates -  said there had been ""a material deterioration in the outlook"" for UK economic growth. The bank's policymakers now expect the UK economy to shrink rather than expand in the final three months of this year. It is also expected to contract by 0.25% in 2023, down from its previous forecast of 1.25% growth. How high could UK interest rates go? Why are prices rising so quickly? While that would not technically be a recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters - it would leave the UK at a real risk of one. Moreover, the MPC believes unemployment will rise as businesses start to struggle, climbing from 3.6% this year to around 5% in 2024. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said rising energy costs will cause 'hardship' Raising rates makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow. The idea is that people start spending less, helping cool demand for goods and services and, in turn, slowing the pace of price rises. But economists have warned that increases in interest rates may have little effect given rising global oil and gas prices. The Bank's MPC expects inflation to hit 9% in the coming months - up from its previous forecast of 8% - and to reach 10.25% by the end of the year. It said the impact of the Ukraine war on household gas and electricity prices was largely to blame, following the increase in the energy price cap in April and a further expected rise in October which could push household bills up to Â£2,800 a year. Mr Bailey said there could be a 40% rise in the price cap based on current prices. ""I must say that I recognise the hardship this will cause for many people in the UK, particularly those on the lowest incomes, often with little or no savings,"" he said. Following the Bank's forecasts the pound fell by more than a cent against the US dollar to below $1.24, its lowest level since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in mid-2020. Jay Lane, who lives with his wife and two sons in Long Eaton near Nottingham, said his family's monthly energy bill had more than doubled from Â£127 to Â£282 after the price cap was raised in April. ""The first day I got the quote from our supplier, I was sitting at my desk and I literally slid off the chair because I could not believe what I was seeing,"" the 46-year-old told the BBC. With their food and fuel bills also going up, Mr Lane, who is a web developer, said the family was cutting back on holidays and non-essential spending to make up for rising costs. His eldest son is missing out on a camping trip abroad with his Scouts group so the family can afford a holiday this year, which Mr Lane said was ""pretty tough for him"". They are also trying to use less energy by avoiding using their tumble dryer and switching the TV and other devices off standby when they're not being used. ""They're small amounts, but over the years it's going to add up,"" he said. With people having to spend more money on necessities, this year will see the largest fall in household disposable income since 2011, and the second largest since records began in 1964, the Bank added. However, it expects inflation will peak this year before falling back to 3.5% in 2023 and to 1.5% by 2024. Russia is one of the world's top oil and gas producers and its invasion of Ukraine has driven up global energy prices amid concerns about disruption to supplies. Russia and Ukraine are also major producers of commodities like metals, fertilisers and foodstuffs, the prices of which have rocketed. A majority of six members of the Bank's MPC voted to lift interest rates to 1% but the remaining three members wanted a steeper rise to 1.25%. The MPC's forecasts are based on market expectations that interest rates will rise as high as 2.5% in mid-2023 before falling back again. Are you affected by UK interest rates rising?

Scotland's counts are now complete,and the full results can be found here. You can alsosearch for results in your local area here. The live coverage of theNorthern Ireland Assembly results continues here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The local elections don't hold up a perfect mirror to the whole country's desires, or exactly what would happen if a general election had just happened. But they are a valuable measure of the state of the battle of the two main parties who seek to govern us all. Caveats aside, the events of the last 24 hours do matter. Spin back a few weeks, and some Conservatives feared these elections would end in absolute calamity after months of extraordinary revelations about what had been going on in Downing Street during lockdown. The party feared an angry public would punish them at the ballot box. And rising anxiety about making ends meet would translate too into a kicking for the government. 
After all the turmoil, the prime minister's allies fretted. And some of Boris Johnson's detractors darkly hoped a meltdown would give them reason to act to oust him. Now that nearly everything has been counted, the Tories have lost nearly 500 seats across the UK. That represents around a quarter of the council seats they contested. Read more from Laura here Tommorrow's newspaper front pages point the finger at the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives for the performances of their parties in the location elections. The Times says the Tories have been ""punished"" in the south on England, reporting that voters in the party's heartlands are questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership. But the Daily Mail says it is Keir Starmer who is ""in crisis"". The paper has headlinedon Durham Police's investigationinto whether the Labour leader breached lockdown rules along with Labour's performance in the northern 'Red Wall', where the party made some gains but perhaps not on the scale that Labour might have hoped. The Guardian's coverage centres on criticism of Boris Johnson by senior Conservative figures, some of whom have blamed the PM for big Tory losses in London and the south. Susan Thomson was one of eight women who stood for election in the Western Isles Here's one story you might have missed in the flurry of updates today: the Western Isles in Scotland has elected female councillors for the first time since 2012. Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected for the SNP, and will be the only two women among the area's 27 councillors. Six other women who stood were not elected. The islands had beenseeking greater female representationon the local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, andheld a workshopearlier this year aimed at encouraging more women to stand. In 2017, for the first time in its history, no women were elected to the comhairle. Seven women stood for election that year. You can read more on this here. It's been a tough day for plenty of would-be councillors, but perhaps even tougher for candidates who lost out through pure chance. In at least three cases, ties for seats were decided through a sophisticated adjudication process - tossing a coin or drawing straws. Independent Andy Solloway won the Skipton West and West Craven division of the newNorth Yorkshireunitary authority after a representative for Labour rival Peter Madeley drew the short straw. Both men had received 503 votes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He says he still supports the prime minister but ""he has to use the summer months to build the confidence of the party"" going forward to the next general election. In north-east Wales, where the party routed Welsh Labour in the 2019 election, the Tories have fallen from the largest party in one council, Denbighshire, to fourth. That's a result that will do nothing to calm Welsh Tory nerves about Boris Johnson's ability to keep those 2019 Conservative converts on board. Read more analysis of results in Waleshere. The Conservatives have lost control of their only council in Wales. Labour has become the biggest party in Monmouthshire, with the final results now declared in the county. Labour secured 22 seats (up 12), Conservatives 18 (down 12), Greens one (up one). BBC Wales has been told that the Greens will work with Labour. One seat in the Llanfoist ward had to be settled by a coin toss after the Labour and Conservative candidates finished neck and neck. The coin came down in favour of the Tory. Elsewhere across Wales, Labour gained two councils and Plaid Cymru three. Labour regained Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and held Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport and Torfaen, while Plaid retained Gwynedd and gained Anglesey, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said he accepted things ""might not have gone our way"" in parts of Wales. ""We went into these elections with a difficult national picture and it appears that has had an impact,"" he said.

Lutfur Rahman, right, has defeated Labour's John Biggs, left, to become mayor of Tower Hamlets once again John Biggs, Labour's incumbent mayor of Tower Hamlets, has been beaten by Lutfur Rahman in a shock result. Rahman, standing for the Aspire party, wasremoved as mayor of the east London borough in 2015and banned from office for five years after being found guilty of election fraud. However, he beat Biggs after second preference votes were counted. Joseph LeeBBC News Here are some quirky stories we've found in this years election results... After a decade of Labour rule at Hull Council, leader Darren Hale clearly wasn't taking defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats lightly. He told the BBC that the loss was ""a great disappointment"", adding: ""You can't please all of the people all of the time."" Sounding like a man who had received at least one too many letters of complaint from the public, he added: ""I look forward to all the roadworks being completed in the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public, but we'll see.""

For all their importance, local elections aren't known for their star power. And Thurrock Council in Essex lost its bit of celebrity sparkle when Conservative councillor and former 80s singer David Van Day - half of pop duo Dollar - lost his seat to Labour by 20 votes. Still, it's not the first time he's bounced back from disappointment. After stepping out of the limelight, Van Day began to build a business career in the 2000s selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams in Brighton - earning him the nickname ""Burger Van Day"". We have been hearing thatSinn FÃ©in has secured the most first-preference votesin Northern Ireland's Assembly election. So how does the system work? While UK general elections allow voters to choose just one candidate in their local area, NI Assembly elections see voters rank multiple candidates. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. For each constituency, a quota of votes is calculated using a mathematical formula, based on the number of seats and the number of votes cast. Candidates who reach this number of votes from 'first preference votes' (where voters choose them as number one) are elected. If these candidates get votes above the quota number, their extra votes are transferred to other candidates - so the candidate marked ""2"" on those ballot papers gets those votes instead. The candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their second preferences get transferred to other candidates. The same process continues round by round with the lowest candidate being knocked out and their votes being transferred to candidates who are still in the race. You can read more on this here. Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes by a wide margin in Northern Ireland's Assembly election. The party received 250,388 first preferences, compared with the 184,002 returned for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - first preference votes for it have dropped by about 40,000.The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, NI voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been vying for top spot in this election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the offices of the first and deputy first minister are equal with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. Read more about the results in Northern Irelandhere. We're about two thirds of the way through this marathon. The final results should be all done by tomorrow evening. The story of the night is that theLiberal Democratshave made big gains while theConservativeshave sustained heavy losses across the country.Labour, entering this fight from an already high watermark in 2018, has made further gains from a strong starting point. TheGreens, too, are finding they have seats in some councils for the first time. InScotland, counting is complete and theSNPhave retained their first-place position in many councils, but Labour have now taken second place as the pro-union opposition. Until recently, that lead opposition job fell to the Conservatives. The SNP, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens have all made gains at the expense of the Conservatives. InWales, the Conservatives have suffered more losses, withPlaid Cymrumaking gains for control of some local authorities. Labour have put in a strong performance.

Last Mariupol defenders must surrender says Russia,"The UN humanitarian chief says a new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol There are thought to be about 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, stuck in the steel plant Vladimir Putin says Ukraine should order its fighters remaining in the Azovstal complex to surrender Capturing the whole of Mariupol would be symbolic for Moscow ahead of its annual 9 May Victory Day celebration Meanwhile, international donors have pledged $6.5bn to support Ukraine during a conference in Poland Edited by Andrew Humphrey Thanks for joining us for today's coverage from Ukraine. We're ending our live posts on this page now, but we'll pick things up again in a few hours. Our writers today were Alys Davies, Alexandra Fouche, Sofia Ferreira Santos, Emily McGarvey and Leo Sands. The editors were Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan, Emma Owen and Andrew Humphrey. You can find any major developing stories and in depth coverage on the BBC Newshome page. Goodnight. This video can not be played Drone footage shows damaged Azovstal steelworks where civilians still remain Just before we go, we wanted to share this drone footage showing the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. It gives an indication of how vast the complex is, and the devastation the industrial works has suffered. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross will attempt to evacuate the civilians still trapped there tomorrow. Once again, the plight of those in Mariupol was the focus of our coverage for much of the day. We'll be pausing our coverage shortly, so here's a recap of what's happened today. In Mariupol...  Internationally...  On Putin... The UN has documented 180 cases of civilians, journalists, and local politicians being arbitrarily detained or disappeared in Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine. Michelle Bachelet, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, said her office had also found eight similar cases in Ukrainian-controlled territory of possible enforced disappearances of pro-Russian individuals. ""In areas around Kyiv, from late February for about five weeks, Russian forces targeted male civilians who they considered suspicious,"" Bachelet said. According to evidence collected by her office, some of those individuals were ""taken to Belarus and Russia, unbeknownst to their families, and
held in pre-trial detention facilities"". Many of their families still do not know what has happened to them, she added. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Away from Ukraine, Nato says it will increase its presence around Sweden and the Baltic sea if Sweden applies to join the alliance, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Swedish broadcaster SVT. The secretary general highlighted the importance of protecting the country's borders while its Nato application is approved, which could take up to a year. ""From the potential moment Sweden is applying, and Nato says
that they want Sweden to join, there is a very strong obligation
from Nato to be able to guarantee Sweden's security,"" Stoltenberg
told SVT. Sweden and neighbouring Finland are expected to make a decision on whether they are applying to join Nato this month, as both countries have considered joining the alliance following the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is asking its Western allies for more weapons before it can launch a counteroffensive on Russia, which is likely to be late June at the earliest, when it expects to receive additional military aid. Here's a look at what aid has been sent so far: Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the possibility of the UK sending long-range weapons to help Ukraine's military - and the UK has already sent Ukraine thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles and some Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. The US sent Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles - andthey are now sending helicopters, long-range artillery and armoured personnel carriers. Slovakia sent its S-300 anti aircraft defence system, which can destroy aircraft up to 400km away. The US and Turkey have both sent drones armed with missiles. Several Nato countries are now supplying Ukraine with heavier weapons, to enable its army to push back against Russia's army, and they areplanning massively to increase the amounts they are spending on military aid. Some more details have emerged on plans for another evacuation attempt to rescue civilians trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol. ""Tomorrow, May 6, there will be an evacuation from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia,"" Ukraine's Deputy PM Iryna Vereshchukwrites in a Facebook post,external. She says residents should gather on Friday at 12:00 local (09:00 GMT) near Mariupol's Port City shopping centre, providing no further details. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross hope that a convoy of its buses intended to evacuate civilians trapped in Mariupol's besieged steelworks will reach the city tomorrow morning. Laura BickerBBC News We're now hearing that another evacuation convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Hundreds of civilians are thought to be trapped in the maze-like tunnels under the plant. Itâs hoped the buses will reach Mariupol by Friday morning. The operation is being run jointly by the UN and the Red Cross. Sarah RainsfordReporting from Makariv Almost every window of Makariv hospital, outside Kyiv, has been
blown out. There are holes from mortar fire in the car park and twisted pieces
of Russian missiles under a tree. Even so, the hospitalâs still working as a day clinic. When Russian tanks first rolled into the town, the hospital
director says staff strung white sheets on the roof marked with red crosses
hoping that would protect them. ""The 5th floor was hit by mortar fire,"" Galina
Romanenko recalls. ""When an ambulance drove out to get diesel, the Russians
shot right at it."" Doctors stacked sacks filled with soil inside the windows of their
operating theatre so they could go on treating the wounded, under fire.The hospital was treating up to two dozen injured people a day at the height of the fighting. They had to help many
others over the phone. ""Theyâd call to say they were wounded but surrounded. We even helped
a woman give birth by phone,"" Galina says. The hospital was evacuated on 7 March.
Ukrainian forces then moved into its grounds, drawing even heavier fire. At
that point an entire clinic was hit, leaving only the filing cabinets standing,
charred, among the wreckage. The UN is trying to organise another evacuation from Mariupol, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said. Speaking at a meeting of the body's Security Council, Guterres said that this was in addition to the two convoys that have already been completed successfully, including one that rescued 101 civilians who had been trapped in the city's massive Azovstal steelworks. The UN chief did not specify whether it applied to civilians in the steelworks or to those in the wider Mariupol area. ""It is our policy not to speak about details of [negotiations] before they are completed to avoid undermining possible success."" Guterres added: ""We must continue
to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes."". The luxury yacht, named 'The Amadea', is one of the largest in the world Sticking with sanctions, and a $300 million (Â£243m) luxury yacht owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov has been seized by authorities in Fiji after the US Justice Department requested it be held for violating sanctions and for alleged ties to corruption. The luxury yacht, the Amadea, which was berthed in Lautoka when it was seized, is 348-feet (105 metres) long and has eight cabins, a VIP stateroom, and a helipad. US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the department wants to make clear that there is ""no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime"". Kerimov is part-owner of Russia's Gazprom and an official of the Russian government. He was described by the US department as part of a group of oligarchs who ""profit from the Russian government through corruption and its malign activity around the globe, including the occupation of Crimea."" The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell speaking on 3 May The EU is close to agreeing on a sixth round of sanctions against Russia, the bloc's foreign policy chief has said. ""They are almost there. And we need this agreement because we have to push still more our economic and financial pressure on Russia,"" Josep Borrell said at an event in Italy. Yesterday the EU Commission proposed that the next round of sanctions includeda phased ban on Russian oil imports, which if approved would be its toughest move against the Russian energy sector to date. The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, is one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies. He has long given his backing to Russia's invasion, allowing troops to advance from his country's border when it began. But he has said he hadn't expected the operation to ""drag on this way"". In an interview with the Associated Press news agency Mr Lukashenko said that Russia's leader had had no choice but to act because Ukraine was ""provoking Russia"". But he said: ""I am not immersed in this problem enough to say whether it goes according to plan, like the Russians say, or like I feel it. ""I want to stress one more time: I feel like this operation has dragged on."" Mr Lukashenko also said he wanted the war to end, saying Belarus had ""done and are doing everything"" to stop it.

Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Civilians are helped over rubble at the steelworks plant There is renewed hope that civilians who are still trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol can be evacuated, as the UN and the Red Cross say a new convoy is expected on Friday. The situation at the site, surrounded by Russian forces, is rapidly deteriorating, with little food and water supplies. Meanwhile, the relatives of the hundreds of fighters who are also holed up there are desperate for an evacuation to include them too. âWeâre worried because the Russian attacks have been happening for three days and we still donât have contact with our fighters there,â Nataliia, whose brother is a fighter currently at the site, told me. âI donât know how our fighters are dealing with it. I cannot get any information.â She urged the Ukrainian government to come up with a plan for their rescue. Russian officials have urged them to lay down their arms. The fighters, however, say they will not surrender. A new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to try to evacuate the remaining civilians there, and is expected to arrive on Friday, the United Nations humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, says. More than 340 civilians were evacuated from different parts of Mariupol yesterday with the help of the UN and the Red Cross, Griffiths said. ""Today, as we speak, a convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning, hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell that they have inhabited for so many weeks and months and take them back to safety,"" Griffiths said. Numerous attempts had previously failed to get civilians out of the besieged city of Mariupol - butthe first successful evacuation of the steelworks happened earlier this week. Around 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, are still believed to be stuck underneath the steel plant. Unverified images posted by Luhansk officials apparently showing damage from Russian shelling In addition to overnight strikes on the city of Kramatorsk, Ukrainian officials say Russian attacks have resumed elsewhere in Ukraine's east. Russian shelling killed a 15-year-old boy in Kharkiv who was helping to evacuate animals from a zoo, the owner of the Feldman Ecopark zoo says. Two other people were badly wounded in the attack, he added. The governor of Mykolaiv says that the region and city ""were bombed all night"" wounding several people. Andin a Telegram post,externalthis afternoon, Luhansk's Ukrainian military commander says that the bodies of four men and one woman - all civilians - have been discovered in towns around the region after ""24 devastating attacks"" by Russian forces. The BBC has not been able to verify these reports. Andrew HardingReporting from Kramatorsk Within hours of the attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from the streets At least 25 people have been injured in a series of overnight explosions in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. Local officials said six civilians were severely wounded. The blasts â at least some believed to be the result of air strikes â damaged apartment blocks and shops in a residential neighbourhood of the city. One air strike appeared to have destroyed a local hot water plant surrounded by apartment blocks, leaving a huge crater perhaps four metres deep, and widespread damage to dozens of residential homes. In a short statement, the Donestsk regionâs military administration said that nine homes and a school were also significantly damaged. Less than a month ago,at least 50 people were killed when a missile hit the cityâs railway station. Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of a âmonstrous war crimeâ following the strike. Within hours of last nightâs attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from Kramatorskâs streets, while mechanical diggers removed larger blocks of concrete that had been torn apart in one blast. The EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulator warned that airlines may be at heightened risk due to the war in Ukraine. In a statement, the regulator said civil planes may be accidentally targeted and airlines could be struck by cyber-attacks while the conflict is ongoing. ""As shown by previous wars, misidentification is easy in
confused arenas of warfare"", the regulator said. In 2014, aMalaysia Airlines flight crashed while flying over conflict-hit eastern Ukraineafter it was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile. ""If we add in the likelihood of jamming
of electronic aids that may be involved with navigation and
or identification tools, then it is easy to see the potential
for innocent aircraft being subject to missiles or radar laid
weapons,"" the EASA added. The regulator also stated that there are potential risks related to military operations using civilian airports throughout the conflict. Paul KirbyBBC News Russia's Victory Day has become an annual event - the military parade in Red Square in Moscow and cities across Russia on 9 May - when the countrymarks its victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Under Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become a show of military strength as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two, when 27 million Soviet citizens died. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Instead of celebrating the overthrow of Ukraine's government, the Kremlin will have to settle for the capture of most of Mariupol. The city may lie in ruins, but Russia has repeatedly talked of ""de-Nazification and demilitarisation"" of Ukraine and it may claim defeat of the Azov battalion, which it has falsely portrayed as Nazi. That would resonate on a day marking World War Two. Read more aboutRussia's Victory Day parade. Vladimir Putin meeting with Israeli PM Naftali Bennett in Sochi last October Some more now from today's phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, which we reported earlier. Bennett has now said that Putin apologised to him forremarks earlier this week by his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovclaiming that Adolf Hitler was part-Jewish. Lavrov made the comments when asked in an interview how Russia could claim to be ""de-Nazifying"" Ukraine when its president is himself Jewish. In the interview, Russia's top diplomat said ""Hitler also had Jewish blood,"" adding: ""wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews."" The comments sparked outrage in Israel, which summoned the country's Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and demanded an apology. Prime Minister Bennett says he has accepted Putin's apology for the remarks and thanked him for clarifying his position. Â© 2025 BBC.

Voters head to polls in elections across UK,"Boris Johnson admits the local election results in some parts of England have been ""tough"" for the Tory party The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland The party has lost key London councils to Labour, and southern councils to the Liberal Democrats, who have gained more than 190 seats across England Sir Keir Starmer has hailed a ""really good set of results"" for Labour - however major gains in England have not been made outside London The BBC calculates that based on these results, if the whole country had been voting - Labour would have 35% of the vote, Conservative 30%, Lib Dems 19% and others 16% Labour has become the second largest party in the Scottish council elections, but the SNP continues to dominate In the Northern Ireland Assembly election, Sinn FÃ©in has received the largest number of first preference votes but the count is ongoing The Conservatives have seen heavy losses in Wales, while Plaid Cymru have made gains Emily McGarvey, Natasha Preskey, Richard Morris, Paul Gribben and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thank you for joining us today.

Scotland's counts are now complete,and the full results can be found here. You can alsosearch for results in your local area here. The live coverage of theNorthern Ireland Assembly results continues here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The local elections don't hold up a perfect mirror to the whole country's desires, or exactly what would happen if a general election had just happened. But they are a valuable measure of the state of the battle of the two main parties who seek to govern us all. Caveats aside, the events of the last 24 hours do matter. Spin back a few weeks, and some Conservatives feared these elections would end in absolute calamity after months of extraordinary revelations about what had been going on in Downing Street during lockdown. The party feared an angry public would punish them at the ballot box. And rising anxiety about making ends meet would translate too into a kicking for the government. 
After all the turmoil, the prime minister's allies fretted. And some of Boris Johnson's detractors darkly hoped a meltdown would give them reason to act to oust him. Now that nearly everything has been counted, the Tories have lost nearly 500 seats across the UK. That represents around a quarter of the council seats they contested. Read more from Laura here Tommorrow's newspaper front pages point the finger at the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives for the performances of their parties in the location elections. The Times says the Tories have been ""punished"" in the south on England, reporting that voters in the party's heartlands are questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership. But the Daily Mail says it is Keir Starmer who is ""in crisis"". The paper has headlinedon Durham Police's investigationinto whether the Labour leader breached lockdown rules along with Labour's performance in the northern 'Red Wall', where the party made some gains but perhaps not on the scale that Labour might have hoped. The Guardian's coverage centres on criticism of Boris Johnson by senior Conservative figures, some of whom have blamed the PM for big Tory losses in London and the south. Susan Thomson was one of eight women who stood for election in the Western Isles Here's one story you might have missed in the flurry of updates today: the Western Isles in Scotland has elected female councillors for the first time since 2012. Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected for the SNP, and will be the only two women among the area's 27 councillors. Six other women who stood were not elected. The islands had beenseeking greater female representationon the local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, andheld a workshopearlier this year aimed at encouraging more women to stand. In 2017, for the first time in its history, no women were elected to the comhairle. Seven women stood for election that year. You can read more on this here. It's been a tough day for plenty of would-be councillors, but perhaps even tougher for candidates who lost out through pure chance. In at least three cases, ties for seats were decided through a sophisticated adjudication process - tossing a coin or drawing straws. Independent Andy Solloway won the Skipton West and West Craven division of the newNorth Yorkshireunitary authority after a representative for Labour rival Peter Madeley drew the short straw. Both men had received 503 votes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Similarly, inCarmarthenshire, one result was settled by the toss of a coin, with Labour's Philip Warlow winning a seat in the Bigyn ward after fellow Labour candidate David Darkin guessed incorrectly. Darkin's mother, Janet Williams, had taken one of the ward's other seats. Janet Williams won a seat - but her son lost out due to a coin toss She said she was ""gutted"" for her son. Elsewhere, Tory Lilian Barker was elected in the Crackley and Red Street ward inNewcastle-under-Lyme, after drawing lots with Labour's Claire Radford. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey leaving a polling station in Kingston upon Thames yesterday One of the main stories today has been how the Liberal Democrats have managed to take so many southern English council seats out of Conservative hands: Outside of the South, theLib Dems gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull council, after taking it from Labour control. Labour lost two seats and the Lib Dems gained three. Dylan Tippetts came out as trans in 2018 Dylan Tippetts became Plymouth's first openly trans councillor earlier today, as well as the first Labour councillor in the city's Compton ward. Tippetts, 21, says he hopes his election will help young people who are yet to come out, as well as demonstrating that trans people are ""just normal human beings"". ""For me, it's bigger than just promoting equality and diversity in terms of trans people,"" he added. ""It's promoting the amazing diversity that we've got across our city in all walks of life."" Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Labour MP Luke Pollard tweeted his support for Tippetts, writing: ""As our city's first ever openly gay MP, I am simply over the moon. ""Now the hard work really begins."" Let's take a look at what's been happening around the UK. The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland, losing key London councils to Labour, and southern English councils to the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Daveyhailed the results as a ""turning point"" for his party. Boris Johnson said the Tories had faced a ""tough"" time. Labour struggled to make any major breakthroughs outside London, although it was already starting at a high watermark from 2018, when these seats were last contested. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party had had a ""really good set of results today"". In Wales,Labour have had 65 more councillors elected, bringing their total to 522. Plaid Cymru lost nine councillors but the party now has control of three more councils. The Conservatives lost 82 councillors, bringing their total to 110. The Liberal Democrats have gained an extra 11 councillors, and the Greens have had their first Welsh councillors elected. In Scotland,the SNP remain the firm favourite of Scottish voters- they've got 453 councillors, after having an extra 22 elected. Labour are up 20 at 282. The Conservatives have lost 63 at 214. There are now 87 Lib Dems, up 20, and the Greens are up 16 at 35. In Northern Ireland, the picture is still emerging, butSinn Fein have the largest first preference vote, followed by the DUP, who have lost around 40,000 first preference votes. Meanwhile, the Alliance party has made big gains. Bury, which made headlines in January whenBury South MP Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour, has seen Labour hold on. The Conservatives lost four seats and the Lib Dems lost three while Labour gained one. Six more independent councillors have been elected. Wakeford tweeted that he was ""immensely proud of the results"",external, describing them as a ""testament to the hard work all year round by Bury Labour"". Christian Wakeford defected to Labour following revelations about lockdown parties in No 10 Several Conservative council leaders have been blaming Boris Johnson after they suffered heavy local election defeats. John Mallinson, who lost in the new Cumberland Council, said voters did not feel the PM could be ""relied upon to tell the truth"". Wandsworth leader Ravi Govindia said ""national issues"" had caused the loss of the flagship council to Labour. But Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden said it was not time to change leader. Johnson said he took responsibility for the results, adding that it was clear voters wanted his government to focus on issues that mattered to them. Read more on this story here. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she shed a happy tear at the news of Roza Salih's election We know that the SNP has again finished as the biggest party in the Scottish council elections and it has emerged that one of its candidates - Roza Salih - has become the first former refugee to be elected to Glasgow City council. The 33-year-old says people in the city have ""always welcomed"" her. ""I've never given up, and now they've trusted in me,"" she said. ""I can't believe it. Twenty years ago I came to this country as a refugee, and to think back I would never have imagined to serve my city."" Salih's family fled Kurdistan in northern Iraq when she was a teenager. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she had shed a ""very happy tear"" at the news. You can read more on this here. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Sinn FÃ©in has polled the largest number of first preference votes in the Northern Ireland Assembly election by a long way. The first stage of the count is complete in all 18 constituencies. More than a quarter of a million people gave their â1â vote to the republican party. Sinn FÃ©in won 29% of the first preference vote- with the Democratic Unionists receiving 21.3%. Sinn FÃ©in increased its share by just over 1% - while the DUP has seen a drop of almost 7%. A fall in the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) vote - from 12% to 9% - suggests nationalist voters may have rallied around Sinn FÃ©in. A factor in this may be that pre-election polls suggested Sinn FÃ©in could deliver a nationalist first minister for the first time. The DUP seems to have taken a hit not from the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party - but from the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which takes a more hard-line position. The TUV has seen its vote share almost quadruple - to 7.6% - while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is down 1.7%. The final result will depend on the 2s, 3s 4s and beyond on the ballot paper. Itâs a complicated process, and counting is now expected to pause overnight and resume on Saturday. Most analysts believe Sinn FÃ©in is on course to win the largest number of seats. For breaking news developments in Northern Ireland, you can keep uphere. The chief secretary to the Treasury says his party ""should be getting right behind the prime minister"" despite losses in the local elections. Simon Clarke told BBC News it had ""not been an easy
night or day for the Conservative Party"". But he insisted that Boris Johnson had ""made the right calls on a whole host of issues since he came in"", such as Brexit, Covid and Ukraine. Clarke conceded that the partygate issue had been ""a difficult backdrop"" to the campaign. However, he said the PM had ""rightly and repeatedly apologised"" for the lockdown parties in Downing Street, and it was ""not the only factor at play"". He added: ""The government has lessons to learn and a new-found focus on delivery."" Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor The results emerging from Wales confirm the worst fears of the Welsh Conservatives. They were always expecting to suffer losses, but not on a scale that could wipe out all the gains they made in the last council elections five years ago. Their leader, Andrew RT Davies, blames the issues that have plagued Boris Johnson's government in Westminster - the cost of living crisis and partygate. He says he still supports the prime minister but ""he has to use the summer months to build the confidence of the party"" going forward to the next general election. In north-east Wales, where the party routed Welsh Labour in the 2019 election, the Tories have fallen from the largest party in one council, Denbighshire, to fourth. That's a result that will do nothing to calm Welsh Tory nerves about Boris Johnson's ability to keep those 2019 Conservative converts on board. Read more analysis of results in Waleshere. The Conservatives have lost control of their only council in Wales. Labour has become the biggest party in Monmouthshire, with the final results now declared in the county. Labour secured 22 seats (up 12), Conservatives 18 (down 12), Greens one (up one). BBC Wales has been told that the Greens will work with Labour. One seat in the Llanfoist ward had to be settled by a coin toss after the Labour and Conservative candidates finished neck and neck. The coin came down in favour of the Tory. Elsewhere across Wales, Labour gained two councils and Plaid Cymru three. Labour regained Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and held Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport and Torfaen, while Plaid retained Gwynedd and gained Anglesey, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said he accepted things ""might not have gone our way"" in parts of Wales. ""We went into these elections with a difficult national picture and it appears that has had an impact,"" he said.

Lutfur Rahman, right, has defeated Labour's John Biggs, left, to become mayor of Tower Hamlets once again John Biggs, Labour's incumbent mayor of Tower Hamlets, has been beaten by Lutfur Rahman in a shock result. Rahman, standing for the Aspire party, wasremoved as mayor of the east London borough in 2015and banned from office for five years after being found guilty of election fraud. However, he beat Biggs after second preference votes were counted. Joseph LeeBBC News Here are some quirky stories we've found in this years election results... After a decade of Labour rule at Hull Council, leader Darren Hale clearly wasn't taking defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats lightly. He told the BBC that the loss was ""a great disappointment"", adding: ""You can't please all of the people all of the time."" Sounding like a man who had received at least one too many letters of complaint from the public, he added: ""I look forward to all the roadworks being completed in the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public, but we'll see.""

For all their importance, local elections aren't known for their star power. And Thurrock Council in Essex lost its bit of celebrity sparkle when Conservative councillor and former 80s singer David Van Day - half of pop duo Dollar - lost his seat to Labour by 20 votes. Still, it's not the first time he's bounced back from disappointment. After stepping out of the limelight, Van Day began to build a business career in the 2000s selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams in Brighton - earning him the nickname ""Burger Van Day"". We have been hearing thatSinn FÃ©in has secured the most first-preference votesin Northern Ireland's Assembly election. So how does the system work? While UK general elections allow voters to choose just one candidate in their local area, NI Assembly elections see voters rank multiple candidates. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. For each constituency, a quota of votes is calculated using a mathematical formula, based on the number of seats and the number of votes cast. Candidates who reach this number of votes from 'first preference votes' (where voters choose them as number one) are elected. If these candidates get votes above the quota number, their extra votes are transferred to other candidates - so the candidate marked ""2"" on those ballot papers gets those votes instead. The candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their second preferences get transferred to other candidates. The same process continues round by round with the lowest candidate being knocked out and their votes being transferred to candidates who are still in the race. You can read more on this here. Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes by a wide margin in Northern Ireland's Assembly election. The party received 250,388 first preferences, compared with the 184,002 returned for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - first preference votes for it have dropped by about 40,000.The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, NI voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been vying for top spot in this election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the offices of the first and deputy first minister are equal with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. Read more about the results in Northern Irelandhere. We're about two thirds of the way through this marathon. The final results should be all done by tomorrow evening. The story of the night is that theLiberal Democratshave made big gains while theConservativeshave sustained heavy losses across the country.Labour, entering this fight from an already high watermark in 2018, has made further gains from a strong starting point. TheGreens, too, are finding they have seats in some councils for the first time. InScotland, counting is complete and theSNPhave retained their first-place position in many councils, but Labour have now taken second place as the pro-union opposition. Until recently, that lead opposition job fell to the Conservatives. The SNP, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens have all made gains at the expense of the Conservatives. InWales, the Conservatives have suffered more losses, withPlaid Cymrumaking gains for control of some local authorities. Labour have put in a strong performance.

Evacuation convoy heading to Mariupol 'hellscape' says UN,"The UN humanitarian chief says a new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol There are thought to be about 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, stuck in the steel plant Vladimir Putin says Ukraine should order its fighters remaining in the Azovstal complex to surrender Capturing the whole of Mariupol would be symbolic for Moscow ahead of its annual 9 May Victory Day celebration Meanwhile, international donors have pledged $6.5bn to support Ukraine during a conference in Poland Edited by Andrew Humphrey Thanks for joining us for today's coverage from Ukraine. We're ending our live posts on this page now, but we'll pick things up again in a few hours. Our writers today were Alys Davies, Alexandra Fouche, Sofia Ferreira Santos, Emily McGarvey and Leo Sands. The editors were Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan, Emma Owen and Andrew Humphrey. You can find any major developing stories and in depth coverage on the BBC Newshome page. Goodnight. This video can not be played Drone footage shows damaged Azovstal steelworks where civilians still remain Just before we go, we wanted to share this drone footage showing the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. It gives an indication of how vast the complex is, and the devastation the industrial works has suffered. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross will attempt to evacuate the civilians still trapped there tomorrow. Once again, the plight of those in Mariupol was the focus of our coverage for much of the day. We'll be pausing our coverage shortly, so here's a recap of what's happened today. In Mariupol...  Internationally...  On Putin... The UN has documented 180 cases of civilians, journalists, and local politicians being arbitrarily detained or disappeared in Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine. Michelle Bachelet, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, said her office had also found eight similar cases in Ukrainian-controlled territory of possible enforced disappearances of pro-Russian individuals. ""In areas around Kyiv, from late February for about five weeks, Russian forces targeted male civilians who they considered suspicious,"" Bachelet said. According to evidence collected by her office, some of those individuals were ""taken to Belarus and Russia, unbeknownst to their families, and
held in pre-trial detention facilities"". Many of their families still do not know what has happened to them, she added. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Away from Ukraine, Nato says it will increase its presence around Sweden and the Baltic sea if Sweden applies to join the alliance, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Swedish broadcaster SVT. The secretary general highlighted the importance of protecting the country's borders while its Nato application is approved, which could take up to a year. ""From the potential moment Sweden is applying, and Nato says
that they want Sweden to join, there is a very strong obligation
from Nato to be able to guarantee Sweden's security,"" Stoltenberg
told SVT. Sweden and neighbouring Finland are expected to make a decision on whether they are applying to join Nato this month, as both countries have considered joining the alliance following the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is asking its Western allies for more weapons before it can launch a counteroffensive on Russia, which is likely to be late June at the earliest, when it expects to receive additional military aid. Here's a look at what aid has been sent so far: Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the possibility of the UK sending long-range weapons to help Ukraine's military - and the UK has already sent Ukraine thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles and some Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. The US sent Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles - andthey are now sending helicopters, long-range artillery and armoured personnel carriers. Slovakia sent its S-300 anti aircraft defence system, which can destroy aircraft up to 400km away. The US and Turkey have both sent drones armed with missiles. Several Nato countries are now supplying Ukraine with heavier weapons, to enable its army to push back against Russia's army, and they areplanning massively to increase the amounts they are spending on military aid. Some more details have emerged on plans for another evacuation attempt to rescue civilians trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol. ""Tomorrow, May 6, there will be an evacuation from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia,"" Ukraine's Deputy PM Iryna Vereshchukwrites in a Facebook post,external. She says residents should gather on Friday at 12:00 local (09:00 GMT) near Mariupol's Port City shopping centre, providing no further details. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross hope that a convoy of its buses intended to evacuate civilians trapped in Mariupol's besieged steelworks will reach the city tomorrow morning. Laura BickerBBC News We're now hearing that another evacuation convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Hundreds of civilians are thought to be trapped in the maze-like tunnels under the plant. Itâs hoped the buses will reach Mariupol by Friday morning. The operation is being run jointly by the UN and the Red Cross. Sarah RainsfordReporting from Makariv Almost every window of Makariv hospital, outside Kyiv, has been
blown out. There are holes from mortar fire in the car park and twisted pieces
of Russian missiles under a tree. Even so, the hospitalâs still working as a day clinic. When Russian tanks first rolled into the town, the hospital
director says staff strung white sheets on the roof marked with red crosses
hoping that would protect them. ""The 5th floor was hit by mortar fire,"" Galina
Romanenko recalls. ""When an ambulance drove out to get diesel, the Russians
shot right at it."" Doctors stacked sacks filled with soil inside the windows of their
operating theatre so they could go on treating the wounded, under fire.The hospital was treating up to two dozen injured people a day at the height of the fighting. They had to help many
others over the phone. ""Theyâd call to say they were wounded but surrounded. We even helped
a woman give birth by phone,"" Galina says. The hospital was evacuated on 7 March.
Ukrainian forces then moved into its grounds, drawing even heavier fire. At
that point an entire clinic was hit, leaving only the filing cabinets standing,
charred, among the wreckage. The UN is trying to organise another evacuation from Mariupol, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said. Speaking at a meeting of the body's Security Council, Guterres said that this was in addition to the two convoys that have already been completed successfully, including one that rescued 101 civilians who had been trapped in the city's massive Azovstal steelworks. The UN chief did not specify whether it applied to civilians in the steelworks or to those in the wider Mariupol area. ""It is our policy not to speak about details of [negotiations] before they are completed to avoid undermining possible success."" Guterres added: ""We must continue
to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes."". The luxury yacht, named 'The Amadea', is one of the largest in the world Sticking with sanctions, and a $300 million (Â£243m) luxury yacht owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov has been seized by authorities in Fiji after the US Justice Department requested it be held for violating sanctions and for alleged ties to corruption. The luxury yacht, the Amadea, which was berthed in Lautoka when it was seized, is 348-feet (105 metres) long and has eight cabins, a VIP stateroom, and a helipad. US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the department wants to make clear that there is ""no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime"". Kerimov is part-owner of Russia's Gazprom and an official of the Russian government. He was described by the US department as part of a group of oligarchs who ""profit from the Russian government through corruption and its malign activity around the globe, including the occupation of Crimea."" The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell speaking on 3 May The EU is close to agreeing on a sixth round of sanctions against Russia, the bloc's foreign policy chief has said. ""They are almost there. And we need this agreement because we have to push still more our economic and financial pressure on Russia,"" Josep Borrell said at an event in Italy. Yesterday the EU Commission proposed that the next round of sanctions includeda phased ban on Russian oil imports, which if approved would be its toughest move against the Russian energy sector to date. The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, is one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies. He has long given his backing to Russia's invasion, allowing troops to advance from his country's border when it began. But he has said he hadn't expected the operation to ""drag on this way"". In an interview with the Associated Press news agency Mr Lukashenko said that Russia's leader had had no choice but to act because Ukraine was ""provoking Russia"". But he said: ""I am not immersed in this problem enough to say whether it goes according to plan, like the Russians say, or like I feel it. ""I want to stress one more time: I feel like this operation has dragged on."" Mr Lukashenko also said he wanted the war to end, saying Belarus had ""done and are doing everything"" to stop it.

Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Civilians are helped over rubble at the steelworks plant There is renewed hope that civilians who are still trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol can be evacuated, as the UN and the Red Cross say a new convoy is expected on Friday. The situation at the site, surrounded by Russian forces, is rapidly deteriorating, with little food and water supplies. Meanwhile, the relatives of the hundreds of fighters who are also holed up there are desperate for an evacuation to include them too. âWeâre worried because the Russian attacks have been happening for three days and we still donât have contact with our fighters there,â Nataliia, whose brother is a fighter currently at the site, told me. âI donât know how our fighters are dealing with it. I cannot get any information.â She urged the Ukrainian government to come up with a plan for their rescue. Russian officials have urged them to lay down their arms. The fighters, however, say they will not surrender. A new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to try to evacuate the remaining civilians there, and is expected to arrive on Friday, the United Nations humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, says. More than 340 civilians were evacuated from different parts of Mariupol yesterday with the help of the UN and the Red Cross, Griffiths said. ""Today, as we speak, a convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning, hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell that they have inhabited for so many weeks and months and take them back to safety,"" Griffiths said. Numerous attempts had previously failed to get civilians out of the besieged city of Mariupol - butthe first successful evacuation of the steelworks happened earlier this week. Around 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, are still believed to be stuck underneath the steel plant. Unverified images posted by Luhansk officials apparently showing damage from Russian shelling In addition to overnight strikes on the city of Kramatorsk, Ukrainian officials say Russian attacks have resumed elsewhere in Ukraine's east. Russian shelling killed a 15-year-old boy in Kharkiv who was helping to evacuate animals from a zoo, the owner of the Feldman Ecopark zoo says. Two other people were badly wounded in the attack, he added. The governor of Mykolaiv says that the region and city ""were bombed all night"" wounding several people. Andin a Telegram post,externalthis afternoon, Luhansk's Ukrainian military commander says that the bodies of four men and one woman - all civilians - have been discovered in towns around the region after ""24 devastating attacks"" by Russian forces. The BBC has not been able to verify these reports. Andrew HardingReporting from Kramatorsk Within hours of the attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from the streets At least 25 people have been injured in a series of overnight explosions in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. Local officials said six civilians were severely wounded. The blasts â at least some believed to be the result of air strikes â damaged apartment blocks and shops in a residential neighbourhood of the city. One air strike appeared to have destroyed a local hot water plant surrounded by apartment blocks, leaving a huge crater perhaps four metres deep, and widespread damage to dozens of residential homes. In a short statement, the Donestsk regionâs military administration said that nine homes and a school were also significantly damaged. Less than a month ago,at least 50 people were killed when a missile hit the cityâs railway station. Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of a âmonstrous war crimeâ following the strike. Within hours of last nightâs attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from Kramatorskâs streets, while mechanical diggers removed larger blocks of concrete that had been torn apart in one blast. The EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulator warned that airlines may be at heightened risk due to the war in Ukraine. In a statement, the regulator said civil planes may be accidentally targeted and airlines could be struck by cyber-attacks while the conflict is ongoing. ""As shown by previous wars, misidentification is easy in
confused arenas of warfare"", the regulator said. In 2014, aMalaysia Airlines flight crashed while flying over conflict-hit eastern Ukraineafter it was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile. ""If we add in the likelihood of jamming
of electronic aids that may be involved with navigation and
or identification tools, then it is easy to see the potential
for innocent aircraft being subject to missiles or radar laid
weapons,"" the EASA added. The regulator also stated that there are potential risks related to military operations using civilian airports throughout the conflict. Paul KirbyBBC News Russia's Victory Day has become an annual event - the military parade in Red Square in Moscow and cities across Russia on 9 May - when the countrymarks its victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Under Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become a show of military strength as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two, when 27 million Soviet citizens died. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Instead of celebrating the overthrow of Ukraine's government, the Kremlin will have to settle for the capture of most of Mariupol. The city may lie in ruins, but Russia has repeatedly talked of ""de-Nazification and demilitarisation"" of Ukraine and it may claim defeat of the Azov battalion, which it has falsely portrayed as Nazi. That would resonate on a day marking World War Two. Read more aboutRussia's Victory Day parade. Vladimir Putin meeting with Israeli PM Naftali Bennett in Sochi last October Some more now from today's phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, which we reported earlier. Bennett has now said that Putin apologised to him forremarks earlier this week by his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovclaiming that Adolf Hitler was part-Jewish. Lavrov made the comments when asked in an interview how Russia could claim to be ""de-Nazifying"" Ukraine when its president is himself Jewish. In the interview, Russia's top diplomat said ""Hitler also had Jewish blood,"" adding: ""wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews."" The comments sparked outrage in Israel, which summoned the country's Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and demanded an apology. Prime Minister Bennett says he has accepted Putin's apology for the remarks and thanked him for clarifying his position. Â© 2025 BBC.

McColl's convenience store chain on brink of collapse,"Convenience store chain McColl's is on the brink of collapse, placing thousands of UK jobs at risk. The retailer said it was ""increasingly likely"" it would fall into administration unless talks around a rescue deal were successful. It said that discussions about securing the future of the business are ongoing. More than 16,000 people are employed by McColl's, which has a partnership agreement with the supermarket chain Morrisons. McColl's said that without any fresh funding in the short-term, the group would likely ""be placed into administration with the objective of achieving a sale of the group to a third-party purchaser and securing the interests of creditors and employees"". On Friday,Sky News reported,externalthat Morrisons had proposed a deal to McColl's lenders which involved injecting funds into the struggling retailer. It reported that it would stop McColl's collapsing and save many jobs by keeping most of its 1,400 shops open. Morrisons declined to comment when contacted by the BBC. McColl's has a wholesale tie-up with Morrisons, as well as Martin's newsagents, with a strategy centred around an image of a ""neighbourhood retailer"". According to its website,external, it serves about five million customers each week, having been founded in Glasgow in 1901. Co-op store sales to McColl's approved Pret, McColls, Welcome Break in minimum wage fail But earlier this week, the listed company warned that its shares would be suspended because it was unable to meet the deadline for filing its annual results. McColl's said that its accounts would not be signed off in time to meet the deadline. Teresa Wickham, a former director at Safeway, told the BBC's Today programme that McColl's had been ""caught in a difficult place, particularly with Covid"". She said the pandemic came at a time when the firm was shifting its business model from running traditional convenience stores to selling more fresh produce in its partnership with Morrisons. Stores that had done this had done well, Ms Wickham said, as shopping habits shifted to buying more locally in the coronavirus crisis, but the chain had lacked investment, and only a small proportion of its stores had made the shift. ""They didn't quite have enough fresh produce, and also at the time during the pandemic we switched very quickly to online shopping,"" she said. ""It will survive, but whether all of it survives is a difficult thing to say."" McColl's successfully raised Â£30m from shareholders last year to invest in driving the expansion of its Morrisons Daily convenience stores, but at the time it warned that footfall had been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Around the same time, it and other firms also faced allegations from the government that it had failed to pay some of its workers the UK minimum wage. McColl's, Pret and Welcome Break said the underpayments were historic errorsand staff had been swiftly reimbursed. The businesses were made to pay back the money as well as being fined Â£3.2m over breaches, such as deducting pay from wages for uniforms and expenses, or failing to pay the correct apprenticeship rate.

Russians flee to Dubai to avoid sanctions,"Dubai has emerged as a haven for wealthy Russians fleeing the impact of western sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Russian billionaires and entrepreneurs have been arriving in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in unprecedented numbers, business leaders told the BBC. Property purchases in Dubai by Russians surged by 67% in the first three months of 2022, a report said. The UAE has not put sanctions on Russia or criticised its invasion of Ukraine. It is also providing visas to non-sanctioned Russians while many Western countries have restricted them. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have left Russia over the last two months - although exact figures are not available. One Russian economist saidas many as 200,000 Russians had left in the first 10 days after the war began. Virtuzone, which helps companies to set up operations in Dubai, has seen a huge surge of Russian clients. ""We are receiving five times more enquiries from Russians since the war began,"" said chief executive George Hojeige. ""They are worried about an economic meltdown that's coming. That is why they are moving here to secure their wealth,"" he added. Emirates to continue flying to Russia Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? The influx of Russian nationals has bolstered demand for luxury villas and apartments across the city. Real estate agents are reporting a surge in property prices, as Russians arriving in Dubai are looking to purchase homes. Dubai-based real estate agency Betterhomes found property purchases by Russianssurged by two thirds in the first three months of 2022.,external And another real estate agency, Modern Living, told the BBC it had hired many Russian-speaking agents to cater to rising demand. Chief executive Thiago Caldas said they were receiving numerous calls from Russian nationals looking to relocate to Dubai immediately. ""Russians who are coming down are not buying just for investment, they are looking at Dubai as a second home,"" he said. Many multinational companies and Russian start-ups are also relocating their employees to the UAE. Fuad Fatullaev is the co-founder of WeWay - a blockchain technology company that had offices in Russia and Ukraine. After the war broke out, he and his partners shifted hundreds of employees to Dubai. ""The war had a massive impact on our operations. We couldn't continue [as we were] as we had to move hundreds of people outside of Ukraine and Russia,"" says Mr Fatullaev, who is a Russian citizen. He adds that they chose to shift their employees to the UAE as it offers a safe economic and political environment to operate a business. He said Russian businesses were moving out as they were finding it incredibly difficult to operate due to sanctions. The challenge was even more acute for companies dealing with international clients and brands, as most western firms have severed ties with Russian-based enterprises, he said. Global firms like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Google that have shut down offices in Russia, are also relocating some of their employees to Dubai. ""There is definitely a brain drain that is happening. A lot of people are leaving because there are a lot of business restrictions right now,"" says Mr Fatullaev . Russia's central bank is barred from tapping into the billions of foreign reserves held overseas in foreign banks. Some Russian banks have been removed from the Swift financial messaging system. To protect its reserves, the Russian government has enacted capital restrictions and banned citizens from exiting the country with more than $10,000 in foreign currency. Finding it difficult to transfer cash, a lot of Russian buyers are making payments in cryptocurrencies. Some of the purchasers have an intermediary who will take the payment in crypto and then pass on the cash to the seller on behalf of the buyer. Gulf states including the UAE and Saudi Arabia have rejected calls from western governments to impose sanctions on Russia. The UAE was one of only three countries, along with China and India, to abstain in a United Nations Security Council vote in February to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also abstained in a General Assembly vote on 7 April to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. The rise in Russian investment comes just months after the UAE was placed on a ""grey list"" by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial crime watchdog. It means the country faces increased monitoring of its efforts to counter money laundering and terrorist financing. The UAE government has claimed to have taken significant measures to regulate inbound investment, and has stated that it remains committed to working closely with FATF on areas for improvement.

Plane returns to Heathrow after pilot roster error,"The Virgin Atlantic aircraft was bound for New York JFK Airport A Virgin Atlantic aircraft turned back to Heathrow after it emerged the first officer had not completed his final flying test. About 40 minutes into the flight to New York on Monday, the two pilots became aware of the ""rostering error"", the airline said. Flight VS3 had reached the skies over Ireland before returning to Heathrow. Virgin Atlantic said a replacement for the first officer was found and the plane departed again for New York. The airline insisted safety was not compromised and explained the initial first officer joined Virgin Atlantic in 2017. He was fully qualified under UK aviation regulations, the airline added, but had not completed a final assessment flight that was part of the airline's internal requirements. The flight turned back as the captain had not been designated as a trainer. Control of an aircraft is usually shared between a first officer and the captain, but the latter holds ultimate responsibility for what happens on a flight. A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: ""The qualified first officer, who was flying alongside an experienced captain, was replaced with a new pilot to ensure full compliance with Virgin Atlantic's training protocols, which exceed industry standards. ""We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers, who arrived two hours and 40 minutes later than scheduled as a result of the crew change.""

Shell profits nearly triple as oil prices surge,"Energy giant Shell has reported its highest ever quarterly profits as oil and gas prices surge around the world. Shell made $9.13bn (Â£7.3bn) in the first three months of the year, nearly triple its $3.2bn profit it announced for the same period last year. But the firm saidpulling out of Russian oil and gasdue to the Ukraine conflict had cost it $3.9bn (Â£3.1bn). On Tuesday, rival BP also reported a sharp rise in profit, but the UK has so far ruled out a windfall tax. The invasion of Ukraine has helped oil and gas prices skyrocket. Russia is one of the world's major exporters but Western nations have pledged to cut their dependence on the country for energy. Oil prices were already rising before the Ukraine war as economies started to recover from the Covid pandemic. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the war in Ukraine had caused ""significant disruption to global energy markets"". ""The impacts of this uncertainty and the higher cost that comes with it are being felt far and wide. ""We have been engaging with governments, our customers and suppliers to work through the challenging implications and provide support and solutions where we can."" Shell rivals, including BP and TotalEnergies have also reported a sharp rise in underlying profits. Norway's Equinor, which supplies a quarter of the UK's gas, also posted record earnings on Wednesday. Shell's profits were expected to be big. The price of oil and gas, already high at the end of last year, surged higher after the Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened disruption and eventual boycotts of one of the world's biggest suppliers of energy. These numbers surpassed those lofty expectations. The question now is what Shell will do with all this money. The company paid out Â£4.3bn to shareholders, which include millions of pension savers, in the last quarter and said it plans to dish out roughly the same in the next three months. Shell has already said it will invest Â£20bn to Â£25bn in the UK in the next decade in low carbon energy and in UK gas and oil supplies. Ministers will be watching closely to make sure Shell delivers on those commitments. It's the promise of investment that is standing between UK oil and gas companies and the windfall tax opposition parties have called for but the government has so far resisted. The high prices of oil and gas are pushing up the cost of living around the world. In the UK, inflation is running at 7%, its highest rate for 30 years, as energy bills, fuel costs and food prices jump. The Bank of Englandraised interest rates on Thursdayto try to temper inflation. One of the main contributors to UK inflation has been fuel prices, which are near record highs and could stay that way for months, according to some analysts. Demand for diesel has grown as the popularity of online shopping deliveries remains high, and inventories are low in the US and Europe. Russia is a major exporter of diesel, but the Ukraine invasion has made access to that limited. As part of Western sanctions, the European Union has proposed a total ban on Russian oil imports. Mr van Beurden said Shell was ""ahead of a ban or a boycott"" by getting out of its positions in Russia. The firm is in the process of ending all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom, as well as pulling out of its Russian petrol station and other businesses. He said a complete ban or boycott of Russian gas would be a ""major disaster"" which would leave a ""supply hole"" in Europe. Russia has demanded that payments for gas be made in roubles to try to prop up the currency, but the EU has said that may contravene sanctions. Mr van Beurden said that Shell will ""continue paying to the end of May and will have to see what happens after that"", adding that the firm will operate within sanctions. The UK government has so far ruled out a windfall tax on the oil companies, despite calls from opposition parties for one to be imposed. The Shell boss said that if a windfall tax was imposed on North Sea oil and gas profits, Shell would be unlikely to shelve UK green investment plans such as building more electric vehicle charging. Nevertheless, he added that Shell's plans would ""have to make economic sense when it comes to making those investment decisions on the day"". Shell plans to invest $25bn over the next decade, with 75% in green technologies, and the rest in oil and gas projects, including in the North Sea. The company's chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman, said its North Sea plans would see more ""energy security"" for the UK. However, Mr van Beurden acknowledged that oil firms sell their products on international markets, and that developing North Sea oil would not necessarily lower prices.

UK and Japan sign military pact amid Russia worry,"Boris Johnson has promised to work with other countries to take on ""autocratic, coercive powers"", after signing a defensive partnership with Japan. The prime minister met Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida in Downing Street, where the two nations also announced joint exercises and increased working together for disaster relief. The agreement is the first of its kind between Japan and a European country. It comes after both PMs condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The agreement also follows the UK government'sdefence and foreign policy integrated review, published last year, which announced a ""tilt"" towards the Indo-Pacific region. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The meeting between Mr Kishida and Mr Johnson also focused on how to exert pressure on Russia and help allies become less dependent on its oil and gas. Mr Johnson said: ""We in the UK recognise that our security in Europe is indivisible from the security, our collective security, in the Asia-Pacific, in the Indo-Pacific region. ""And there is direct read across from the actions of autocratic, coercive powers in Europe, to what may happen in east Asia. And that's why we want to work more closely together."" Japan, a member of the G7 group of leading economies, is part of the Western alliance defending Ukraine and has condemned the invasion, imposed sanctions on Russia and sent non-lethal military aid to Kyiv. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""Both leaders agreed that Russia's barbaric invasion marked the end of the post-Cold War period and had major implications for wider international stability."" Addressing UK business leaders at London's Guildhall ahead of his meeting with Mr Johnson, Mr Kishida said Japan would utilise nuclear reactors to reduce its dependence on Russian energy. Mr Johnson said the UK and Japan were ""focused on driving growth, creating highly skilled jobs and ensuring we remain technology superpowers"". He also announced that former Business Secretary Greg Clark, the Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells, as Britain's new trade envoy to Japan. During the meeting the two leaders ate popcorn from Fukushima, to mark the lifting of restrictions on food products from the Japanese region after the 2011 nuclear disaster. A flypast took place to mark the visit of Mr Kishida - his first to the UK since becoming prime minister last October - and included two Typhoon fighter jets and the RAF Voyager Vespina.

We're ending our live posts on this page now, but we'll pick things up again in a few hours. Our writers today were Alys Davies, Alexandra Fouche, Sofia Ferreira Santos, Emily McGarvey and Leo Sands. The editors were Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan, Emma Owen and Andrew Humphrey. You can find any major developing stories and in depth coverage on the BBC Newshome page. Goodnight. This video can not be played Drone footage shows damaged Azovstal steelworks where civilians still remain Just before we go, we wanted to share this drone footage showing the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. It gives an indication of how vast the complex is, and the devastation the industrial works has suffered. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross will attempt to evacuate the civilians still trapped there tomorrow. Once again, the plight of those in Mariupol was the focus of our coverage for much of the day. We'll be pausing our coverage shortly, so here's a recap of what's happened today. In Mariupol...  Internationally...  On Putin... The UN has documented 180 cases of civilians, journalists, and local politicians being arbitrarily detained or disappeared in Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine. Michelle Bachelet, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, said her office had also found eight similar cases in Ukrainian-controlled territory of possible enforced disappearances of pro-Russian individuals. ""In areas around Kyiv, from late February for about five weeks, Russian forces targeted male civilians who they considered suspicious,"" Bachelet said. According to evidence collected by her office, some of those individuals were ""taken to Belarus and Russia, unbeknownst to their families, and
held in pre-trial detention facilities"". Many of their families still do not know what has happened to them, she added. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Away from Ukraine, Nato says it will increase its presence around Sweden and the Baltic sea if Sweden applies to join the alliance, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Swedish broadcaster SVT. The secretary general highlighted the importance of protecting the country's borders while its Nato application is approved, which could take up to a year. ""From the potential moment Sweden is applying, and Nato says
that they want Sweden to join, there is a very strong obligation
from Nato to be able to guarantee Sweden's security,"" Stoltenberg
told SVT. Sweden and neighbouring Finland are expected to make a decision on whether they are applying to join Nato this month, as both countries have considered joining the alliance following the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is asking its Western allies for more weapons before it can launch a counteroffensive on Russia, which is likely to be late June at the earliest, when it expects to receive additional military aid. Here's a look at what aid has been sent so far: Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the possibility of the UK sending long-range weapons to help Ukraine's military - and the UK has already sent Ukraine thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles and some Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. The US sent Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles - andthey are now sending helicopters, long-range artillery and armoured personnel carriers. Slovakia sent its S-300 anti aircraft defence system, which can destroy aircraft up to 400km away. The US and Turkey have both sent drones armed with missiles. Several Nato countries are now supplying Ukraine with heavier weapons, to enable its army to push back against Russia's army, and they areplanning massively to increase the amounts they are spending on military aid. Some more details have emerged on plans for another evacuation attempt to rescue civilians trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol. ""Tomorrow, May 6, there will be an evacuation from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia,"" Ukraine's Deputy PM Iryna Vereshchukwrites in a Facebook post,external. She says residents should gather on Friday at 12:00 local (09:00 GMT) near Mariupol's Port City shopping centre, providing no further details. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross hope that a convoy of its buses intended to evacuate civilians trapped in Mariupol's besieged steelworks will reach the city tomorrow morning. Laura BickerBBC News We're now hearing that another evacuation convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Hundreds of civilians are thought to be trapped in the maze-like tunnels under the plant. Itâs hoped the buses will reach Mariupol by Friday morning. The operation is being run jointly by the UN and the Red Cross. Sarah RainsfordReporting from Makariv Almost every window of Makariv hospital, outside Kyiv, has been
blown out. There are holes from mortar fire in the car park and twisted pieces
of Russian missiles under a tree. Even so, the hospitalâs still working as a day clinic. When Russian tanks first rolled into the town, the hospital
director says staff strung white sheets on the roof marked with red crosses
hoping that would protect them. ""The 5th floor was hit by mortar fire,"" Galina
Romanenko recalls. ""When an ambulance drove out to get diesel, the Russians
shot right at it."" Doctors stacked sacks filled with soil inside the windows of their
operating theatre so they could go on treating the wounded, under fire.The hospital was treating up to two dozen injured people a day at the height of the fighting. They had to help many
others over the phone. ""Theyâd call to say they were wounded but surrounded. We even helped
a woman give birth by phone,"" Galina says. The hospital was evacuated on 7 March.
Ukrainian forces then moved into its grounds, drawing even heavier fire. At
that point an entire clinic was hit, leaving only the filing cabinets standing,
charred, among the wreckage. The UN is trying to organise another evacuation from Mariupol, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said. Speaking at a meeting of the body's Security Council, Guterres said that this was in addition to the two convoys that have already been completed successfully, including one that rescued 101 civilians who had been trapped in the city's massive Azovstal steelworks. The UN chief did not specify whether it applied to civilians in the steelworks or to those in the wider Mariupol area. ""It is our policy not to speak about details of [negotiations] before they are completed to avoid undermining possible success."" Guterres added: ""We must continue
to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes."". The luxury yacht, named 'The Amadea', is one of the largest in the world Sticking with sanctions, and a $300 million (Â£243m) luxury yacht owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov has been seized by authorities in Fiji after the US Justice Department requested it be held for violating sanctions and for alleged ties to corruption. The luxury yacht, the Amadea, which was berthed in Lautoka when it was seized, is 348-feet (105 metres) long and has eight cabins, a VIP stateroom, and a helipad. US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the department wants to make clear that there is ""no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime"". Kerimov is part-owner of Russia's Gazprom and an official of the Russian government. He was described by the US department as part of a group of oligarchs who ""profit from the Russian government through corruption and its malign activity around the globe, including the occupation of Crimea."" The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell speaking on 3 May The EU is close to agreeing on a sixth round of sanctions against Russia, the bloc's foreign policy chief has said. ""They are almost there. And we need this agreement because we have to push still more our economic and financial pressure on Russia,"" Josep Borrell said at an event in Italy. Yesterday the EU Commission proposed that the next round of sanctions includeda phased ban on Russian oil imports, which if approved would be its toughest move against the Russian energy sector to date. The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, is one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies. He has long given his backing to Russia's invasion, allowing troops to advance from his country's border when it began. But he has said he hadn't expected the operation to ""drag on this way"". In an interview with the Associated Press news agency Mr Lukashenko said that Russia's leader had had no choice but to act because Ukraine was ""provoking Russia"". But he said: ""I am not immersed in this problem enough to say whether it goes according to plan, like the Russians say, or like I feel it. ""I want to stress one more time: I feel like this operation has dragged on."" Mr Lukashenko also said he wanted the war to end, saying Belarus had ""done and are doing everything"" to stop it.

Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Civilians are helped over rubble at the steelworks plant There is renewed hope that civilians who are still trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol can be evacuated, as the UN and the Red Cross say a new convoy is expected on Friday. The situation at the site, surrounded by Russian forces, is rapidly deteriorating, with little food and water supplies. Meanwhile, the relatives of the hundreds of fighters who are also holed up there are desperate for an evacuation to include them too. âWeâre worried because the Russian attacks have been happening for three days and we still donât have contact with our fighters there,â Nataliia, whose brother is a fighter currently at the site, told me. âI donât know how our fighters are dealing with it. I cannot get any information.â She urged the Ukrainian government to come up with a plan for their rescue. Russian officials have urged them to lay down their arms. The fighters, however, say they will not surrender. A new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to try to evacuate the remaining civilians there, and is expected to arrive on Friday, the United Nations humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, says. More than 340 civilians were evacuated from different parts of Mariupol yesterday with the help of the UN and the Red Cross, Griffiths said. ""Today, as we speak, a convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning, hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell that they have inhabited for so many weeks and months and take them back to safety,"" Griffiths said. Numerous attempts had previously failed to get civilians out of the besieged city of Mariupol - butthe first successful evacuation of the steelworks happened earlier this week. Around 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, are still believed to be stuck underneath the steel plant. Unverified images posted by Luhansk officials apparently showing damage from Russian shelling In addition to overnight strikes on the city of Kramatorsk, Ukrainian officials say Russian attacks have resumed elsewhere in Ukraine's east. Russian shelling killed a 15-year-old boy in Kharkiv who was helping to evacuate animals from a zoo, the owner of the Feldman Ecopark zoo says. Two other people were badly wounded in the attack, he added. The governor of Mykolaiv says that the region and city ""were bombed all night"" wounding several people. Andin a Telegram post,externalthis afternoon, Luhansk's Ukrainian military commander says that the bodies of four men and one woman - all civilians - have been discovered in towns around the region after ""24 devastating attacks"" by Russian forces. The BBC has not been able to verify these reports. Andrew HardingReporting from Kramatorsk Within hours of the attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from the streets At least 25 people have been injured in a series of overnight explosions in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. Local officials said six civilians were severely wounded. The blasts â at least some believed to be the result of air strikes â damaged apartment blocks and shops in a residential neighbourhood of the city. One air strike appeared to have destroyed a local hot water plant surrounded by apartment blocks, leaving a huge crater perhaps four metres deep, and widespread damage to dozens of residential homes. In a short statement, the Donestsk regionâs military administration said that nine homes and a school were also significantly damaged. Less than a month ago,at least 50 people were killed when a missile hit the cityâs railway station. Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of a âmonstrous war crimeâ following the strike. Within hours of last nightâs attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from Kramatorskâs streets, while mechanical diggers removed larger blocks of concrete that had been torn apart in one blast. The EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulator warned that airlines may be at heightened risk due to the war in Ukraine. In a statement, the regulator said civil planes may be accidentally targeted and airlines could be struck by cyber-attacks while the conflict is ongoing. ""As shown by previous wars, misidentification is easy in
confused arenas of warfare"", the regulator said. In 2014, aMalaysia Airlines flight crashed while flying over conflict-hit eastern Ukraineafter it was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile. ""If we add in the likelihood of jamming
of electronic aids that may be involved with navigation and
or identification tools, then it is easy to see the potential
for innocent aircraft being subject to missiles or radar laid
weapons,"" the EASA added. The regulator also stated that there are potential risks related to military operations using civilian airports throughout the conflict. Paul KirbyBBC News Russia's Victory Day has become an annual event - the military parade in Red Square in Moscow and cities across Russia on 9 May - when the countrymarks its victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Under Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become a show of military strength as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two, when 27 million Soviet citizens died. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Instead of celebrating the overthrow of Ukraine's government, the Kremlin will have to settle for the capture of most of Mariupol. The city may lie in ruins, but Russia has repeatedly talked of ""de-Nazification and demilitarisation"" of Ukraine and it may claim defeat of the Azov battalion, which it has falsely portrayed as Nazi. That would resonate on a day marking World War Two. Read more aboutRussia's Victory Day parade. Vladimir Putin meeting with Israeli PM Naftali Bennett in Sochi last October Some more now from today's phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, which we reported earlier. Bennett has now said that Putin apologised to him forremarks earlier this week by his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovclaiming that Adolf Hitler was part-Jewish. Lavrov made the comments when asked in an interview how Russia could claim to be ""de-Nazifying"" Ukraine when its president is himself Jewish. In the interview, Russia's top diplomat said ""Hitler also had Jewish blood,"" adding: ""wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews."" The comments sparked outrage in Israel, which summoned the country's Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and demanded an apology. Prime Minister Bennett says he has accepted Putin's apology for the remarks and thanked him for clarifying his position. Â© 2025 BBC.

Poo converts harmful CO2 to useful chemicals,"Dr Rhiannon Chalmers-Brown runs the research project at the steelworks Carbon emissions from Tata Steel blast furnaces are being converted to chemicals in a project which could help large polluters lower their carbon footprint. Gases from the firm's Port Talbot steelworks are mixed with tiny bacteria from sewage plant samples. The bacteria produce acetic acid, which is used to make chemicals for different industries. ""Microbes have always been able to do it,"" Dr Rhiannon Chalmers-Brown said. ""We are just taking them and using them in this way,"" the researcher from the University of South Wales, who runs the trial project, added. Researchers say this process could be used to get rid of the CO2 coming from the chimneys of many different industries . Tata Steel is the biggest emitter of CO2 in the UK and has already taken steps to reduce its impact on the planet . The CO2 that comes from the chimneys of its two blast furnaces at Port Talbot, where it makes steel for use in its steelworks across the UK, is considerable. Dr Chalmers-Brown started researching the process in the university's labs and is now running a pilot project at the steelworks. Tata Steel is one of the funders of the research project at the University of South Wales. A pipe takes some of the gases from the blast furnace into pilot project's testing area A long large pipe takes the gases produced in the blast furnace to other parts of the works, but a small pipe guides some of those gases into the testing area. Dr Chalmers-Brown explains how the gases, CO2 and Carbon Monoxide from the blast furnace ""feed"" the microbes used for the project. The climate-damaging gases are then turned into acetic acids that can be used by a wide range of manufacturers in industries from paint manufacturing to food production. They could even be used to colour coat steel at Tata's plant in Shotton, Flintshire. The pilot project at the Port Talbot steelworks The gases enter a metal reactor that is about 4ft (1.2 metres) tall where they are mixed with live microbes taken from ""sewage sludge "" or poo. ""They are little bacteria that swim around in our reactor and they eat the gases and make acetic acid for us,"" Dr Chalmers-Brown says. For Tata Steel, the project is one of many ways in which it is trying to make steel production cleaner. In addition, it is turning the CO2 it produces into a useful product, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere and causing damage. It is a climate change solution known as ""Carbon Capture and Use"". Martin Brunnock from Tata Steel says the CO2 could be used to create other products ""Ultimately we use as much gas as we can and the gas that we can't use is flared into the atmosphere,"" said Martin Brunnock, Tata Steel's Sustainability Spokesman said. ""This project has the potential to create value from that CO2 and that could be used to create other products."" Cutting emissions is the main incentive for funding this pilot. Tata Steel has committed to reducing the amount of CO2 it releases into the air by 30% by 2030 . Demand for steel is expected to increase as new renewable and nuclear energy plants are built . The blast furnaces where molten steel is made from coal and iron ore are under most scrutiny. Tata Steel could instead use electric furnaces or turn to hydrogen as a fuel.

Michelle Bachelet, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, said her office had also found eight similar cases in Ukrainian-controlled territory of possible enforced disappearances of pro-Russian individuals. ""In areas around Kyiv, from late February for about five weeks, Russian forces targeted male civilians who they considered suspicious,"" Bachelet said. According to evidence collected by her office, some of those individuals were ""taken to Belarus and Russia, unbeknownst to their families, and
held in pre-trial detention facilities"". Many of their families still do not know what has happened to them, she added. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Away from Ukraine, Nato says it will increase its presence around Sweden and the Baltic sea if Sweden applies to join the alliance, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Swedish broadcaster SVT. The secretary general highlighted the importance of protecting the country's borders while its Nato application is approved, which could take up to a year. ""From the potential moment Sweden is applying, and Nato says
that they want Sweden to join, there is a very strong obligation
from Nato to be able to guarantee Sweden's security,"" Stoltenberg
told SVT. Sweden and neighbouring Finland are expected to make a decision on whether they are applying to join Nato this month, as both countries have considered joining the alliance following the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is asking its Western allies for more weapons before it can launch a counteroffensive on Russia, which is likely to be late June at the earliest, when it expects to receive additional military aid. Here's a look at what aid has been sent so far: Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the possibility of the UK sending long-range weapons to help Ukraine's military - and the UK has already sent Ukraine thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles and some Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. The US sent Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles - andthey are now sending helicopters, long-range artillery and armoured personnel carriers. Slovakia sent its S-300 anti aircraft defence system, which can destroy aircraft up to 400km away. The US and Turkey have both sent drones armed with missiles. Several Nato countries are now supplying Ukraine with heavier weapons, to enable its army to push back against Russia's army, and they areplanning massively to increase the amounts they are spending on military aid. Some more details have emerged on plans for another evacuation attempt to rescue civilians trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol. ""Tomorrow, May 6, there will be an evacuation from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia,"" Ukraine's Deputy PM Iryna Vereshchukwrites in a Facebook post,external. She says residents should gather on Friday at 12:00 local (09:00 GMT) near Mariupol's Port City shopping centre, providing no further details. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross hope that a convoy of its buses intended to evacuate civilians trapped in Mariupol's besieged steelworks will reach the city tomorrow morning. Laura BickerBBC News We're now hearing that another evacuation convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Hundreds of civilians are thought to be trapped in the maze-like tunnels under the plant. Itâs hoped the buses will reach Mariupol by Friday morning. The operation is being run jointly by the UN and the Red Cross. Sarah RainsfordReporting from Makariv Almost every window of Makariv hospital, outside Kyiv, has been
blown out. There are holes from mortar fire in the car park and twisted pieces
of Russian missiles under a tree. Even so, the hospitalâs still working as a day clinic. When Russian tanks first rolled into the town, the hospital
director says staff strung white sheets on the roof marked with red crosses
hoping that would protect them. ""The 5th floor was hit by mortar fire,"" Galina
Romanenko recalls. ""When an ambulance drove out to get diesel, the Russians
shot right at it."" Doctors stacked sacks filled with soil inside the windows of their
operating theatre so they could go on treating the wounded, under fire.The hospital was treating up to two dozen injured people a day at the height of the fighting. They had to help many
others over the phone. ""Theyâd call to say they were wounded but surrounded. We even helped
a woman give birth by phone,"" Galina says. The hospital was evacuated on 7 March.
Ukrainian forces then moved into its grounds, drawing even heavier fire. At
that point an entire clinic was hit, leaving only the filing cabinets standing,
charred, among the wreckage. The UN is trying to organise another evacuation from Mariupol, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said. Speaking at a meeting of the body's Security Council, Guterres said that this was in addition to the two convoys that have already been completed successfully, including one that rescued 101 civilians who had been trapped in the city's massive Azovstal steelworks. The UN chief did not specify whether it applied to civilians in the steelworks or to those in the wider Mariupol area. ""It is our policy not to speak about details of [negotiations] before they are completed to avoid undermining possible success."" Guterres added: ""We must continue
to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes."". The luxury yacht, named 'The Amadea', is one of the largest in the world Sticking with sanctions, and a $300 million (Â£243m) luxury yacht owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov has been seized by authorities in Fiji after the US Justice Department requested it be held for violating sanctions and for alleged ties to corruption. The luxury yacht, the Amadea, which was berthed in Lautoka when it was seized, is 348-feet (105 metres) long and has eight cabins, a VIP stateroom, and a helipad. US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the department wants to make clear that there is ""no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime"". Kerimov is part-owner of Russia's Gazprom and an official of the Russian government. He was described by the US department as part of a group of oligarchs who ""profit from the Russian government through corruption and its malign activity around the globe, including the occupation of Crimea."" The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell speaking on 3 May The EU is close to agreeing on a sixth round of sanctions against Russia, the bloc's foreign policy chief has said. ""They are almost there. And we need this agreement because we have to push still more our economic and financial pressure on Russia,"" Josep Borrell said at an event in Italy. Yesterday the EU Commission proposed that the next round of sanctions includeda phased ban on Russian oil imports, which if approved would be its toughest move against the Russian energy sector to date. The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, is one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies. He has long given his backing to Russia's invasion, allowing troops to advance from his country's border when it began. But he has said he hadn't expected the operation to ""drag on this way"". In an interview with the Associated Press news agency Mr Lukashenko said that Russia's leader had had no choice but to act because Ukraine was ""provoking Russia"". But he said: ""I am not immersed in this problem enough to say whether it goes according to plan, like the Russians say, or like I feel it. ""I want to stress one more time: I feel like this operation has dragged on."" Mr Lukashenko also said he wanted the war to end, saying Belarus had ""done and are doing everything"" to stop it.

Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Civilians are helped over rubble at the steelworks plant There is renewed hope that civilians who are still trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol can be evacuated, as the UN and the Red Cross say a new convoy is expected on Friday. The situation at the site, surrounded by Russian forces, is rapidly deteriorating, with little food and water supplies. Meanwhile, the relatives of the hundreds of fighters who are also holed up there are desperate for an evacuation to include them too. âWeâre worried because the Russian attacks have been happening for three days and we still donât have contact with our fighters there,â Nataliia, whose brother is a fighter currently at the site, told me. âI donât know how our fighters are dealing with it. I cannot get any information.â She urged the Ukrainian government to come up with a plan for their rescue. Russian officials have urged them to lay down their arms. The fighters, however, say they will not surrender. A new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to try to evacuate the remaining civilians there, and is expected to arrive on Friday, the United Nations humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, says. More than 340 civilians were evacuated from different parts of Mariupol yesterday with the help of the UN and the Red Cross, Griffiths said. ""Today, as we speak, a convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning, hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell that they have inhabited for so many weeks and months and take them back to safety,"" Griffiths said. Numerous attempts had previously failed to get civilians out of the besieged city of Mariupol - butthe first successful evacuation of the steelworks happened earlier this week. Around 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, are still believed to be stuck underneath the steel plant. Unverified images posted by Luhansk officials apparently showing damage from Russian shelling In addition to overnight strikes on the city of Kramatorsk, Ukrainian officials say Russian attacks have resumed elsewhere in Ukraine's east. Russian shelling killed a 15-year-old boy in Kharkiv who was helping to evacuate animals from a zoo, the owner of the Feldman Ecopark zoo says. Two other people were badly wounded in the attack, he added. The governor of Mykolaiv says that the region and city ""were bombed all night"" wounding several people. Andin a Telegram post,externalthis afternoon, Luhansk's Ukrainian military commander says that the bodies of four men and one woman - all civilians - have been discovered in towns around the region after ""24 devastating attacks"" by Russian forces. The BBC has not been able to verify these reports. Andrew HardingReporting from Kramatorsk Within hours of the attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from the streets At least 25 people have been injured in a series of overnight explosions in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. Local officials said six civilians were severely wounded. The blasts â at least some believed to be the result of air strikes â damaged apartment blocks and shops in a residential neighbourhood of the city. One air strike appeared to have destroyed a local hot water plant surrounded by apartment blocks, leaving a huge crater perhaps four metres deep, and widespread damage to dozens of residential homes. In a short statement, the Donestsk regionâs military administration said that nine homes and a school were also significantly damaged. Less than a month ago,at least 50 people were killed when a missile hit the cityâs railway station. Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of a âmonstrous war crimeâ following the strike. Within hours of last nightâs attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from Kramatorskâs streets, while mechanical diggers removed larger blocks of concrete that had been torn apart in one blast. The EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulator warned that airlines may be at heightened risk due to the war in Ukraine. In a statement, the regulator said civil planes may be accidentally targeted and airlines could be struck by cyber-attacks while the conflict is ongoing. ""As shown by previous wars, misidentification is easy in
confused arenas of warfare"", the regulator said. In 2014, aMalaysia Airlines flight crashed while flying over conflict-hit eastern Ukraineafter it was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile. ""If we add in the likelihood of jamming
of electronic aids that may be involved with navigation and
or identification tools, then it is easy to see the potential
for innocent aircraft being subject to missiles or radar laid
weapons,"" the EASA added. The regulator also stated that there are potential risks related to military operations using civilian airports throughout the conflict. Paul KirbyBBC News Russia's Victory Day has become an annual event - the military parade in Red Square in Moscow and cities across Russia on 9 May - when the countrymarks its victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Under Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become a show of military strength as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two, when 27 million Soviet citizens died. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Instead of celebrating the overthrow of Ukraine's government, the Kremlin will have to settle for the capture of most of Mariupol. The city may lie in ruins, but Russia has repeatedly talked of ""de-Nazification and demilitarisation"" of Ukraine and it may claim defeat of the Azov battalion, which it has falsely portrayed as Nazi. That would resonate on a day marking World War Two. Read more aboutRussia's Victory Day parade. Vladimir Putin meeting with Israeli PM Naftali Bennett in Sochi last October Some more now from today's phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, which we reported earlier. Bennett has now said that Putin apologised to him forremarks earlier this week by his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovclaiming that Adolf Hitler was part-Jewish. Lavrov made the comments when asked in an interview how Russia could claim to be ""de-Nazifying"" Ukraine when its president is himself Jewish. In the interview, Russia's top diplomat said ""Hitler also had Jewish blood,"" adding: ""wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews."" The comments sparked outrage in Israel, which summoned the country's Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and demanded an apology. Prime Minister Bennett says he has accepted Putin's apology for the remarks and thanked him for clarifying his position. Â© 2025 BBC.

Russia on agenda as Johnson hosts Japanese PM,"Boris Johnson has promised to work with other countries to take on ""autocratic, coercive powers"", after signing a defensive partnership with Japan. The prime minister met Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida in Downing Street, where the two nations also announced joint exercises and increased working together for disaster relief. The agreement is the first of its kind between Japan and a European country. It comes after both PMs condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The agreement also follows the UK government'sdefence and foreign policy integrated review, published last year, which announced a ""tilt"" towards the Indo-Pacific region. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The meeting between Mr Kishida and Mr Johnson also focused on how to exert pressure on Russia and help allies become less dependent on its oil and gas. Mr Johnson said: ""We in the UK recognise that our security in Europe is indivisible from the security, our collective security, in the Asia-Pacific, in the Indo-Pacific region. ""And there is direct read across from the actions of autocratic, coercive powers in Europe, to what may happen in east Asia. And that's why we want to work more closely together."" Japan, a member of the G7 group of leading economies, is part of the Western alliance defending Ukraine and has condemned the invasion, imposed sanctions on Russia and sent non-lethal military aid to Kyiv. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""Both leaders agreed that Russia's barbaric invasion marked the end of the post-Cold War period and had major implications for wider international stability."" Addressing UK business leaders at London's Guildhall ahead of his meeting with Mr Johnson, Mr Kishida said Japan would utilise nuclear reactors to reduce its dependence on Russian energy. Mr Johnson said the UK and Japan were ""focused on driving growth, creating highly skilled jobs and ensuring we remain technology superpowers"". He also announced that former Business Secretary Greg Clark, the Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells, as Britain's new trade envoy to Japan. During the meeting the two leaders ate popcorn from Fukushima, to mark the lifting of restrictions on food products from the Japanese region after the 2011 nuclear disaster. A flypast took place to mark the visit of Mr Kishida - his first to the UK since becoming prime minister last October - and included two Typhoon fighter jets and the RAF Voyager Vespina.

"Russians flee to Dubai to avoid sanctionsProperty purchases by Russians in Dubai surged by 67% in the first quarter of 2022, a report says.Business","Dubai has emerged as a haven for wealthy Russians fleeing the impact of western sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Russian billionaires and entrepreneurs have been arriving in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in unprecedented numbers, business leaders told the BBC. Property purchases in Dubai by Russians surged by 67% in the first three months of 2022, a report said. The UAE has not put sanctions on Russia or criticised its invasion of Ukraine. It is also providing visas to non-sanctioned Russians while many Western countries have restricted them. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have left Russia over the last two months - although exact figures are not available. One Russian economist saidas many as 200,000 Russians had left in the first 10 days after the war began. Virtuzone, which helps companies to set up operations in Dubai, has seen a huge surge of Russian clients. ""We are receiving five times more enquiries from Russians since the war began,"" said chief executive George Hojeige. ""They are worried about an economic meltdown that's coming. That is why they are moving here to secure their wealth,"" he added. Emirates to continue flying to Russia Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroad What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? The influx of Russian nationals has bolstered demand for luxury villas and apartments across the city. Real estate agents are reporting a surge in property prices, as Russians arriving in Dubai are looking to purchase homes. Dubai-based real estate agency Betterhomes found property purchases by Russianssurged by two thirds in the first three months of 2022.,external And another real estate agency, Modern Living, told the BBC it had hired many Russian-speaking agents to cater to rising demand. Chief executive Thiago Caldas said they were receiving numerous calls from Russian nationals looking to relocate to Dubai immediately. ""Russians who are coming down are not buying just for investment, they are looking at Dubai as a second home,"" he said. Many multinational companies and Russian start-ups are also relocating their employees to the UAE. Fuad Fatullaev is the co-founder of WeWay - a blockchain technology company that had offices in Russia and Ukraine. After the war broke out, he and his partners shifted hundreds of employees to Dubai. ""The war had a massive impact on our operations. We couldn't continue [as we were] as we had to move hundreds of people outside of Ukraine and Russia,"" says Mr Fatullaev, who is a Russian citizen. He adds that they chose to shift their employees to the UAE as it offers a safe economic and political environment to operate a business. He said Russian businesses were moving out as they were finding it incredibly difficult to operate due to sanctions. The challenge was even more acute for companies dealing with international clients and brands, as most western firms have severed ties with Russian-based enterprises, he said. Global firms like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Google that have shut down offices in Russia, are also relocating some of their employees to Dubai. ""There is definitely a brain drain that is happening. A lot of people are leaving because there are a lot of business restrictions right now,"" says Mr Fatullaev . Russia's central bank is barred from tapping into the billions of foreign reserves held overseas in foreign banks. Some Russian banks have been removed from the Swift financial messaging system. To protect its reserves, the Russian government has enacted capital restrictions and banned citizens from exiting the country with more than $10,000 in foreign currency. Finding it difficult to transfer cash, a lot of Russian buyers are making payments in cryptocurrencies. Some of the purchasers have an intermediary who will take the payment in crypto and then pass on the cash to the seller on behalf of the buyer. Gulf states including the UAE and Saudi Arabia have rejected calls from western governments to impose sanctions on Russia. The UAE was one of only three countries, along with China and India, to abstain in a United Nations Security Council vote in February to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also abstained in a General Assembly vote on 7 April to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. The rise in Russian investment comes just months after the UAE was placed on a ""grey list"" by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial crime watchdog. It means the country faces increased monitoring of its efforts to counter money laundering and terrorist financing. The UAE government has claimed to have taken significant measures to regulate inbound investment, and has stated that it remains committed to working closely with FATF on areas for improvement.

How high could UK interest rates go?,"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. The first drop in rates for more than four years came in August, followed by another in November. Some analysts predict another cut in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,rose by 2.6% in the 12 months to November 2024which was up from 2.3% in October. That means inflation is back above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The government's plans to borrow and spend billions which were set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgethave changed expectations. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskafter the Budget announcement thatthey will have to pay more National Insurance for their staff, which could also affect the economy. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. How the Budget will affect you and your money Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change would have an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.46%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.23%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row. Its key lending rate is now ina target range of 4.25% to 4.5%,but the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace next year.

We're ending our live posts on this page now, but we'll pick things up again in a few hours. Our writers today were Alys Davies, Alexandra Fouche, Sofia Ferreira Santos, Emily McGarvey and Leo Sands. The editors were Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan, Emma Owen and Andrew Humphrey. You can find any major developing stories and in depth coverage on the BBC Newshome page. Goodnight. This video can not be played Drone footage shows damaged Azovstal steelworks where civilians still remain Just before we go, we wanted to share this drone footage showing the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. It gives an indication of how vast the complex is, and the devastation the industrial works has suffered. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross will attempt to evacuate the civilians still trapped there tomorrow. Once again, the plight of those in Mariupol was the focus of our coverage for much of the day. We'll be pausing our coverage shortly, so here's a recap of what's happened today. In Mariupol...  Internationally...  On Putin... The UN has documented 180 cases of civilians, journalists, and local politicians being arbitrarily detained or disappeared in Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine. Michelle Bachelet, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, said her office had also found eight similar cases in Ukrainian-controlled territory of possible enforced disappearances of pro-Russian individuals. ""In areas around Kyiv, from late February for about five weeks, Russian forces targeted male civilians who they considered suspicious,"" Bachelet said. According to evidence collected by her office, some of those individuals were ""taken to Belarus and Russia, unbeknownst to their families, and
held in pre-trial detention facilities"". Many of their families still do not know what has happened to them, she added. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Away from Ukraine, Nato says it will increase its presence around Sweden and the Baltic sea if Sweden applies to join the alliance, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Swedish broadcaster SVT. The secretary general highlighted the importance of protecting the country's borders while its Nato application is approved, which could take up to a year. ""From the potential moment Sweden is applying, and Nato says
that they want Sweden to join, there is a very strong obligation
from Nato to be able to guarantee Sweden's security,"" Stoltenberg
told SVT. Sweden and neighbouring Finland are expected to make a decision on whether they are applying to join Nato this month, as both countries have considered joining the alliance following the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is asking its Western allies for more weapons before it can launch a counteroffensive on Russia, which is likely to be late June at the earliest, when it expects to receive additional military aid. Here's a look at what aid has been sent so far: Boris Johnson and Volodymyr Zelensky discussed the possibility of the UK sending long-range weapons to help Ukraine's military - and the UK has already sent Ukraine thousands of NLAW anti-tank missiles and some Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. The US sent Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles - andthey are now sending helicopters, long-range artillery and armoured personnel carriers. Slovakia sent its S-300 anti aircraft defence system, which can destroy aircraft up to 400km away. The US and Turkey have both sent drones armed with missiles. Several Nato countries are now supplying Ukraine with heavier weapons, to enable its army to push back against Russia's army, and they areplanning massively to increase the amounts they are spending on military aid. Some more details have emerged on plans for another evacuation attempt to rescue civilians trapped in the besieged city of Mariupol. ""Tomorrow, May 6, there will be an evacuation from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia,"" Ukraine's Deputy PM Iryna Vereshchukwrites in a Facebook post,external. She says residents should gather on Friday at 12:00 local (09:00 GMT) near Mariupol's Port City shopping centre, providing no further details. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross hope that a convoy of its buses intended to evacuate civilians trapped in Mariupol's besieged steelworks will reach the city tomorrow morning. Laura BickerBBC News We're now hearing that another evacuation convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. Hundreds of civilians are thought to be trapped in the maze-like tunnels under the plant. Itâs hoped the buses will reach Mariupol by Friday morning. The operation is being run jointly by the UN and the Red Cross. Sarah RainsfordReporting from Makariv Almost every window of Makariv hospital, outside Kyiv, has been
blown out. There are holes from mortar fire in the car park and twisted pieces
of Russian missiles under a tree. Even so, the hospitalâs still working as a day clinic. When Russian tanks first rolled into the town, the hospital
director says staff strung white sheets on the roof marked with red crosses
hoping that would protect them. ""The 5th floor was hit by mortar fire,"" Galina
Romanenko recalls. ""When an ambulance drove out to get diesel, the Russians
shot right at it."" Doctors stacked sacks filled with soil inside the windows of their
operating theatre so they could go on treating the wounded, under fire.The hospital was treating up to two dozen injured people a day at the height of the fighting. They had to help many
others over the phone. ""Theyâd call to say they were wounded but surrounded. We even helped
a woman give birth by phone,"" Galina says. The hospital was evacuated on 7 March.
Ukrainian forces then moved into its grounds, drawing even heavier fire. At
that point an entire clinic was hit, leaving only the filing cabinets standing,
charred, among the wreckage. The UN is trying to organise another evacuation from Mariupol, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has said. Speaking at a meeting of the body's Security Council, Guterres said that this was in addition to the two convoys that have already been completed successfully, including one that rescued 101 civilians who had been trapped in the city's massive Azovstal steelworks. The UN chief did not specify whether it applied to civilians in the steelworks or to those in the wider Mariupol area. ""It is our policy not to speak about details of [negotiations] before they are completed to avoid undermining possible success."" Guterres added: ""We must continue
to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes."". The luxury yacht, named 'The Amadea', is one of the largest in the world Sticking with sanctions, and a $300 million (Â£243m) luxury yacht owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov has been seized by authorities in Fiji after the US Justice Department requested it be held for violating sanctions and for alleged ties to corruption. The luxury yacht, the Amadea, which was berthed in Lautoka when it was seized, is 348-feet (105 metres) long and has eight cabins, a VIP stateroom, and a helipad. US Attorney General Merrick Garland said the department wants to make clear that there is ""no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime"". Kerimov is part-owner of Russia's Gazprom and an official of the Russian government. He was described by the US department as part of a group of oligarchs who ""profit from the Russian government through corruption and its malign activity around the globe, including the occupation of Crimea."" The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell speaking on 3 May The EU is close to agreeing on a sixth round of sanctions against Russia, the bloc's foreign policy chief has said. ""They are almost there. And we need this agreement because we have to push still more our economic and financial pressure on Russia,"" Josep Borrell said at an event in Italy. Yesterday the EU Commission proposed that the next round of sanctions includeda phased ban on Russian oil imports, which if approved would be its toughest move against the Russian energy sector to date. The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, is one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies. He has long given his backing to Russia's invasion, allowing troops to advance from his country's border when it began. But he has said he hadn't expected the operation to ""drag on this way"". In an interview with the Associated Press news agency Mr Lukashenko said that Russia's leader had had no choice but to act because Ukraine was ""provoking Russia"". But he said: ""I am not immersed in this problem enough to say whether it goes according to plan, like the Russians say, or like I feel it. ""I want to stress one more time: I feel like this operation has dragged on."" Mr Lukashenko also said he wanted the war to end, saying Belarus had ""done and are doing everything"" to stop it.

Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Civilians are helped over rubble at the steelworks plant There is renewed hope that civilians who are still trapped in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol can be evacuated, as the UN and the Red Cross say a new convoy is expected on Friday. The situation at the site, surrounded by Russian forces, is rapidly deteriorating, with little food and water supplies. Meanwhile, the relatives of the hundreds of fighters who are also holed up there are desperate for an evacuation to include them too. âWeâre worried because the Russian attacks have been happening for three days and we still donât have contact with our fighters there,â Nataliia, whose brother is a fighter currently at the site, told me. âI donât know how our fighters are dealing with it. I cannot get any information.â She urged the Ukrainian government to come up with a plan for their rescue. Russian officials have urged them to lay down their arms. The fighters, however, say they will not surrender. A new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to try to evacuate the remaining civilians there, and is expected to arrive on Friday, the United Nations humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, says. More than 340 civilians were evacuated from different parts of Mariupol yesterday with the help of the UN and the Red Cross, Griffiths said. ""Today, as we speak, a convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning, hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell that they have inhabited for so many weeks and months and take them back to safety,"" Griffiths said. Numerous attempts had previously failed to get civilians out of the besieged city of Mariupol - butthe first successful evacuation of the steelworks happened earlier this week. Around 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, are still believed to be stuck underneath the steel plant. Unverified images posted by Luhansk officials apparently showing damage from Russian shelling In addition to overnight strikes on the city of Kramatorsk, Ukrainian officials say Russian attacks have resumed elsewhere in Ukraine's east. Russian shelling killed a 15-year-old boy in Kharkiv who was helping to evacuate animals from a zoo, the owner of the Feldman Ecopark zoo says. Two other people were badly wounded in the attack, he added. The governor of Mykolaiv says that the region and city ""were bombed all night"" wounding several people. Andin a Telegram post,externalthis afternoon, Luhansk's Ukrainian military commander says that the bodies of four men and one woman - all civilians - have been discovered in towns around the region after ""24 devastating attacks"" by Russian forces. The BBC has not been able to verify these reports. Andrew HardingReporting from Kramatorsk Within hours of the attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from the streets At least 25 people have been injured in a series of overnight explosions in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. Local officials said six civilians were severely wounded. The blasts â at least some believed to be the result of air strikes â damaged apartment blocks and shops in a residential neighbourhood of the city. One air strike appeared to have destroyed a local hot water plant surrounded by apartment blocks, leaving a huge crater perhaps four metres deep, and widespread damage to dozens of residential homes. In a short statement, the Donestsk regionâs military administration said that nine homes and a school were also significantly damaged. Less than a month ago,at least 50 people were killed when a missile hit the cityâs railway station. Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of a âmonstrous war crimeâ following the strike. Within hours of last nightâs attacks, council workers were busy cleaning rubble from Kramatorskâs streets, while mechanical diggers removed larger blocks of concrete that had been torn apart in one blast. The EU's Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulator warned that airlines may be at heightened risk due to the war in Ukraine. In a statement, the regulator said civil planes may be accidentally targeted and airlines could be struck by cyber-attacks while the conflict is ongoing. ""As shown by previous wars, misidentification is easy in
confused arenas of warfare"", the regulator said. In 2014, aMalaysia Airlines flight crashed while flying over conflict-hit eastern Ukraineafter it was hit by a Russian-made Buk missile. ""If we add in the likelihood of jamming
of electronic aids that may be involved with navigation and
or identification tools, then it is easy to see the potential
for innocent aircraft being subject to missiles or radar laid
weapons,"" the EASA added. The regulator also stated that there are potential risks related to military operations using civilian airports throughout the conflict. Paul KirbyBBC News Russia's Victory Day has become an annual event - the military parade in Red Square in Moscow and cities across Russia on 9 May - when the countrymarks its victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Under Vladimir Putin, Victory Day has become a show of military strength as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two, when 27 million Soviet citizens died. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Instead of celebrating the overthrow of Ukraine's government, the Kremlin will have to settle for the capture of most of Mariupol. The city may lie in ruins, but Russia has repeatedly talked of ""de-Nazification and demilitarisation"" of Ukraine and it may claim defeat of the Azov battalion, which it has falsely portrayed as Nazi. That would resonate on a day marking World War Two. Read more aboutRussia's Victory Day parade. Vladimir Putin meeting with Israeli PM Naftali Bennett in Sochi last October Some more now from today's phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, which we reported earlier. Bennett has now said that Putin apologised to him forremarks earlier this week by his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovclaiming that Adolf Hitler was part-Jewish. Lavrov made the comments when asked in an interview how Russia could claim to be ""de-Nazifying"" Ukraine when its president is himself Jewish. In the interview, Russia's top diplomat said ""Hitler also had Jewish blood,"" adding: ""wise Jewish people say that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews."" The comments sparked outrage in Israel, which summoned the country's Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and demanded an apology. Prime Minister Bennett says he has accepted Putin's apology for the remarks and thanked him for clarifying his position. Â© 2025 BBC.

Russia trying to destroy Mariupol defenders - Ukraine army,"The UN humanitarian chief says a new convoy is on its way to the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol There are thought to be about 200 civilians, including at least 20 children, stuck in the steel plant Vladimir Putin says Ukraine should order its fighters remaining in the Azovstal complex to surrender Capturing the whole of Mariupol would be symbolic for Moscow ahead of its annual 9 May Victory Day celebration Meanwhile, international donors have pledged $6.5bn to support Ukraine during a conference in Poland Edited by Andrew Humphrey Thanks for joining us for today's coverage from Ukraine. We're ending our live posts on this page now, but we'll pick things up again in a few hours. Our writers today were Alys Davies, Alexandra Fouche, Sofia Ferreira Santos, Emily McGarvey and Leo Sands. The editors were Chris Giles, Jeremy Gahagan, Emma Owen and Andrew Humphrey. You can find any major developing stories and in depth coverage on the BBC Newshome page. Goodnight. This video can not be played Drone footage shows damaged Azovstal steelworks where civilians still remain Just before we go, we wanted to share this drone footage showing the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. It gives an indication of how vast the complex is, and the devastation the industrial works has suffered. As we've been reporting, the UN and Red Cross will attempt to evacuate the civilians still trapped there tomorrow. Once again, the plight of those in Mariupol was the focus of our coverage for much of the day. We'll be pausing our coverage shortly, so here's a recap of what's happened today. In Mariupol...  Internationally...  On Putin... The UN has documented 180 cases of civilians, journalists, and local politicians being arbitrarily detained or disappeared in Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine. Michelle Bachelet, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, said her office had also found eight similar cases in Ukrainian-controlled territory of possible enforced disappearances of pro-Russian individuals. ""In areas around Kyiv, from late February for about five weeks, Russian forces targeted male civilians who they considered suspicious,"" Bachelet said. According to evidence collected by her office, some of those individuals were ""taken to Belarus and Russia, unbeknownst to their families, and
held in pre-trial detention facilities"". Many of their families still do not know what has happened to them, she added.

LiveLiveVoters head to polls in elections across UK12 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson admits the local election results in some parts of England have been ""tough"" for the Tory party The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland The party has lost key London councils to Labour, and southern councils to the Liberal Democrats, who have gained more than 190 seats across England Sir Keir Starmer has hailed a ""really good set of results"" for Labour - however major gains in England have not been made outside London The BBC calculates that based on these results, if the whole country had been voting - Labour would have 35% of the vote, Conservative 30%, Lib Dems 19% and others 16% Labour has become the second largest party in the Scottish council elections, but the SNP continues to dominate In the Northern Ireland Assembly election, Sinn FÃ©in has received the largest number of first preference votes but the count is ongoing The Conservatives have seen heavy losses in Wales, while Plaid Cymru have made gains Emily McGarvey, Natasha Preskey, Richard Morris, Paul Gribben and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thank you for joining us today. We're closing up now but you can find the latest numbers forEngland,Walesand theNorthern Ireland Assemblyon our results pages. Scotland's counts are now complete,and the full results can be found here. You can alsosearch for results in your local area here. The live coverage of theNorthern Ireland Assembly results continues here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The local elections don't hold up a perfect mirror to the whole country's desires, or exactly what would happen if a general election had just happened. But they are a valuable measure of the state of the battle of the two main parties who seek to govern us all. Caveats aside, the events of the last 24 hours do matter. Spin back a few weeks, and some Conservatives feared these elections would end in absolute calamity after months of extraordinary revelations about what had been going on in Downing Street during lockdown. The party feared an angry public would punish them at the ballot box. And rising anxiety about making ends meet would translate too into a kicking for the government. 
After all the turmoil, the prime minister's allies fretted. And some of Boris Johnson's detractors darkly hoped a meltdown would give them reason to act to oust him. Now that nearly everything has been counted, the Tories have lost nearly 500 seats across the UK. That represents around a quarter of the council seats they contested. Read more from Laura here Tommorrow's newspaper front pages point the finger at the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives for the performances of their parties in the location elections. The Times says the Tories have been ""punished"" in the south on England, reporting that voters in the party's heartlands are questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership. But the Daily Mail says it is Keir Starmer who is ""in crisis"". The paper has headlinedon Durham Police's investigationinto whether the Labour leader breached lockdown rules along with Labour's performance in the northern 'Red Wall', where the party made some gains but perhaps not on the scale that Labour might have hoped. The Guardian's coverage centres on criticism of Boris Johnson by senior Conservative figures, some of whom have blamed the PM for big Tory losses in London and the south. Susan Thomson was one of eight women who stood for election in the Western Isles Here's one story you might have missed in the flurry of updates today: the Western Isles in Scotland has elected female councillors for the first time since 2012. Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected for the SNP, and will be the only two women among the area's 27 councillors. Six other women who stood were not elected. The islands had beenseeking greater female representationon the local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, andheld a workshopearlier this year aimed at encouraging more women to stand. In 2017, for the first time in its history, no women were elected to the comhairle. Seven women stood for election that year. You can read more on this here. It's been a tough day for plenty of would-be councillors, but perhaps even tougher for candidates who lost out through pure chance. In at least three cases, ties for seats were decided through a sophisticated adjudication process - tossing a coin or drawing straws. Independent Andy Solloway won the Skipton West and West Craven division of the newNorth Yorkshireunitary authority after a representative for Labour rival Peter Madeley drew the short straw. Both men had received 503 votes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Similarly, inCarmarthenshire, one result was settled by the toss of a coin, with Labour's Philip Warlow winning a seat in the Bigyn ward after fellow Labour candidate David Darkin guessed incorrectly. Darkin's mother, Janet Williams, had taken one of the ward's other seats. Janet Williams won a seat - but her son lost out due to a coin toss She said she was ""gutted"" for her son. Elsewhere, Tory Lilian Barker was elected in the Crackley and Red Street ward inNewcastle-under-Lyme, after drawing lots with Labour's Claire Radford. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey leaving a polling station in Kingston upon Thames yesterday One of the main stories today has been how the Liberal Democrats have managed to take so many southern English council seats out of Conservative hands: Outside of the South, theLib Dems gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull council, after taking it from Labour control. Labour lost two seats and the Lib Dems gained three. Dylan Tippetts came out as trans in 2018 Dylan Tippetts became Plymouth's first openly trans councillor earlier today, as well as the first Labour councillor in the city's Compton ward. Tippetts, 21, says he hopes his election will help young people who are yet to come out, as well as demonstrating that trans people are ""just normal human beings"". ""For me, it's bigger than just promoting equality and diversity in terms of trans people,"" he added. ""It's promoting the amazing diversity that we've got across our city in all walks of life."" Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Labour MP Luke Pollard tweeted his support for Tippetts, writing: ""As our city's first ever openly gay MP, I am simply over the moon. ""Now the hard work really begins."" Let's take a look at what's been happening around the UK. The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland, losing key London councils to Labour, and southern English councils to the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Daveyhailed the results as a ""turning point"" for his party. Boris Johnson said the Tories had faced a ""tough"" time. Labour struggled to make any major breakthroughs outside London, although it was already starting at a high watermark from 2018, when these seats were last contested. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party had had a ""really good set of results today"". In Wales,Labour have had 65 more councillors elected, bringing their total to 522. Plaid Cymru lost nine councillors but the party now has control of three more councils. The Conservatives lost 82 councillors, bringing their total to 110. The Liberal Democrats have gained an extra 11 councillors, and the Greens have had their first Welsh councillors elected. In Scotland,the SNP remain the firm favourite of Scottish voters- they've got 453 councillors, after having an extra 22 elected. Labour are up 20 at 282. The Conservatives have lost 63 at 214. There are now 87 Lib Dems, up 20, and the Greens are up 16 at 35. In Northern Ireland, the picture is still emerging, butSinn Fein have the largest first preference vote, followed by the DUP, who have lost around 40,000 first preference votes. Meanwhile, the Alliance party has made big gains. Bury, which made headlines in January whenBury South MP Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour, has seen Labour hold on. The Conservatives lost four seats and the Lib Dems lost three while Labour gained one. Six more independent councillors have been elected. Wakeford tweeted that he was ""immensely proud of the results"",external, describing them as a ""testament to the hard work all year round by Bury Labour"". Christian Wakeford defected to Labour following revelations about lockdown parties in No 10 Several Conservative council leaders have been blaming Boris Johnson after they suffered heavy local election defeats. John Mallinson, who lost in the new Cumberland Council, said voters did not feel the PM could be ""relied upon to tell the truth"". Wandsworth leader Ravi Govindia said ""national issues"" had caused the loss of the flagship council to Labour. But Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden said it was not time to change leader. Johnson said he took responsibility for the results, adding that it was clear voters wanted his government to focus on issues that mattered to them. Read more on this story here. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she shed a happy tear at the news of Roza Salih's election We know that the SNP has again finished as the biggest party in the Scottish council elections and it has emerged that one of its candidates - Roza Salih - has become the first former refugee to be elected to Glasgow City council. The 33-year-old says people in the city have ""always welcomed"" her. ""I've never given up, and now they've trusted in me,"" she said. ""I can't believe it. Twenty years ago I came to this country as a refugee, and to think back I would never have imagined to serve my city."" Salih's family fled Kurdistan in northern Iraq when she was a teenager. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she had shed a ""very happy tear"" at the news. You can read more on this here. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Sinn FÃ©in has polled the largest number of first preference votes in the Northern Ireland Assembly election by a long way. The first stage of the count is complete in all 18 constituencies. More than a quarter of a million people gave their â1â vote to the republican party. Sinn FÃ©in won 29% of the first preference vote- with the Democratic Unionists receiving 21.3%. Sinn FÃ©in increased its share by just over 1% - while the DUP has seen a drop of almost 7%. A fall in the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) vote - from 12% to 9% - suggests nationalist voters may have rallied around Sinn FÃ©in. A factor in this may be that pre-election polls suggested Sinn FÃ©in could deliver a nationalist first minister for the first time. The DUP seems to have taken a hit not from the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party - but from the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which takes a more hard-line position. The TUV has seen its vote share almost quadruple - to 7.6% - while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is down 1.7%. The final result will depend on the 2s, 3s 4s and beyond on the ballot paper. Itâs a complicated process, and counting is now expected to pause overnight and resume on Saturday. Most analysts believe Sinn FÃ©in is on course to win the largest number of seats. For breaking news developments in Northern Ireland, you can keep uphere. The chief secretary to the Treasury says his party ""should be getting right behind the prime minister"" despite losses in the local elections. Simon Clarke told BBC News it had ""not been an easy
night or day for the Conservative Party"". But he insisted that Boris Johnson had ""made the right calls on a whole host of issues since he came in"", such as Brexit, Covid and Ukraine. Clarke conceded that the partygate issue had been ""a difficult backdrop"" to the campaign. However, he said the PM had ""rightly and repeatedly apologised"" for the lockdown parties in Downing Street, and it was ""not the only factor at play"". He added: ""The government has lessons to learn and a new-found focus on delivery."" Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor The results emerging from Wales confirm the worst fears of the Welsh Conservatives. They were always expecting to suffer losses, but not on a scale that could wipe out all the gains they made in the last council elections five years ago. Their leader, Andrew RT Davies, blames the issues that have plagued Boris Johnson's government in Westminster - the cost of living crisis and partygate. He says he still supports the prime minister but ""he has to use the summer months to build the confidence of the party"" going forward to the next general election. In north-east Wales, where the party routed Welsh Labour in the 2019 election, the Tories have fallen from the largest party in one council, Denbighshire, to fourth. That's a result that will do nothing to calm Welsh Tory nerves about Boris Johnson's ability to keep those 2019 Conservative converts on board. Read more analysis of results in Waleshere. The Conservatives have lost control of their only council in Wales. Labour has become the biggest party in Monmouthshire, with the final results now declared in the county. Labour secured 22 seats (up 12), Conservatives 18 (down 12), Greens one (up one). BBC Wales has been told that the Greens will work with Labour. One seat in the Llanfoist ward had to be settled by a coin toss after the Labour and Conservative candidates finished neck and neck. The coin came down in favour of the Tory. Elsewhere across Wales, Labour gained two councils and Plaid Cymru three. Labour regained Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and held Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport and Torfaen, while Plaid retained Gwynedd and gained Anglesey, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said he accepted things ""might not have gone our way"" in parts of Wales. ""We went into these elections with a difficult national picture and it appears that has had an impact,"" he said.

Lutfur Rahman, right, has defeated Labour's John Biggs, left, to become mayor of Tower Hamlets once again John Biggs, Labour's incumbent mayor of Tower Hamlets, has been beaten by Lutfur Rahman in a shock result. Rahman, standing for the Aspire party, wasremoved as mayor of the east London borough in 2015and banned from office for five years after being found guilty of election fraud. However, he beat Biggs after second preference votes were counted. Joseph LeeBBC News Here are some quirky stories we've found in this years election results... After a decade of Labour rule at Hull Council, leader Darren Hale clearly wasn't taking defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats lightly. He told the BBC that the loss was ""a great disappointment"", adding: ""You can't please all of the people all of the time."" Sounding like a man who had received at least one too many letters of complaint from the public, he added: ""I look forward to all the roadworks being completed in the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public, but we'll see.""

For all their importance, local elections aren't known for their star power. And Thurrock Council in Essex lost its bit of celebrity sparkle when Conservative councillor and former 80s singer David Van Day - half of pop duo Dollar - lost his seat to Labour by 20 votes. Still, it's not the first time he's bounced back from disappointment. After stepping out of the limelight, Van Day began to build a business career in the 2000s selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams in Brighton - earning him the nickname ""Burger Van Day"". We have been hearing thatSinn FÃ©in has secured the most first-preference votesin Northern Ireland's Assembly election. So how does the system work? While UK general elections allow voters to choose just one candidate in their local area, NI Assembly elections see voters rank multiple candidates. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. For each constituency, a quota of votes is calculated using a mathematical formula, based on the number of seats and the number of votes cast. Candidates who reach this number of votes from 'first preference votes' (where voters choose them as number one) are elected. If these candidates get votes above the quota number, their extra votes are transferred to other candidates - so the candidate marked ""2"" on those ballot papers gets those votes instead. The candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their second preferences get transferred to other candidates. The same process continues round by round with the lowest candidate being knocked out and their votes being transferred to candidates who are still in the race. You can read more on this here. Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes by a wide margin in Northern Ireland's Assembly election. The party received 250,388 first preferences, compared with the 184,002 returned for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - first preference votes for it have dropped by about 40,000.The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, NI voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been vying for top spot in this election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the offices of the first and deputy first minister are equal with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921.

Shell profits nearly triple as oil prices surgeThe energy giant says pulling out of Russian oil and gas activities had cost the firm $3.9bn.,"Energy giant Shell has reported its highest ever quarterly profits as oil and gas prices surge around the world. Shell made $9.13bn (Â£7.3bn) in the first three months of the year, nearly triple its $3.2bn profit it announced for the same period last year. But the firm saidpulling out of Russian oil and gasdue to the Ukraine conflict had cost it $3.9bn (Â£3.1bn). On Tuesday, rival BP also reported a sharp rise in profit, but the UK has so far ruled out a windfall tax. The invasion of Ukraine has helped oil and gas prices skyrocket. Russia is one of the world's major exporters but Western nations have pledged to cut their dependence on the country for energy. Oil prices were already rising before the Ukraine war as economies started to recover from the Covid pandemic. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the war in Ukraine had caused ""significant disruption to global energy markets"". ""The impacts of this uncertainty and the higher cost that comes with it are being felt far and wide. ""We have been engaging with governments, our customers and suppliers to work through the challenging implications and provide support and solutions where we can."" Shell rivals, including BP and TotalEnergies have also reported a sharp rise in underlying profits. Norway's Equinor, which supplies a quarter of the UK's gas, also posted record earnings on Wednesday. Shell's profits were expected to be big. The price of oil and gas, already high at the end of last year, surged higher after the Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened disruption and eventual boycotts of one of the world's biggest suppliers of energy. These numbers surpassed those lofty expectations. The question now is what Shell will do with all this money. The company paid out Â£4.3bn to shareholders, which include millions of pension savers, in the last quarter and said it plans to dish out roughly the same in the next three months. Shell has already said it will invest Â£20bn to Â£25bn in the UK in the next decade in low carbon energy and in UK gas and oil supplies. Ministers will be watching closely to make sure Shell delivers on those commitments. It's the promise of investment that is standing between UK oil and gas companies and the windfall tax opposition parties have called for but the government has so far resisted. The high prices of oil and gas are pushing up the cost of living around the world. In the UK, inflation is running at 7%, its highest rate for 30 years, as energy bills, fuel costs and food prices jump. The Bank of Englandraised interest rates on Thursdayto try to temper inflation. One of the main contributors to UK inflation has been fuel prices, which are near record highs and could stay that way for months, according to some analysts. Demand for diesel has grown as the popularity of online shopping deliveries remains high, and inventories are low in the US and Europe. Russia is a major exporter of diesel, but the Ukraine invasion has made access to that limited. As part of Western sanctions, the European Union has proposed a total ban on Russian oil imports. Mr van Beurden said Shell was ""ahead of a ban or a boycott"" by getting out of its positions in Russia. The firm is in the process of ending all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom, as well as pulling out of its Russian petrol station and other businesses. He said a complete ban or boycott of Russian gas would be a ""major disaster"" which would leave a ""supply hole"" in Europe. Russia has demanded that payments for gas be made in roubles to try to prop up the currency, but the EU has said that may contravene sanctions. Mr van Beurden said that Shell will ""continue paying to the end of May and will have to see what happens after that"", adding that the firm will operate within sanctions. The UK government has so far ruled out a windfall tax on the oil companies, despite calls from opposition parties for one to be imposed. The Shell boss said that if a windfall tax was imposed on North Sea oil and gas profits, Shell would be unlikely to shelve UK green investment plans such as building more electric vehicle charging. Nevertheless, he added that Shell's plans would ""have to make economic sense when it comes to making those investment decisions on the day"". Shell plans to invest $25bn over the next decade, with 75% in green technologies, and the rest in oil and gas projects, including in the North Sea. The company's chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman, said its North Sea plans would see more ""energy security"" for the UK. However, Mr van Beurden acknowledged that oil firms sell their products on international markets, and that developing North Sea oil would not necessarily lower prices.

"High Street isn't dead, says new Sports Direct boss","This video can not be played New Sports Direct boss: ""I've proved myself and my worth to the group"" The new boss of Sports Direct has warned that the retailer will probably have to put up prices as it faces costs that are ""going through the roof"". Michael Murray has taken over from Mike Ashley - his future father-in-law - as chief executive of Frasers Group. But in his first interview in the job he told the BBC Mr Ashley was ""not pulling the strings"". He also insisted that the High Street is not dead, with plans to open up to 10 new flagship stores across the UK. At the age of 32, Mr Murray has become one of the youngest chief executives among FTSE 250 companies after a meteoric rise to the top of one of the UK's biggest retailers. But he faces a particularly challenging time with rising costs and a squeeze on household incomes. Although Sports Direct stores pride themselves on countless deals and offers, Mr Murray admitted prices will probably rise. ""In terms of the pricing of product, we are very much at the mercy of our brand partners,"" he said. ""They decide the price they want to sell the goods for and we will increase the prices as and when the brands ask us or recommend us to do so."" Ashley to step down as head of Sports Direct group Mike Ashley: Who is the founder of Sports Direct? New boss of Sports Direct group could net Â£100m Speaking to the BBC ahead of Sports Direct opening its new Birmingham store on Friday, Mr Murray said he believed Britain's High Streets were not ""dead"", but said they would be ""different"". ""I believe if you give people a reason to come and shop, they will shop. They've just not had a reason for the past few years,"" he added. Over four floors, Birmingham's new Sports Direct looks like a high-tech department store for sport and fitness - a world away from traditional stores. It includes an E-sports gaming room, a sports bra fitting service, as well as Evans Cycles and a Game concession. ""It's cost more than Â£10m. It's a huge investment in the High Street,"" Mr Murray said. He said Mr Ashley was a ""genius of his generation"", but said it required a ""different type of genius and a different type of mindset what takes us forward into the next generation"". ""What I want to do is to build on the retail excellence which Mike's created over the last 40 years and build a business that's fit for purpose for the next 40 years,"" he said. ""It's really as simple as that."" Birmingham's new look Sports Direct opens on Friday London's Oxford Street store was the first new look Sports Direct unveiled last year and Mr Murray said there's room for up to 10 of the big regional, experiential stores. It's a big bet on the future of the High Street. However, re-imagining shops isn't just about enticing customers in. One of Mr Murray's biggest challenges is persuading his major brands, Nike and Adidas, to supply the most-desirable trainers and tracksuits. It's a journey, he claimed, is going ""very well"". ""If we'd done this five or six years ago it would've looked a completely different store because you wouldn't have had the product to put in it,"" he said. Mr Murray, who is engaged to Mr Ashley's eldest daughter, has been leading efforts to modernise the business in a bid to appeal to younger shoppers. Before he took over as chief executive, he wasn't an employee of Sports Direct, nor did he have a seat on the board. He earned millions of pounds in consultancy fees linked to a host of property deals he made for the group. Mr Murray brushed off accusations that he only got the job through his connections to former Newcastle United owner Mr Ashley - who founded Sports Direct in 1982 and is still the majority shareholder of the firm's empire, which includes House of Frasers, Flannels and Jack Wills. ""I've definitely proved myself and my worth to the group. I think we've achieved so much over the last few years. Mike would never put me up to a job which he didn't think I could excel in because I don't think it'd be very popular around the dinner table,"" Mr Murray said. Mike Ashley founded Sports Direct in 1982 So is Mr Ashley still pulling the strings? ""No Mike is not pulling the strings,"" said Mr Murray. ""We've worked in a partnership, a very collaborative one over the last two to three years. We have vocal debates. We agree, we disagree. But ultimately the decision lies with me on the outcome of where we take the company. ""I'm definitely my own man."" He said he would bring clarity to the business, saying the retailer had been ""misunderstood with maybe more of a scattergun approach in the past"". Mr Murray believes people will spend less and not buy for the sake of it, but spend on ""aspirational"" items instead. There have been no shortage of shoppers splashing out hundreds of pounds for a T-shirt in Flannels, the designer fashion chain, which Mr Murray said is a fast growing part of the business. ""The luxury brands have just been severely underserved in regional markets. Before, there was nowhere really to buy that product. And every time we open a new store in a regional town or city, it far exceeds our expectation."" But what's the plan for the remaining 43 House of Fraser shops? Mike Ashley snapped up the department store chain after it collapsed in 2018 and vowed to turn into the Harrods of the High Street. Mr Murray doesn't yet know how many will be kept. He admitted some of the stores need to be reduced in size or moved. But the incentive to succeed couldn't be bigger. Mr Murray is in line for a Â£100m pay-out if he can more than double the share price to Â£15 within the next three years. ""I wouldn't have signed up to it if I didn't believe we've got a very strong strategy.""

Uber loses $5.9bn as Asia investment values fall,"Ride-hailing and delivery group Uber has made a $5.9bn (Â£4.7bn) loss, mostly due to its stakes in other companies. The firm said almost all of the loss was a result of the fall in the value of investments in businesses including two Asian ride-hailing giants - China's Didi and South East Asia's Grab. Shares in Didi and Grab have plunged since listing in New York last year. Despite the loss, Uber's boss highlighted its progress in recovering from the impact of the pandemic. ""Our results demonstrate just how much progress we've made navigating out of the pandemic and how the power of our platform is differentiating our business performance,"" chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said. That came as the company said the number of trips taken had risen 18% for the three months to the end of March, compared to the same period last year. That helped its revenue rise by 136%. On a net basis, Uber's first-quarter loss soared to $5.9bn from $108m a year ago, driven by $5.6bn of drops in the value of stakes in other businesses, primarily Chinese ride-hailing company Didi. However, Uber has enough cash to hold on to those loss-making stakes and wait for a better time to sell them, chief financial officer Nelson Chai said. Its shares ended Wednesday's trading session in New York 4.65% lower. Uber granted licence to operate in London Uber to list New York City yellow taxis in app In 2016, as it faced tough competition in China, Uber sold its business in the world's second largest economy to Didi in exchange for an 18% stake in the Beijing-headquartered firm. Didi's US market valuation has fallen by more than 80% since its $4.4bn debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) last summer. Within days of the listing China's internet regulator ordered online stores not to offer Didi's app, saying it illegally collected users' personal data. In December, the company announcedplans to take its shares off the NYSEand move its listing to Hong Kong. This week, Didi revealed that it faced an investigation by the US stock market watchdog about its initial public offering (IPO). In 2018, when both firms were still privately owned, Uber sold its businesses in South East Asia to Grab for a 27.5% stake in the Singapore-based company. Grab's shares fell sharply in their debuton New York's Nasdaq trading platform in December last year. Its stock market valuation has dropped by almost 75% since the IPO, which was the largest ever US listing by a South East Asian firm. Uber also owns a stake in Indian food delivery firm Zomato, which it got in 2020 in exchange for its Uber Eats operations in India. Zomato's shares have almost halved in valuesince making a stellar stock market debut in July.

Russia on agenda as Johnson hosts Japanese PMBoris Johnson and Japanese PM Fumio Kishida are expected to agree a defensive partnership.UK,"Boris Johnson has promised to work with other countries to take on ""autocratic, coercive powers"", after signing a defensive partnership with Japan. The prime minister met Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida in Downing Street, where the two nations also announced joint exercises and increased working together for disaster relief. The agreement is the first of its kind between Japan and a European country. It comes after both PMs condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The agreement also follows the UK government'sdefence and foreign policy integrated review, published last year, which announced a ""tilt"" towards the Indo-Pacific region. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The meeting between Mr Kishida and Mr Johnson also focused on how to exert pressure on Russia and help allies become less dependent on its oil and gas. Mr Johnson said: ""We in the UK recognise that our security in Europe is indivisible from the security, our collective security, in the Asia-Pacific, in the Indo-Pacific region. ""And there is direct read across from the actions of autocratic, coercive powers in Europe, to what may happen in east Asia. And that's why we want to work more closely together."" Japan, a member of the G7 group of leading economies, is part of the Western alliance defending Ukraine and has condemned the invasion, imposed sanctions on Russia and sent non-lethal military aid to Kyiv. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""Both leaders agreed that Russia's barbaric invasion marked the end of the post-Cold War period and had major implications for wider international stability."" Addressing UK business leaders at London's Guildhall ahead of his meeting with Mr Johnson, Mr Kishida said Japan would utilise nuclear reactors to reduce its dependence on Russian energy. Mr Johnson said the UK and Japan were ""focused on driving growth, creating highly skilled jobs and ensuring we remain technology superpowers"". He also announced that former Business Secretary Greg Clark, the Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells, as Britain's new trade envoy to Japan. During the meeting the two leaders ate popcorn from Fukushima, to mark the lifting of restrictions on food products from the Japanese region after the 2011 nuclear disaster. A flypast took place to mark the visit of Mr Kishida - his first to the UK since becoming prime minister last October - and included two Typhoon fighter jets and the RAF Voyager Vespina.

"High Street isn't dead, says new Sports Direct bossMichael Murray says high streets will be ""different"" ahead of a new look Sports Direct store opening.","This video can not be played New Sports Direct boss: ""I've proved myself and my worth to the group"" The new boss of Sports Direct has warned that the retailer will probably have to put up prices as it faces costs that are ""going through the roof"". Michael Murray has taken over from Mike Ashley - his future father-in-law - as chief executive of Frasers Group. But in his first interview in the job he told the BBC Mr Ashley was ""not pulling the strings"". He also insisted that the High Street is not dead, with plans to open up to 10 new flagship stores across the UK. At the age of 32, Mr Murray has become one of the youngest chief executives among FTSE 250 companies after a meteoric rise to the top of one of the UK's biggest retailers. But he faces a particularly challenging time with rising costs and a squeeze on household incomes. Although Sports Direct stores pride themselves on countless deals and offers, Mr Murray admitted prices will probably rise. ""In terms of the pricing of product, we are very much at the mercy of our brand partners,"" he said. ""They decide the price they want to sell the goods for and we will increase the prices as and when the brands ask us or recommend us to do so."" Ashley to step down as head of Sports Direct group Mike Ashley: Who is the founder of Sports Direct? New boss of Sports Direct group could net Â£100m Speaking to the BBC ahead of Sports Direct opening its new Birmingham store on Friday, Mr Murray said he believed Britain's High Streets were not ""dead"", but said they would be ""different"". ""I believe if you give people a reason to come and shop, they will shop. They've just not had a reason for the past few years,"" he added. Over four floors, Birmingham's new Sports Direct looks like a high-tech department store for sport and fitness - a world away from traditional stores. It includes an E-sports gaming room, a sports bra fitting service, as well as Evans Cycles and a Game concession. ""It's cost more than Â£10m. It's a huge investment in the High Street,"" Mr Murray said. He said Mr Ashley was a ""genius of his generation"", but said it required a ""different type of genius and a different type of mindset what takes us forward into the next generation"". ""What I want to do is to build on the retail excellence which Mike's created over the last 40 years and build a business that's fit for purpose for the next 40 years,"" he said. ""It's really as simple as that."" Birmingham's new look Sports Direct opens on Friday London's Oxford Street store was the first new look Sports Direct unveiled last year and Mr Murray said there's room for up to 10 of the big regional, experiential stores. It's a big bet on the future of the High Street. However, re-imagining shops isn't just about enticing customers in. One of Mr Murray's biggest challenges is persuading his major brands, Nike and Adidas, to supply the most-desirable trainers and tracksuits. It's a journey, he claimed, is going ""very well"". ""If we'd done this five or six years ago it would've looked a completely different store because you wouldn't have had the product to put in it,"" he said. Mr Murray, who is engaged to Mr Ashley's eldest daughter, has been leading efforts to modernise the business in a bid to appeal to younger shoppers. Before he took over as chief executive, he wasn't an employee of Sports Direct, nor did he have a seat on the board. He earned millions of pounds in consultancy fees linked to a host of property deals he made for the group. Mr Murray brushed off accusations that he only got the job through his connections to former Newcastle United owner Mr Ashley - who founded Sports Direct in 1982 and is still the majority shareholder of the firm's empire, which includes House of Frasers, Flannels and Jack Wills. ""I've definitely proved myself and my worth to the group. I think we've achieved so much over the last few years. Mike would never put me up to a job which he didn't think I could excel in because I don't think it'd be very popular around the dinner table,"" Mr Murray said. Mike Ashley founded Sports Direct in 1982 So is Mr Ashley still pulling the strings? ""No Mike is not pulling the strings,"" said Mr Murray. ""We've worked in a partnership, a very collaborative one over the last two to three years. We have vocal debates. We agree, we disagree. But ultimately the decision lies with me on the outcome of where we take the company. ""I'm definitely my own man."" He said he would bring clarity to the business, saying the retailer had been ""misunderstood with maybe more of a scattergun approach in the past"". Mr Murray believes people will spend less and not buy for the sake of it, but spend on ""aspirational"" items instead. There have been no shortage of shoppers splashing out hundreds of pounds for a T-shirt in Flannels, the designer fashion chain, which Mr Murray said is a fast growing part of the business. ""The luxury brands have just been severely underserved in regional markets. Before, there was nowhere really to buy that product. And every time we open a new store in a regional town or city, it far exceeds our expectation."" But what's the plan for the remaining 43 House of Fraser shops? Mike Ashley snapped up the department store chain after it collapsed in 2018 and vowed to turn into the Harrods of the High Street. Mr Murray doesn't yet know how many will be kept. He admitted some of the stores need to be reduced in size or moved. But the incentive to succeed couldn't be bigger. Mr Murray is in line for a Â£100m pay-out if he can more than double the share price to Â£15 within the next three years. ""I wouldn't have signed up to it if I didn't believe we've got a very strong strategy.""

Shell's profit nearly triples as oil prices surgeThe war in Ukraine has lifted energy prices soar with oil majors reaping the benefits.Business,"Energy giant Shell has reported its highest ever quarterly profits as oil and gas prices surge around the world. Shell made $9.13bn (Â£7.3bn) in the first three months of the year, nearly triple its $3.2bn profit it announced for the same period last year. But the firm saidpulling out of Russian oil and gasdue to the Ukraine conflict had cost it $3.9bn (Â£3.1bn). On Tuesday, rival BP also reported a sharp rise in profit, but the UK has so far ruled out a windfall tax. The invasion of Ukraine has helped oil and gas prices skyrocket. Russia is one of the world's major exporters but Western nations have pledged to cut their dependence on the country for energy. Oil prices were already rising before the Ukraine war as economies started to recover from the Covid pandemic. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the war in Ukraine had caused ""significant disruption to global energy markets"". ""The impacts of this uncertainty and the higher cost that comes with it are being felt far and wide. ""We have been engaging with governments, our customers and suppliers to work through the challenging implications and provide support and solutions where we can."" Shell rivals, including BP and TotalEnergies have also reported a sharp rise in underlying profits. Norway's Equinor, which supplies a quarter of the UK's gas, also posted record earnings on Wednesday. Shell's profits were expected to be big. The price of oil and gas, already high at the end of last year, surged higher after the Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened disruption and eventual boycotts of one of the world's biggest suppliers of energy. These numbers surpassed those lofty expectations. The question now is what Shell will do with all this money. The company paid out Â£4.3bn to shareholders, which include millions of pension savers, in the last quarter and said it plans to dish out roughly the same in the next three months. Shell has already said it will invest Â£20bn to Â£25bn in the UK in the next decade in low carbon energy and in UK gas and oil supplies. Ministers will be watching closely to make sure Shell delivers on those commitments. It's the promise of investment that is standing between UK oil and gas companies and the windfall tax opposition parties have called for but the government has so far resisted. The high prices of oil and gas are pushing up the cost of living around the world. In the UK, inflation is running at 7%, its highest rate for 30 years, as energy bills, fuel costs and food prices jump. The Bank of Englandraised interest rates on Thursdayto try to temper inflation. One of the main contributors to UK inflation has been fuel prices, which are near record highs and could stay that way for months, according to some analysts. Demand for diesel has grown as the popularity of online shopping deliveries remains high, and inventories are low in the US and Europe. Russia is a major exporter of diesel, but the Ukraine invasion has made access to that limited. As part of Western sanctions, the European Union has proposed a total ban on Russian oil imports. Mr van Beurden said Shell was ""ahead of a ban or a boycott"" by getting out of its positions in Russia. The firm is in the process of ending all of its joint ventures with the Russian energy company Gazprom, as well as pulling out of its Russian petrol station and other businesses. He said a complete ban or boycott of Russian gas would be a ""major disaster"" which would leave a ""supply hole"" in Europe. Russia has demanded that payments for gas be made in roubles to try to prop up the currency, but the EU has said that may contravene sanctions. Mr van Beurden said that Shell will ""continue paying to the end of May and will have to see what happens after that"", adding that the firm will operate within sanctions. The UK government has so far ruled out a windfall tax on the oil companies, despite calls from opposition parties for one to be imposed. The Shell boss said that if a windfall tax was imposed on North Sea oil and gas profits, Shell would be unlikely to shelve UK green investment plans such as building more electric vehicle charging. Nevertheless, he added that Shell's plans would ""have to make economic sense when it comes to making those investment decisions on the day"". Shell plans to invest $25bn over the next decade, with 75% in green technologies, and the rest in oil and gas projects, including in the North Sea. The company's chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman, said its North Sea plans would see more ""energy security"" for the UK. However, Mr van Beurden acknowledged that oil firms sell their products on international markets, and that developing North Sea oil would not necessarily lower prices.

LiveLiveVoters head to polls in elections across UKLess than a minute ago,"Boris Johnson admits the local election results in some parts of England have been ""tough"" for the Tory party The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland The party has lost key London councils to Labour, and southern councils to the Liberal Democrats, who have gained more than 190 seats across England Sir Keir Starmer has hailed a ""really good set of results"" for Labour - however major gains in England have not been made outside London The BBC calculates that based on these results, if the whole country had been voting - Labour would have 35% of the vote, Conservative 30%, Lib Dems 19% and others 16% Labour has become the second largest party in the Scottish council elections, but the SNP continues to dominate In the Northern Ireland Assembly election, Sinn FÃ©in has received the largest number of first preference votes but the count is ongoing The Conservatives have seen heavy losses in Wales, while Plaid Cymru have made gains Emily McGarvey, Natasha Preskey, Richard Morris, Paul Gribben and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thank you for joining us today. We're closing up now but you can find the latest numbers forEngland,Walesand theNorthern Ireland Assemblyon our results pages. Scotland's counts are now complete,and the full results can be found here. You can alsosearch for results in your local area here. The live coverage of theNorthern Ireland Assembly results continues here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The local elections don't hold up a perfect mirror to the whole country's desires, or exactly what would happen if a general election had just happened. But they are a valuable measure of the state of the battle of the two main parties who seek to govern us all. Caveats aside, the events of the last 24 hours do matter. Spin back a few weeks, and some Conservatives feared these elections would end in absolute calamity after months of extraordinary revelations about what had been going on in Downing Street during lockdown. The party feared an angry public would punish them at the ballot box. And rising anxiety about making ends meet would translate too into a kicking for the government. 
After all the turmoil, the prime minister's allies fretted. And some of Boris Johnson's detractors darkly hoped a meltdown would give them reason to act to oust him. Now that nearly everything has been counted, the Tories have lost nearly 500 seats across the UK. That represents around a quarter of the council seats they contested. Read more from Laura here Tommorrow's newspaper front pages point the finger at the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives for the performances of their parties in the location elections. The Times says the Tories have been ""punished"" in the south on England, reporting that voters in the party's heartlands are questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership. But the Daily Mail says it is Keir Starmer who is ""in crisis"". The paper has headlinedon Durham Police's investigationinto whether the Labour leader breached lockdown rules along with Labour's performance in the northern 'Red Wall', where the party made some gains but perhaps not on the scale that Labour might have hoped. The Guardian's coverage centres on criticism of Boris Johnson by senior Conservative figures, some of whom have blamed the PM for big Tory losses in London and the south. Susan Thomson was one of eight women who stood for election in the Western Isles Here's one story you might have missed in the flurry of updates today: the Western Isles in Scotland has elected female councillors for the first time since 2012. Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected for the SNP, and will be the only two women among the area's 27 councillors. Six other women who stood were not elected. The islands had beenseeking greater female representationon the local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, andheld a workshopearlier this year aimed at encouraging more women to stand. In 2017, for the first time in its history, no women were elected to the comhairle. Seven women stood for election that year. You can read more on this here. It's been a tough day for plenty of would-be councillors, but perhaps even tougher for candidates who lost out through pure chance. In at least three cases, ties for seats were decided through a sophisticated adjudication process - tossing a coin or drawing straws. Independent Andy Solloway won the Skipton West and West Craven division of the newNorth Yorkshireunitary authority after a representative for Labour rival Peter Madeley drew the short straw. Both men had received 503 votes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Similarly, inCarmarthenshire, one result was settled by the toss of a coin, with Labour's Philip Warlow winning a seat in the Bigyn ward after fellow Labour candidate David Darkin guessed incorrectly. Darkin's mother, Janet Williams, had taken one of the ward's other seats. Janet Williams won a seat - but her son lost out due to a coin toss She said she was ""gutted"" for her son. Elsewhere, Tory Lilian Barker was elected in the Crackley and Red Street ward inNewcastle-under-Lyme, after drawing lots with Labour's Claire Radford. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey leaving a polling station in Kingston upon Thames yesterday One of the main stories today has been how the Liberal Democrats have managed to take so many southern English council seats out of Conservative hands: Outside of the South, theLib Dems gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull council, after taking it from Labour control. Labour lost two seats and the Lib Dems gained three. Dylan Tippetts came out as trans in 2018 Dylan Tippetts became Plymouth's first openly trans councillor earlier today, as well as the first Labour councillor in the city's Compton ward. Tippetts, 21, says he hopes his election will help young people who are yet to come out, as well as demonstrating that trans people are ""just normal human beings"". ""For me, it's bigger than just promoting equality and diversity in terms of trans people,"" he added. ""It's promoting the amazing diversity that we've got across our city in all walks of life."" Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Labour MP Luke Pollard tweeted his support for Tippetts, writing: ""As our city's first ever openly gay MP, I am simply over the moon. ""Now the hard work really begins."" Let's take a look at what's been happening around the UK. The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland, losing key London councils to Labour, and southern English councils to the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Daveyhailed the results as a ""turning point"" for his party. Boris Johnson said the Tories had faced a ""tough"" time. Labour struggled to make any major breakthroughs outside London, although it was already starting at a high watermark from 2018, when these seats were last contested. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party had had a ""really good set of results today"". In Wales,Labour have had 65 more councillors elected, bringing their total to 522. Plaid Cymru lost nine councillors but the party now has control of three more councils. The Conservatives lost 82 councillors, bringing their total to 110. The Liberal Democrats have gained an extra 11 councillors, and the Greens have had their first Welsh councillors elected. In Scotland,the SNP remain the firm favourite of Scottish voters- they've got 453 councillors, after having an extra 22 elected. Labour are up 20 at 282. The Conservatives have lost 63 at 214. There are now 87 Lib Dems, up 20, and the Greens are up 16 at 35. In Northern Ireland, the picture is still emerging, butSinn Fein have the largest first preference vote, followed by the DUP, who have lost around 40,000 first preference votes. Meanwhile, the Alliance party has made big gains. Bury, which made headlines in January whenBury South MP Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour, has seen Labour hold on. The Conservatives lost four seats and the Lib Dems lost three while Labour gained one. Six more independent councillors have been elected. Wakeford tweeted that he was ""immensely proud of the results"",external, describing them as a ""testament to the hard work all year round by Bury Labour"". Christian Wakeford defected to Labour following revelations about lockdown parties in No 10 Several Conservative council leaders have been blaming Boris Johnson after they suffered heavy local election defeats. John Mallinson, who lost in the new Cumberland Council, said voters did not feel the PM could be ""relied upon to tell the truth"". Wandsworth leader Ravi Govindia said ""national issues"" had caused the loss of the flagship council to Labour. But Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden said it was not time to change leader. Johnson said he took responsibility for the results, adding that it was clear voters wanted his government to focus on issues that mattered to them. Read more on this story here. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she shed a happy tear at the news of Roza Salih's election We know that the SNP has again finished as the biggest party in the Scottish council elections and it has emerged that one of its candidates - Roza Salih - has become the first former refugee to be elected to Glasgow City council. The 33-year-old says people in the city have ""always welcomed"" her. ""I've never given up, and now they've trusted in me,"" she said. ""I can't believe it. Twenty years ago I came to this country as a refugee, and to think back I would never have imagined to serve my city."" Salih's family fled Kurdistan in northern Iraq when she was a teenager. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she had shed a ""very happy tear"" at the news. You can read more on this here. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Sinn FÃ©in has polled the largest number of first preference votes in the Northern Ireland Assembly election by a long way. The first stage of the count is complete in all 18 constituencies. More than a quarter of a million people gave their â1â vote to the republican party. Sinn FÃ©in won 29% of the first preference vote- with the Democratic Unionists receiving 21.3%. Sinn FÃ©in increased its share by just over 1% - while the DUP has seen a drop of almost 7%. A fall in the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) vote - from 12% to 9% - suggests nationalist voters may have rallied around Sinn FÃ©in. A factor in this may be that pre-election polls suggested Sinn FÃ©in could deliver a nationalist first minister for the first time. The DUP seems to have taken a hit not from the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party - but from the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which takes a more hard-line position. The TUV has seen its vote share almost quadruple - to 7.6% - while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is down 1.7%. The final result will depend on the 2s, 3s 4s and beyond on the ballot paper. Itâs a complicated process, and counting is now expected to pause overnight and resume on Saturday. Most analysts believe Sinn FÃ©in is on course to win the largest number of seats. For breaking news developments in Northern Ireland, you can keep uphere. The chief secretary to the Treasury says his party ""should be getting right behind the prime minister"" despite losses in the local elections. Simon Clarke told BBC News it had ""not been an easy
night or day for the Conservative Party"". But he insisted that Boris Johnson had ""made the right calls on a whole host of issues since he came in"", such as Brexit, Covid and Ukraine. Clarke conceded that the partygate issue had been ""a difficult backdrop"" to the campaign. However, he said the PM had ""rightly and repeatedly apologised"" for the lockdown parties in Downing Street, and it was ""not the only factor at play"". He added: ""The government has lessons to learn and a new-found focus on delivery."" Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor The results emerging from Wales confirm the worst fears of the Welsh Conservatives. They were always expecting to suffer losses, but not on a scale that could wipe out all the gains they made in the last council elections five years ago. Their leader, Andrew RT Davies, blames the issues that have plagued Boris Johnson's government in Westminster - the cost of living crisis and partygate. He says he still supports the prime minister but ""he has to use the summer months to build the confidence of the party"" going forward to the next general election. In north-east Wales, where the party routed Welsh Labour in the 2019 election, the Tories have fallen from the largest party in one council, Denbighshire, to fourth. That's a result that will do nothing to calm Welsh Tory nerves about Boris Johnson's ability to keep those 2019 Conservative converts on board. Read more analysis of results in Waleshere. The Conservatives have lost control of their only council in Wales. Labour has become the biggest party in Monmouthshire, with the final results now declared in the county. Labour secured 22 seats (up 12), Conservatives 18 (down 12), Greens one (up one). BBC Wales has been told that the Greens will work with Labour. One seat in the Llanfoist ward had to be settled by a coin toss after the Labour and Conservative candidates finished neck and neck. The coin came down in favour of the Tory. Elsewhere across Wales, Labour gained two councils and Plaid Cymru three. Labour regained Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and held Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport and Torfaen, while Plaid retained Gwynedd and gained Anglesey, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said he accepted things ""might not have gone our way"" in parts of Wales. ""We went into these elections with a difficult national picture and it appears that has had an impact,"" he said.

Lutfur Rahman, right, has defeated Labour's John Biggs, left, to become mayor of Tower Hamlets once again John Biggs, Labour's incumbent mayor of Tower Hamlets, has been beaten by Lutfur Rahman in a shock result. Rahman, standing for the Aspire party, wasremoved as mayor of the east London borough in 2015and banned from office for five years after being found guilty of election fraud. However, he beat Biggs after second preference votes were counted. Joseph LeeBBC News Here are some quirky stories we've found in this years election results... After a decade of Labour rule at Hull Council, leader Darren Hale clearly wasn't taking defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats lightly. He told the BBC that the loss was ""a great disappointment"", adding: ""You can't please all of the people all of the time."" Sounding like a man who had received at least one too many letters of complaint from the public, he added: ""I look forward to all the roadworks being completed in the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public, but we'll see.""

For all their importance, local elections aren't known for their star power. And Thurrock Council in Essex lost its bit of celebrity sparkle when Conservative councillor and former 80s singer David Van Day - half of pop duo Dollar - lost his seat to Labour by 20 votes. Still, it's not the first time he's bounced back from disappointment. After stepping out of the limelight, Van Day began to build a business career in the 2000s selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams in Brighton - earning him the nickname ""Burger Van Day"". We have been hearing thatSinn FÃ©in has secured the most first-preference votesin Northern Ireland's Assembly election. So how does the system work? While UK general elections allow voters to choose just one candidate in their local area, NI Assembly elections see voters rank multiple candidates. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. For each constituency, a quota of votes is calculated using a mathematical formula, based on the number of seats and the number of votes cast. Candidates who reach this number of votes from 'first preference votes' (where voters choose them as number one) are elected. If these candidates get votes above the quota number, their extra votes are transferred to other candidates - so the candidate marked ""2"" on those ballot papers gets those votes instead. The candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their second preferences get transferred to other candidates. The same process continues round by round with the lowest candidate being knocked out and their votes being transferred to candidates who are still in the race. You can read more on this here. Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes by a wide margin in Northern Ireland's Assembly election. The party received 250,388 first preferences, compared with the 184,002 returned for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - first preference votes for it have dropped by about 40,000.The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, NI voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been vying for top spot in this election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the offices of the first and deputy first minister are equal with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. Read more about the results in Northern Irelandhere. We're about two thirds of the way through this marathon. The final results should be all done by tomorrow evening.

The live coverage of theNorthern Ireland Assembly results continues here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The local elections don't hold up a perfect mirror to the whole country's desires, or exactly what would happen if a general election had just happened. But they are a valuable measure of the state of the battle of the two main parties who seek to govern us all. Caveats aside, the events of the last 24 hours do matter. Spin back a few weeks, and some Conservatives feared these elections would end in absolute calamity after months of extraordinary revelations about what had been going on in Downing Street during lockdown. The party feared an angry public would punish them at the ballot box. And rising anxiety about making ends meet would translate too into a kicking for the government. 
After all the turmoil, the prime minister's allies fretted. And some of Boris Johnson's detractors darkly hoped a meltdown would give them reason to act to oust him. Now that nearly everything has been counted, the Tories have lost nearly 500 seats across the UK. That represents around a quarter of the council seats they contested. Read more from Laura here Tommorrow's newspaper front pages point the finger at the leaders of Labour and the Conservatives for the performances of their parties in the location elections. The Times says the Tories have been ""punished"" in the south on England, reporting that voters in the party's heartlands are questioning Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership. But the Daily Mail says it is Keir Starmer who is ""in crisis"". The paper has headlinedon Durham Police's investigationinto whether the Labour leader breached lockdown rules along with Labour's performance in the northern 'Red Wall', where the party made some gains but perhaps not on the scale that Labour might have hoped. The Guardian's coverage centres on criticism of Boris Johnson by senior Conservative figures, some of whom have blamed the PM for big Tory losses in London and the south. Susan Thomson was one of eight women who stood for election in the Western Isles Here's one story you might have missed in the flurry of updates today: the Western Isles in Scotland has elected female councillors for the first time since 2012. Susan Thomson and Frances Murray were elected for the SNP, and will be the only two women among the area's 27 councillors. Six other women who stood were not elected. The islands had beenseeking greater female representationon the local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, andheld a workshopearlier this year aimed at encouraging more women to stand. In 2017, for the first time in its history, no women were elected to the comhairle. Seven women stood for election that year. You can read more on this here. It's been a tough day for plenty of would-be councillors, but perhaps even tougher for candidates who lost out through pure chance. In at least three cases, ties for seats were decided through a sophisticated adjudication process - tossing a coin or drawing straws. Independent Andy Solloway won the Skipton West and West Craven division of the newNorth Yorkshireunitary authority after a representative for Labour rival Peter Madeley drew the short straw. Both men had received 503 votes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Similarly, inCarmarthenshire, one result was settled by the toss of a coin, with Labour's Philip Warlow winning a seat in the Bigyn ward after fellow Labour candidate David Darkin guessed incorrectly. Darkin's mother, Janet Williams, had taken one of the ward's other seats. Janet Williams won a seat - but her son lost out due to a coin toss She said she was ""gutted"" for her son. Elsewhere, Tory Lilian Barker was elected in the Crackley and Red Street ward inNewcastle-under-Lyme, after drawing lots with Labour's Claire Radford. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey leaving a polling station in Kingston upon Thames yesterday One of the main stories today has been how the Liberal Democrats have managed to take so many southern English council seats out of Conservative hands: Outside of the South, theLib Dems gained control of Kingston-upon-Hull council, after taking it from Labour control. Labour lost two seats and the Lib Dems gained three. Dylan Tippetts came out as trans in 2018 Dylan Tippetts became Plymouth's first openly trans councillor earlier today, as well as the first Labour councillor in the city's Compton ward. Tippetts, 21, says he hopes his election will help young people who are yet to come out, as well as demonstrating that trans people are ""just normal human beings"". ""For me, it's bigger than just promoting equality and diversity in terms of trans people,"" he added. ""It's promoting the amazing diversity that we've got across our city in all walks of life."" Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Labour MP Luke Pollard tweeted his support for Tippetts, writing: ""As our city's first ever openly gay MP, I am simply over the moon. ""Now the hard work really begins."" Let's take a look at what's been happening around the UK. The Conservatives have lost more than 480 council seats across England, Wales and Scotland, losing key London councils to Labour, and southern English councils to the Liberal Democrats. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Daveyhailed the results as a ""turning point"" for his party. Boris Johnson said the Tories had faced a ""tough"" time. Labour struggled to make any major breakthroughs outside London, although it was already starting at a high watermark from 2018, when these seats were last contested. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party had had a ""really good set of results today"". In Wales,Labour have had 65 more councillors elected, bringing their total to 522. Plaid Cymru lost nine councillors but the party now has control of three more councils. The Conservatives lost 82 councillors, bringing their total to 110. The Liberal Democrats have gained an extra 11 councillors, and the Greens have had their first Welsh councillors elected. In Scotland,the SNP remain the firm favourite of Scottish voters- they've got 453 councillors, after having an extra 22 elected. Labour are up 20 at 282. The Conservatives have lost 63 at 214. There are now 87 Lib Dems, up 20, and the Greens are up 16 at 35. In Northern Ireland, the picture is still emerging, butSinn Fein have the largest first preference vote, followed by the DUP, who have lost around 40,000 first preference votes. Meanwhile, the Alliance party has made big gains. Bury, which made headlines in January whenBury South MP Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour, has seen Labour hold on. The Conservatives lost four seats and the Lib Dems lost three while Labour gained one. Six more independent councillors have been elected. Wakeford tweeted that he was ""immensely proud of the results"",external, describing them as a ""testament to the hard work all year round by Bury Labour"". Christian Wakeford defected to Labour following revelations about lockdown parties in No 10 Several Conservative council leaders have been blaming Boris Johnson after they suffered heavy local election defeats. John Mallinson, who lost in the new Cumberland Council, said voters did not feel the PM could be ""relied upon to tell the truth"". Wandsworth leader Ravi Govindia said ""national issues"" had caused the loss of the flagship council to Labour. But Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden said it was not time to change leader. Johnson said he took responsibility for the results, adding that it was clear voters wanted his government to focus on issues that mattered to them. Read more on this story here. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she shed a happy tear at the news of Roza Salih's election We know that the SNP has again finished as the biggest party in the Scottish council elections and it has emerged that one of its candidates - Roza Salih - has become the first former refugee to be elected to Glasgow City council. The 33-year-old says people in the city have ""always welcomed"" her. ""I've never given up, and now they've trusted in me,"" she said. ""I can't believe it. Twenty years ago I came to this country as a refugee, and to think back I would never have imagined to serve my city."" Salih's family fled Kurdistan in northern Iraq when she was a teenager. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she had shed a ""very happy tear"" at the news. You can read more on this here. Chris PageBBC News Ireland correspondent Sinn FÃ©in has polled the largest number of first preference votes in the Northern Ireland Assembly election by a long way. The first stage of the count is complete in all 18 constituencies. More than a quarter of a million people gave their â1â vote to the republican party. Sinn FÃ©in won 29% of the first preference vote- with the Democratic Unionists receiving 21.3%. Sinn FÃ©in increased its share by just over 1% - while the DUP has seen a drop of almost 7%. A fall in the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) vote - from 12% to 9% - suggests nationalist voters may have rallied around Sinn FÃ©in. A factor in this may be that pre-election polls suggested Sinn FÃ©in could deliver a nationalist first minister for the first time. The DUP seems to have taken a hit not from the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party - but from the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which takes a more hard-line position. The TUV has seen its vote share almost quadruple - to 7.6% - while the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) is down 1.7%. The final result will depend on the 2s, 3s 4s and beyond on the ballot paper. Itâs a complicated process, and counting is now expected to pause overnight and resume on Saturday. Most analysts believe Sinn FÃ©in is on course to win the largest number of seats. For breaking news developments in Northern Ireland, you can keep uphere. The chief secretary to the Treasury says his party ""should be getting right behind the prime minister"" despite losses in the local elections. Simon Clarke told BBC News it had ""not been an easy
night or day for the Conservative Party"". But he insisted that Boris Johnson had ""made the right calls on a whole host of issues since he came in"", such as Brexit, Covid and Ukraine. Clarke conceded that the partygate issue had been ""a difficult backdrop"" to the campaign. However, he said the PM had ""rightly and repeatedly apologised"" for the lockdown parties in Downing Street, and it was ""not the only factor at play"". He added: ""The government has lessons to learn and a new-found focus on delivery."" Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor The results emerging from Wales confirm the worst fears of the Welsh Conservatives. They were always expecting to suffer losses, but not on a scale that could wipe out all the gains they made in the last council elections five years ago. Their leader, Andrew RT Davies, blames the issues that have plagued Boris Johnson's government in Westminster - the cost of living crisis and partygate. He says he still supports the prime minister but ""he has to use the summer months to build the confidence of the party"" going forward to the next general election. In north-east Wales, where the party routed Welsh Labour in the 2019 election, the Tories have fallen from the largest party in one council, Denbighshire, to fourth. That's a result that will do nothing to calm Welsh Tory nerves about Boris Johnson's ability to keep those 2019 Conservative converts on board. Read more analysis of results in Waleshere. The Conservatives have lost control of their only council in Wales. Labour has become the biggest party in Monmouthshire, with the final results now declared in the county. Labour secured 22 seats (up 12), Conservatives 18 (down 12), Greens one (up one). BBC Wales has been told that the Greens will work with Labour. One seat in the Llanfoist ward had to be settled by a coin toss after the Labour and Conservative candidates finished neck and neck. The coin came down in favour of the Tory. Elsewhere across Wales, Labour gained two councils and Plaid Cymru three. Labour regained Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and held Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport and Torfaen, while Plaid retained Gwynedd and gained Anglesey, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said he accepted things ""might not have gone our way"" in parts of Wales. ""We went into these elections with a difficult national picture and it appears that has had an impact,"" he said. You canread more hereabout Monmouthshire and the wider elections results across Wales.  Lutfur Rahman, right, has defeated Labour's John Biggs, left, to become mayor of Tower Hamlets once again John Biggs, Labour's incumbent mayor of Tower Hamlets, has been beaten by Lutfur Rahman in a shock result. Rahman, standing for the Aspire party, wasremoved as mayor of the east London borough in 2015and banned from office for five years after being found guilty of election fraud. However, he beat Biggs after second preference votes were counted. Joseph LeeBBC News Here are some quirky stories we've found in this years election results... After a decade of Labour rule at Hull Council, leader Darren Hale clearly wasn't taking defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats lightly. He told the BBC that the loss was ""a great disappointment"", adding: ""You can't please all of the people all of the time."" Sounding like a man who had received at least one too many letters of complaint from the public, he added: ""I look forward to all the roadworks being completed in the middle of the night by magic pixies with no disruption to the public, but we'll see.""

For all their importance, local elections aren't known for their star power. And Thurrock Council in Essex lost its bit of celebrity sparkle when Conservative councillor and former 80s singer David Van Day - half of pop duo Dollar - lost his seat to Labour by 20 votes. Still, it's not the first time he's bounced back from disappointment. After stepping out of the limelight, Van Day began to build a business career in the 2000s selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams in Brighton - earning him the nickname ""Burger Van Day"". We have been hearing thatSinn FÃ©in has secured the most first-preference votesin Northern Ireland's Assembly election. So how does the system work? While UK general elections allow voters to choose just one candidate in their local area, NI Assembly elections see voters rank multiple candidates. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. For each constituency, a quota of votes is calculated using a mathematical formula, based on the number of seats and the number of votes cast. Candidates who reach this number of votes from 'first preference votes' (where voters choose them as number one) are elected. If these candidates get votes above the quota number, their extra votes are transferred to other candidates - so the candidate marked ""2"" on those ballot papers gets those votes instead. The candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their second preferences get transferred to other candidates. The same process continues round by round with the lowest candidate being knocked out and their votes being transferred to candidates who are still in the race. You can read more on this here. Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes by a wide margin in Northern Ireland's Assembly election. The party received 250,388 first preferences, compared with the 184,002 returned for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - first preference votes for it have dropped by about 40,000.The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, NI voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been vying for top spot in this election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the offices of the first and deputy first minister are equal with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. Read more about the results in Northern Irelandhere. We're about two thirds of the way through this marathon. The final results should be all done by tomorrow evening. The story of the night is that theLiberal Democratshave made big gains while theConservativeshave sustained heavy losses across the country.Labour, entering this fight from an already high watermark in 2018, has made further gains from a strong starting point. TheGreens, too, are finding they have seats in some councils for the first time. InScotland, counting is complete and theSNPhave retained their first-place position in many councils, but Labour have now taken second place as the pro-union opposition. Until recently, that lead opposition job fell to the Conservatives. The SNP, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens have all made gains at the expense of the Conservatives. InWales, the Conservatives have suffered more losses, withPlaid Cymrumaking gains for control of some local authorities. Labour have put in a strong performance.

For all their importance, local elections aren't known for their star power. And Thurrock Council in Essex lost its bit of celebrity sparkle when Conservative councillor and former 80s singer David Van Day - half of pop duo Dollar - lost his seat to Labour by 20 votes. Still, it's not the first time he's bounced back from disappointment. After stepping out of the limelight, Van Day began to build a business career in the 2000s selling hamburgers, doughnuts and ice creams in Brighton - earning him the nickname ""Burger Van Day"". We have been hearing thatSinn FÃ©in has secured the most first-preference votesin Northern Ireland's Assembly election. So how does the system work? While UK general elections allow voters to choose just one candidate in their local area, NI Assembly elections see voters rank multiple candidates. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. For each constituency, a quota of votes is calculated using a mathematical formula, based on the number of seats and the number of votes cast. Candidates who reach this number of votes from 'first preference votes' (where voters choose them as number one) are elected. If these candidates get votes above the quota number, their extra votes are transferred to other candidates - so the candidate marked ""2"" on those ballot papers gets those votes instead. The candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and their second preferences get transferred to other candidates. The same process continues round by round with the lowest candidate being knocked out and their votes being transferred to candidates who are still in the race. You can read more on this here. Sinn FÃ©in has received the most first-preference votes by a wide margin in Northern Ireland's Assembly election. The party received 250,388 first preferences, compared with the 184,002 returned for the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - first preference votes for it have dropped by about 40,000.The Alliance Party has increased its first preference vote by about 44,000 to 116,681. Under the Single Transferrable Vote (STV) system, NI voters can choose as many candidates as they like and rank them in order of preference by writing a number next to their name. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in have been vying for top spot in this election, which comes with the entitlement to nominate the next first minister. While the offices of the first and deputy first minister are equal with joint power, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the Stormont Parliament, since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921.
