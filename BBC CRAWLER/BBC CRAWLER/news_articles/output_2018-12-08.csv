A cultural history of the ponytail,"In 2018, it has a feminist undercurrent, implying âIâm busy, Iâm working, and I need my hair OFF my faceâ There are several specific types of relief that we donât yet have a word for but should: taking your heels off after a night out, removing your bra at the end of the day (read: the second you get home), and the sweet release of taking down a scraped-back ponytail. Ariana Grande can relate to the latter. The 25-year-old pop star has recently admitted being in âconstant painâ from her signature âdo. Considering she premiered it in 2014, that's alongtime to have a hair headache. No wonder she's had a trim and let it alldown,external. Ariana Grande and her signature ponytail on stage at the Billboard Music Awards, May 2018 But until now, she was prepared to suffer for her style, describing her affection for her ponytail as âtrue love,externalâ. French Vogue declared the high ponytail âthe look of Fall 2018,externalâ, and the ponytail hashtag on Instagram brings up 2.3 million hits, with its myriad variations (#ponytailgoals, #ponytailbraids, #highponytail), generating thousands more. All of which seems to suggest that weâre way more yay than neigh (sorry) about 2018âs hottest up-do. But how did we get here? Hereâs a quick hair-story lessonâ¦ Some may think that the semi-bald, semi-ponytail look was invented by a rock music fan who couldnât quite accept the ageing process, but pre-17th century, the male Manchu people of Northeast China grew the hair on the top of their heads long (and often braided it), while the front was shaved. A sort of reverse rocker, if you will. Known as a âqueue,externalâ â the French word for âtailâ â the traditional hairstyle is often associated with theÂ Manchu people, prior to their forming theQing Dynasty,external, the last imperial Chinese Dynasty that ruled from 1644 to 1912. But the ponytail can possibly be traced back to Ancient Greece - when it was seen in frescoes painted thousands of years ago in Crete, set high on the backs of heads of women, according to theEncyclopedia of Hair,external. The Manchu people forcefully introduced the style to Han Chinese men (who along with Han Chinese women, traditionally wore their hair in buns or topknots), during the Manchu conquest of China in the early 17th century. The enforced style was a symbol of submission, with execution the punishment for non-compliance. Chinese men with the Manchu hairstyle from the book Geschichte des KostÃ¼ms (History of the Costume) published in 1905 In 2018, the male ponytail is seen as unconventional and artistic (see celebs identifiable by one name: Zayn, Brad, Jared), but in the 18th century, it was the mandatory style for European soldiers, and considered both hyper-masculine and theepitome of âestablishmentâ,external. French soldiers were required to wear their hair in a queue (ofno longer than eight inches in length,external), while British soldiers and sailors wore their long hair pulled back into ponytails, not always braided, but often greased and/or powdered or tarred. It was secured with ribbon or a strap, so tight that one British soldier said he didnât think heâd be able to âclose his eyelids afterwards,external'. 'Queue' was the commonly used word for the style by soldiers until the 20th century. 'Pony's tail,external' makes one appearance in Anthony Trollope's 1873 book The Eustace Diamonds. The British Army was ordered tocut off its queues in 1800,external, when regulations changed and short hair was deemed smarter and lower maintenance, although the Navy wore a version,known as a 'pigtail',external, until about 1820.Â From left to right: English cavalry officer with braided queue, French officer with loops-pigtail and black ribbon, German officer with pigtail wig and black leather queue Ringlets, chignons, sausage curls, elaborate up-dosâ¦ but the ponytail wasthought of as informal,external. (Anyone who has yanked a hair tie from around their wrist and stuck their hair up in a messy pony, while slobbing about the house can probably agree, right?) It was also viewed as a style for young girls, rather than women. Sandra Dee with Cliff Robertson in Gidget, 1959 When the 20th century arrived, every era had its iconic âdo â the flapper bob in the '20s, the starlet waves in the '40s â and it wasnât until the '50s that the humble ponytail started to get its moment, thanks to thefirst-ever Barbie,external(who came with a perky pony), and film stars such as Sandra Dee making the style famous in films like 1959âsÂGidget,external. As the actress had such a girl-next-door reputation (Rizzo's song inGrease,externalis a quick explanation as to how Dee was regarded in the '50s) the hairstyle, by extension, did too. In the 1960s, the high pony hit pop culture inI Dream of Jeannie,external, another âgoodâ character - a 2,000-year-old genie who devotes her life and sorcery to the human man she loves. It then took the model Brigitte Bardot - AKA the epitome of sexy, insouciant French chic - to tousle it in the '60s, which reinvented the ponytail into a style that the cool girls wore. French film star Brigitte Bardot pioneered the artfully dishevelled ponytail Meanwhile, in the '70s, menâs hair was getting longer again (hello, Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles!) but rather than restricting it, it was all about letting it hang free, man. Itâs pretty apt that the Queen of Reinvention gave the good-girl hairdo another makeover. Madonnaâs 1990 Blonde Ambition tour saw her sporting a clip-on platinum plaited pony that became as legendary as the conical bra she wore it with. Combined with Madgeâs trademark swagger, she made the ponytail synonymous with female empowerment (as well as other style choices). Fans quickly started wearing their hair in copycat ponies to the shows, but Madonna actually dropped the look halfway through the tour because it kept getting caught in her headset â as well as putting too much stress on her natural hair. However, the pony remained iconic, with the hairpiece from the tour selling for Â£12,000 ($20,000)at an auction in 2014,external. Madonna on stage during her Blond Ambition world tour in 1990 Box braids were around long before Janet Jacksonâs romantic moviePoetic Justice, but as theyâre still often referred to as âJanet Jackson braidsâ or âPoetic Justice braids,externalâ, itâs fair to say that she was responsible for their '90s revival. But she didnât stop with one trend. When she pulled the braids back into a high ponytail, she made the box-braid pony officially (as they say in fashion) âa thingâ that A-listers such as Zoe Kravitz and Jada Pinkett-Smith continue to love. In 2013, she paid homage to herself (as only a true diva can) by reviving her own look atMilan fashion week,external. Janet Jackson at the Grammy Awards, 1993 The slicked-back high pony had already been deemed âthe Croydon facelift,externalâ by style snobs - owing to its gravity-defying effect on the visage when pulled tight enough â when Little Britain took any remaining poshness out of the pony. Matt Lucasâs character Vicky Pollard made it synonymous with a tracksuit-wearing teen delinquent.Â Not exactly the ponyâs finest hour, perhaps, but a funny one nonetheless. Kate Moss (left) joins comedian Matt Lucas (aka 'Vicky Pollard') on stage at the Hammersmith Apollo, 2006 Ever wondered at school what equations had to do with real life? Wonder no more. A team of British and American scientists won theIg Nobel for PhysicsÂ for coming up with a calculation that predicts the shape of any ponytail (based on hair length, curliness and the effect of gravity thereon). Sure, we all know theÂequation,externaloff by heart (ahem) - and itâs better known as the âRapunzel Number,externalâ. The award is considered a spoof of the Nobel Prize, but the quirky experiments submitted by the scientists are often designed to tackle real-world problems, and as one of the researchers worked at a giant shampoo company, there was a business interest in 'hairodynamics'. However, it also helped scientists understand other materials better, such as wool and fur. (But it is also a good conversation starter: âHey, whatâs your Rapunzel Number?â) The 2018 pony is a slick, pulled-back number that has a feminist undercurrent, implying âIâm busy, Iâm working, and I need my hair OFF my faceâ. It's a look that's been popularised by the likes of Beyonce at 2015âs Met Gala, J-Lo and the Kardashians, who return to it time and again, and of course Ariana with her seminal pony. BeyoncÃ© makes a statement at the Met Gala, 2015 But as Ariana knows, it comes at a price. Regularly wearing your hair pulled back tightly can cause headaches andtraction alopecia,externalâ a type of hair-loss whereby hair thins out after prolonged stress on the follicle. Which is why Ariana might have decided to give her pony the Thank u, Next treatment (for now). So what now for this unisex, century-spanning do - have we indeed reached peak ponytail? With Meghan Markle regularly pulling her hair back in a simple, mid-height pony, something tells us that itâs not going anywhere, simply reinventing itself again.

Peer's son who killed himself failed by NHSLord Monson's son Rupert Green took his own life while being treated for psychosis.Surrey,"Lord Monson believes his son's mental health problems were related to his use of strong cannabis A peer's son who took his own life was let down by an NHS trust, a coroner has ruled. Rupert Green, a user of strong cannabis and son of hereditary peer Lord Monson, killed himself in January 2017 after displaying symptoms of psychosis. Sitting in Woking, Surrey, assistant coroner Anna Crawford said there had been a failure on the part of Surrey and Borders NHS Trust. The trust said it was ""deeply sorry"" for 21-year-old Mr Green's death. The inquest heard he had been under the care of the Early Intervention in Psychosis Team, a branch of the Surrey trust, since 2016. On 15 January 2017, Mr Green was taken by his mother to an out-of-hours service for people with mental health issues. He was displaying acute psychotic symptoms, ""stating he was the son of God"", and threatening to kill himself if not believed, the inquest heard. Mr Green, pictured here in his childhood, became addicted to skunk cannabis A mental health nurse was said to be ""very concerned about him"" and asked her colleagues at the trust's Home Treatment Team (HTT) to carry out an assessment, but they refused the referral. Instead he was seen for a planned review the following day. He continued to display signs of psychosis but stopped threatening to kill himself. On 18 January he began the threats again, and told his mother there ""would be blood on her hands"" if she did not believe him. He was found dead later that day in the family's garden. Lord Monson has appealed for tougher penalties for those who deal in the skunk strain of cannabis Concluding Friday's inquest hearing, Ms Crawford said there had been ""a failure on the part of the HTT to assess and care for Rupert during the period of 15-18 January 2017"", but there was not a sufficient connection ""between that failure and Rupert's death"" to conclude there had been neglect. Justin Wilson, the trust's chief medical officer, said after the hearing: ""Our serious investigation into the care and treatment provided to Rupert has shown the communication between our Safe Haven service and Home Treatment Team was not clear and requires improvement. ""There was a missed opportunity for more intensive support from our Home Treatment Team and we have worked closely with the services involved to make positive changes."" In 2017, Nicholas Monson told the BBC his son, who was heir to the family's Burton estate in Lincolnshire, had suffered from psychosis as a result of an addiction to skunk - a strong form of cannabis. The peer has campaigned for the legalisation of milder forms of cannabis and tougher penalties for those dealing the skunk strain.

Asylum seeker 'children' found to be adults,"The government say age-disputed cases are ""challenging"" Twenty-four asylum seekers who claimed they were children after being sent to Liverpool were found to be adults, the city's council has said. The authority said another 15 asylum seekers ""should have been identified as children"" by the government and accommodated in London instead. A Home Office spokesman said age-disputed cases remain ""a very challenging area"". Liverpool City Council wants to recover Â£657,000 for supporting the children. A council document,externalsaid 39 asylum seekers sent to Liverpool by the Home Office in 2018 ""have then claimed they were children"". The authority ""had to pay for an 'age assessment' for each one (costing Â£1,500 each) that concluded that 15 were children and 24 were adults"". Support for children includes more benefits and educational provision, ""which they cannot access if they are an adult seeking asylum"", according to the document. ""The 15 children should not have been sent by the Home Office to Liverpool,"" it continued, ""they should have been identified as children by the Home Office and therefore received support from a local social services (such as in Croydon) and not be a cost to Liverpool City Council"". As they had been assessed as children in Liverpool, the council was obliged to support them - the costs of which are ""approximately Â£657,000 per year"". It said it ""should be able to recover the costs associated with the children who should never have been sent to Liverpool"". The document also highlighted: the council has been ""threatened"" with judicial reviews from legal advisers for some of the asylum seekers found to be adults it was providing them with accommodation at a cost of ""approximately Â£350,000 per year"" to avoid legal costs it has decided to fund legal advice to challenge the next six cases ""where the young person is assessed as an adult and a judicial review is threatened by the asylum seeker's legal adviser"" the council has asked the Home Office to fund independent age assessments earlier in the process A Home Office spokesman said ""safeguarding children"" was a priority, adding ""age-disputed cases remain a very challenging area of work in which no single assessment technique, or combination of techniques, is likely to determine an individual's age with precision"". ""The Home Office will treat someone claiming to be a child as an adult where their physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggests that they are significantly over 18."" He added that funding for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children was under review. David Simmonds, deputy chairman for the Local Government Association, said the issue was spread nationwide. ""The process at the border is pretty weak because there is no definitive way of checking age. ""Lawyers know a judicial review will cost a council between Â£20,000 and Â£60,000 and use the threat of court to get their client what they want. ""Fair play to Liverpool for trying to stand up to it. But win or lose, the taxpayer always loses out.""

Major government contractor 'seeks rescue',"Among the company's contracts is for cleaning at Network Rail stations One of the UK's largest providers of public services is seeking a rescue deal as it struggles with Â£500m of debt,according to the Financial Times.,external Interserve, which works in prisons, schools, hospitals and on the roads, said it might look for new investment or sell off part of the business. Workers at the Foreign Office and the NHS are among Interserve's tens of thousands of UK employees. The government said it supported the company's long-term recovery plan. The Financial Times reported that the company was looking for a deal to refinance its debt which would mean lenders taking a significant loss while public shareholders would be ""virtually wiped out"". Its share price dropped to a 30-year low last month. Despite lucrative contracts in the Middle East and its wide range of work in the UK, the company has continued to lose money since March, when it agreed an earlier rescue deal. Its troubles have been blamed on cancellations and delays in its construction contracts as well as struggling waste-to-energy projects in Derby and Glasgow. Interserve claims its prospects are improving, and says it will increase profits this year. From its origins in dredging and construction, the company has diversified into wide range of services, such as health care and catering, for clients in government and industry. At King George Hospital in east London, for instance, Interserve has a Â£35 million contract for for cleaning, security, meals, waste management and maintenance. Its infrastructure projects include improving the M5 Junction 6 near Bristol, refurbishing the Rotherham Interchange bus station in Yorkshire, and upgrading sewers and water pipes for Northumbrian Water. But Interserve is also the largest provider of probation services in England and Wales, supervising about 40,000 ""medium-low risk offenders"" for the Ministry of Justice. In a statement, Interserve said: ""The fundamentals of the business are strong and the board is focused on ensuring Interserve has the right financial structure to support its future success."" The company said its options included bringing ""new capital into the business and progressing the disposal of non-core businesses "". Interserve's difficulties follow the collapse of Carillion in January 2018, whichput thousands of jobs at risk and cost taxpayers Â£148m. Interserve shares dive on fears for future Government reassures over Interserve Following that, the government launched a pilot of ""living wills"" for contractors, so that critical services can be taken over in the event of a crisis. Interserve is one of five suppliers taking part. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ""We monitor the financial health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Interserve, and have regular discussions with the company's management. The company successfully raised new debt facilities earlier this year, and we fully support them in their long term recovery plan.""

Six dead in Italy nightclub stampede,"This video can not be played Emergency services attend the wounded at the scene in Corinaldo Six people have been killed and dozens have been injured, 12 of them seriously, in a stampede at a nightclub in Italy, officials say. Some reports say there was panic after pepper spray was fired inside the club in the town of Corinaldo, near the eastern coastal city of Ancona. Up to 1,000 people were inside the Lanterna Azzurra club attending a concert by rapper Sfera Ebbasta. Five of the victims were 14 to 16 years old. The sixth was a 39-year-old woman. She had gone to the club with her daughter. The incident took place at about 01:00 (midnight GMT) as Italy began celebrating the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. The concert had not yet begun when ""acrid smell"" forced crowds to rush towards the emergency exits. The accident occurred after railings gave way and people began falling off a walkway. Many of the injured suffered crushing wounds and broken limbs. The injured have been taken to hospitals in Senigallia and Ancona. Seven are said to be in intensive care.

Breaking|Breaking newsTrump chief of staff John Kelly to quitDonald Trump says chief of staff John Kelly will leave his job by the end of the year.US & Canada,"Some reports suggest Mr Kelly's relationship with Mr Trump has deteriorated President Donald Trump has announced that his chief of staff John Kelly will leave his job by the end of the year. There have been persistent reports for several days that Gen Kelly was under pressure to go. Some reports said that the retired Marine Corps general's relationship with Mr Trump had deteriorated. But Mr Trump described Mr Kelly as a ""great guy"" and said a replacement would be named ""over the next day or two"". The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The people around Donald Trump ""He's been with me almost two years now, between two positions,"" Mr Trump said. ""I appreciate his service very much."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America correspondent John Kelly came into the job promising to bring military discipline to an administration riddled with leaks and palace intrigue. He can claim some success - but the leaks never completely disappeared and, by the end, the chief of staff was as deep into the back-stabbing and personnel drama as anyone. A White House job is never easy, but this administration has chewed through senior staff at a record pace. Donald Trump is on his third national security adviser, fifth communications director and soon to be third chief of staff. The one constant is the man in the Oval Office. He likes to say his administration operates like a well-oiled machine, but the grinding gears are amassing quite a professional body count. In total, 28 people have resigned or been fired from the White House during Mr Trump's administration. Last month Reuters news agency quoted a source as saying that Vice-President Mike Pence's chief of staff Nick Ayers was a possible contender for the chief of staff role. This video can not be played What Mr Kelly said in October 2017: 'I was not brought in to control Trump' Earlier this year Gen Kelly was forced to deny that he had called Mr Trump an ""idiot"" after the quote was included in a book about Mr Trump by the veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward. Gen Kelly is said to have used the description repeatedly and also allegedly said that ""it's pointless to try to convince him of anything"". Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes Why the Woodward effect damages Trump Mr Trump initially nominated Gen Kelly to oversee Homeland Security before promoting him to chief of staff last July, replacing Reince Priebus. On Saturday, the president also announced that his highest-ranking military officer, Gen Joe Dunford, would be retiring as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He tweeted to say Gen Mark Milley, the current Chief of Staff of the US Army, would replace Gen Dunford.

'I drive 10 minutes to open an email'Villagers in west Wales say slow internet speeds are causing problems for business owners.Wales,"This video can not be played Cothi Valley 'blighted' by poor internet speeds A business owner has said slow internet speeds mean he has to take a 10 minute drive in order to email clients. Rhydian Thomas is among a group of homeowners in the Cothi Valley, Carmarthenshire, who say broadband as slow as 0.1Mbps creates obstacles in their personal and professional lives. Openreach said nearly 95% of Wales now had access to fibre optic broadband. But Mr Thomas said that where he lives, ""it takes an entire day to download a film"". The number of Welsh homes able to access superfast broadband has increased since 2013when availability was the lowest in the UK at just 48%,external, with just 370,000 properties able to access it. Five years later, the number of homes in Wales able to access speeds of 24Mbps or above stands at about 720,000, following the completion of the Superfast Cymru scheme. But critics said Superfast Cymru's rollout was too slow and still left some communities lagging behind. Some residents in the Cothi Valley are connected to the internet via copper wiring to a telephone exchange 6km (3.7miles) away. Electrical contractor Mr Thomas said ""painfully slow"" speeds caused him frequent problems. ""I need the internet to access emails for various jobs or update details on work that I have just done. But the speeds are so slow that it takes forever just to open a webpage,"" he said. ""It can dip out completely if it starts raining - and I've lost count of the amount of times I've had to drive into Carmarthen to use free wifi in a cafe just to send an email."" Welsh internet via satellite over Africa Fed up villagers install fast broadband Why schoolgirl does homework in a lay-by The father-of-one said it has also frustrated him while he launches a new business for audio speakers. Neighbour John Burton said: ""In terms of speeds, it's like we are 10-15 years behind everyone else. The situation is made all the more worse when the mobile signal is non-existent too."" He added that residents' efforts to persuade Openreach and the Welsh Government to upgrade the line had proved fruitless. Residents said they have looked into installing their own network - but it was too expensive given the small number of houses. Rhydian Thomas and other homeowners in the village experience download speeds as low as 0.5Mbps Swansea University business lecturer Dr Robert Bowen said broadband access had improved dramatically - but ""not spots"" meant rural places risked becoming even more isolated. ""When you consider some of these places do not have a local bank anymore, because their bank has closed, then reliable and fast access to the internet isn't a luxury but more of an essential service,"" he said. ""It also limits opportunities for businesses and plays a factor in younger people moving away. ""A lot of progress has been made but more still needs to be done, because for some it's still very much a postcode lottery."" UK homes to get faster broadband by 2020 Village 'abandoned' over broadband Villagers often struggle to connect to the internet Openreach said it was working on the successor to superfast broadband - fibre first - with speeds of up to one gigabit per second. The latest city to be signed up to the upgrade, which aims to reach three million UK homes and businesses by 2020, is Swansea. Managing director Kim Mears said: ""We've already done an incredible amount of work across Wales in improving access to better broadband connectivity - both in rural and urban parts of the country. ""Despite the challenges of planning, street works and permissions, our engineers are already reaching thousands of homes and businesses every week."" The firm also said Wales now had better fibre broadband coverage than Germany, Italy or France. The Welsh Government insisted Superfast Cymru had ""transformed the digital landscape in Wales"". A spokeswoman said: ""In 2013 less than half of premises in Wales had access to superfast broadband compared with over nine out of 10 now.  We know there is more to do to reach the final premises without access."" How has superfast broadband rollout gone?

Missing mosaic pieces returned to TurkeyFragments of the ancient Gypsy Girl mosaic given back by a US university go on show at a museum.Europe,"The missing pieces were smuggled out of Turkey in the 1960s Missing fragments of an ancient mosaic known as the Gypsy Girl have been put on display in a museum in Turkey after being returned from the United States. The fragments are being displayed next to the incomplete, almost 2,000-year-old mosaic of a young girl. Her haunting eyes have become a symbol of the southern city of Gaziantep. The missing pieces were smuggled out of Turkey in the 1960s and bought by a US university, which finally agreed to give them back. The Gypsy Girl mosaic was excavated in 1998 Archaeologists discovered the mosaic 20 years ago while excavating the remains of the city of Zeugma, founded by a general of Alexander the Great and destroyed in the 3rd Century. However, several pieces had already been looted and smuggled out of the country. Satanic statue installed at US statehouse Rare white reindeer spotted in Norway Afghanistan's 'Little Messi' flees home They had been bought by Bowling Green State University in Ohio. In 2012 Turkey asked for their return, which was finally agreed after five years of talks. On Saturday the missing pieces were exhibited in Gaziantep's Zeugma Mosaic Museum.

"'I feel cheated' - right to die campaignerNoel Conway, a terminally ill man with motor neurone disease, was refused permission by the Supreme Court last week to challenge the law on assisted dying.Health","Noel Conway is dependent on a ventilator to help him breathe Noel Conway says ""a medieval mindset"" has prevented him having the right to control when he dies. The retired lecturer from Shropshire, who is terminally ill with motor neurone disease, was refused permission by the Supreme Court last week to challenge the law on assisted dying. He told me he was ""bitterly disappointed, bewildered, and felt cheated"" by the decision. The only way he can end his life now in the UK is to remove his ventilator. But Mr Conway is not ready to die. He is too busy publishing a collection of short stories and finishing his memoirs. He uses voice recognition software to dictate to his computer because he has no movement below his head and neck. Mr Conway wants a doctor to be allowed to prescribe him a lethal dose of drugs, when he has less than six months to live. Before his illness Noel Conway was a keen skier, climber and cyclist Supported by the campaign group Dignity in Dying, his legal team have spent the past two years challenging the blanket ban on assisted dying. They argue that the Suicide Act, which makes it an offence to help someone to die, contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights. But that legal challenge came to an abrupt end at the end of November, when the Supreme Court refused permission to hear an appeal - Mr Conway's case had already been rejected by two lower courts. Mr Conway, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014, told me he was ""bitterly disappointed, bewildered, and felt cheated"". Speaking at his home in Shropshire he told me that more and more jurisdictions around the world were introducing assisted dying: ""One hundred million people worldwide can access a dignified and humane ending to their lives, but we can't in this country. ""We are governed by a medieval mindset which overrides more modern ways of thinking, like the Human Rights Act."" Mr Conway said his only option of ending his life in this country was by removing his ventilator. He is still able to breathe without the mechanical device for short periods, and there is uncertainty as to how long he might survive without it. ""If it's removed I should have only a few minutes to live, but it could be hours or even days."" The Supreme Court was told that any distress could be managed through palliative care. Mr Conway says he accepts there would be pain relief, but argues that it would leave him in a ""semi-conscious state"" and deny him a dignified death: ""It would be terrible for my wife and family, not knowing whether I could hear them or how long it would take before I expired."" Mr Conway told me he would continue to campaign for assisted dying, even though all legal options are now closed. MPs overwhelmingly rejected proposals to allow assisted dying in England and Wales in 2015. Care Not Killing, which opposes assisted dying, said the Supreme Court had been right to reject a ""dangerous attempt to legalise assisted suicide"", adding that the current law balances an individual's rights with the need to protect vulnerable people, who could feel pressured into ending their lives.

China threatens Huawei arrest consequences,"Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of the company's founder China has demanded that Canada release the arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou or face consequences. Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng separately summoned both the US and Canadian ambassadors and lodged a ""strong protest"" urging her release. The ministry described Ms Meng's arrest as ""extremely nasty"". Ms Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer and daughter of the firm's founder, is accused of breaking US sanctions on Iran. She was held in Vancouver last Saturday and faces extradition to the US, where she could be jailed for up to 30 years if found guilty. China insists that she has not violated any laws. Why Huawei matters in five charts What's going on with Huawei? A quick guide to the US-China trade war On Friday Ms Meng appeared before a Canadian court, which adjourned a decision on whether or not to allow bail until Monday. Ms Meng's arrest while she was changing planes in Vancouver last Saturday was a serious breach of her rights, Reuters quoted the foreign ministry as saying. It ""ignored the law"" and was ""unreasonable"", it said. ""China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately release the detained person... otherwise Canada must accept full responsibility for the serious consequences caused,"" the statement added. On Sunday, Le Yucheng made similar demands to the US, warning: ""China will respond further depending on US actions."" The Supreme Court of British Columbia was told that Ms Meng had used a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. A court sketch shows Meng Wanzhou during Friday's bail hearing The court was told that she had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company. It heard a Canadian prosecutor say that Ms Meng was accused of ""conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions"". The prosecutor said she had denied to US bankers any direct connections between Huawei and SkyCom, when in fact ""SkyCom is Huawei"". Ms Meng could be a flight risk and thus should be denied bail, he added. The arrest has put further strain on US-China relations. The two countries have been locked in trade disputes, althougha 90-day truce had been agreedon Saturday - before news of the arrest came to light on Wednesday. Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Friday that China had been assured that due process was being followed and Ms Meng would have consular access while her case was before the courts. Ms Freeland reiterated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's claim that Ms Meng's arrest had ""no political involvement"". By BBC Monitoring Meng Wanzhou, 46, joined Huawei as early as 1993, when she began a career at her father's company as a receptionist. After she graduated with a master's degree in accountancy from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 1999, she joined the finance department of Huawei. She became the company's chief finance officer in 2011 and was promoted to vice-chair a few months before her arrest. Ms Meng's links to her father, Ren Zhengfei, were not known to the public until a few years ago. In a practice highly unusual in Chinese tradition, she adopted her family name not from her father but her mother, Meng Jun, who was Mr Ren's first wife. Some Western governments fear Beijing will gain access to fifth-generation (5G) mobile and other communications networks through Huawei and expand its spying ability, although the firm insists there is no government control. Japan is expected to ban government use of products made by Huawei and ZTE over cybersecurity concerns, local media reported on Friday.It would follow moves by New Zealand and Australia to block Huawei. Should we worry about Huawei? Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? US National Security Adviser John Bolton said his country has had ""enormous concerns for years"" about the practice of Chinese firms ""to use stolen American intellectual property, to engage in forced technology transfers, and to be used as arms of the Chinese government's objectives in terms of information technology in particular"". ""Not respecting this particular arrest, but Huawei is one company we've been concerned about,"" he said. US PresidentDonald Trump last month reinstated all the US sanctions on Iranthat had been removed under a 2015 nuclear deal. Trump re-imposes Iran sanctions: Now what? Iran nuclear deal: Key details Mr Trump had been fiercely opposed to the deal, which saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The re-imposed sanctions hit oil exports, shipping and banks - all core parts of Iran's economy. Although there are some waivers, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the US will ""aggressively"" target any firm or organisation ""evading our sanctions"".

How China's tech sensation overtook Apple,"Huawei is the poster child for China's dynamic tech sector. It has grown phenomenally in recent years, from a small manufacturer of telephone exchange switches, to become a global leader in the tech industry. While the brand is familiar to many from its mobile phone handsets, Huawei has its finger in many other pies - from cloud services to artificial intelligence. And despite increasing controversy around whether using Huawei telecoms equipmentposes a security risk, the block on its business deals in some countries, andthe arrest in Canada of one of its executives, the company itself has continued on its steady path of global growth. That growth has come against the backdrop of China's continued rise, on its way to becoming the world's second largest economy, providing the firm with a huge base upon which to build its initial market as a springboard to international expansion. Most noticeably for consumers, Huawei has swept into the market for consumer electronics, in particular with smartphones. Earlier this year it overtook Apple in the number of handsets it was shipping worldwide. Shipments don't always translate into phones reaching consumers, but the uptick in production and distribution still reflectsa rise in Huawei's popularity, including for both premium models and its lower-priced Honor brand. Expanding sales of smartphones comes despite political hostility towards the brand in some parts of the world, especially the US. There, no carriers support Huawei, so while consumers can buy a Huawei phone, they aren't widely marketed. But it's in telecoms network equipment, which forms the largest part of Huawei's business, that is having its greatest impact on the company. The US has banned the use of Huawei equipment in communications networks, warning of security risks and has called for other governments to follow suit. Nevertheless, in all parts of the world, even in the Americas, the market for Huawei products has grown over the past three years. Washington's decision to block the use of Huawei equipment in telecommunications infrastructure on security grounds has been emulated in New Zealand, Australia and Japan. With the US pressing for other governments to follow suit, that raises questions over whether the firm's global expansion is set to be curtailed in some regions in the near future. Currently though, Huawei is holding its own in one of the largest parts of its business, the sale of mobile telecommunications infrastructure equipment, such as that needed to supportthe roll-out of faster 5G networks. But how much Huawei continues to grow, won't depend only on political attitudes in Western capitals. It will depend on how well the Chinese tech giant's products compare with its competitors. In the past, the firm has been accused - like many Chinese companies - of copying technology developed in the West and then undercutting rivals on prices. But Huawei is currently outspending many other global players in research and development in a bid to gain a future edge. Prospects may not be as bright for Huawei now as they used to be, given the political squeeze from the West. But, the firm went through the financial crisis largely unaffected thanks to a powerful domestic market in China, IHS Markit industry analyst Stephane Teral points out. The same could happen again if it loses more contracts in the West. ""Huawei went through this unfazed with no problems, because they were able to diversify at a time when China was just taking off, including telecoms restructuring, that really helped Huawei,"" he said.

Gunman's seized trainers up for auction,"A studded pair of Christian Louboutin high tops is among the pairs of trainers that will be up for auction Dozens of pairs of designer trainers that were seized after a gangster was arrested are to be sold at auction. Isaiah Hanson-Frost, 22, is serving a six-year jail sentence for shooting a gun at a car containing rival gang members. The 55 pairs of trainers, valued at about Â£18,500. include brands such as Christian Louboutin, Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo and Gucci. The money raised will go towards helping to prevent crime. During a hearing at Gloucester Crown Court on 23 November, Hanson-Frost denied possession of criminal property but agreed to hand over the collection. A total of 55 pairs will be auctioned off to raise money for the High Sheriff's Fund in Gloucestershire Under the Police Property Act, the Gloucestershire force can auction off the trainers. Det Insp Dave Shore-Nye said: ""We often see the reason for someone to commit crime is down to their own personal greed and to make money. ""We are keen to put a stop to anyone who is living a lavish lifestyle which has been funded through crime, and this shows the level Gloucestershire Constabulary will go to in order to strip a criminal of their assets and then put the money to good use."" These trainers are by the Italian designer Giacomo Morelli Hanson-Frost was jailed in Aprilafter admitting violent disorder and possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence in relation to the shooting, which happened on the Chase Lane Industrial Estate in Gloucester.

"Man traced on missing airman footageCorrie Mckeague's mother says the public would be ""horrified"" if they saw the CCTV footage.Suffolk","Corrie Mckeague's mother said the CCTV footage showed her son ""did not go in the bin"" A man captured on CCTV and believed by a missing airman's mother to be her son has identified himself to detectives. Police viewed the footage during their investigation into Corrie Mckeague's disappearance from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 2016. His mother Nicola Urquhart said the public would be ""horrified"" to see it, as it cast doubt on the police theories over her son's whereabouts. Police said the man captured on CCTV had been traced. The BBC asked for the CCTV footage to be released under the Freedom of Information Act. Suffolk Police turned down the request on the grounds of data protection laws. Mr Mckeague was last seen on CCTV at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016 Mr Mckeague was last seen entering a bin loading bay when he was on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, leadingpolice to believe he had gone into one of the bins. But his remains were not found despite a 20-week trawl of a landfill site near Cambridge. Missing airman 'in waste disposal system' The tragedy that shaped Corrie Mckeague Missing airman 'may have dodged CCTV' Mrs Urquhart said she had viewed CCTV footage which she said showed a man leaving the bin loading bay. She said the footage was ""grainy"" but it showed a person ""wearing incredibly bright, reflective clothing, which looks like white trousers"". Mrs Urquhart said she believed it was her son and if members of the public saw the footage ""no-one would believe he went in the bin"". Detectives spent 20 weeks searching the landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire Suffolk Police said the footage showed three individuals who were ""tracked walking into the area and away from the area"". It said clearer images of them were found, ""enabling identification"". The force said all three individuals had been spoken to by police and had identified themselves from the images. It said it was ""confident"" none of them was Mr Mckeague. The force said the individuals were ruled out in autumn 2016. Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline, Fife, was 23 when he went missing. He was last seen entering in the bin loading area at 03:25 on 24 September.

Tear gas as French protests turn violent,"This video can not be played Protesters surged forward before tear gas was fired Police in Paris have fired rubber bullets and tear gas as a fourth weekend of anti-government protests across France turned violent. Almost 1,000 people have been taken into custody nationwide. Parisian hospital authorities said 126 people had been injured in the city, but none seriously. At least three police officers were also hurt. The ""yellow vest"" movement opposed fuel tax rises but ministers say it has been hijacked by ""ultra-violent"" protesters. An estimated 125,000 demonstrators gathered across the country during the day, with 10,000 of them in the capital, where the scenes were the most destructive. Looters have been seen smashing shop fronts, and cars have been set on fire. In pictures: France's latest protests Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests French students 'humiliated by police' In a television address on Saturday evening, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the ""casseurs"" (troublemakers) were still at work. He called for more communication between the government and protesters to resolve the conflict. ""The dialogue has begun,"" he said. ""It is now necessary to rebuild the national unity."" Apart from Paris, there were demonstrations in several other cities on Saturday including Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille and Grenoble. Some places also had separate climate change marches taking place. There have been a number of confrontations in the capital. Video footage showed one demonstrator being hit in the torso with a rubber bullet while standing in front of a line of police with his hands up. At least three members of the press were also hit. Water cannon were deployed on a street east of the city centre. Who supports the 'gilets jaunes' As night fell, protesters converged on Place de la RÃ©publique, and a heavy police presence remained on the  Champs-ElysÃ©es. Nearly 90,000 officers were deployed countrywide in anticipation of clashes, including 8,000 in Paris where 12 armoured vehicles were also utilised. Last week, hundreds of people were arrested and 162 were injured in violence in Paris - some of the worst street clashes in the French capital for decades. This weekend, six matches in the top tier of France's football league were postponed. The Louvre, MusÃ©e d'Orsay and other sites were also closed all day in Paris. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris The French government is relieved that its worst forebodings about the protests did not come to pass. There was certainly some violence in Paris, but it was not on the scale of the week before. The new tactics of the police - record numbers of officers deployed, moving quickly to occupy the ground and not hesitating to make arrests - paid off. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the escalation of violence had been stopped. It is a relief for President Macron - but not much more. He must know that the moment will be thrown away if he does not move in quickly now with ideas that go some way to satisfying the more moderate of the yellow vests. The time is for dialogue, the government says, and the president will make an address to the nation early this week. The question is will he give the protesters what they want, which is something very simple: more money in their pockets. Does he think France can afford to economically? The sentiment of the anti-government protests has inspired other spin-off protests in nearby countries. About 100 people were arrested in the capital Brussels. Some threw paving stones, fireworks, flares and other objects at police, according to AP news agency. In the Netherlands, a protest was held outside parliament in The Hague, with an estimated 100 participants. The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters are so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. Over the past few weeks, the social media movement has morphed from a protest over fuel prices to a leaderless spectrum of interest groups and differing demands. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Its core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, still has widespread support. This video can not be played Gilets Jaunes: Are nationalists infiltrating the ""yellow vests""? An opinion poll on Friday showed a dip in support for the protests, but it still stood at 66%. Meanwhile, President Emmanuel Macron's ratings have fallen to 23% amid the crisis, polls suggest. The government has said it is scrapping the unpopular fuel tax increases in its budget and has frozen electricity and gas prices for 2019. The problem is that protests have erupted over other issues. Granting concessions in some areas may not placate all the protesters, some of whom are calling for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions, easier university requirements and even the resignation of the president. Some of Mr Macron's critics call him ""the president of the rich"". Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?

Why 'yellow vests' won't stop,"The protests look set to continue over the weekend ""We are fed up of hearing promises from politicians. The French don't believe in them any more."" Freddie Bouvier, a truck driver from Beauvais in northern France, is one of thousands of ""yellow vest"" protesters rallying against President Emmanuel Macron and his government. They first took to the streets to protests against a rising fuel tax - a move since abandoned by the government - but the scope has become far greater. At least four people have died and hundreds have been arrested in the worst unrest to hit France in decades. And further nationwide protests are being held on Saturday. Paris sites to close amid riot fears Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? French students 'humiliated by police' ""Whether it's a suspension or a freeze of the fuel tax, it's all good news,"" Mr Bouvier tells the BBC. ""But these are just words. We want to see action quickly."" The movement cuts across age, job and region. It includes members of the working and middle classes, all affected by the higher cost of living in France. President Macron was elected on a programme of economic reform, and there is widespread fury that his new policies have failed to deliver the promised change. Claude Rigolet tells the BBC his income has dropped by almost a fifth since 2000, and has stopped him from eating out or going on holiday in the summer. ""Everything is more expensive,"" the retiree from Reims says. ""Taxes are going up - housing, heating costs, cars. Everything is going up."" Natacha Perchat agrees. The cleaner from Reims says that the fuel tax was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"". ""They [the government] are hitting the little people hard. My husband works for a transport company. We're not wealthy. We're already in the red at the beginning of the month,"" she says. ""Mid-month we have to use gift vouchers for our children to buy food. This can't go on. We don't live, we survive. It's a scandal."" Polls suggest a majority of French people still back the movement Delphine Notelet, 45, from Honfleur in Normandy told French magazine Marianneshe earns â¬1200 a month after tax for her job caring for the elderly,external. After bills, that leaves her with â¬50 a week. She wants a better life for children, who can see the difficulties for themselves. ""Emmanuel Macron didn't want to listen to us?"" she says. ""We're proving to him that we are not puppets swallowed under an avalanche of taxes, but citizens."" Despite the deaths of four people and injuries to hundreds more, the French people overwhelmingly support the protests - albeit with reservations. Hours before the government cancelled its proposed tax rise, a poll conducted for French newspaper Le Figaro showed78% believed the yellow vests are fighting for France's general interest,external. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? However, nearly half of respondents - 47% - believe it is violent, and 59% admit they are worried by the movement. ""All demonstrations get a bit violent, ""Mr Bouvier says. ""But the troublemakers are the result of the way we have marginalised people. Today they live on benefits and trafficking, stealing. And this is how they express their anger at the system."" Social media, and in particular Facebook, is at the core of the demonstrations. According to broadcaster BFM TV, three Facebook groups -La France en colÃ¨re,external(Angry France),Gilet Jaune,externalandGilet jaune,external- had the most interaction on Wednesday, when the fuel tax rise was scrapped. Users from across France post memes, images and text expressing their anger and denouncing the government. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Memo reveals Cohen's help on Russia probe,"Cohen once famously vowed he would take a bullet for Mr Trump President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer has given substantial help on how Russian nationals tried to affect the 2016 election, a legal memo has revealed. Michael Cohen's help is detailed in the memo from Robert Mueller, who is heading the probe into alleged Russian collusion with the Trump team. The memo is mainly to guide sentencing for crimes Cohen has admitted. A second Mueller memo sets out the case against ex-campaign chief Paul Manafort for breaching a plea bargain deal. Cohen and Manafort are among a number of Trump aides being investigated in Special Counsel Mueller's probe. Both have been co-operating with his team but Mr Mueller now accuses Manafort of lying. Michael Cohen: Trump's pit bull Manafort: The man who helped Trump win In a separate court filing on Friday, prosecutors in New York made their case for the length of Cohen's sentence when it is delivered on Wednesday. They say he should serve a ""substantial"" jail term after admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. President Trump has repeatedly denied there was any collusion with Russian officials, calling the investigation a ""witch hunt"". The White House said Friday's memos offered nothing new or damaging about the president. Mr Trump tweeted: ""Totally clears the President. Thank you!"" although it was unclear to what he was referring. It isa government sentencing memorandum on the one charge of lying to Congress,external. Cohen had admitted making false statements about a Trump property deal, out of loyalty to the president. The memo from Robert Mueller's office says there were ""sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US presidential election"" The memo says that although this crime was serious, any sentencing should be served concurrently with the New York prosecutors' recommendations on other crimes. Five big things Mueller is looking at Trump Russia: The saga in 250 words The memo says Cohen has taken ""significant steps to mitigate his criminal conduct"". The key elements of the memo are about the Russian links. They are that Cohen: ""Provided information about his own contacts with Russian interests during the campaign and discussions with others in the course of making those contacts"" ""Also provided information about attempts by other Russian nationals to reach the campaign"" Spoke to ""a Russian national who claimed to be a 'trusted person' in the Russian Federation who could offer the campaign 'political synergy' and 'synergy on a government level'"". This person proposed a meeting between Individual 1 (previously identified by Cohen as Mr Trump) and the Russian president, saying it could have a ""phenomenal"" impact ""not only in political but in a business dimension as well"". The meeting did not take place Provided ""relevant and useful information concerning his contacts with persons connected to the White House during the 2017-2018 time period The New York prosecutors' submission said,externalCohen had committed four federal crimes over several years. ""He was motivated to do so by personal greed, and repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends,"" the filing said. One of the crimes Cohen admitted was paying hush money to two women who alleged they had affairs with Mr Trump. This could amount to a violation of US campaign finance laws. While the prosecutors accepted Cohen's help with the Mueller investigation should be taken into account in sentencing, they said it should only bring a ""modest"" reduction on the guidelines of four to five years. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher In a one-two punch of court filings, the memos say that Cohen should get credit for providing useful information to investigators. But not too much credit. Some of the information in the special counsel's document is already known. The negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow, which lasted well into the 2016 presidential campaign, were once again outlined. But the document drives home the point that Donald Trump was kept informed about the possible deal, which could have netted ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" and that the negotiations took place ""at a time of sustained efforts by the Russian government to interfere with the US election"". Other details Cohen supplied are largely left to the imagination. The president is also once again implicated in the campaign finance charges against Cohen. The New York prosecutors state that Mr Trump's lawyer acted to silence two women who claim they had affairs with Mr Trump in order to ""influence the 2016 presidential election"". What's more, Cohen ""acted in co-ordination with and at the direction of Individual 1"". What all this means is that prosecutors in New York and Washington are claiming the president had implicit knowledge and involvement in a campaign finance crime. He also had knowledge of a massive property deal that involved contacts with Russian government officials while he was running for president in an election that was being targeted for influence by the Russian government. The picture they paint is a dark one. Paul Manafort served for five months with the Trump campaign team, three of them as campaign manager, before being sacked. This latest memo, from Mr Mueller's office,external, tries to spell out how the special counsel believes Manafort breached a plea bargain deal by lying to investigators. Manafort was convicted of financial fraud in Augustrelating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. He then accepted a plea bargain deal under which he would help with the Russia inquiry. The deal had meantManafort would face up to 10 years in prison, with certain charges dismissed. His lawyers deny he has lied. The memo lists five allegations of breaching the deal by lying: On his interaction with Konstantin Kilimnik, a business associate who Mr Mueller says is tied to Russian intelligence. The actual allegations in the memo are redacted A second case involving Kilimnik and obstruction of justice Payment to a firm working for Manafort On a separate department of justice inquiry On contacts with Trump administration officials The memo calls these ""multiple discernible lies - these were not instances of mere memory lapse"". Our correspondent, Anthony Zurcher, says that given the central focus of Mr Mueller's investigation is Russia-Trump links, the Kilimnik connection could prove to be of particular interest.

Rudd sees 'plausible' Brexit Plan B,"This video can not be played Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd says there is no better option than the PM's Brexit deal The UK could pursue alternative options if Theresa May's Brexit plan is rejected by MPs, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has acknowledged. She is the first cabinet minister to publicly float the possibility of ""plausible"" alternatives. Mrs Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she still supported the PM's plan  - but ""anything could happen"" if it did not get through on Tuesday. She said it could be ""chaotic"" if Mrs May's deal is rejected. Mrs Rudd said a so-called ""Norway plus"" option or another referendum would both be possibilities in such a situation. A Norway plus arrangement would see the UK remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) and joining a customs union with the EU. However the UK would have to accept free movement of people - breaching a previous ""red line"" laid down by the PM. Ms Rudd described it as a ""plausible"", but not a ""desirable"" option for a Plan B. She also said she was not certain it could be done. Norway is not a member of the EU but it is part of the EEA.  While a cross-party group of MPs back a similar status for the UK - the government would need to apply to join Norway and three other countries in the European Free Trade Association. Ms Rudd said the deal Mrs May reached with the EU last month was the ""best option"". ""What we need is a compromise deal - that's what the prime minister has proposed,"" she said. Brexit: A really simple guide No-deal disruption at Dover 'could last six months' Leave campaigners prepare for another referendum Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Asked why she had previously refused to speculate on possible alternatives to Mrs May's agreement, Ms Rudd said: ""We are getting closer to the vote. ""People are saying why they are not going to vote for it and I'm just pointing out if you don't vote for it, these are the other things that could happen. Are you sure you want them more?"" Pro and anti-Brexit campaigners have been staging protests at Westminster By Matt Cole, BBC political correspondent Far and wide this week - ministers have travelled the UK selling the idea of Theresa May's Brexit plan. The message has been a simple one - there is no alternative. Until this morning - when the Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd opened the door to a Plan B...  and what might happen if MPs vote down the deal. To be clear, Mrs Rudd says she still backs - and will vote for - the PM's plan. But she has now become the first voice from within the cabinet to entertain a notion of what happens next if the vote is lost. What is more, politicians know how their words are weighed. The work and pensions secretary will have been aware that people would interpret raising the prospect of a Norway Plus relationship with the EU as her signalling her support. Some will find it easy to believe that her declaration that such an arrangement would be ""plausible"" is none other than an early shot in the looming battle of the Plan Bs. For there to be a plan B though, plan A must first be voted down. And despite Mrs Rudd's protestations of faith that the deal's not dead, it's looking highly likely it will be killed off on Tuesday. Ms Rudd told Today a lot of people had a ""perfect vision"" of what they think Brexit should look like, ""and that perfect is not available"". ""I would urge my colleagues to think about, first of all, why people voted to leave the European Union, what their interpretation is of that; and, secondly, what the alternatives are,"" she said. She added: ""If it doesn't get through, anything could happen...  and none of them are as good as the current arrangement."" This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs? Ms Rudd said she hoped an amendment to Tuesday's vote, tabled by former Northern Ireland minister Sir Hugo Swire in an attempt to win over Eurosceptic MPs, ""will give some of my colleagues reassurance"". Many MPs have expressed concerns about the so-called backstop arrangement, aimed at preventing a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if no trade deal is ready before the end of the post-Brexit transition period, in December 2020. The amendment would enable Parliament to approve a decision to trigger the backstop and put a one-year time limit on it. On Saturday, Colchester MP Will Quince became the latest Conservative to resign from the government over the backstop question. Mr Quince stepped down as a ministerial aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson,telling the Sunday Telegraph,externalhe could not support a backstop without an end date.

Norway is not a member of the EU but is in the European Economic Area, meaning it is part of the single market In return, it contributes to the EU budget, and has to follow most EU rules and laws, including the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people Norway is not part of the customs union, so, to avoid a hard Irish border, a new customs union (or equivalent arrangement) with the EU - a ""Norway plus"" solution - would be necessary You can read a more detailed explanation of the Norway modelhere.

Review: The painting reunited after 500 years Ã¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ,"Each year I have to face an awful moment of truth. It happens on the first morning of every summer holiday when I'm somewhere hot and sunny with friends and family. Drinks are flowing, music is playing. Everybody is happy. Except for me. I am as tense as one of Ed Sheeran's guitar strings. In order to go swimming, which I really want to do, I will have to remove my shirt. In public. My upper body is never a pretty sight, but at this point in high summer, its shortcomings are comically accentuated by the ""T-shirt tan"" that reveals light brown extremities incongruously protruding from a pinkish-white torso. It is a crushing image I am normally able to suppress throughout the winter months, but to my horror it reappeared in an unwanted flashback on Thursday afternoon when I was at the National Gallery in London. I was visiting the Trafalgar Square institution to see two parts of a panel painting by the great Renaissance master Andrea Mantegna (c 1431-1506), which hadn't been displayed together for maybe 500 years. United, they depict the story of Christ shortly after his crucifixion. The bottom panel is The Descent of Christ into Limbo (c 1492); the upper piece gives us Part Two, The Resurrection of Christ (c 1492). The Resurrection of Christ, about 1492, was re-attributed earlier this year to Andrea Mantegna The Descent of Christ into Limbo was painted by Andrea Mantegna, probably about 1492 There has been much excitement about their reunification, which is great, but in all honesty they make for a very odd couple. The top panel has been cleaned to within an inch of its life, with the central figure lying beneath Christ's feet grabbing all the attention in his garishly bright orange top and matching knee-length socks. Meanwhile, the panel below is as sober as a teetotallers' annual convention, with the faded red pigment of Christ's loose-fitting garment the most vivid element of a tonally harmonious painting. It is the stark contrast between the two that conjures up the image of my vacation humiliation. The fact that the upper painting has been given the full conservation treatment while the picture below has not is nobody's fault - they have different owners. But given the story we are being pitched is the two images were always intended to be seen as one, it seems an odd decision to present them when they are in such dramatically altered states. The Accademia Carrara in Bergamo says the area on the left shows a part of The Resurrection of Christ, before 19th Century varnish and repaint were removed, and the section on the right is after the restoration It makes them appear as separate entities by different artists from different times. As, indeed, they may be. The upper panel has long been thought to be the work of a less accomplished artist than Mantegna. Andrea Mantegna Its attribution was seriously questioned in the early 20th Century, since when curators have believed it to be by an apprentice in Mantegna's studio, or possibly by one of the artist's sons, or even a copy made at a later date. That opinion changed earlier this year when Giovanni Valagussa, a curator at Accademia Carrara in Bergamo, which owns The Resurrection of Christ, took the opportunity to spend some time in the store rooms while the gallery was being refurbished. He happened upon the painting and thought it too good to be by a minor artist. He then noticed the tip of a cross at the very bottom of the picture, which seemed to be positioned at the entrance to a tunnel or cave. That got Valagussa thinking. Maybe this unloved picture covered in discoloured varnish might be the part of a larger composition. After a bit of detective work, the curator found the perfect match: Mantegna's uncontested painting, The Descent of Christ into Limbo, which is in private ownership. He immediately spotted the staff in Christ's left hand and saw it was cut off at the top. What if he placed his picture above an image of The Descent, lining up the small Cross at the foot of his image to the pole below? The result was astonishing. Accademia Carrara says this HD image of the two panels shows how the arch of the rocks and the Cross at the bottom of The Resurrection of Christ connects with the top of The Descent of Christ into Limbo Not only was the cross a perfect fit, but once in place, the entire composition connected like a jigsaw to create an overall design that he knew Mantegna had produced many times. Further research revealed that both images were painted using egg tempera on a poplar wood panel with nail holes that lined up, suggesting they were once held together by the same baton. This led to the conclusion that they would have once formed part of an altar panel in the chapel of the Ducal Palace in Mantua, northern Italy, where Mantegna lived for 50 years, having been hired by the ruling Gonzaga family as their court painter. He had been born not far away in Padua, into a modest family (his father was an illiterate carpenter), who would never have imagined their young lad would grow up to become a celebrity artist of noble status, living in a splendid house he himself designed. How the artist managed to climb life's ladder so successfully is evident in the National Gallery exhibition, Mantegna & Bellini, where the two panel paintings were reunited on Thursday. In the first room of the show, which looks at how the two artists and brothers-in-law riffed off one another, there is a portrait of Saint Mark the Evangelist (c 1448). Andrea Mantegna showed early talent, painting Saint Mark the Evangelist (c 1448) in his late teens It is a wonderful picture, painted when Mantegna was just 17 or 18 years old, and already demonstrating an extraordinary talent for naturalism and perspective. OK, the thumb on St Mark's right hand appears to be embedded in his jaw, but other than that it is a notable achievement for one so young. Mantegna might not be as famous as the big three: Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael (the artists, not the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), but when you see this show you wonder why that is the case. When on top form, he was every bit as pioneering and skilful as the three Renaissance greats that came shortly after him. If you want a masterclass in the art of foreshortening, look no further than this exhibition, where Mantegna shows he can convince in a way the technically gifted Bellini cannot. All of which makes the introduction of the hyper-cleaned The Resurrection of Christ jar a little.  You can see why the curators wanted to show off their discovery, but it feels rushed. The Resurrection of Christ (above) and The Descent of Christ into Limbo (below) being installed at the National Gallery Bizarrely, the paintings don't actually look very good together: the frames don't match, the images are too far apart, and the nature of the upper panel's facelift appears crass in comparison to the gracefully aged image below. It is a three-star exhibit in a five-star show.

'I drive 10 minutes to open an email',"This video can not be played Cothi Valley 'blighted' by poor internet speeds A business owner has said slow internet speeds mean he has to take a 10 minute drive in order to email clients. Rhydian Thomas is among a group of homeowners in the Cothi Valley, Carmarthenshire, who say broadband as slow as 0.1Mbps creates obstacles in their personal and professional lives. Openreach said nearly 95% of Wales now had access to fibre optic broadband. But Mr Thomas said that where he lives, ""it takes an entire day to download a film"". The number of Welsh homes able to access superfast broadband has increased since 2013when availability was the lowest in the UK at just 48%,external, with just 370,000 properties able to access it. Five years later, the number of homes in Wales able to access speeds of 24Mbps or above stands at about 720,000, following the completion of the Superfast Cymru scheme. But critics said Superfast Cymru's rollout was too slow and still left some communities lagging behind. Some residents in the Cothi Valley are connected to the internet via copper wiring to a telephone exchange 6km (3.7miles) away. Electrical contractor Mr Thomas said ""painfully slow"" speeds caused him frequent problems. ""I need the internet to access emails for various jobs or update details on work that I have just done. But the speeds are so slow that it takes forever just to open a webpage,"" he said. ""It can dip out completely if it starts raining - and I've lost count of the amount of times I've had to drive into Carmarthen to use free wifi in a cafe just to send an email."" Welsh internet via satellite over Africa Fed up villagers install fast broadband Why schoolgirl does homework in a lay-by The father-of-one said it has also frustrated him while he launches a new business for audio speakers. Neighbour John Burton said: ""In terms of speeds, it's like we are 10-15 years behind everyone else. The situation is made all the more worse when the mobile signal is non-existent too."" He added that residents' efforts to persuade Openreach and the Welsh Government to upgrade the line had proved fruitless. Residents said they have looked into installing their own network - but it was too expensive given the small number of houses. Rhydian Thomas and other homeowners in the village experience download speeds as low as 0.5Mbps Swansea University business lecturer Dr Robert Bowen said broadband access had improved dramatically - but ""not spots"" meant rural places risked becoming even more isolated. ""When you consider some of these places do not have a local bank anymore, because their bank has closed, then reliable and fast access to the internet isn't a luxury but more of an essential service,"" he said. ""It also limits opportunities for businesses and plays a factor in younger people moving away. ""A lot of progress has been made but more still needs to be done, because for some it's still very much a postcode lottery."" UK homes to get faster broadband by 2020 Village 'abandoned' over broadband Villagers often struggle to connect to the internet Openreach said it was working on the successor to superfast broadband - fibre first - with speeds of up to one gigabit per second. The latest city to be signed up to the upgrade, which aims to reach three million UK homes and businesses by 2020, is Swansea. Managing director Kim Mears said: ""We've already done an incredible amount of work across Wales in improving access to better broadband connectivity - both in rural and urban parts of the country. ""Despite the challenges of planning, street works and permissions, our engineers are already reaching thousands of homes and businesses every week."" The firm also said Wales now had better fibre broadband coverage than Germany, Italy or France. The Welsh Government insisted Superfast Cymru had ""transformed the digital landscape in Wales"". A spokeswoman said: ""In 2013 less than half of premises in Wales had access to superfast broadband compared with over nine out of 10 now.  We know there is more to do to reach the final premises without access."" How has superfast broadband rollout gone?

Man traced on missing airman footage,"Corrie Mckeague's mother said the CCTV footage showed her son ""did not go in the bin"" A man captured on CCTV and believed by a missing airman's mother to be her son has identified himself to detectives. Police viewed the footage during their investigation into Corrie Mckeague's disappearance from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 2016. His mother Nicola Urquhart said the public would be ""horrified"" to see it, as it cast doubt on the police theories over her son's whereabouts. Police said the man captured on CCTV had been traced. The BBC asked for the CCTV footage to be released under the Freedom of Information Act. Suffolk Police turned down the request on the grounds of data protection laws. Mr Mckeague was last seen on CCTV at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016 Mr Mckeague was last seen entering a bin loading bay when he was on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, leadingpolice to believe he had gone into one of the bins. But his remains were not found despite a 20-week trawl of a landfill site near Cambridge. Missing airman 'in waste disposal system' The tragedy that shaped Corrie Mckeague Missing airman 'may have dodged CCTV' Mrs Urquhart said she had viewed CCTV footage which she said showed a man leaving the bin loading bay. She said the footage was ""grainy"" but it showed a person ""wearing incredibly bright, reflective clothing, which looks like white trousers"". Mrs Urquhart said she believed it was her son and if members of the public saw the footage ""no-one would believe he went in the bin"". Detectives spent 20 weeks searching the landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire Suffolk Police said the footage showed three individuals who were ""tracked walking into the area and away from the area"". It said clearer images of them were found, ""enabling identification"". The force said all three individuals had been spoken to by police and had identified themselves from the images. It said it was ""confident"" none of them was Mr Mckeague. The force said the individuals were ruled out in autumn 2016. Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline, Fife, was 23 when he went missing. He was last seen entering in the bin loading area at 03:25 on 24 September.

Primark reopens in Belfast after fire,"This video can not be played 'It's like Christmas coming early' More than 1,000 people queued outside the new Primark store in Belfast when its doors opened on Saturday. Crowd control measures, including crush barriers, were in place outside the new store at Commonwealth House, which opened at 09:00 GMT. The retailer has returned to the city four months after a huge fire destroyed its flagship store at Bank Buildings in August. ""It's like Christmas coming early - I'm ecstatic,"" said one shopper. Another woman said: ""I'm from Comber so I have a Primark in Newtownards but this one is the biggest one - it's Belfast."" New plans for fire-damaged Primark Belfast shopper numbers 'fall' after blaze Earlier this week, atemporary walkway was openedto allow eight businesses to resume trading following the fire. Primark said it was ""committed to a long-term future in Belfast"". ""Today marks a significant milestone for our people, our neighbours and the wider community, as we take the first step to get back to business following the fire at Bank Buildings,"" said company director Ben Mansfield. ""We are confident that our store and the newly-built walkway will help restore footfall in the Castle Street and surrounding area at this critical time, just before Christmas."" This video can not be played Drone footage shows the extent of the destruction caused by the fire at the Bank Buildings Primark was extending into Commonwealth House at the time of the fire. The new Primark store is smaller than the original store, but it still has four floors, 23 cash desks and 25 fitting rooms. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI Primark spent the day handing out free bags and balloons but they are still not ready to offer any interviews. There is no shortage of questions. What caused the fire? Could more have been done to prevent it? Who is going to pay for all the disruption? For more than 100 days, I have asked for an interview. It is always the same answer: ""A Primark spokesperson is not available for comment."" It is hoped the new store will breathe life back into the city centre following adip in footfall following the blaze. Speaking outside the premises on Castle Street, Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey said she hoped it would give the city centre a pre-Christmas increase in footfall. ""It's crucial - this can only help but boost the city,"" she said. ""There are challenges ahead with retail but I suppose in the aftermath of what happened at the fire, it allows us to start to reimagine and rethink what we do with our city centre."" Primark first opened in Belfast in 1975 on Donegall Place. Meanwhile, another new store opened in Belfast on Saturday - discount department store Guineys has moved into the former BHS site in Castle Place. Guineys specialises in homeware and clothing, and it has 11 stores in the Republic of Ireland.

Grenfell MP's call over Universal Credit,"Emma Dent Coad says Universal Credit could leave many of her constituents without money over Christmas The MP whose seat is home to Grenfell Tower has urged the government to delay next week's launch of Universal Credit in the area, saying it could leave survivors without income at Christmas. The benefit scheme is due to come to North Kensington, where the blaze left 72 dead, just 13 days before Christmas. The first payment takes five weeks to come through, a situation Emma Dent Coad described as ""unacceptable"". The government said it was providing ""targeted support"" for those affected. Universal credit was designed to make claiming benefits simpler, combining six different payments into one,but has proved controversial, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends and administrative problems. It was due to be rolled out in North Kensington in July 2017 but was delayed following the deadly tower block fire the month before. It is now set to be introduced on Wednesday. Ms Dent Coad, who won the west London constituency of Kensington for Labour in the general election just days before the fire, wrote to then work and pensions secretary Esther McVey on 2 November urging the government not to inflict any more pain on families who had ""already lost so much"". She highlighted problems they had faced last Christmas whensome pay-outs to survivors by the local council were delayed. The MP told BBC News: ""It's unthinkable, they're going to have another Christmas now wondering whether they can afford to buy food, let alone presents for their children."" The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said advances of up to 100% were available for people from the first day of their claim. But Ms Dent Coad, who set up a food bank in Kensington, said in her letter that requesting advances for Christmas would leave people facing ""many future months without enough income to cover their expenses"". Ms Dent Coad said her constituents had already 'suffered so much' The leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council Elizabeth Campbell also wrote to Ms McVey in March calling for the roll-out to be halted ""for the foreseeable future"". Maher Khoudair, who suffers from polio, and his family survived the tragedy and now live elsewhere in Kensington. He described the decision to roll out the scheme as ""wrong"" and said he did not know how some people would cope over the festive period. How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Who were the victims? Should Universal Credit be paid weekly instead of monthly? A DWP spokesperson said: ""In preparation for Universal Credit roll-out in North Kensington, we have put in place a range of special measures. ""This includes providing targeted support from experienced work coaches and working closely with the local authority and Citizens Advice to offer additional help to people."" The spokesperson also said the DWP ""secured a commitment to have a housing officer co-located in the Jobcentre before roll-out and then on an ongoing basis"" and said the department offered a range of activities at the Curve, a Grenfell community centre, such as IT and employability courses. The DWP is also working with the council to ""further support Grenfell residents"", the spokesperson added. How are universal credit rules changing?

Japan eases rules for foreign workers,"Japan will allow some foreigners to work in construction and other sectors Japan's parliament has approved a controversial new law allowing hundreds of thousands of foreigners into the country to ease labour shortages. From next April foreigners will be allowed to take up jobs in sectors such construction, farming and nursing. Japan has traditionally been wary of immigration but the government says more foreigners are needed because of Japan's ageing population. Opposition parties say the law risks exposing newcomers to exploitation. Under the new system, more than 300,000 foreigners could be allowed to work in sectors facing a labour crunch. The law creates two new visa categories. Workers in the first category will be allowed in for five years if they have a certain level of skill and some proficiency in Japanese. The economic lessons Japan can teach the West Trending in Japan: Restless retirees Workers with a higher level of skills would qualify for the second visa category and would eventually be allowed to apply for residency. The opposition has argued that an influx of foreign workers would depress wages and lead to exploitation of migrant labour. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says the current programme of ""technical training"" for low-skilled foreign workers is open to abuse by unscrupulous employers. Businesses in Japan have long argued for changes to immigration rules to recruit workers from other countries. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stressed the proposed law is not an overhaul of immigration policy and Japan will only accept foreigners ""who have specific skills and can work immediately to address serious labour shortages, only in sectors that genuinely need them"". Japan's fertility rate dropped below 2.1 childbirths per woman - replacement level - in the 1970s and now stands at around 1.4.

Review: The painting reunited after 500 years âââââ,"Each year I have to face an awful moment of truth. It happens on the first morning of every summer holiday when I'm somewhere hot and sunny with friends and family. Drinks are flowing, music is playing. Everybody is happy. Except for me. I am as tense as one of Ed Sheeran's guitar strings. In order to go swimming, which I really want to do, I will have to remove my shirt. In public. My upper body is never a pretty sight, but at this point in high summer, its shortcomings are comically accentuated by the ""T-shirt tan"" that reveals light brown extremities incongruously protruding from a pinkish-white torso. It is a crushing image I am normally able to suppress throughout the winter months, but to my horror it reappeared in an unwanted flashback on Thursday afternoon when I was at the National Gallery in London. I was visiting the Trafalgar Square institution to see two parts of a panel painting by the great Renaissance master Andrea Mantegna (c 1431-1506), which hadn't been displayed together for maybe 500 years. United, they depict the story of Christ shortly after his crucifixion. The bottom panel is The Descent of Christ into Limbo (c 1492); the upper piece gives us Part Two, The Resurrection of Christ (c 1492). The Resurrection of Christ, about 1492, was re-attributed earlier this year to Andrea Mantegna The Descent of Christ into Limbo was painted by Andrea Mantegna, probably about 1492 There has been much excitement about their reunification, which is great, but in all honesty they make for a very odd couple. The top panel has been cleaned to within an inch of its life, with the central figure lying beneath Christ's feet grabbing all the attention in his garishly bright orange top and matching knee-length socks. Meanwhile, the panel below is as sober as a teetotallers' annual convention, with the faded red pigment of Christ's loose-fitting garment the most vivid element of a tonally harmonious painting. It is the stark contrast between the two that conjures up the image of my vacation humiliation. The fact that the upper painting has been given the full conservation treatment while the picture below has not is nobody's fault - they have different owners. But given the story we are being pitched is the two images were always intended to be seen as one, it seems an odd decision to present them when they are in such dramatically altered states. The Accademia Carrara in Bergamo says the area on the left shows a part of The Resurrection of Christ, before 19th Century varnish and repaint were removed, and the section on the right is after the restoration It makes them appear as separate entities by different artists from different times. As, indeed, they may be. The upper panel has long been thought to be the work of a less accomplished artist than Mantegna. Andrea Mantegna Its attribution was seriously questioned in the early 20th Century, since when curators have believed it to be by an apprentice in Mantegna's studio, or possibly by one of the artist's sons, or even a copy made at a later date. That opinion changed earlier this year when Giovanni Valagussa, a curator at Accademia Carrara in Bergamo, which owns The Resurrection of Christ, took the opportunity to spend some time in the store rooms while the gallery was being refurbished. He happened upon the painting and thought it too good to be by a minor artist. He then noticed the tip of a cross at the very bottom of the picture, which seemed to be positioned at the entrance to a tunnel or cave. That got Valagussa thinking. Maybe this unloved picture covered in discoloured varnish might be the part of a larger composition. After a bit of detective work, the curator found the perfect match: Mantegna's uncontested painting, The Descent of Christ into Limbo, which is in private ownership. He immediately spotted the staff in Christ's left hand and saw it was cut off at the top. What if he placed his picture above an image of The Descent, lining up the small Cross at the foot of his image to the pole below? The result was astonishing. Accademia Carrara says this HD image of the two panels shows how the arch of the rocks and the Cross at the bottom of The Resurrection of Christ connects with the top of The Descent of Christ into Limbo Not only was the cross a perfect fit, but once in place, the entire composition connected like a jigsaw to create an overall design that he knew Mantegna had produced many times. Further research revealed that both images were painted using egg tempera on a poplar wood panel with nail holes that lined up, suggesting they were once held together by the same baton. This led to the conclusion that they would have once formed part of an altar panel in the chapel of the Ducal Palace in Mantua, northern Italy, where Mantegna lived for 50 years, having been hired by the ruling Gonzaga family as their court painter. He had been born not far away in Padua, into a modest family (his father was an illiterate carpenter), who would never have imagined their young lad would grow up to become a celebrity artist of noble status, living in a splendid house he himself designed. How the artist managed to climb life's ladder so successfully is evident in the National Gallery exhibition, Mantegna & Bellini, where the two panel paintings were reunited on Thursday. In the first room of the show, which looks at how the two artists and brothers-in-law riffed off one another, there is a portrait of Saint Mark the Evangelist (c 1448). Andrea Mantegna showed early talent, painting Saint Mark the Evangelist (c 1448) in his late teens It is a wonderful picture, painted when Mantegna was just 17 or 18 years old, and already demonstrating an extraordinary talent for naturalism and perspective. OK, the thumb on St Mark's right hand appears to be embedded in his jaw, but other than that it is a notable achievement for one so young. Mantegna might not be as famous as the big three: Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael (the artists, not the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), but when you see this show you wonder why that is the case. When on top form, he was every bit as pioneering and skilful as the three Renaissance greats that came shortly after him. If you want a masterclass in the art of foreshortening, look no further than this exhibition, where Mantegna shows he can convince in a way the technically gifted Bellini cannot. All of which makes the introduction of the hyper-cleaned The Resurrection of Christ jar a little.  You can see why the curators wanted to show off their discovery, but it feels rushed. The Resurrection of Christ (above) and The Descent of Christ into Limbo (below) being installed at the National Gallery Bizarrely, the paintings don't actually look very good together: the frames don't match, the images are too far apart, and the nature of the upper panel's facelift appears crass in comparison to the gracefully aged image below. It is a three-star exhibit in a five-star show.

Breaking|Breaking newsSix dead in Italy nightclub stampedeMore than 100 people are also injured in the incident near Ancona on the east coast.Europe,"This video can not be played Emergency services attend the wounded at the scene in Corinaldo Six people have been killed and dozens have been injured, 12 of them seriously, in a stampede at a nightclub in Italy, officials say. Some reports say there was panic after pepper spray was fired inside the club in the town of Corinaldo, near the eastern coastal city of Ancona. Up to 1,000 people were inside the Lanterna Azzurra club attending a concert by rapper Sfera Ebbasta. Five of the victims were 14 to 16 years old. The sixth was a 39-year-old woman. She had gone to the club with her daughter. The incident took place at about 01:00 (midnight GMT) as Italy began celebrating the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. The concert had not yet begun when ""acrid smell"" forced crowds to rush towards the emergency exits. The accident occurred after railings gave way and people began falling off a walkway. Many of the injured suffered crushing wounds and broken limbs. The injured have been taken to hospitals in Senigallia and Ancona. Seven are said to be in intensive care.

France braced for 'ultra-violent' protests,"This video can not be played Protesters surged forward before tear gas was fired Police in Paris have fired rubber bullets and tear gas as a fourth weekend of anti-government protests across France turned violent. Almost 1,000 people have been taken into custody nationwide. Parisian hospital authorities said 126 people had been injured in the city, but none seriously. At least three police officers were also hurt. The ""yellow vest"" movement opposed fuel tax rises but ministers say it has been hijacked by ""ultra-violent"" protesters. An estimated 125,000 demonstrators gathered across the country during the day, with 10,000 of them in the capital, where the scenes were the most destructive. Looters have been seen smashing shop fronts, and cars have been set on fire. In pictures: France's latest protests Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests French students 'humiliated by police' In a television address on Saturday evening, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the ""casseurs"" (troublemakers) were still at work. He called for more communication between the government and protesters to resolve the conflict. ""The dialogue has begun,"" he said. ""It is now necessary to rebuild the national unity."" Apart from Paris, there were demonstrations in several other cities on Saturday including Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille and Grenoble. Some places also had separate climate change marches taking place. There have been a number of confrontations in the capital. Video footage showed one demonstrator being hit in the torso with a rubber bullet while standing in front of a line of police with his hands up. At least three members of the press were also hit. Water cannon were deployed on a street east of the city centre. Who supports the 'gilets jaunes' As night fell, protesters converged on Place de la RÃ©publique, and a heavy police presence remained on the  Champs-ElysÃ©es. Nearly 90,000 officers were deployed countrywide in anticipation of clashes, including 8,000 in Paris where 12 armoured vehicles were also utilised. Last week, hundreds of people were arrested and 162 were injured in violence in Paris - some of the worst street clashes in the French capital for decades. This weekend, six matches in the top tier of France's football league were postponed. The Louvre, MusÃ©e d'Orsay and other sites were also closed all day in Paris. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris The French government is relieved that its worst forebodings about the protests did not come to pass. There was certainly some violence in Paris, but it was not on the scale of the week before. The new tactics of the police - record numbers of officers deployed, moving quickly to occupy the ground and not hesitating to make arrests - paid off. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the escalation of violence had been stopped. It is a relief for President Macron - but not much more. He must know that the moment will be thrown away if he does not move in quickly now with ideas that go some way to satisfying the more moderate of the yellow vests. The time is for dialogue, the government says, and the president will make an address to the nation early this week. The question is will he give the protesters what they want, which is something very simple: more money in their pockets. Does he think France can afford to economically? The sentiment of the anti-government protests has inspired other spin-off protests in nearby countries. About 100 people were arrested in the capital Brussels. Some threw paving stones, fireworks, flares and other objects at police, according to AP news agency. In the Netherlands, a protest was held outside parliament in The Hague, with an estimated 100 participants. The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters are so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. Over the past few weeks, the social media movement has morphed from a protest over fuel prices to a leaderless spectrum of interest groups and differing demands. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Its core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, still has widespread support. This video can not be played Gilets Jaunes: Are nationalists infiltrating the ""yellow vests""? An opinion poll on Friday showed a dip in support for the protests, but it still stood at 66%. Meanwhile, President Emmanuel Macron's ratings have fallen to 23% amid the crisis, polls suggest. The government has said it is scrapping the unpopular fuel tax increases in its budget and has frozen electricity and gas prices for 2019. The problem is that protests have erupted over other issues. Granting concessions in some areas may not placate all the protesters, some of whom are calling for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions, easier university requirements and even the resignation of the president.

Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?,"They have staged some of the most comprehensive protests seen in France since 1968, but who are the people making up the ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) movement? The protesters, thus named because they sport the distinctive yellow high-visibility jackets required to be carried in every vehicle by French law, initially came together to demonstrate against a sharp increase in diesel taxes. But itsraison d'Ãªtrehas since expanded, and the government U-turn on fuel taxes has failed to appease everyone. The movement - born online - cuts across age, job and region, and includes members of the working and middle classes, all affected by the higher cost of living. Its members range from factory workers and the unemployed to the self-employed (particularly artisans) and retired people. Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? What they all seemed to have in common at the outset was their reliance on cars to get around, often living in more rural and less populated parts of the country. As the movement grew, their demands evolved and have now morphed into general anger at higher living costs and President Emmanuel Macron's economic policies. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? Some experts describe the bulk of the protesters as people who struggle to make ends meet at the end of the month. ""Those are the French people who struggle to balance their household budget because of 'obligatory' expenses (rent, insurance, heating...) that keep increasing,"" analysts JÃ©rÃ´me Fourquet and Sylvain Manternach explained in a study published last week. ""For these people from the middle and working classes, the increase in price at the pump, to which they go regularly, represents the most glaring illustration of this increase in constrained expenditures,"" they said. They all share ""the same vision of the world... the same lifestyle, where the car occupies a central place in their everyday lives"", BenoÃ®t Coquard, a sociologist, told L'HumanitÃ© newspaper. Some of those who appeared in court Monday following violent clashes at Saturday's protests give a further idea of who makes up this multifaceted movement. Some had past criminal records for violent crime and clashing with police, but others included a 21-year-old with a master's degree in finance; a 45-year-old divorced butcher and father of one; a high-school student with a prison conviction; and a car factory worker. In early December, Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe announced that the fuel taxes would be dropped from the budget - but by then, many protesters were calling for other policy changes too. Mr Macron was elected on a platform of economic reform, which would, the French people were told, improve their lot - with lower unemployment and a kick-started economy. But many feel that has not happened. An analysis of the 2018-19 budget carried out by France's public policy institute, for example, found that the poorest quarter of households would largely see their income drop or stay the same under the plans. Middle-income earners would see a modest bump - but the greatest beneficiaries would be those who are already wealthy, in the top 1%. The pattern is worse for retired people - almost all of whom will be worse off. This video can not be played Dozens of people were injured in clashes Its members have mainly got themselves organised on social media, via online groups and Facebook pages, and have acted through petitions, videos and calls to action. As the movement grew, they have also met physically to get organised, in meeting rooms, supermarkets or at petrol stations. On the ground, they have arranged themselves to ensure a constant presence at roadblocks around the country. Many attend before or after work, take leave or go on their day off; rotas have been organised according to protesters' availability to maintain cover. In many instances, they have also had help from locals donating food, money and other supplies. Jacline Mouraud became a symbol of the fight against the fuel price increases Another characteristic of the movement is the fact that it is leaderless, though it does have a few spokespeople who act as figureheads. ""We don't want anyone using our movement, and we don't want leaders,"" said Frank Buhler, a prominent member of the gilets jaunes. ""We have to start all over again, that's how far we've come. The French Revolution started with flour wars; for us it's fuel taxes."" Eric Drouet, a 33-year-old truck driver from Seine-et-Marne, is credited with calling for the November protests in Paris via a Facebook page. His call was shared and replicated online, leading to regional protests being held, reports say. Another representative is Jacline Mouraud, a 51-year-old accordion player, from Brittany. A video she posted online denouncing the fuel price hikes and the other difficulties drivers faced garnered six million views. She was one of the spokespeople who said she could not attend a meeting with the prime minister after receiving death threats. Statues were smashed at the Arc de Triomphe in violent clashes on 1 December Dealing with a leaderless movement can have real consequences, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on 3 December, after particularly violent protests in Paris a few days earlier. Answering questions from a National Assembly parliamentary committee about the weekend's destructive demonstration, he said there had been no prior discussion with representatives from the movement to ensure a peaceful protest. As a result, violent far-right and far-left groups had infiltrated the protest, and incited protesters into more violence, he said. ""These are troublemakers who came, out of financial opportunism with immoral intentions, who came to take advantage of the chaos to smash up and steal from shops."" It now remains to be seen whether the movement can maintain momentum in the long term, after the government announced its first concessions - and if any more are to come.

Four arrested over diamond tiara theftThe valuable Portland Tiara was stolen in a night-time raid at the Welbeck Estate in Nottinghamshire.Nottingham,"Experts have said they feared the tiara may be cut apart and the diamonds sold separately Four people have been arrested in connection with the theft of a diamond tiara from a country estate. The Portland Tiara,part of a jewellery collection at the Welbeck Estate, was worn by the Duchess of Portland to Edward VII's coronation in 1902. It was taken along with a diamond brooch on 20 November. Three men, 46, 38 and 33, and a 30-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of burglary. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Nottinghamshire Police said all four remain in custody and enquiries are ongoing.

'Norway plus' is Rudd's Brexit Plan B,"This video can not be played Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd says there is no better option than the PM's Brexit deal The UK could pursue alternative options if Theresa May's Brexit plan is rejected by MPs, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has acknowledged. She is the first cabinet minister to publicly float the possibility of ""plausible"" alternatives. Mrs Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she still supported the PM's plan  - but ""anything could happen"" if it did not get through on Tuesday. She said it could be ""chaotic"" if Mrs May's deal is rejected. Mrs Rudd said a so-called ""Norway plus"" option or another referendum would both be possibilities in such a situation. A Norway plus arrangement would see the UK remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) and joining a customs union with the EU. However the UK would have to accept free movement of people - breaching a previous ""red line"" laid down by the PM. Ms Rudd described it as a ""plausible"", but not a ""desirable"" option for a Plan B. She also said she was not certain it could be done. Norway is not a member of the EU but it is part of the EEA.  While a cross-party group of MPs back a similar status for the UK - the government would need to apply to join Norway and three other countries in the European Free Trade Association. Ms Rudd said the deal Mrs May reached with the EU last month was the ""best option"". ""What we need is a compromise deal - that's what the prime minister has proposed,"" she said. Brexit: A really simple guide No-deal disruption at Dover 'could last six months' Leave campaigners prepare for another referendum Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Asked why she had previously refused to speculate on possible alternatives to Mrs May's agreement, Ms Rudd said: ""We are getting closer to the vote. ""People are saying why they are not going to vote for it and I'm just pointing out if you don't vote for it, these are the other things that could happen. Are you sure you want them more?"" Pro and anti-Brexit campaigners have been staging protests at Westminster By Matt Cole, BBC political correspondent Far and wide this week - ministers have travelled the UK selling the idea of Theresa May's Brexit plan. The message has been a simple one - there is no alternative. Until this morning - when the Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd opened the door to a Plan B...  and what might happen if MPs vote down the deal. To be clear, Mrs Rudd says she still backs - and will vote for - the PM's plan. But she has now become the first voice from within the cabinet to entertain a notion of what happens next if the vote is lost. What is more, politicians know how their words are weighed. The work and pensions secretary will have been aware that people would interpret raising the prospect of a Norway Plus relationship with the EU as her signalling her support. Some will find it easy to believe that her declaration that such an arrangement would be ""plausible"" is none other than an early shot in the looming battle of the Plan Bs. For there to be a plan B though, plan A must first be voted down. And despite Mrs Rudd's protestations of faith that the deal's not dead, it's looking highly likely it will be killed off on Tuesday. Ms Rudd told Today a lot of people had a ""perfect vision"" of what they think Brexit should look like, ""and that perfect is not available"". ""I would urge my colleagues to think about, first of all, why people voted to leave the European Union, what their interpretation is of that; and, secondly, what the alternatives are,"" she said. She added: ""If it doesn't get through, anything could happen...  and none of them are as good as the current arrangement."" This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs? Ms Rudd said she hoped an amendment to Tuesday's vote, tabled by former Northern Ireland minister Sir Hugo Swire in an attempt to win over Eurosceptic MPs, ""will give some of my colleagues reassurance"". Many MPs have expressed concerns about the so-called backstop arrangement, aimed at preventing a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if no trade deal is ready before the end of the post-Brexit transition period, in December 2020. The amendment would enable Parliament to approve a decision to trigger the backstop and put a one-year time limit on it. On Saturday, Colchester MP Will Quince became the latest Conservative to resign from the government over the backstop question. Mr Quince stepped down as a ministerial aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson,telling the Sunday Telegraph,externalhe could not support a backstop without an end date.

In pictures: France's latest protests Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests French students 'humiliated by police' In a television address on Saturday evening, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the ""casseurs"" (troublemakers) were still at work. He called for more communication between the government and protesters to resolve the conflict. ""The dialogue has begun,"" he said. ""It is now necessary to rebuild the national unity."" Apart from Paris, there were demonstrations in several other cities on Saturday including Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Marseille and Grenoble. Some places also had separate climate change marches taking place. There have been a number of confrontations in the capital. Video footage showed one demonstrator being hit in the torso with a rubber bullet while standing in front of a line of police with his hands up. At least three members of the press were also hit. Water cannon were deployed on a street east of the city centre. Who supports the 'gilets jaunes' As night fell, protesters converged on Place de la RÃ©publique, and a heavy police presence remained on the  Champs-ElysÃ©es. Nearly 90,000 officers were deployed countrywide in anticipation of clashes, including 8,000 in Paris where 12 armoured vehicles were also utilised. Last week, hundreds of people were arrested and 162 were injured in violence in Paris - some of the worst street clashes in the French capital for decades. This weekend, six matches in the top tier of France's football league were postponed. The Louvre, MusÃ©e d'Orsay and other sites were also closed all day in Paris. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris The French government is relieved that its worst forebodings about the protests did not come to pass. There was certainly some violence in Paris, but it was not on the scale of the week before. The new tactics of the police - record numbers of officers deployed, moving quickly to occupy the ground and not hesitating to make arrests - paid off. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the escalation of violence had been stopped. It is a relief for President Macron - but not much more. He must know that the moment will be thrown away if he does not move in quickly now with ideas that go some way to satisfying the more moderate of the yellow vests. The time is for dialogue, the government says, and the president will make an address to the nation early this week. The question is will he give the protesters what they want, which is something very simple: more money in their pockets. Does he think France can afford to economically? The sentiment of the anti-government protests has inspired other spin-off protests in nearby countries. About 100 people were arrested in the capital Brussels. Some threw paving stones, fireworks, flares and other objects at police, according to AP news agency. In the Netherlands, a protest was held outside parliament in The Hague, with an estimated 100 participants. The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters are so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. Over the past few weeks, the social media movement has morphed from a protest over fuel prices to a leaderless spectrum of interest groups and differing demands. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Its core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, still has widespread support. This video can not be played Gilets Jaunes: Are nationalists infiltrating the ""yellow vests""? An opinion poll on Friday showed a dip in support for the protests, but it still stood at 66%. Meanwhile, President Emmanuel Macron's ratings have fallen to 23% amid the crisis, polls suggest. The government has said it is scrapping the unpopular fuel tax increases in its budget and has frozen electricity and gas prices for 2019. The problem is that protests have erupted over other issues. Granting concessions in some areas may not placate all the protesters, some of whom are calling for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions, easier university requirements and even the resignation of the president.

What is the Norway model?,"The Prime Minister Theresa May is in Norway for a day of meetings with her Scandinavian counterparts at the Northern Future Forum in Oslo. Brexit is bound to come up in conversation, so it feels like a good day to remind ourselves what the Norway model is. Since the referendum, Norway has been discussed as one possible Brexit solution because a) it is not a member of the European Union, but b) it is in the European Economic Area (EEA), which means that it's also part of the single market. So it's about as close to the EU as you can get without being a member state. And, if the UK followed this example, that would mean its trade relations with its nearest neighbours could remain pretty much as they are now. Alphabet soup alert. You have to join EFTA - the European Free Trade Association, which groups four countries together: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Just to complicate things further, Switzerland has chosen not to join the EEA, and relies on a series of complex agreements with the EU instead. It means Norway has full access to the single market, and very limited barriers to trade with the EU. In return it makes substantial contributions to the EU budget, and has to follow most EU rules and laws. These include the so-called four freedoms - the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people. That means people from across the EU are free to live and work in Norway, and Norwegians can live and work across the EU. But Norway has no formal say in making EU rules, because it has no representation in any of the main European institutions. Norway is not part of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) or the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). So it can set its own policies in those areas. It is also exempt from EU rules on justice and home affairs. Yes. That sounds familiar doesn't it? Of course it helps when you have one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world, thanks to huge investments generated by oil and gas revenues. Fishing and agriculture are also big issues in rural Norway (fishing is one of the biggest industries in the country) so being outside the CFP and the CAP are important indicators of national sovereignty. This video can not be played Reality Check: Fishing after Brexit - sink or swim? No, it's not. That means it does need to take some additional administrative steps in order to trade with the EU. But it also means it can sign its own trade deals with other countries around the world. However, being outside the EU customs union means a relationship like Norway's would not solve the thorny Brexit problem of avoiding a hard border in Ireland. To keep theIrish border as open as it is now, you would need to add a new customs union (or equivalent arrangement) with the EU - a ""Norway plus"" solution, if you like. She has. And she has pledged to leave both the single market and the customs union. Some MPs, though, have recently argued in favour of a short-term 'Norway for Now' option. Instead of a transition period after Brexit, it would see the UK joining the EEA (via EFTA) for three years, and agreeing a temporary customs union with the EU. That would, the theory goes, give the UK time to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU for the future. Good point. EEA membership would certainly be on offer as a long-term solution after Brexit. But it's unlikely that Norway and friends would want to be used as a waiting room on the UK's route out of the EU. ""I don't think it's easy to think that you can enter into an organisation you are preparing to leave at the same time,"" Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told the Northern Future Forum. ""It is also a little bit difficult for the rest of us."" Logistics and the law would pose a problem as well. There is neither time nor legal authority before 29 March 2019 for the UK to apply to join EFTA and then rejoin the EEA. As things stand, EFTA states are also not allowed to be in a customs union with the EU. In the government's mind it is. Theresa May said in Oslo today that Norway's existing relationship with the EU ""has elements that wouldn't deliver on the vote of the British people."" But these are uncertain times. If a Brexit deal were to be agreed with the EU, and then voted down in the House of Commons, all bets would be off. And all options (including some version of Norway) could be up for debate.

Students 'humiliated by police',"High school students in Mantes-la-Jolie are arrested following protests against education reform Footage of school students being forced to kneel with their hands behind their heads by French riot police has sparked outrage on social media. A demonstration by students outside a school in Mantes-la-Jolie, west of Paris, ended in clashes with police and more than 140 arrests. Students are angry at plans to reform the exam system, which they say will limit opportunity and breed inequality. It comes as France prepares for further violence from ""yellow vest"" protesters. Police said that those arrested at the Saint-Exupery school were suspected of taking part in an ""armed gathering"", adding that officers had wanted to break up a situation that was getting ""out of control"", Le Monde newspaper reported. However, Paris Communist councillor ClÃ©mentine Autain said the images of students forced to kneel in dirt while facing brick walls were ""frightening"", ""humiliating"" and ""unacceptable"".

FrÃ©dÃ©rique Rolet, of France's education union the SNES-FSU, said she found the footage ""unbearable"", according to French radio station Europe 1. The head of Oxfam France, CÃ©cile Duflot, tweeted that she felt the scenes from the Mantes-la-Jolie school were ""simply intolerable"". Ms Duflot also shareda report produced by former French high school students who participated in demonstrations,externaldating back to the 1960s. In it, they state that the actions taken by authorities in response to the recent protests have been ""disproportionate"". ""We blocked our high schools, occupied the streets,"" the report reads, adding: ""None of us have ever been taken into custody... we were not gassed at close range in front of our schools."" Tourist sites to close on Saturday amid Paris riot fears 'We are not puppets' - voices of 'gilets jaunes' protesters Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Students across the country have been angered by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to change the end-of-school exam, which is known as the baccalaureate and is required for entrance to university, as well as the university admissions platform Parcoursup. Student Louis Benzerrouk said on Thursday that he was demonstrating because young people ""are not listened to"". ""We are despised by [Macron and his government] ... we really have the impression that they are going in the opposite direction,"" he said. Another student, Milena Arvois, said the planned reform will ""kill the vocational schools"", adding that she was also against an increase in fees for foreign students ""because that will be a disaster"". Dozens of schools were blockaded in cities across France this week, including in Marseille, Nantes and Paris. The ""gilets jaunes"" (""yellow vest"") protesters, so-called because they take to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing required to be carried in every vehicle by French law, initially complained at a sharp increase in diesel taxes but the demonstrations have now widened to include other sources of discontent. Mr Macron said his motivation for the increase was environmental, but protesters accused him of being out of touch. The government later scrapped the plan but the yellow vest protesters have since issued more than 40 demands to government, including a minimum pension and widespread changes to the tax system.

'Six months of jams' under no-deal Brexit,"Queues of lorries left residents near the Port of Dover unable to get out to buy basic supplies in 2015 Dover and other Channel ports face disruption for up to six months if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, ministers have said. The ""worst case scenario"" warning,externalcomes after analysis of likely traffic flows, if customs checks are delayed. Lorries carrying medicine could get priority at ports and planes used to fly in drugs, ministers said. But Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said it was ""Project Fear on steroids,"" ahead of Tuesday's big Brexit vote. He told the BBC: ""It's the last throw of the dice from the prime minister who is desperate to get MPs to vote for her withdrawal agreement."" The prime minister's claim that the alternative to the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU is a no-deal Brexit, has so far failed to convince many of her own MPs. Ministers 'can still win over Brexit rebels' Piennar: Plotting and scheming afoot as PM's options narrow 'Bodies uncollected' under no-deal Brexit Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Health Secretary Matt Hancock was among ministers trying to promote the deal on Friday, ahead of Tuesday's Commons vote, which the PM is widely expected to lose. He told the BBC: ""I don't know how likely 'no deal' is. It is what happens automatically unless Parliament passes something else. ""I very strongly feel that the best thing for the country, not just for the health service but for the country as a whole, is for Theresa May's deal to pass."" Lib Dems in Commons bid for new Brexit vote Brexit campaign prepares for referendum Updated advice to government departments from officials warns there could be six months of reduced access and delays at Dover and Folkestone, if the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 without a deal. By BBC Health Editor Hugh Pym Drug companies were told in August by the government to create stockpiles in the UK with six weeks worth of supplies. That has largely been achieved although there has not been so much progress with medical devices. But pharma bosses believe the government should do more to ensure continuity of supply and ministers should give more detail of plans to fast-track lorries through ports. Some may be suspicious about the timing of this with political debate over Brexit raging - government sources say the warning is based on analysis of trading patterns by officials which could not be withheld from Whitehall departments. Mr Hancock has written to health leaders, telling them to check their plans for ensuring the continued supply of medicines. Current advice is that there should be a six-week stockpile of medicines in the UK to cover the possibility of disruption after a no-deal Brexit. About 90% of medicines imported by the UK and the Republic of Ireland come in through Dover. This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs? The health secretary said the ""worst-case planning assumption"" meant that ""whilst the six-week stockpiling activities remain a critical part of our contingency plans, this now needs to be supplemented with additional actions"". He said the NHS should prepare to use alternative routes in the event of disruption on cross-channel routes, including the use of planes to fly in supplies. He wrote that if France or other EU countries imposed additional border checks in a no-deal scenario, the impact was ""likely to be felt mostly on the short straits crossings into Dover and Folkestone"" affecting both exports and imports, with ""significantly reduced access"" for up to six months. ""This is very much a worst-case scenario. In a 'no deal' exit from the EU we would, of course, be pressing member states hard to introduce pragmatic arrangements to ensure the continued full flow of goods which would be to their benefit as well as ours."" This video can not be played Dover council has three concerns over the impact of Brexit Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said the government warning was ""stark"" adding that ""stockpiling more medicines is not the solution to this problem"". He welcomed the intention to prioritise the flow of medicines and vaccines, but added, with just four months to go, ""we need the government to take immediate action to open up alternative supply routes between the UK and Europe and tell companies so that they can make plans"". Kent County Council has warned that dead bodies may remain uncollected and children might miss exams due to gridlocked roads in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In an update,externalon its contingency planning, the local authority said refuse could blight the streets and food deliveries could be disrupted as the county copes with 10,000 lorries parked or stacked on its roads. Council leader Paul Carter said preparations had been made for potential difficulties but added: ""We now need far more input and information from national government in how they are going to work with us. ""There must be a national freight transport plan which, when necessary, can hold lorries back from coming into Kent in the first place should the need arise."" The withdrawal deal negotiated between the UK and EU has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by Parliament if it is to come into force. With many of her own MPs opposing the deal, particularly the controversial issue of the ""backstop"", aimed at preventing the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, Mrs May is expected to lose Tuesday's vote on the deal. One senior minister has told the BBC ""the only political common sense is to delay"" it - but Downing Street has said it will go ahead as planned.

"'Norway plus' is Rudd's Brexit Plan BMs Rudd is the first minister to back an alternative plan publicly, if MPs reject Mrs May's deal.UK Politics","This video can not be played Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd says there is no better option than the PM's Brexit deal The UK could pursue alternative options if Theresa May's Brexit plan is rejected by MPs, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has acknowledged. She is the first cabinet minister to publicly float the possibility of ""plausible"" alternatives. Mrs Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she still supported the PM's plan  - but ""anything could happen"" if it did not get through on Tuesday. She said it could be ""chaotic"" if Mrs May's deal is rejected. Mrs Rudd said a so-called ""Norway plus"" option or another referendum would both be possibilities in such a situation. A Norway plus arrangement would see the UK remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) and joining a customs union with the EU. However the UK would have to accept free movement of people - breaching a previous ""red line"" laid down by the PM. Ms Rudd described it as a ""plausible"", but not a ""desirable"" option for a Plan B. She also said she was not certain it could be done. Norway is not a member of the EU but it is part of the EEA.  While a cross-party group of MPs back a similar status for the UK - the government would need to apply to join Norway and three other countries in the European Free Trade Association. Ms Rudd said the deal Mrs May reached with the EU last month was the ""best option"". ""What we need is a compromise deal - that's what the prime minister has proposed,"" she said. Brexit: A really simple guide No-deal disruption at Dover 'could last six months' Leave campaigners prepare for another referendum Six post-Brexit vote scenarios Asked why she had previously refused to speculate on possible alternatives to Mrs May's agreement, Ms Rudd said: ""We are getting closer to the vote. ""People are saying why they are not going to vote for it and I'm just pointing out if you don't vote for it, these are the other things that could happen. Are you sure you want them more?"" Pro and anti-Brexit campaigners have been staging protests at Westminster By Matt Cole, BBC political correspondent Far and wide this week - ministers have travelled the UK selling the idea of Theresa May's Brexit plan. The message has been a simple one - there is no alternative. Until this morning - when the Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd opened the door to a Plan B...  and what might happen if MPs vote down the deal. To be clear, Mrs Rudd says she still backs - and will vote for - the PM's plan. But she has now become the first voice from within the cabinet to entertain a notion of what happens next if the vote is lost. What is more, politicians know how their words are weighed. The work and pensions secretary will have been aware that people would interpret raising the prospect of a Norway Plus relationship with the EU as her signalling her support. Some will find it easy to believe that her declaration that such an arrangement would be ""plausible"" is none other than an early shot in the looming battle of the Plan Bs. For there to be a plan B though, plan A must first be voted down. And despite Mrs Rudd's protestations of faith that the deal's not dead, it's looking highly likely it will be killed off on Tuesday. Ms Rudd told Today a lot of people had a ""perfect vision"" of what they think Brexit should look like, ""and that perfect is not available"". ""I would urge my colleagues to think about, first of all, why people voted to leave the European Union, what their interpretation is of that; and, secondly, what the alternatives are,"" she said. She added: ""If it doesn't get through, anything could happen...  and none of them are as good as the current arrangement."" This video can not be played Brexit: Can Theresa May win over MPs? Ms Rudd said she hoped an amendment to Tuesday's vote, tabled by former Northern Ireland minister Sir Hugo Swire in an attempt to win over Eurosceptic MPs, ""will give some of my colleagues reassurance"". Many MPs have expressed concerns about the so-called backstop arrangement, aimed at preventing a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if no trade deal is ready before the end of the post-Brexit transition period, in December 2020. The amendment would enable Parliament to approve a decision to trigger the backstop and put a one-year time limit on it. On Saturday, Colchester MP Will Quince became the latest Conservative to resign from the government over the backstop question. Mr Quince stepped down as a ministerial aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson,telling the Sunday Telegraph,externalhe could not support a backstop without an end date.

"Man traced on missing airman footageCorrie Mckeague's mother had said the public would be ""horrified"" if they saw the CCTV footage.Suffolk","Corrie Mckeague's mother said the CCTV footage showed her son ""did not go in the bin"" A man captured on CCTV and believed by a missing airman's mother to be her son has identified himself to detectives. Police viewed the footage during their investigation into Corrie Mckeague's disappearance from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 2016. His mother Nicola Urquhart said the public would be ""horrified"" to see it, as it cast doubt on the police theories over her son's whereabouts. Police said the man captured on CCTV had been traced. The BBC asked for the CCTV footage to be released under the Freedom of Information Act. Suffolk Police turned down the request on the grounds of data protection laws. Mr Mckeague was last seen on CCTV at 03:25 BST on 24 September 2016 Mr Mckeague was last seen entering a bin loading bay when he was on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, leadingpolice to believe he had gone into one of the bins. But his remains were not found despite a 20-week trawl of a landfill site near Cambridge. Missing airman 'in waste disposal system' The tragedy that shaped Corrie Mckeague Missing airman 'may have dodged CCTV' Mrs Urquhart said she had viewed CCTV footage which she said showed a man leaving the bin loading bay. She said the footage was ""grainy"" but it showed a person ""wearing incredibly bright, reflective clothing, which looks like white trousers"". Mrs Urquhart said she believed it was her son and if members of the public saw the footage ""no-one would believe he went in the bin"". Detectives spent 20 weeks searching the landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire Suffolk Police said the footage showed three individuals who were ""tracked walking into the area and away from the area"". It said clearer images of them were found, ""enabling identification"". The force said all three individuals had been spoken to by police and had identified themselves from the images. It said it was ""confident"" none of them was Mr Mckeague. The force said the individuals were ruled out in autumn 2016. Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline, Fife, was 23 when he went missing. He was last seen entering in the bin loading area at 03:25 on 24 September.

"'We're so happy, we thought it had gone''I thought parental leave would be easy'Should we stop listening to these Christmas songs?VideoVideoMichelle and me: How Mrs Obama changed my life","John proposed to girlfriend Daniella in New York - but a short while later they lost the engagement ring Be it fate, or a stroke of good luck, Daniella Anthony and John Drennan are soon to be reunited with their precious piece of jewellery. ""We are so happy, we can't believe it,"" the young couple said after discovering their lost engagement ringhad been found. The pair, from Peterborough, had flown to New York to celebrate their 10-year dating anniversary. Mr Drennan said he'd put a lot of thought into the proposal. Speaking to BBC News on Sunday evening, he said he had carried the ring around in his pocket for two days before finding the right moment. ""I want to clarify that I did not propose over a grate in Times Square - that's where we lost it,"" Mr Drennan said. NYPD find UK couple who lost ring in drain Lost gold ring found on carrot Man told to repay ex for engagement rings The momentous occasion had taken place in Central Park a few hours earlier. ""The time was right. There were autumn leaves everywhere and not many people."" Daniella said yes straight away but they both knew the ring wasn't the right size. ""I tried to tell John it was too big, but he insisted I wear it,"" Ms Anthony said. ""I told her it was fine. I was just so happy to finally call her my fiancÃ©e after all this time,"" Mr Drennan added. The happy couple decided to grab a bite to eat and see the Christmas Spectacular in Times Square when the ring escaped. ""We were walking back to the hotel. I can still visualise the ring. Bouncing onceâ¦ bouncing twice and then it was gone,"" Mr Drennan said. Daniella and John called police straight away and officers were able to jar the grate open with a crow bar. They looked underneath, with the aid of torches, for at least two hours But it was to no avail. ""We just presumed it was gone. In the end, we had no choice but to walk away and try to enjoy the rest of our weekend,"" Mr Drennan said. Daniella was inconsolable and so they left without leaving their names with police, feeling hopeless. They arrived home on Sunday and said they were planning on going straight to the jewellery store to buy another ring. ""I couldn't stand the thought of her being without one,"" Mr Drennan said. But just moments after they touched down at the airport, a friend alerted them to the social media campaign being driven by the New York Police Department. Police had posted the CCTV footage of the couple trying to get the ring from the grate and used Twitter to appeal to find them. Allow Twitter content?

""Hey guys, is this you?"" the friend asked the couple. ""We could not believe it, we really thought it was gone,"" Ms Anthony said. ""We don't use Twitter - we had absolutely no idea this was going on. But we are so happy."" ""We are so thankful to everyone - especially the New York Police Department and everyone who shared our story,"" the couple said. They also wanted to send a heartfelt thank you to everyone who stopped to help look at the scene. There was one family in particular that stayed on for moral support. ""They had a little girl who gave Daniella a big hug and told her not to worry,"" Mr Drennan said. ""At the time, that hug meant everything.""

'I thought parental leave would be easy'Should we stop listening to these Christmas songs?VideoVideoMichelle and me: How Mrs Obama changed my life,"Andy Shelley says his time on parental leave was ""eye-opening"" Following the release of a poll which suggested 27% of mothers did not enjoy their maternity leave as much as they thought they would, parents have been sharing their experience of parental leave - both good and bad. Many people got in touch followingBBC Radio 5 Live presenter Emma Barnett's open and honest accountof her time away from work looking after her baby son, a time which she described as being ""bloody hard and at times, lonely"". So what's it like to be the one who stays at home and looks after the baby? Three parents share their very different experiences. Andy Shelley's girlfriend gave birth to their daughter in March and the couple decided to takeshared parental leave. Prior to making that choice, Andy's partner had been looking after their daughter while he worked 12-hour days. ""It was difficult because I felt like I wasn't doing enough,"" he says. Thirty-year-old Andy took over full-time care for two months in July, but admits he was not aware just how much work was involved in staying home and looking after his daughter. ""Initially I thought parental leave would be a nice break from work - but it wasn't easy. ""Some days she would be upset and I just didn't know what to do. Your entire day revolves around feeds. It becomes a full-time job in itself. ""I would be happy when my partner came home from work as it meant I could have a break."" The Stoke-On-Trent resident says his experience of parental leave was important as he realised how much his girlfriend had been doing when he thought she was ""just off work"". ""It made me appreciate everything she had done and ultimately cemented my relationship with my daughter. ""It's a shame more fathers don't take parental leave as it really opens your eyes and you realise what your partner has to deal with."" Sandrine Charpentier says she had a ""clear vision"" for her maternity leave and made sure it was a ""wonderful experience"" Sandrine Charpentier, from Hayes in Bromley, says her maternity leave with both of her daughters, who are now aged six and nine, was a ""really positive experience"". Despite not knowing many people where she lived, Sandrine made sure she wasn't isolated by booking a different activity every day. ""We would do baby swimming, yoga, singing and play groups. It motivated me to get dressed and get out of the house. ""The whole time I was really tired but I thought that was just part of the job. ""It was great to meet people, be social and talk about our experiences. I was really happy during that time and it was great for my daughters."" As much as she enjoyed her maternity leave, the mum-of-two admits it was also nice to return to work. ""Being at work was like a holiday because I was free to do what I wanted. I didn't have somebody glued to me all the time. ""It was good to do something different, to meet people and not talk about nappies and babies all the time."" People were shocked when Craig Smith said he was going to be a stay-at-home father Craig Smith, 42, from Staffordshire became a stay-at-home dad to his daughter, Matilda, in January when she was eight months old. His wife has a high-level job so they decided that it would be best for him to give up work and focus on their daughter's early years. ""I was very up for the challenge as I've always wanted children, but I didn't really think about what was involved in being a full-time dad. ""Sometimes it's hard because all Matilda wants is her mum."" Craig says his experience made him realise there is not enough support for stay-at-home dads. ""I tried to integrate with local playgroups, but the mums can be quite cliquey and it's very difficult for a dad to be accepted. ""A lot of mum-and-baby groups say fathers are welcome but in reality it's not like that - the mums can be quite cold."" Craig is planning on going back to work part-time when Matilda starts nursery, but says he feels anxious at the prospect of returning to normality. ""It feels like my brain has been conditioned to sing to Peppa Pig or nursery rhymes. The thought of carrying out serious and responsible tasks within a role kind of scares me.""

Should we stop listening to these Christmas songs?VideoVideoMichelle and me: How Mrs Obama changed my life,"Ricardo Montalban and Esther Williams sang Baby, It's Cold Outside in the 1949 film Neptune's Daughter Baby, It's Cold Outside is one of those Christmas songs that's about as traditional as mince pies. Butan American radio station's decision to pull it from playlistsbecause it's seen as unsuitable in the #MeToo era has reignited a debate about the song, and raised questions about other potentially questionable Christmas classics. Baby, It's Cold Outside found a wide audience as a duet between Ricardo Montalban and Esther Williams in the 1949 film Neptune's Daughter, and in recent years has been covered by the likes of Lady Gaga and Michael BublÃ©. Critics of the song see it as the story of a man pressuring a woman into spending the night when she doesn't want to. In particular, the line ""Say what's in this drink?/No cabs to be had out there"" has led people to make a link with date rape. Glenn Anderson, a DJ on Star 102, said the lyrics now felt ""manipulative and wrong"", and that it has no place in a world where people are ""extra sensitive"". However, a former English teacher wrote a feminist defence of the song ina viral Tumblr post,external, suggesting the woman ""is excusing her uncharacteristically bold behaviour (either to the guy or to herself) by blaming it on the drink"". ""It is not a joke about how she's drunk and about to be raped,"" the blog's author wrote. ""It's a joke about how she's perfectly sober and about to have awesome consensual sex and use the drink for plausible deniability because she's living in a society where women aren't supposed to have sexual agency.""

Lee Thompson, a music consultant who has worked in radio and TV for more than 30 years, thinks debates over such songs have grown in recent years. ""In all of my time working at radio stations, I've never had anyone come to me and say 'we shouldn't play a song',"" he says. ""It only seems to be in the last few years that the sensitivity around particular songs are magnified. I think social media is responsible for magnifying these arguments nowadays. ""Some people think, 'since this is my interpretation of the song, therefore everyone else needs to think its the correct interpretation of the song'."" Baby, It's Cold Outside isn't the only seasonal song that some people find problematic. The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl first had a hit with the song in 1987 In 2007, BBC Radio 1 edited out the words ""faggot"" and ""slut"" from The Pogues' Fairytale of New York to avoid offence. But later that evening, the station changed its mind after criticism from listeners. Justin Myers, a columnist for GQ Magazine,wrote on his blog,externalin November how allowing the song to be played on radio uncensored ""legitimises"" the slur and ""burdens"" the LGBT+ community. ""The word still has power, sharp cruel fangs, and is still used to demean and destroy lives of young people up and down the UK,"" he said. The song is heading back into the UK top 40 this week, however, as it has done for the past 13 Decembers, since downloading and streaming made it easier for old tunes to resurface. Magic Radio - which has devoted itself to Christmas songs for the month of December - has said it will keep playing both Baby, It's Cold Outside and Fairytale of New York this year. A spokeswoman for BBC Radio declined to say whether its stations would play the tunes. The BBC doesn't ban songs, she said - but ""tracks are chosen on musical merit and their relevance to our audience on a case-by-case basis"". Bob Geldof gave critics of the lyrics characteristically short shrift Despite being written to raise funds to combat famine in Ethiopia, the 1984 song doesn't refer to the country at all but rather the entire continent, leading to accusations that it fuels the tired trope that everywhere in Africa is the same, rather than a place filled with distinct countries, each with their own unique culture. ""There exists a paternalistic way of thinking about Africa, likely exacerbated by the original (and the second, and the third) Band Aid singles, in which it must be 'saved', and usually from itself. We say 'Africa' in a way that we would never say 'Europe', or 'Asia',"" wrote Bim Adewunmi inThe Guardian in 2014,external. She also pointed out that the lyrics reflected a ""popular narrative"" that those in the West were the ""benevolent elders, helping out poor Africans, mouths always needy and yawning"". Co-writerBob Geldof gave the critics short shrift,external, saying: ""It's a pop song, it's not a doctoral thesis."" The original record raised Â£8m for famine relief by selling 3.8 million copies, making it the second biggest-selling single in UK chart history. Before you tweet ""PC gone mad!"" in all caps, read the following information first. In 2017, Professor Kyna Hamill of Boston University published aresearch paper,externaloutlining the racist origins of the beloved Christmas ditty. Her peer-reviewed paper found that the song was originally performed in blackface in a minstrel show as One Horse Open Sleigh in Boston in September 1857. The song was written by James Pierpont, who was desperate for work after failing at other professional ventures, and Prof Hamill's research suggests he ""capitalised on minstrel music"" and used making fun of black people in the snow as a ""'safe' ground"" for his show. Prof Hamill has said itwasn't her intention,externalto stop your kids from singing this particular tune, however.

"WBC sanctions Wilder-Fury rematchThe WBC sanctions a ""direct rematch"" between champion Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury.BBC SportComments","A rematch between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder is a step closer The WBC has sanctioned a ""direct rematch"" between heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury. Britain's Fury and American Wilder shareda controversial and thrilling draw in Los Angeles on Saturday. Both fighters have said they want a rematch, whileFury is pushing for it to be in the UK. The WBC said in a statement there was a ""unanimous agreement"" to sanction a rematch in a meeting of the board of governors. ""Wilder and Fury gave boxing one of the best fights in the heavyweight division in a long time, which has created tremendous popular demand for the fans to see a rematch,"" it said. ""The WBC is happy to confirm a direct rematch has been approved."" Wilder's mandatory challenger is Dominic Breazeale but this decision by the WBC clears the way for him to fight Fury again next without being stripped of his belt. Listen: 5 Live Boxing with Costello and Bunce What next for the elite heavyweights? Although Fury was knocked down in the ninth and 12th rounds, many observers thought the 30-year-old Briton should have won the bout, which was scored 115-111 for Wilder, 114-112 for Fury and 113-113. Fury's promoter Frank Warren said he and the British Boxing Board of Control would write to the WBC demanding another bout and asking for an explanation of the scoring, with Mexican judge Alejandro Rochin having awarded Wilder seven of the 12 rounds. Fury said he had ""never seen a worse decision in my life"" and described it as a ""gift"" for his opponent. In an Instagram post in response, Wilder, 33, said: ""You saw the best Fury but you did not get the best Wilder and I still managed to get the job done."" Wilder alsoquestioned if referee Jack Reiss' count was too slowin Fury's remarkable rise from the canvas in the 12th round,which Reiss denied. BBC Radio 5 live boxing analyst Steve Bunce Fury and Wilder both want the rematch but I'm not sure where it will be. Had Fury got the decision I am convinced the rematch, 100%, would be in May in this country. I think there will already be an offer in from Las Vegas given how many Brits will go. Don't be surprised if we are going to Vegas in May.
