Cladding firm ends sales for tower blocks,"The US firm that supplied cladding used on London's Grenfell Tower says it has ended global sales of the product for use in high-rise blocks. Arconic said it was discontinuing sales of Reynobond PE for tower blocks due to ""issues"" identified by the fire, which is feared to have killed at least 79. The government said 75 buildings in 26 council areas had now failed fire safety tests - every one tested so far. Theresa May said councils need to speed up tower block safety tests in England. Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid said all hospitals and schools had also been asked to carry out ""immediate checks"". More high-rises fail fire safety tests Where have cladding fire tests failed? Holyrood to review tower block safety Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire He said the fact all tested samples had failed the so-called combustibility test underlined the ""vital importance of submitting samples urgently"". ""The testing facility can analyse 100 samples a day and runs around the clock. I am concerned at the speed at which samples are being submitted. ""I would urge all landlords to submit their samples immediately,"" Mr Javid told the House of Commons. Four inquests were opened, including those of Khadija Saye, Isaac Paulos, and Mohamednur Tuccu Four more Grenfell fire victims' inquests have been opened and adjourned, including that of a boy aged five. The body of Isaac Paulos, who lived with his family on the 18th floor, was found on the 13th floor, Westminster Coroner's Court was told. A preliminary cause of his death was given as ""inhalation of fire fumes"". The inquests of Mary Ajaoi Augustus Mendy, 54, her daughter Khadija Saye, 24, and Mohamednur Tuccu, 44, were also opened. Who are the victims? Questions about the cladding used on Grenfell Tower, in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, were raised in the days after the fire. Engineering and manufacturing company Arconic later confirmed Reynobond PE (polyethylene) - an aluminium composite material - was ""used as one component in the overall cladding system"" of the block. The material has a plastic core, which it is feared may have helped accelerate the spread of the fire. In a fresh statement, the firm said it had stopped sales of Reynobond PE for tall buildings, citing concerns about the ""inconsistency of building codes across the world"". Following the Grenfell Tower fire, issues have arisen ""regarding code compliance of cladding systems"", it added. Cladding from as many as 600 tower blocks across England is being tested for safety. Housing minister Alok Sharma told the BBC Radio 4's Today Programme some councils were acting ""very quickly"". Cladding has been removed for testing in a number of areas, including Salford Mr Sharma added: ""People should not wait for the checks to come back from these (tests). ""They should act now, get the fire service in, check the buildings that they think may be affected, put in place mitigation measures, if required, or, as in the case of Camden, if they need to evacuate, that needs to happen."" Insulation and cladding taken from Grenfell Towerfailed preliminary safety testslast week. Despite theprime minister promising to rehouse all of the tower block's residents within three weeks,Mr Javid says this might not be possible. ""For example...some of the families have first asked for something in Kensington as close as possible to where they lived but then when they have been shown the home and they see the tower and what is left of it, they have changed their minds and quite understandably said, 'Look, we would like to have some other options,'"" he said. Mr Javid added the government was working at the residents' pace and promised they would be made offers of housing within the three week time period. Over the weekend,Camden Council moved to evacuate 650 flats from four tower blocksin the Swiss Cottage area, after London Fire Brigade had raised concerns about cladding, gas pipe insulation, and fire doors. Mr Javid told MPs more than 1,000 fire doors were missing from five blocks in the Camden borough and a number of stairways were not accessible. Some 103 households are currently refusing to leave the tower blocks, the BBC understands - an increase on Saturday when 83 households remained. The apparent increase suggests some families have returned home since the weekend despite the warning.

How lack of sleep affects the brain,"Scientists in Canada have launched what is set to become the world's largest study of the effects of lack of sleep on the brain. A team, atWestern University,,externalOntario, want people from all over the world to sign uponline,externalto do cognitive tests. The specially devised computer games test skills such as reasoning, language comprehension and decision-making. I joined a group of volunteers trying out the tests and had my brain scanned while doing them. Why do we sleep? Are you getting enough sleep? Prof Adrian Owen, a British neuroscientist based at theBrain and Mind Institute,externalin London, Ontario, is leading the study. He told me: ""We all know what it feels like to not get enough sleep but we know very little about the effects on the brain; we want to see how it affects cognition, memory and your ability to concentrate."" The team will collate the cognitive scores and see the variations depending on how much sleep people have had. Everyone's sleep requirements are different, but if enough people join the study, it may allow scientists to determine the average number of hours needed for optimum brain function. I joined four volunteers spending the night at Western University, where we road-tested the brain games and were able to demonstrate how lack of sleep affects cognitive performance. The volunteers (clockwise from top left): Dr Hooman Ganjavi, Sylvie Salewski, Evan Agnew, Cecilia Kramar Dr Hooman Ganjavi, aged 42.  Psychiatrist who is regularly on-call overnight: ""Four to five hours sleep a night is typical for me.  I know that lack of sleep increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but, like many doctors, I don't apply it to me."" Sylvie Salewski, aged 31.  Mother of two girls under five:  ""A good night is when they wake me only two or three times; I can't remember what it is like to sleep through the night undisturbed, and I often feel fuzzy the next day."" Evan Agnew, aged 75.  Retired night clerk.   ""I've never needed eight hours' sleep all at once, and at my age I don't think I need more than four hours in one go.  I will top up my sleep during the day with a nap or two."" Cecilia Kramar, aged 31.  Neuroscientist who does cognitive research with nocturnal mice, meaning late nights in the laboratory: ""When I don't get much sleep, I cannot do anything complicated the next day, like reading a scientific paper, because my brain does not function well."" In Double Trouble, you must click on the word below that matches the colour of the word above. Odd One Out is as simple as it sounds, except that the game gets progressively harder The tests can be played on any computer, tablet or smart phone. Double Trouble:  This looks simple but really stretches the grey matter.  You have to click on the word below that corresponds to the colour in which the word above is written.  So, if the word at the top is ""blue"", but is coloured in red, you must click on the word below that is coloured red, even if it is written as ""blue"".  Fiendish. Odd One Out:  This starts simple but gets increasingly complex as you try to find the one shape that is different from the others. Two more of the brain games - Grammatical Reasoning looks simple until the statements at the top are negatives. In Spatial Planning, you click on the numbers to move them into the right position Grammatical reasoning:  Is the statement about a diagram true or false?  Sounds easy, until you begin dealing with negative statements. Spatial planning:  This tests the ability to plan ahead - like all the games, it measures cognitive skills we use repeatedly during the day. After staying up until 04:00, we were allowed four hours' sleep. When we re-did the cognitive tests later in the morning, Evan, Cecilia and I scored significantly worse than we had the night before. Hooman - who is used to being on-call and responding to patients - did not see much of a dip in his score, while Sylvie's actually improved. Sylvie said:  ""Although I feel a bit fuzzy this morning, maybe I've just got used to functioning on very little sleep; I have to be on as soon as my kids wake up, so it's normal for me."" I have long known that I don't function well when sleep deprived, so it was no surprise that my cognitive scores dipped dramatically in the morning. In order to find out what might be happening in my brain, I repeated the cognitive tests while inside an MRI machine. I was scanned twice - after a normal night's sleep and then after the sleep-deprived night. The functional MRI scanner is able to detect blood flow in the brain - so the areas that are working hardest show increased levels of activity, shown as orange coloured blobs. The scan on the left shows my brain activity during cognitive tests after a normal night's sleep, compared with my sleep-deprived brain, on the right The comparison between the scans was stark: after being sleep deprived, my brain was well under par - there was much less going on up there. Prof Owen gave the scientific explanation: ""There is much less activity in the frontal and parietal lobes - areas we know are crucial for decision making, problem solving and memory. "" We all know that it is dangerous to drive when tired, because our reaction times are impaired and we might fall asleep at the wheel. But the more subtle effects of sleep deprivation on day-to-day living are far less understood. Prof Adrian Owen, of the Brain and Mind Institute, Western, is leading the sleep cognition study Prof Owen told me: ""It may be that lack of sleep is having very profound effects on decision making and perhaps we should avoid making important decisions like buying a house or deciding whether to get married when we are sleep deprived."" We spend nearly a third of our lives asleep, and it is as vital to our wellbeing as the food we eat and the air we breathe. But our 24-hour culture means we are getting less sleep than ever. Last month, a paper inNature Reviews Neuroscience,externalsaid there was ""remarkably little understanding"" of the consequences on the brain of chronic sleep loss. It spoke of the ""precipitous decline in sleep duration throughout industrialised nations"", adding that more research was urgently needed. Those who volunteer for thesleep study,externalmay help find some of the answers needed by both science and society.

Largest aircraft carrier sets sail,"Just before midnight, the ship was able to pass under the Forth Bridge The Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier has left its home port for the first time. HMS Queen Elizabeth - one of two new carriers being built at Rosyth dockyard in Fife at a cost of more than Â£6bn - is to begin sea trials. The ship passed under the Forth Bridge just before midnight. It is the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy. The flight deck alone is the size of three football pitches. Once in service the ship can operate with a crew of 1,000 and 40 aircraft. The 65,000 tonne warship is the Royal Navy's first aircraft carrier since HMS Illustrious was scrapped in 2014. HMS Queen Elizabeth had to wait for low tide to go under the Forth bridges The flightdeck is the size of three football pitches Eleven tugs manoeuvered it out of the dock at Rosyth. It then squeezed through the narrow entrance into the Forth estuary. Once low tide is reached at about 23:00, the warship will have to lower a mast to make it under the Forth bridges - with just a few metres to spare. The project to build HMS Queen Elizabeth and sister ship HMS Prince of Wales cost more than Â£6bn The aircraft carrier weighs 65,000 tonnes and has a top speed of 25 knots Its flight deck is 280m long and 70m wide - enough space for three football pitches The ship is the second in the Royal Navy to be named Queen Elizabeth It will have a crew of about 700, increasing to 1,600 when a full complement of F-35B jets and Crowsnest helicopters are embarked There are 364,000m of pipes inside the ship Both HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales will keep 45 days worth of food in its stores The entire ship's company of 700 can be served a meal within 90 minutes - or 45 minutes when at action station Leaving the Rosyth dock will be among the most difficult manoeuvres in the sea trials with just 50cm between the bottom of the ship and the seabed in the port Commanding officer Captain Jerry Kydd said the ship was important for Britain's reputation as a naval power. ""I think there are very few capabilities, by any country, that are as symbolic as a carrier strike capability,"" he added. ""Submarines you can't see, but these are very visible symbols of power and power projection."" Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: ""This is a historic moment for the UK as our new aircraft carrier takes to sea for the very first time. ""This floating fortress is by far the most powerful ship ever built in Britain that will enable us to tackle multiple and changing threats across the globe. ""HMS Queen Elizabeth is an enduring example of British imagination, ingenuity, invention that will help keep us safe for decades to come. She is built by the best, crewed by the best and will deliver for Britain. ""For the next 50 years she will deploy around the world, demonstrating British power and our commitment to confronting the emerging challenges from a dangerous world. The whole country can be proud of this national achievement. "" This video can not be played The largest and most powerful ship to be built for the Royal Navy is leaving the Rosyth dock for the first time The start of sea trials follows warnings that technical issues and personnel shortagescould delay the deployment of the aircraft carrier. The National Audit Office said in March the project was entering a ""critical phase"", with many risks to manage. The Ministry of Defence acknowledged ""challenges"" but said it was committed to being fully operational by 2026. The technical issues mean the forthcoming sea trials are three months behind schedule. The NAO predicted it would not be operational by 2020, as had been promised by the MoD. The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said that if all went according to plan with the latest developments, HMS Queen Elizabeth would be sailing toward open waters on Monday evening. He said the Royal Navy expected Russia's military to take an interest while the warship was being tested in the North Sea. It will be several years before HMS Queen Elizabeth is fully operational with jets on board.

MP hails himself 'Commons' first Darren',"This video can not be played New MP claims to be the first Darren in the Commons A new MP has proclaimed himself as ""the first ever Darren"" to be elected to the House of Commons. Bristol North West MP Darren Jones claims his name â combined with the area's early evidence of human habitation â makes his a ""historic and fascinating constituency"". The new Labour MP ousted Conservative Charlotte Leslie in the general election earlier this month. Labour mopped up all four Bristol seats at the election. Fellow Bristol MP Kerry McCarthy used Twitter to hail the newest member of the ""Bristol posse"", which includes Bristol West MP Thangam Debbonaire â surely the first Thangam to be elected in the UK. Speaking as MPs debated the Queen's Speech, Mr Jones said: ""From the earliest evidence of human habitation on these British Isles on the shores of the River Avon near Shirehampton, to the 8th Century monastery of Westbury-on-Trym, granted by King Offa of Mercia, to the Roman settlements at Sea Mills and Lawrence Weston, and the Domesday reference to the parish of Henbury and now, so I am told, to the first ever Darren elected to this House of Commons, Bristol North West is an historic and fascinating constituency."" He said it was ""deeply humbling"" to represent the area where he had grown up on a council estate and pledged to fight for a soft Brexit to protect businesses and residents who rely on the EU.

Tories and DUP agree UK government deal,"This video can not be played The chief whips from both parties sign the document An agreement has been reached which will see the Democratic Unionist Party back Theresa May's minority government. The deal, which comes two weeks after the election resulted in a hung Parliament, will see the 10 DUP MPs back the Tories in key Commons votes. There will be Â£1bn extra for Northern Ireland over the next two years. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the ""wide-ranging"" pact was ""good for Northern Ireland and the UK"" but one critic said it was a ""straight bung"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was ""clearly not in the national interest"", and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams said it enabled a ""Tory Brexit which threatens the Good Friday Agreement"". It has prompted calls for matching public investment in Wales and Scotland. A three page document,externaloutlining the terms of the agreement has been published in full. The DUP said it would apply for the lifetime of the Parliament, scheduled to last five years, but would also be reviewed at the end of the current session in two years' time. Recap: How the day unfolded Where does this leave power-sharing talks? May's deal with the DUP: What you need to know Who are the DUP? Where will the money go? There will be Â£1.5bn in funding - consisting of Â£1bn of new money and Â£500m of previously announced funds - to be spent over the next two years on infrastructure, health and education in Northern Ireland, money Mrs Foster said was needed to address the challenges from Northern Ireland's ""unique history"". As part of the deal, the military covenant will be implemented in full in Northern Ireland, meaning more focus on the treatment of military veterans, while the triple lock guarantee of at least a 2.5% rise in the state pension each year, and winter fuel payments, will be maintained throughout the UK. Other key points of the agreement include: The DUP will support the Tories on all Brexit and security legislation The UK's 2% Nato defence spending target will continue to be met Cash support for farmers will remain at current levels until the next election Both parties to adhere to commitments in Good Friday Agreement No Irish border poll without ""consent of the people"" Mrs May shook hands with DUP leader Arlene Foster as she and other senior party figures arrived at Downing Street on Monday to finalise the pact. The two leaders then watched as Conservative chief whip Gavin Williamson and his DUP counterpart Jeffrey Donaldson signed the documents in No 10. Speaking outside Downing Street, Mrs Foster said the agreement would bring stability to the UK government as it embarked on the Brexit process, ""This agreement will operate to deliver a stable government in the United Kingdom's national interest at this vital time,"" she said. Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The Tories now face a bumpy day of criticism, about how the DUP have been bought off - Â£100m for each of their ten votes in Parliament. The other devolved nations will cry foul. Some Tories too are deeply uncomfortable about the association with the DUP brand of unionism. And if the cuts are to be eased in Northern Ireland, what about other parts of the country? But the money that's been found down the back of the Number 10 sofa for Northern Ireland may be worth it for Theresa May as the price of holding power, for now. She now has her majority, whatever the cost, and a dividend could be the conclusion of a deal to get power sharing at Stormont up and running too. Read Laura's blog in full Welcoming the additional funding for Northern Ireland, she said it would benefit all communities. ""Following our discussions the Conservative Party has recognised the case for higher funding in Northern Ireland, given our unique history and indeed circumstances over recent decades."" The UK prime minister said the pact was a ""very good one"" for the UK as a whole. ""We share many values in terms of wanting to see prosperity across the UK, the value of the union, the important bond between the different parts of the UK,"" Mrs May said. ""We very much want to see that protected and enhanced First Secretary of State Damian Green, a close ally of Mrs May's, said he hoped the extra money would help revive devolved government in Northern Ireland. This video can not be played Damian Green: Cash is to help devolved government This video can not be played Carwyn Jones said a ""magic money tree"" had been found for Northern Ireland ""The money that is attached to this agreement is actually less than the money attached to the original Stormont agreement in 2014,"" he told the BBC. ""We know Northern Ireland has particular needs, because of its history and difficulties. ""There are parts of the Northern Ireland infrastructure that needs particular help and that has been recognised on a continuing basis."" The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said most of the money being allocated to Northern Ireland would go to specific projects rather than general spending, meaning it would not necessarily impact on the Barnett formula which determines overall expenditure across the nations of the UK. She said DUP sources pointed to the creation of a ""coordination committee"", suggesting this would give them a direct line in to government discussions and that this may prove particularly influential over the Brexit negotiations. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since March and parties have until Thursday to find agreement. The cash will go to the Northern Ireland executive if the devolved institutions are restored by the deadline of 29 June. The talks have taken two weeks to conclude The two sides met in the Cabinet room Before the deal was signed Under the so-called ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, the DUP will line up behind the government in key votes, such as on the Queen's Speech and Budgets, as well as Brexit and security matters, which are likely to dominate most of the current Parliament. On other legislation, the DUP's support is not necessarily guaranteed - although the Northern Ireland party is expected to back the majority of the government's programme for the next two years after many of its more controversial policies were dropped. 'Outrageous' Tory/DUP deal condemned in Wales Analysis: DUP deal and the funding formula 'No money for Scotland' through DUP deal DUP-Tory deal signed in Downing Street Where is the money going to be spent? The support of the DUP will give Mrs May an effective working majority of 13, given that Sinn Fein do not take up their seven seats and Speaker John Bercow and his three deputies - two of whom are Labour MPs - do not take part in votes. Several senior Tories had advised her to govern without any formal agreement with the DUP, arguing the unionist party would not be prepared to bring Mrs May down and run the risk of triggering a fresh election given their longstanding hostility to Jeremy Corbyn and other senior Labour figures. Former PM Sir John Major warned that a formal association with the DUP could undermine attempts to restore power-sharing government in Northern Ireland while some MPs said the DUP's socially conservative stance on issues such as gay marriage and abortion could damage the party in the longer term. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones suggested Mrs May was ""throwing money at Northern Ireland while ignoring the rest of the UK"", in what he called ""cash for votes"". ""Today's deal represents a straight bung to keep a weak prime minister and a faltering government in office,"" the Labour politician said. Mr Corbyn said public service cuts should be stopped ""right across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland"". He demanded to know where the extra money for Northern Ireland was coming from, and whether other parts of the UK would get a similar cash injection. ""This Tory-DUP deal is clearly not in the national interest but in May's party's interest to help her cling to power,"" he added. Mr Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, said: ""The Tory government has slashed more than Â£1bn from the block grant over the last seven years. ""The allocation of additional funds could help to ease the enormous pressure on our public services. ""The devil is in the detail."" On the plan to implement the military covenant in Northern Ireland, Mr Adams added: ""Sinn Fein will resolutely oppose any attempt to give preferential treatment to British forces, either in terms of legacy or the provision of public services."" In the Commons, MPs from other parties lined up to criticise the new arrangements, with the SNP's Pete Wishart saying it was a ""pathetic grubby little deal"" and accusing the Tories and DUP of ""pork barrel politics"". But Nigel Dodds, the DUP's Westminster leader, said his party could publish details of its correspondence with Labour and the SNP at the time of previous elections. ""Some of the faux outrage we have heard is hypocrisy of the highest order,"" he said. Mr Dodds said the extra investment would be ""for every section of the community in Northern Ireland"".

Nintendo reveals classic SNES console,"The device will come with 21 games built in - plus two controllers Super Mario World, Starfox and Yoshi's Island are set to be re-released later this year as part of a new classic SNES console. The original Super Nintendo Entertainment System, launched in 1990, sold 50 million units worldwide. The SNES Classic follows the NES Classic, which went on sale late last year but abruptly discontinued in April - much to the frustration of fans. Nintendo said limited resources were to blame, but insisted it would not make the same error with the SNES. ""We aren't providing specific numbers, but we will produce significantly more units of Super NES Classic Edition than we did of NES Classic Edition,"" a Nintendo spokesperson said. The assertion follows accusations from the gaming community that Nintendo was engaging in so-called intentional scarcity. The marketing ploy was supposedly intended to drum up publicity for the Japanese company, which launched its flagship new console, the Nintendo Switch, earlier this year. One industry watcher said it was notable that the firm had decided to release new hardware rather than release its old games as apps for smartphones and tablets. ""Nintendo still has the view that it likes to control the whole experience,"" commented Piers Harding-Rolls from the IHS Technology consultancy. ""Conceivably in the future it could release some of these titles for smartphones, but I think it's quite unlikely as these games weren't built for mobile devices."" He added that the firm's mobile strategy currently appears to be focused on in-app payments, which would not fit the selected titles' designs. Nintendo would not confirm if it intended to keep making the SNES Classic beyond the end of 2017. ""Super Nintendo Entertainment System: Super NES Classic Edition is currently planned to ship from Sept. 29 until the end of calendar year 2017,"" the company added. ""Our long-term efforts are focused on delivering great games for the Nintendo Switch system and continuing to build momentum for that platform, as well as serving the more than 63 million owners of Nintendo 3DS family systems. ""We are offering Super Nintendo Entertainment System: Super NES Classic Edition in special recognition of the fans who show tremendous interest our classic content."" As well as the classic titles, Nintendo will also bundle in a game from the SNES era that was never actually released - Star Fox 2. The console will cost $79 in US, and Â£79.99 in the UK. Other firms are also looking to capitalise on yesteryear gaming success. Sega, whose Megadrive console competed fiercely with the SNES in the Nineties, recently said it wouldre-release a huge library of gamesas part of a Netflix-style scheme. The games have advertising unless a user pays a one-off $1.99 fee. For some time, fans of old games have been creating game ROMs - read-only memory - that emulated the old titles so they could be played on a modern PC or other device. However, ROMs are often fraught with bugs, and as games increased in sophistication became harder to reproduce. They were also, of course, illegal - though there are few cases of game companies going after ROM fanatics, although some websites distributing the software have faced legal action. ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Sega debuts free retro games for mobiles Atari is making a new video game console E3: Mario caps Nintendo's triumphant comeback Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

N-Dubz's Dappy sentenced over knife row,"Dappy, whose real name is Costadinos Contostavlos, had armed himself with a butcher's knife The former N-Dubz rapper Dappy has been given a suspended jail sentence for arming himself with a butcher's knife during a row with his partner. The star, whose real name is Costas Contostavlos, 30, admitted having the knife outside the home he shared with Imani Campbell in Hatfield on 10 May. He was given nine months in jail suspended for two years. The rapper, who had a black eye after being attacked while on remand, wept in the dock and thanked the judge. During his trial the court was told neighbours heard a commotion at the couple's Hertfordshire home in the early hours of the morning. Mobile phone footage taken by a witness showed the rapper came out of his home and go to a bush in the front garden where he picked up a knife, before going back inside, prosecutor Neil King said. More news from Hertfordshire Dappy walked free from court after partner Imani Campbell said she ""couldn't ask for a better father and partner"" The rapper wept as the judge suspended his jail sentence for 24 months Dappy, a Big Brother runner-up and cousin of former X-Factor judge Tulisa, was seen later carrying a large butcher's knife with a curved blade. He is also said to have pointed the knife at members of the public making intimidating remarks. Police, including armed officers, attended the address in Roe Green Close, shortly afterwards and forced the door open. Dappy was arrested later that afternoon. An early plea of not guilty to common assault on Miss Campbell was accepted by the prosecution at Luton Crown Court. Handing him a suspended jail sentence, the judge told the rapper he must ""act as a proper role model"", attend a relationship programme and was given an additional 10-day rehabilitation requirement order.

Health bill 'to leave 22m without cover',"A number of Republican senators have expressed reservations about the party's plan Some 22 million Americans could lose their health insurance over the next decade under a Senate bill to replace Obamacare, a congressional report says. However, the bill would reduce the budget deficit, the non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office said. Similar legislation passed by the House was also said to leave millions uninsured. Some Republicans have voiced reservations about the plan. But the White House disputed the CBO's figures. Responding to Monday's report, it said: ""The CBO has consistently proven it cannot accurately predict how healthcare legislation will impact insurance coverage."" The report is a review of draft legislation unveiled by the Republican party last week. It is unlikely to be approved by Democrats, who see the proposals as cruel and unfair. The CBO said that 15 million more people would be uninsured by 2018 under the proposed legislation than under current law, largely because the penalty for not having insurance would be eliminated. Donald Trump called the House healthcare bill that resulted in 23 million additional uninsured by 2026 ""mean"". How might he describe a Senate version that only reduces those numbers to 22 million? Less affluent Americans currently on government-managed Medicaid insurance, many of whom supported the president, will see a 26% reduction in their programmes funding over the next decade, resulting in fewer covered and skimpier benefits. That is a tough pill for moderate Republicans, who will be under enormous pressure from their constituents to vote against the bill. There is some good news in the CBO report, of course. Thanks to the cuts, the Senate measure would reduce the budget deficit by a total of $321bn (Â£252bn) in 2017-2026 - even with Obama-era tax cuts rolled back. The personal health insurance marketplace is estimated to remain largely stable, and premiums will go down (after a spike next year). The bottom line, however, is that the CBO report is a blow to the Senate bill's chances of success. House Republicans weathered a similar beating and rallied to pass their version, so it is much too early to write a political epitaph. That assumes, of course, that their efforts are not undermined by the man in the Oval Office. This video can not be played Trump's battles with Obamacare - in his own words President Donald Trump's Republican party is struggling to secure the 50 votes it needs to get its bill through the Senate when it comes to the floor. What's wrong with Obamacare? 'Obamacare saved my life' The Republican senator for Maine, Susan Collins, has said she will vote against it, joining colleagues Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee and Rand Paul who on Thursday said they were ""not ready to vote for this bill"", but were ""open to negotiation"". Their concerns about the measure include its rollback of the expansion of Medicaid, the public health programme for the poor and disabled. Mr Johnson said on Sunday there was ""no way"" there should be a vote on the legislation this week. The Senate bill would slash taxes for the wealthy offering less help for working families to buy medical insurance. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi earlier warned that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Americans would die if congressional Republicans pass their healthcare legislation. Republicans have rejected the notion that anyone will die as a result of their healthcare plan. Is Trump's 'Obamacare nightmare' over? Video, 00:01:58Is Trump's 'Obamacare nightmare' over?

Salvador Dali's body to be exhumed,"DalÃ­ died in Spain in 1989 and had no children with his wife A judge in Madrid has ordered the exhumation of the body of Spanish artist Salvador DalÃ­ to get samples for a paternity suit. A Spanish woman, born in 1956, said her mother, a maid, had a clandestine affair with the painter in 1955. The judge said there were no biological remains or personal objects of the artist to be used in the test. He died in Spain in 1989 at the age of 85. The DalÃ­ Foundation, which manages the artist's estate, says it will appeal. The surrealist painter was buried in the theatre and museum he designed himself, in his home town of Figueres in the north-eastern Catalonia region. Maria Pilar Abel MartÃ­nez, a tarot card reader who was born in Girona, made the paternity claim for the first time in 2015. BBC Arts:What is surrealism? Ms MartÃ­nez claims that her mother had an affair with the world-famous painter She said her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in CadaquÃ©s, next to where the painter had a home. Antonia left her job in 1955, moved to a different city and married another man. Ms MartÃ­nez claimed that her mother told her several times that DalÃ­ was her father, on many occasions in front of others. ""The only thing I'm missing is a moustache,"" she once said, according tonewspaper El Mundo (in Spanish).,external At the time of the alleged affair, DalÃ­ was married to his muse Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. The couple had no children. Salvador DalÃ­ is best known for his surrealist works The decision also cites that Ms MartÃ­nez underwent two paternity tests, both in 2007, but never received the results. Her legal action is against the Spanish state, to which DalÃ­ left his estate. If she is confirmed to be the artist's daughter, she could use his surname and be entitled to part of his estate - but Spanish media say she would have to legally request it. Ms MartÃ­nez's lawyer said there was no date for the exhumation, but that it could happen as soon as July. The DalÃ­ Foundationsaid in a statement,externalthat an appeal would ""be lodged in the coming days.""

Beach death friends 'competent swimmers',"Two brothers died with three of their friends at Camber last year An inquest into the deaths of five young men at Camber Sands has heard they were all able swimmers and keen on sport. Two brothers, Ken, 18, and Kobi Saththiyanathan, 22, died at the Sussex beach last August along with three of their friends. A pathologist told the hearing in Hastings that all five drowned. Earlier, a lawyer said the beach, which can attract 30,000 people a day at peak times, had ""hidden dangers"". Two other people died in July 2016, after one got into difficulty at Camber and the other tried to reach him - the circumstances of their deaths will be considered as part of the inquest into the five friends' deaths. This video can not be played Ajirthan Ravi, brother of Nitharsan Ravi, called for increased safety at Camber before inquest proceedings began In his opening remarks, the family's barrister Patrick Roche said relatives were keen that ""no-one else suffers the same appalling tragedy"". The men who died all lived in the London area and were of Sri Lankan origin. The inquest heard the two brothers had grown up in a Sri Lankan village surrounded by three rivers and had ""good swimming ability"". A statement by the brothers' father Arumukam Saththiyanathan said his sons regularly played cricket and football and swam in Sri Lanka almost every weekend before they came to the UK in 2008 when they were aged 10 and 14. He added: ""As a family we went to the beaches in the UK nearly every summer and the boys went without us sometimes."" He said Kobi, a business studies student at Brighton University, loved Camber and had visited the beach three times in 2016 before his death. Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Brett Lockyer, said toxicology tests on both brothers were negative for drugs and alcohol. Ken, an A Level student, was described as healthy with no natural disease, and a GP report on Kobi said he had no serious conditions and was not on repeat medication. Their mother, Jegaleela Saththiyanathan, said both her sons were physically fit and played sport at a district level in Sri Lanka. 'Competent swimmer' Nitharsan Ravi was studying aeronautical engineering at Brighton Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, died alongside his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, known as Kobi, both from Erith, south east London. Their three friends, who also died on 24 August were Nitharsan Ravi, 22, from Plumstead, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, from Grays, Essex and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, from Welling. On 24 July, Mohit Dupar, 36, from Hayes, west London, attempted to reach Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, after he got into difficulty. Mr Silva Da Cruz died at the scene. Mr Dupar died in hospital four days later. The inquest heard Mr Ravi had been admitted to hospital with a head injury the day before he died, after an alleged assault four days earlier, but Dr Lockyer said: ""I don't believe the head injury has played a significant part in this man's demise."" Mr Ravi's father, Nagaratnam, said his ""fit and healthy"" son, who had driven the group to Camber, was a competent swimmer. The Brighton University aeronautical engineering student was ""caring, polite and humble and was active with a high work rate,"" Mr Ravi added. He said his family visited beaches every year and his son was ""accustomed to swimming"". Inthushan Sriskantharasa, a Tesco shift manager, was on a day off from work when he died. His uncle, Sivapragasan Thavarasa, said he had seen him swimming in the sea and described him as a ""very able"". Gurushanth Srithavarajah, a student and part-time shop assistant, spent the first 12 years of his life living near the sea in Sri Lanka and was described by his sister, Kabinuja as a competent swimmer.

What comes after 'Ohhh Jeremy Corbyn!'?,"These days it's not that weird seeing a man born in 1949 rocking the crowds at the Glastonbury Festival. Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits and Richard Hell were all born that year and I am sure they could still get the campers roaring. The novelty value was that it was a politician, Jeremy Corbyn, who was lapping up the love this year. However, the age gap and the ""well, fancy that"" factor have obscured the very real importance of the Labour leader's appearance at the annual music festival. His first big gig since his election triumph (no, I know he didn't win, and yes it was) highlights the reason he's done so well, and flags up the pitfalls ahead. It could mark the point of peak Corbyn. But a big deal? Certainly. It won't get the column inches or hours of airtime and earnest analysis devoted every year to the leaders' speeches at conference time, but it was far more important. They rarely amount to much - trust me I've covered quite a few of them in my time - and they're nearly always forgotten within the week. Mr Corbyn's offering was, to say the least, unusual. And that is the point. He doesn't play the game - and people who can't bear political game-playing love this conscious vibe. Of course, part of its importance was the venue. He wasn't speaking to party press officers and political hacks in a cavernous hall, but live and direct to thousands of people in a muddy field in Somerset. That the rebellious and radical leader of the Labour Party, scorned by the establishment and most of his own MPs, was asked to make a speech, is part of the meaning. The Glastonbury crowd differed greatly from a traditional party conference audience The organisers knew he would be popular. It is obvious that Jezza has become, if not an idol, an object of affection for some younger people. That isn't particularly strange. Strands coexist, neo-liberalism may still rule the world and Glastonbury is an intensely commercial gathering, but Che Guevara is still on people's T-shirts and Margaret Thatcher isn't. Conservatism has rarely been cool, even under Dave Cameron. Corbynmania isn't just retro chic with a dash of post-modern irony. The counter-culture moulded the modern. And - just as Glasto isn't really only for or about the young - this is only the symbolic tip of the Corbyn iceberg. Festivals are largely made up of the unbuttoned middle class, pretty well-heeled, but no less fed up about the future and the society they in which they live, particularly after the Brexit vote. The part of the old Labour coalition who drifted away after Tony Blair's Iraq war. Jeremy Corbyn appears at Glastonbury Populism: Pantomime politics or the public fighting back? All about general election 2017 Profile of Labour's leader But the tone of Mr Corbyn's speech was also really important. He didn't pull that trick of daring but arrogant bands and hit them with new material. He stuck to some of the very old favourites, but there was a freshness for those who've heard thousands of political speeches. There were none of the policy announcements which are catnip to the commentariat and only a couple of disparaging comments about President Trump, but no direct attacks on the Conservatives. There was not much mention of current politics at all in fact - one reference to the Grenfell Tower fire and one about rights of EU citizens and that was about it. Instead, Mr Corbyn might have taken another piece of clichÃ©d advice for bands: it was all full of soul and feeling - from the heart. Appropriately for a festival, there was a lot about love and peace and a better world. A burning sense of injustice, sure, but a steady rhythm optimism running through it - riffs on poetry, art and the wisdom of learning lessons from each other. Warm and fuzzy or pie in the sky? Lying on your back on the grass, that sounds OK. In one sense, it is a very old politics but it is the product of the new politics. Back in 2008, I frequently mused aloud that I knew the financial crisis would produce new political movements - I just couldn't tell what they would be - and 11 years later I have had my answer in spades. Populist politicians like French President Emmanuel Macron have enjoyed recent success Talk of populism has its place but the common thread which ties together Trump and Macron and links Italy's Five Star Movement to Corbyn, is a rejection of the existing political order and what's been tried before. A restless quest for something new, a hope for change. That might sound weird when we have just seen a return to two party politics. But, while the label on the Labour bottle is the same, the contents are very different. It is one of the many ironies of Brexit that Theresa May's analysis was probably spot on. That the vote which turned the British political world upside down wasn't only about the European Union but about people left behind, missing out, ignored by an elite and frustrated. Her mistake - and ours - was to believe that she could capture that spirit. Still, ""Oooh Jeremy Corbyn"" might be as good as it gets for Jezza. This could be peak Corbyn. What lies ahead is tougher - to convince people not only that he's a nice old geezer who's not the horned demon painted by the tabloids, but that he is a potential prime minister. The Labour right's grudging acceptance that he had a good war has yet to translate into anything like helpful support. Many on his team want vengeance. His reshuffle buried no hatchets. Neither right nor left of Labour seem to have heededPaul Mason's acute analysis,external- which suggests giving the right the control of defence and security so the left can own the economy. Theresa May has said she wants to reach out to the ""just about managings"" The critical task is still holding together the fraying coalition at the heart of the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn may be able to combine an appeal to partygoers in luxury yachts and people suffering in tower blocks, but it is much harder for him to reach those who bought their own council houses. Those white working class men on the doorstep shaking their heads and saying ""not while he's leader"" were not a myth. Whenever the next election arrives, there will be more scrutiny of what he would be like as prime minister. It is true the press have thrown everything they have to throw and the more over the top abuse has failed. But expectations were so low that it helped Mr Corbyn. If, this year, people felt they could vote Labour as a protest, to dent Mrs May's predicted immense majority, they won't think that next time. Then again, the Conservatives can hardly warn of the dangers of a weak government with a besieged leader with no authority trying to manage a party pulling in different directions on Brexit. But Labour MPs will be the very last to breezily sing ""Oooh Jeremy Corbyn"". Capturing a sunny mood of righteous rebellion is very far from grasping the keys to No 10.

Were predictions about Hong Kong's handover correct?,"In July 1997, more than 150 years of British rule came to an end in Hong Kong with its handover to China, a historic event viewed with a mixture of uncertainty and hope. We asked observers how their predictions turned out 20 years on. Back then, cosmopolitan and prosperous Hong Kong was seen as China's vital gateway to the outside world - and many believed it would stay that way for years to come. Fast forward 20 years, and it is no longer the only jewel in China's crown, with cities such as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou becoming financial or manufacturing powerhouses. ""Hong Kong was the golden goose in China,"" said politician Martin Lee. ""I couldn't have thought that China's economy would develop so quicklyâ¦ and Hong Kong's bargaining power would diminish so fast."" Many also did not envision Hong Kong ending up as ""a paradise for money laundering and capital outflow"" for the mainland, said financial analyst Agnes Wu. In recent years Chinese tycoons have sought to park their assets, businesses and even themselves within the city amid a corruption crackdown in Beijing - something which the Chinese government has frowned upon. Many wondered in 1997 how the reunion of a freewheeling, liberal city with its tightly-controlled mainland would pan out, particularly a few years after the Tiananmen Massacre which saw the brutal crushing of pro-democracy protests. One hope was that Hong Kong could eventually ""infect China with democracy"", said Keith Richburg, a former correspondent with The Washington Post. With China's rapid pace of economic development, many believed it would open up politically as well, and ""if Hong Kong could just hold on for 20 years, there would be a convergence"". Some believe the opposite has happened. Last month, Hong Kong's last British governorChris Patten said,externalthere had been ""a steady tightening of grip on Hong Kong's windpipe"" and its autonomy. China has promised to preserve the city's rights and autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. But there are fears it is not keeping that promise, followingthe disappearance of Hong Kong booksellers and a Chinese tycoonand Beijing'sintervention in the selection of Hong Kong lawmakers. China now sees Hong Kong ""as a threat... a base of subversion, a place to be controlled,"" said Mr Richburg, particularly after a series of large-scale protests culminating in the2014 pro-democracy demonstrations. China has also become emboldened by ""the fact it's become clear that outside powers, including Britain, are not going to make any trouble... it's got a pretty free hand,"" said Jonathan Fenby, a former editor of the South China Morning Post newspaper. Hong Kong: Twenty years on Young in Hong Kong Have Hong Kong's youth lost hope in the future? Growing up in post-handover Hong Kong But others disagree. Hong Kong's chief executive-elect Carrie Lamrecently told the BBCthat ""one country, two systems"" is as ""robust as ever"", and rule of law is ""better than pre-1997"". Ms Lam, a former civil servant, is herself an example of Beijing keeping its promises, according to politician Regina Ip. ""Without the reunification, a lot of us local administrative officers (like Ms Lam) would not have risen to the top.... To this extent, 'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' has been fulfilled,"" said Ms Ip. She believes the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland needs more time to evolve. ""'One country, two systems' is proving to be more complex and more challenging than originally expected,"" she said, but she hopes outstanding issues ""will be resolved in the coming years, sooner rather than later."" With the handover, ""many of us thought it would be only natural that young children were going to learn the (Chinese) national anthem, and learn to respect and love China in their classes,"" said anthropologist Gordon Mathews. Beijing had thought Hong Kong would embrace this return to the Chinese motherland after decades of foreign rule, said observers. Instead, Hong Kongers ended up developing a strong sense of local identity, one that is often defined by anti-mainland sentiment. Hong Kong journalist Ching Cheong recalled that in 1997 one worry was of ""mainlandisation"" where Hong Kong's values would be eroded, turning it into ""just another Chinese city"". ""But something that I didn't predict took place instead - the appearance of localism, or separatism,"" he said, referring to thepolitical movementwhere some advocate independence from the mainland. Local identity has only been strengthened with perceived attempts by Beijing to exert influence. Singer Anthony Wong says ""many people started caring about their own rights"" following attempts to introduce mainland-styled anti-subversion laws and national education in Hong Kong, which sparked large-scale protests and a ""political awakening"". But others like Hong Kong business magnate Allan Zeman believe that assimilation is inevitable. ""In the next 20 years, things are going to change... we have the bridge between Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai, we have the high-speed rail. These infrastructures will change Hong Kong and eventually the borders will become seamless."" ""Hong Kong will integrate more in China, whether we like it or not.""

DUP-Tory deal: Where will the money go?,"The Tory-DUP deal specifically mentions the York Street Interchange designed to ease traffic congestion in Belfast Northern Ireland will receive an extra Â£1bn over the next two years as part of the deal that will see the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs back Theresa May's minority government in Commons votes. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the ""wide-ranging"" pact was ""good for Northern Ireland and the UK"" -  so where will the money be spent? The heart ofthe financial packageis infrastructure spending - Â£400m of it over two years. That is a significant sum given that Northern Ireland's annual infrastructure budget is about Â£1bn. The deal specifically mentions the York Street Interchange, a project to ease congestion where three major roads meet in Belfast. It is expected to cost about Â£150m, so there should be plenty left over for other major projects. They could include a planned transport hub in the centre of Belfast and other major roads schemes like the completion of the A5 or A6. The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Williamson of the Conservative Party signed the confidence and supply deal in Downing Street On top of the Â£400m, there is a further Â£150m for ultra-fast broadband. This was a project which was already being scoped by the Department of the Economy before the collapse of Stormont. It is ultimately about improving the connectivity of rural businesses. Previous Stormont/Westminster deals have also included infrastructure but they typically involved allowing Stormont to borrow more. This time it is cold, hard, no-strings-attached cash. The money for health and education is more modest - given that a figure of Â£1bn for health alone was being mentioned during the negotiations. Health:A minimum of Â£250m, with Â£200m directed to health service transformation and Â£50m towards mental health provision. It will also receive Â£50m to ""address immediate pressures"" Education:Â£50m to ""address immediate pressures"" Infrastructure:Â£400m for projects including delivery theYork Street Interchange, plus Â£150m to provide ultra-fast broadband across Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland's capital budget is currently about Â£1bn per year. Deprivation:Â£100m over five years targeted to deprived communities VAT and Air Passenger Duty tax:Agreed to further consultation Corporation tax:Agreed to work towards devolving the tax to Stormont City deals and Enterprise Zones:Agreed to ""comprehensive and ambitious set"" of city deals and ""limited number"" of Enterprise Zones There is a minimum of Â£250m for health and and we can assume it will get about half the ""immediate pressures"" money, bringing it to a total of Â£300m. That will help ease the problems with waiting lists and give the system some breathing space ahead of a major reform programme. The ""immediate pressures"" money for education (about Â£50m) will go some way to easing a growing row with head teachers who have said they will not impose any more cuts. There is also Â£100m to be spent on deprived communities over five years. It will be interesting to see what the delivery mechanism for that money will be. This section of the agreement outlines how money will be spent on infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland Stormont's Social Investment Fund, which was also designed to help those communities, has been mired in controversy. Another part of this deal is to give flexibility to a previously agreed Â£500m fund for investment in shared education and housing projects. Stormont has struggled to spend this money, in its first year just Â£3m of a Â£50m allocation was spent. So its is possible that the new flexibility will allow all that money to go into general infrastructure spending.

'We didnât say we would part-leave the EU',"This video can not be played Nobody voted to âpart leaveâ the European Union, says Dr Liam Fox Out of the single market. Out of the customs union. Free of European Union laws. Immigration under Westminster control. If anyone was wondering whether the government might offer some substantial wriggle room on the Brexit negotiations to take account of the very different Parliamentary arithmetic following the general election, they have another think coming. Dr Liam Fox, the cabinet minister for international trade, has told the BBC that nobody voted to ""part-leave"" the European Union. The public either voted leave - which he takes to mean being out of the two substantive EU trading structures, the single market and the customs union - or remain, a vote to stay wholly in the union. As leave won, Dr Fox argues, it is now time for the Conservatives to get on with it and deliver, even without a majority in Parliament. ""We have to go full steam ahead and get the job done,"" he told me, saying he didn't recognise the terms ""hard"" (fully out) and ""soft"" (partially out, or a delayed out) Brexit. To coin a phrase, Brexit means Brexit. And anyone, including Conservative MPs, sympathetic to a different approach - and who may feel emboldened by the election result - should remember the referendum outcome last year. May sets out details of EU citizens plan Davis 'pretty sure' of free trade deal Brexit: All you need to know Dr Fox was speaking to me as part of a news special on BBC1 tonight at 8.30pm called Brexit: What's Next? With colleague and Europe Editor, Katya Adler, it is an attempt to try to unpack what the remarkably close general election result means for Britain and the EU's approach to Brexit. Dr Fox admits that getting the final Brexit deal through Parliament ""won't be easier"" after the Prime Minister lost her majority, but argues that Theresa May will stick to the position laid out before 8 June. Which is fully out of the single market and the customs union. There may be transitional arrangements as Britain moves to a new trading relationship with the EU, but Dr Fox refused to be drawn on how long that would be. ""How long is a piece of string?"" he answered, after I put to him the former business secretary Sir Vince Cable's suggestion that it could be a decade before any final deal is completed. I don't think that means Dr Fox is relaxed about how long any ""transition"" may take - he wants the deal done as quickly as possible. But he does believe a ""cliff edge"" departure should be avoided - which may take some time, although how long, for Dr Fox, is still unclear. ""The British public made a decision to leave,"" Dr Fox told me. ""We have to honour that decision to leave. ""We didn't say we would part-leave the European Union. ""[The public] gave us an instruction to do so and anybody who is a democrat needs to follow that instruction. ""If we want to get what the British public voted for in the referendum - control of our laws, control of our borders, control of our money - then we have to have an exit which takes us outside the single market and outside the customs union - although we will want to maximise our ability to trade inside that market."" He said that the option of ""no deal"" had to be left on the table. ""What are these people actually saying to us?"" Dr Fox said of those who say that ""no deal"" should be off the table. ""Are they saying that we should seriously go into a negotiation and saying whatever deal is offered we would accept that rather than walk away? ""I mean what sort of a negotiation actually would that be? ""It's effectively waving the white flag before the negotiations actually begin. ""It is not a sensible position for us to have ""But we don't want to get to no deal. ""We've set out the sort of deal that we want, a deal that's good for European citizens in the United Kingdom and British citizens in the European Union; that's good for British business, that enables us to trade maximally with the single market; that means there's as little friction at our borders as possible, giving Britain simultaneously the freedom to develop new trading agreements elsewhere."" Of course staying in the customs union - which would prevent Britain signing its own trade deals with countries outside the EU - would effectively make Dr Fox's department superfluous. Dr Fox may not like the distinction between ""hard"" and ""soft"", but Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, is judged to have a rather different approach (""soft"", if you like) to the type of deal Britain may strike with the EU,as I wrote last month. And, for this BBC1 news special, both Sir Vince, who is standing to be leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Sir Keir Starmer, Labour's shadow secretary for exiting the EU, said they might be willing to join forces with Mr Hammond to put ""jobs and prosperity"" at the heart of the negotiations. Dr Fox says that is a false division - and that the future prosperity of the UK is at the heart of his approach to Brexit. Britain can be strong economically outside the EU, he says, despite the myriad of warnings that leaving the single market and the customs union could damage the UK economy. ""If you are looking at a free trade agreement in a global context, this one with the European Union ought to be the simplest in the history of mankind because we're beginning from a completely tariff free basis and we're beginning with exactly the same laws and regulations as the rest of our European partners,"" Dr Fox said. ""And the only reason that we'll not get to this perfect arrangement would be if the politics of Europe got in the way. ""That would be a pity because it would just say that they were putting the politics of Europe above the prosperity of Europe."" And on the chance of Britain ever staying in the EU - as some EU leaders have rather wistfully suggested - Dr Fox has a straightforward answer. ""There's about as much chance of us staying in the European Union as of me finding the tooth fairy.""

What happens if you take too much MDMA?,"One man has died and four othersare seriously illin Manchester after taking what police say is a ""particularly potent"" form of MDMA. It's being branded as ""magic"" or ""pink champagne"" - and is sold as crystals. A man's been arrested on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs and has been released while inquiries continue. So what happens to your body when you take too much MDMA? We asked an addiction psychiatrist, Dr Adam Winstock, to explain. ""When MDMA gets absorbed into your blood stream, it hits your brain and causes it to release a whole bunch of chemicals,"" says Dr Winstock - who also runs the Global Drug Survey. ""Mainly serotonin but also things called noradrenalin and dopamine. This is what gives you the pleasurable effects. ""But if you take too much these same chemicals can cause your heart to start going too fast, and you can start overheating, sweating and gurning. ""And the euphoria and energy give way, so you're left feeling anxious, twitchy and agitated."" Some people can get through this simply by waiting it out, others need a trip to A&E. But anyone withthese symptoms,externalshould get immediate medical help - rigid muscles, shallow breathing, fast racing pulse, hyper-aggression/mania, seizure, foaming at the mouth and unconsciousness. Although Dr Winstock says the number of deaths in the UK where MDMA is implicated is on the rise, overall he describes it as a ""remarkably safe"" drug. ""It can kill people in the three main ways. Firstly, if you get too much serotonin, dopamine and noradrenalin you can get dehydrated and overheat. ""Once your body goes above about 42C your organs shut down and it can be very difficult to get people to recover from that point. ""The other thing is an abnormal heart rhythm. Too much stress on your heart can essentially give you a heart attack. ""Finally, some people die because they drink too much water. It's because MDMA also releases a hormone called SIADH which stops you peeing. So it's really weird - and it does mean that you need to be careful not to drink too much. ""But in general the risk is small and even people who end up in A&E will usually be back to normal in two or three days."" Because MDMA is a class A drug, possession can land you with up to seven years in prison. ""There's always a risk taking any drug and the only way to reduce that risk to zero is to not take it,"" says Dr Winstock. ""But if you are going to, the simple advice is when you're taking a new pill or powder for the first time, don't be daft, start with a test dose, lay off the booze and drink some water. ""Above all - I think the most important thing is to keep an eye on your mates. Because the person that's going to get you out of trouble more quickly than anyone else is your mate. ""So if you see someone who's overheating, they look like they're acting strangely, get them off to one side and take them to a first aid tent. That early intervention can make a big difference. ""Never be afraid of going to get help, it can save your mate."" MDMA is gettingpurer and more dangerousand more people are dying every year after taking pills. In 2015, 57 people died taking ecstasy, which is up from 13 in 2011. If you need help, there's more atBBC Advice.

Why Scottish tower blocks pass fire tests,"North Ayrshire Council ordered the removal of cladding from high-rise buildings after the fire in 1999 Following the Grenfell Tower, 60 high-rise buildings in 25 local authorities in Englandhave failed fire safety testsso far. But no local authority or housing association tower blocks in Scotland have been found to use the same kind of cladding. In Scotland, a change to building regulations in 2005 made it mandatory for builders to ensure that any external cladding ""inhibited"" fire spreading. The new regulations were introduced following a fatal fire in a Scottish tower block in 1999. On Friday 11 June 1999, a fireswept through a 14-storey block of flats,externalin North Ayrshire. The blaze started at about 12:45 and ended up destroying flats on nine floors of the Garnock Court block in Irvine. A 55-year-old man died in the fire and five other people, including a 15-month-old child, were injured. Witnesses reported that a vertical ribbon of cladding on one corner of the block was quickly ablaze and the fire reached the 12th floor within 10 minutes of it starting. Cladding firm ends sales for tower blocks Where have cladding fire tests failed? Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire The flats were owned by North Ayrshire Council, who ordered the removal of plastic cladding and PVC window frames as a precaution ""at whatever cost"" so they could be replaced with safer materials. The then local MP, Brian Donohoe, said at the time he believed there was something ""quite wrong"" in the use of the cladding. ""Afterwards I had surgeries that were full of people who wanted to get out of these flats as soon as was possible. That clearly was enough to drive me and drive the council,"" he told BBC Scotland on Monday. Mr Donohoe was also concerned that tower blocks across the UK which used similar cladding could be at risk, and the Labour MP pushed for a parliamentary inquiry into the extent of the problem. The review - by the select committee on environment, transport and regional affairs - was set up quickly andreported back in January 2000,external. The fire at Garnock Court spread to nine floors It said the evidence received during the inquiry suggested most external cladding being used in the UK did not pose ""a serious threat to life or property in the event of fire"". But the report added: ""Notwithstanding... we do not believe that it should take a serious fire in which many people are killed before all reasonable steps are taken towards minimising the risks."" Committee members recommended that local authorities and registered social landlords reviewed their existing building stock and the cladding systems used. MPs also said they wanted to make it clear that any addition to the outside of a building which had the ""potential to lessen its resistance to external fire spread"" should be subject to building regulations. Mr Donohoe, who was MP for Central Ayrshire until 2015, said the inquiry contributed to the tightening of the rules in Scotland, where building regulations were now devolved. ""Of course, the chief executive here [North Ayrshire Council] and also the MSPs by that time were in a position to, and did, enforce change in Scotland,"" he said. ""Which is why we we're in the position that we have no properties in Scotland that have been identified as being failures in that respect."" Mr Donohoe added that a series of UK governments had been ""remiss in their responsibilities and their duties"" to people who lived in high-rise properties in England. ""[The problem] was indentified but nothing was being done. It's really a disaster that has been created as a consequence of inaction of all government and I blame that as being the main reason why we had that fire at Grenfell."" In the Scottish Parliament last week, Communities Secretary Angela Constance alsocited the Irvine fire directly,externalas the reason why cladding used on high-rise buildings in Scotland must use materials and design which resist the spread of fire. Responding to a question from Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, she said: ""Building standards regulations are reviewed regularly. ""In my discussions with building standards professionals in the Scottish government, they were able to recount to me the responses that they have made over a number of years to specific events and specific fires. ""For example, when there was a tragic fire in Irvine in 1999, that led to a revisiting of regulations, which meant that all cladding that was used in high-rise dwellings had to be non-combustible."" The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 introduced the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004which came into force,externalon 1 May 2005. It contains the mandatory regulation: ""Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the event of an outbreak of fire within the building, or from an external source, the spread of fire on the external walls of the building is inhibited."" The Scottish governmentsaid on Fridaythat no local authority or housing association high-rises in Scotland used the cladding installed on Grenfell Tower. But the safety of Scotland's tower blocks will be examined by a Holyrood committee as part of the government's investigation into high-rise safety and building standards.

Is Holland & Barrett a future star?,"Can Holland & Barrett offer more than just bargains at the till? The Russian billionaire buying health food chain Holland & Barrett, said he was looking for future stars of the High Street to invest in. Does the protein shake-to-dried fruit store really fit that bill? Are you one of those people who check your sleep app before you even throw back the covers in the morning? Do you chuck some chia seeds and goji berries into a blender, and run through a mindfulness routine until it's ready? If so, you're part of the booming trend for ""wellness"" that by rights ought to be making Holland &  Barrett a supernova of the High Street already. It should have been easy, given our almost insatiable appetite for avoiding things (gluten, parabens, nuts) as well as adding things (fibre, vitamin D, protein) for the sake of our health. But Holland & Barrett, rather than riding the well-being wave, has been coasting, say observers. When you walk into a Holland & Barrett shop the ubiquitous ""buy one get one half price"" offers can give the impression of a cut-price supermarket. ""Holland and Barrett has lost its true meaning outside offers and that's not a healthy strategy,"" says Kate Hardcastle, consumer expert at retail consultancy, Insight With Passion. In some branches it can feel as though not much has changed since the chain was first founded in 1870. ""They are this really antiquated retailer on the High Street. They're fuddy-duddy,"" says Ms Hardcastle. ""The impression is, it's a till point, without engagement, where you just select and purchase. ""And that's not where consumers buying into this trend are at."" Turmeric capsules Omega 3 Fish Oil Apple Cider Vinegar Almonds Cod Liver Oil ""They don't strike me as a superstar of the High Street at all,"" says independent retail analyst Richard Hyman. ""That's not to say I don't think it's a decent solid-ish company"" (although he thinks the new owners are paying an ""extraordinarily generous price"" for it). The difficulty is that consumers generally pick up on health and well-being trends online, and it only takes a click or two to then order your bottle of skin-smoothing snail gel or bag of super seaweed peanuts and have them delivered to your door. In which case it is hard to see what will draw people into a High Street store. ""In very simple terms you have to provide something in a face-to-face environment that can't be replicated online or you won't have a physical business left,"" says Mr Hyman. What you need is something ""aspirational, inspirational or added-value service-orientated with lots of theatre,"" he says. Five new Holland & Barrett ""More"" stores that have opened in recent years suggest the chain has cottoned on to the need for change - and may give an inkling of the kind of potential its new owner sees in it. These stores are making shopping more of an experience, offering vegan nail bars and on-the-go protein shake stations, alongside the chance to have health checks including measuring your Body Mass Index, hydration and fat percentage. Even some smaller branches now offer fruit, seed and nut pick 'n' mix, ""make your own body scrubs"" stations, and oil and vinegar bars. But they'll need to take that modernising effort further, says Kate Hardcastle, if they want to fit snugly into the well-being trend. ""I do see them as a really big potential player, but they need to be investing more in becoming appealing to today's customers. ""If you think of brands out there: from Whole Foods to Nike, there's a significant investment in relationship with their customers"". She points to Boots, which has built up trust in its healthcare advice by offering flu vaccinations and pharmacists giving in-store advice. ""Where you have specialisms in stores, they work very well - from baristas making coffee through to make-up counter demonstrations with make-up artists,"" she says. And she believes there's potentially a Holland & Barrett-shaped hole in the wellness market for just that kind of retail-to-service chain. ""In that industry, with the well-being coaches, and lifestyle and diet gurus, someone needs to pull this all together. ""That's the direction I'd go if I were taking them to superstar retailer,"" she says, pointing out the chain does have a strong brand presence that could help make that happen. ""I'd make it cut through,"" she says. ""It's sometimes who shouts the loudest.""

'I had to crowdfund for my wheelchair',"Hannah Barham-Brown was studying at medical school when she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome two years ago. The inherited condition leaves her joints weak and susceptible to dislocation. It means she has to rely on a wheelchair a lot of the time. But when she was given the diagnosis she quickly realised the NHS was not going to be there for her. She was offered a standard NHS-issue wheelchair - but at 20kg (3st 2lb) it would have been too heavy for her and potentially dangerous, given her condition. She began to think her dreams of becoming a medic were over. ""I didn't even think I would get through medical school,"" she says. A friend suggested she try to raise the money herself. The NHS offered her Â£140 towards the costs, but modern lightweight wheelchairs can set you back thousands of pounds. Ms Barham-Brown, 29, who is working across different hospitals in south London as part of her first year of being a junior doctor, took to crowdfunding and within 24 hours had raised enough to buy a fairly basic one for just over Â£2,000. ""Without it I wouldn't have been able to work as a doctor,"" she says. ""The standard one is just too heavy and has a wide turning circle. ""It just would not have been possible to get around the wards. ""Now, I'm the quickest doctor in the hospital - they're always sending me to get the bloods."" The wheelchair also allows her to play sport - she races and plays wheelchair basketball. ""It is so short-sighted not to fund wheelchairs that people need,"" she says. ""It keeps them active and working. Without them people become isolated, but unfortunately the cuts in the health service mean that is not possible."" Ms Barham-Brown is not the only person to have faced such difficulties. She says she is increasingly hearing of people resorting to such tactics to get the equipment they need. ""More and more I'm seeing pleas on social media from people begging for support to buy wheelchairs, not only chairs like this - lightweight self-propelling chairs - but electric chairs,"" she says. ""The guidelines for getting chairs now are so strict, wheelchair services across the country are being privatised and it's just getting harder and harder to get access.""

22m to lose health cover in Senate bill,"A number of Republican senators have expressed reservations about the party's plan Some 22 million Americans could lose their health insurance over the next decade under a Senate bill to replace Obamacare, a congressional report says. However, the bill would reduce the budget deficit, the non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office said. Similar legislation passed by the House was also said to leave millions uninsured. Some Republicans have voiced reservations about the plan. But the White House disputed the CBO's figures. Responding to Monday's report, it said: ""The CBO has consistently proven it cannot accurately predict how healthcare legislation will impact insurance coverage."" The report is a review of draft legislation unveiled by the Republican party last week. It is unlikely to be approved by Democrats, who see the proposals as cruel and unfair. The CBO said that 15 million more people would be uninsured by 2018 under the proposed legislation than under current law, largely because the penalty for not having insurance would be eliminated. Donald Trump called the House healthcare bill that resulted in 23 million additional uninsured by 2026 ""mean"". How might he describe a Senate version that only reduces those numbers to 22 million? Less affluent Americans currently on government-managed Medicaid insurance, many of whom supported the president, will see a 26% reduction in their programmes funding over the next decade, resulting in fewer covered and skimpier benefits. That is a tough pill for moderate Republicans, who will be under enormous pressure from their constituents to vote against the bill. There is some good news in the CBO report, of course. Thanks to the cuts, the Senate measure would reduce the budget deficit by a total of $321bn (Â£252bn) in 2017-2026 - even with Obama-era tax cuts rolled back. The personal health insurance marketplace is estimated to remain largely stable, and premiums will go down (after a spike next year). The bottom line, however, is that the CBO report is a blow to the Senate bill's chances of success. House Republicans weathered a similar beating and rallied to pass their version, so it is much too early to write a political epitaph. That assumes, of course, that their efforts are not undermined by the man in the Oval Office. This video can not be played Trump's battles with Obamacare - in his own words President Donald Trump's Republican party is struggling to secure the 50 votes it needs to get its bill through the Senate when it comes to the floor. What's wrong with Obamacare? 'Obamacare saved my life' The Republican senator for Maine, Susan Collins, has said she will vote against it, joining colleagues Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee and Rand Paul who on Thursday said they were ""not ready to vote for this bill"", but were ""open to negotiation"". Their concerns about the measure include its rollback of the expansion of Medicaid, the public health programme for the poor and disabled. Mr Johnson said on Sunday there was ""no way"" there should be a vote on the legislation this week. The Senate bill would slash taxes for the wealthy offering less help for working families to buy medical insurance. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi earlier warned that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Americans would die if congressional Republicans pass their healthcare legislation. Republicans have rejected the notion that anyone will die as a result of their healthcare plan. Is Trump's 'Obamacare nightmare' over? Video, 00:01:58Is Trump's 'Obamacare nightmare' over?

"I am not a bad guy, says Diouf","El Hadji Diouf now lives and works in his native Senegal El Hadji Diouf is a hero in Senegal. Everywhere he goes, he is mobbed by fans both young and old. His countrymen are still grateful for the stellar role he played during the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. But in England, he is remembered more for his controversial antics than for his football talent. It is a trait that followed him in the English league clubs he played for - from Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers to Bolton Wanderers, with a spell for Rangers in Scotland as well. Diouf was aggressive, spat at opponents and confronted match officials as well as opponents. But now in his retirement, he is telling his story. ""I am a lion, I am a bad loser and it's not wrong to be a bad loser,"" said Diouf of his often combative mood during his playing days. This video can not be played El Hadji Diouf: I'm fit, sexy and helping Senegal ""I have got character and I want people to respect me."" Diouf, who has moved back to the Senegalese capital Dakar, says he was often misunderstood during his playing days in England. He said: ""I am an easy target. It's easy to talk about El Hadji Diouf and I let them talk but I know in my heart I am a good guy. My family know, my population knows, my continent knows I am a good guy and that's the best thing. The rest is not my problem."" Despite this defence, Diouf admits he has done some bad things. When asked why, for example, he used to spit at opponents, he said: ""Maybe they used to tell me something I didn't want to hear. I did that, I paid and now it's finished."" The Senegalese legend had a drawn-out row with former Liverpool team-mates such as Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard. Steven Gerrard and Diouf were Liverpool team-mates from 2002 to 2004 Even today, Diouf and Gerrard continue their feudthrough the media.,externalSo what exactly is the problem? ""I have no problem with him,"" Diouf said. ""He [Gerrard] is a strong character and I am a strong character. ""'Stevie G' was a very good player. People like him in Liverpool but he never did anything for his country. I am Mr El Hadji Diouf, Mr Senegal but he is Mr Liverpool and Senegal is bigger than Liverpool and he has to know that."" Diouf is working in Senegal as a government goodwill ambassador. He is President Macky Sall's adviser on sport as well as running his own sports newspaper business in Dakar - and is often mobbed by young people when he visits his gym in the city. ""My life is about sport but the government cannot do everything alone, they need help from people like me,"" Diouf said. ""The president believes in me and that's why when I finished playing football, he called me and told me he wants me to help because the young generation believe in me. I am an example to them."" President Macky Sall employs Diouf as a sports adviser Asked if he would consider a role in politics, Diouf said he was concentrating on helping to develop his country - but could not rule out entering politics in future. He said: ""I am interested because we have to make things change. People like me can make things change. ""We have a country to build, a continent to build and why not be involved in politics tomorrow?"" The 2002 World Cup gave El Hadj Diouf (centre) his greatest sense of achievement Twice presented with the African Footballer of the Year award by the Confederation of African football (Caf), Diouf was part of the Senegal side which reached the last eight at the 2002 World Cup, beating defending champions France along the way. He describes that period as the greatest achievement of his career - putting it on a par with Diego Maradona's World Cup-winning achievements with Argentina. ""We put Senegal on the world map,"" he said. ""Before the World Cup nobody knew Senegal, but after the World Cup everybody wanted to know where Senegal was. ""What Maradona did for his country is what I did for Senegal. I was one of the biggest men at the 2002 World Cup. ""We were colonised by France. Most of the businesses are run by French people here and to beat them was a big thing for us. ""Before the game, they used to say, 'The reserve team is going to play against the first team' - because most of the players used to play in the French league. ""I used to be at Lens, Salif Diao [was at Sedan], Khalilou Fadiga [was at Auxerre], most of the players played in the French league but we used to say: 'Be careful before you kill the lion.'"" Diouf says he would like to do more to help develop football on the African continent, but feels structural changes need to take place. ""Fifa has changed and now it's time for African football federations to change too,"" he said. This is the first in this week's Where Are They Now? series by Stanley Kwenda, looking at what some of Africa's ex-football stars are doing after hanging up their boots. He will also speak to Salif Diao, Peter Ndlovu, Benni McCarthy and Nwankwo Kanu.

May sets out details of EU citizens plan,"This video can not be played Theresa May sets out 'offer' on EU citizens' rights Theresa May has said she wants EU citizens living in the UK to stay after Brexit as she announced plans designed to put their ""anxiety to rest"". All EU nationals lawfully resident for at least five years will be able to apply for ""settled status"" and be able to bring over spouses and children. Those who come after an as-yet-unagreed date will have two years to ""regularise their status"" but with no guarantees. Jeremy Corbyn said the offer was ""not generous"" and ""too little, too late"". Labour said the UK should have made a unilateral guarantee of security to EU citizens in the aftermath of last year's Brexit vote. The EU's chief negotiator said the proposals did not go far enough. A 15-page document,externaloutlining the detail of the UK's offer to EU citizens was published as Theresa May briefed MPs on the outcome of Friday's EU summit - at which she first set out her plans. What is UK offering EU citizens? Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? She told the Commons that she wanted to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland - who she said were an ""integral part of the economic and cultural fabric"" of the UK. But she said any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019. The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be ""no expectation"" they will be granted permanent residence A period of ""blanket residence permission"" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held ""comprehensive sickness insurance"" The prime minister told MPs that those granted settled status, equivalent to having indefinite leave to remain, would be ""treated as if they were UK citizens for healthcare, benefits and pensions"". Mrs May said the process of application would be simplified and a ""light touch"" approach adopted. The existing application process for permanent residency, which involves filling out a 85-page form, has been widely criticised. ""Under these plans, no EU citizen currently in the UK lawfully will be asked to leave at the point the UK leaves the EU,"" Mrs May said. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Officials anticipate that the process of administering ""settled status"" will be a huge challenge, with some 3.2 million potential applications. Those EU nationals who've been assigned residency cards already will have to apply again under the new system, though the process for them is expected to be ""streamlined"". It's thought applications for settled status will start to be processed from mid-2018. Officials say they intend to put in place a new, online, simplified system - but say they are used to dealing with large volumes of applications - 2.5 million visas each year and seven million passports.  Read Danny's blog Mrs May said spouses, children and other family members currently living overseas would be able to come to the UK and apply for settled status on the same basis as their partners and relatives. Pressed by several Labour MPs, she suggested there would be no income barriers for anyone whose relatives have been in the UK for more than five years while, for others, existing rules applying to the foreign dependents of British citizens would be in force in future. ""There will be no extra requirements,"" she said. ""We are not talking about splitting up families."" She also insisted the UK should police the new rules rather than the European Court of Justice. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn attacks government 'offer' to EU citizens But Mr Corbyn said the question of citizens' rights should have been dealt with in isolation rather than being dragged into the ""delicate and complex"" matrix of trade and other Brexit-related issues now being discussed. ""The truth is it is too little, too late. That could have been done and should have been done a year ago when Labour put that very proposal to the House of Commons. This isn't a generous offer. This is confirmation the government is prepared to use people as bargaining chips."" The SNP's Ian Blackford said there were still ""more questions than answers"" about how EU citizens living in Scotland would be affected. And the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said it could not understand why those who already had permanent residence were being asked to re-apply to obtain the new status. ""These are people who have already proven their right to be here to the government's satisfaction under a very stringent process,"" said its chief executive Saira Grant. ""It is astonishing that the government wants to take on the expense and administrative hassle of reprocessing all of those applications under a new scheme."" Reacting on Twitter, Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said his goal was the same level of protection that citizens currently have under EU law. He added: ""More ambition, clarity and guarantees needed than in today's UK position."" Another key EU figure, Guy Verhofstadt, who is negotiating on behalf of the European Parliament, warned that any changes to free movement laws before the UK has left would break EU law.

Victor Wanyama Street goes nowhere,"Wanyama posted a photo on his Instagram account and thanked Tanzanians Tottenham and Kenyan midfielder Victor Wanyama was honoured in Tanzania on Saturday by having a street named after him in Dar es Salaam. But the gesture looks to have been short-lived as local websites showeda picture of the street sign being taken away,externalthe following day. A statement from the local Ubungo council said procedures to rename a street had not been observed. There has been no reaction so far from Wanyama, who turned 26 on Sunday. The footballer was in Tanzania on holiday and had attended a local tournament in the suburb of Ubungo. Tottenham signed Wanyamafrom Southampton last July for $11m on a five-year deal. BBC Africa football correspondent Stanley Kwenda says that Wanyama is the poster boy of East African football, and that in the absence of a strong national football team from the region he is the face of the game there.

Al-Qaeda hostage released after six years,"Johan Gustafsson is said to be ""happy"" and ""overwhelmed"" following his release Hostage Johan Gustafsson, held by al-Qaeda in Mali since 2011, has been freed, the Swedish government says. Mr Gustafsson, 42, is being flown back to Sweden from Africa, Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot WallstrÃ¶msaid in a statement,externalon Monday. He was seized by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) along with two other men, one of whom was freed in a dawn raid in 2015. Ms WallstrÃ¶m said Mr Gustafsson was ""in good spirits"",local media report,external. ""It is with great pleasure that I can announce that Johan Gustafsson has been released,"" Ms WallstrÃ¶m added. She said that the Swede's release was thanks to ""extensive efforts"" and co-operation between the Swedish foreign ministry, police and ""foreign authorities"". Ms WallstrÃ¶m said she had spoken with Mr Gustafsson, who she described as being ""happy"" and ""overwhelmed"" by Monday's events. ""I cannot say more at the current time,"" she added. Sweden's former Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said that Mr Gustafsson's kidnapping weighed heavily on his mind during his time in the role, which ended in 2014. He tweeted on Monday: ""Extremely gratifying that Johan Gustafsson is free. No single case concerned me more as foreign minister."" The French military launched an operation against AQIM in January 2013 Mr Gustafsson was kidnapped along with South African Stephen McGown and Dutchman Sjaak Rijke.

Trump travel ban injunction partly lifted,"The original ban in January provoked mass protests at American airports US President Donald Trump has welcomed a Supreme Court ruling allowing his travel ban to be partly reinstated as a ""victory for our national security"". America's highest court also granted a White House request allowing part of its refugee ban to go into effect. The justices said they would consider in October whether the president's policy should be upheld or struck down. Mr Trump seeks to place a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120-day ban on refugees. The president welcomed the ruling's qualified authorisation to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, which he described as ""terror-prone countries"". ""As president, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm,"" he added. Mr Trump has already said the ban would take effect within 72 hours of court approval. The Supreme Court saidin Monday's decision,external: ""In practical terms, this means that [the executive order] may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. ""All other foreign nationals are subject to the provisions of [the executive order]."" The ruling also said it would permit a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the US to go into effect, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who do not have any ""bona fide relationship"" with an American individual or entity. Mark this down as a win for Donald Trump. The path to entry into the US for immigrants and refugees from the affected nations, if they don't have existing ties to the US - either through family, schools or employment - just became considerably harder. The decision marks a reaffirmation of the sweeping powers the president has traditionally been granted by the courts in areas of national security. There was fear in some quarters that the administration's ham-fisted implementation of its immigration policy could do lasting damage to the president's prerogatives. That appears not to be the case. The government, the justices write, has a ""compelling need to provide for the nation's security"". That includes being able to close the borders based on an evaluation of the potential of foreign threats - at least for now. The Supreme Court justices will fully consider the arguments on both sides next autumn. Of course, by that time it may not matter. The administration has three months to conduct its ""executive review"" of immigration policy and devise new guidelines. In the meantime, the gates to America just got a bit smaller. Big win for Trump and his travel ban The ruling clarifies that those who would be deemed to have such a relationship would include a foreign national who wishes to enter the US to live with or visit a family member, a student at an American university, an employee of a US company, or a lecturer invited to address an American audience. This would not apply, it said, to ""someone who enters into a relationship simply to avoid [the executive order]. ""For example, a non-profit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion."" Five questions on the revised travel ban This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' Yes. Three of the court's conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - wrote that they would have allowed the travel ban to go into full effect. Justice Thomas said the government's interest in preserving national security outweighs any hardship to people denied entry into the country. Mr Trump restored a 5-4 conservative majority to the Supreme Court when his nominee, Justice Gorsuch, joined its bench in April. There are five Republican appointees on the court and four Democratic appointees. Attorney General Jeff Sessions says ""the threat to our national security is real and becoming increasingly dangerous"". He has welcomed the decision, saying it is ""an important step towards restoring the separation of powers between the branches of the federal government."" Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project, says that it remains to be decided if the ban is constitutional, but that the courts which have looked at the measure have been against it: ""[But] in practical terms most of the people who stood to be affected by the ban will still be allowed to come in."" David Miliband, president of theInternational Rescue Committee (IRC),,externalhas urged the government to start a review of its vetting process. ""The court's decision threatens damage to vulnerable people waiting to come to the US: people with urgent medical conditions blocked, innocent people left adrift, all of whom have been extensively vetted."" The US president insisted his ban was necessary for national security amid a slew of terrorist attacks in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin and other cities. However, critics called the policy un-American and Islamophobic, and the lower courts broadly seemed to agree. The president's policy was left in limbo after it was struck down by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland days following its issuance on 6 March. The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said in May the ban was ""rooted in religious animus"" toward Muslims. The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in June: ""National security is not a 'talismanic incantation' that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power."" A Yemeni woman hugs her mother at a Virginia airport in February after courts granted a temporary stay on President Trump's order The original ban, released on 27 January, provoked mass protests at American airports. It included Iraq among nations whose travellers would be barred from the US, and imposed a full ban on refugees from Syria. The president issued a revised version with a narrower scope on 6 March to overcome some of the legal problems. But Mr Trump was unhappy about having to do so, calling it a ""watered down, politically correct"" version of the first one. Muslims on Trump ban: I don't belong here.

Majorca shark 'more exciting than scary',"This video can not be played Blue shark spotted on holiday resort in Majorca A British holidaymaker who saw a blue shark swimming in shallow waters while he was staying in Majorca says he was ""more excited than scared"". Tim Prottey-Jones said his wife Angela was getting into the sea at Illetas beach on the Spanish island on Saturday when the shark appeared. It swam past ""calmly, perhaps eerily calmly"", but was ""an amazing sight"". Mr Prottey-Jones, from London, said people rushed out of the sea but got back in again some 25 minutes later. ""We had been on the beach all morning because it was extremely hot and we wanted to leave it as long as possible to enter the water and cool off."" The 37-year-old said his wife was walking down into the water when he noticed everyone coming out of it in a rush to leave. ""I joked with Angela, 'It's because you're going in everyone's coming out'. That's when I saw this fin swim past in the shallow water very near to where everyone was standing, near where the water was,"" Mr Prottey-Jones said. ""The shark swam straight past us very calmly - eerily calm. It was an amazing sight because you just don't expect to see this beautiful animal."" The couple spotted the shark while trying to cool off at Illetas beach Despite thinking the fish could have been between 6ft and 8ft long (1.8-2.4 metres), Mr Prottey-Jones said he did not feel scared. He shouted and pointed to Mrs Prottey-Jones to alert her and threw her his phone to capture the moment. ""I was more excited than scared because I'd never seen anything like it. It was a surreal experience - I want to see it again."" Asked how others on the beach reacted, he said there was ""a little bit of hysteria but it wasn't manic screaming"". He added: ""Parents with young children in the water were most recognisably worried by it. Having little kids in there was probably the biggest worry."" But Mr Prottey-Jones said that, with no further sign of the shark, it was less than half-an-hour before holidaymakers were venturing back into the sea. He said the shark ""didn't feel threatening"" but admitted that, if it had moved in an aggressive way, then it would have been different. It was laterreported,externalthe shark had been captured and killed. Ali Hood, director of conservation at the Shark Trust, said a hook was found embedded in the fish's mouth by local aquarium staff. She explained this was likely to have affected the shark's ""ability to hunt and feed effectively, and may explain its uncharacteristic behaviour, swimming so close in to shore"". They are found in tropical waters worldwide from the eastern Atlantic Ocean including Norway to South Africa, and in the Mediterranean as well as the western Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. But the shark is native to the Mediterranean. They can grow to a maximum size of 383cm (12.5ft). It is thought to be the most heavily fished shark being mainly taken as a bycatch with their fins prized in Asia. Source: Shark Trust,external According tothe International Shark Attack File,externalcompiled by the University of Florida's museum of natural history, blue sharks have been responsible for 13 shark attacks since 1580, four of which were fatal. That compares with 314 for great white sharks, of which 80 were fatal.

How Harry Potter enchanted the world,"This video can not be played What JK Rowling said about first Harry Potter book in 1997 Can you believe it's 20 years since the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone? Joanne Rowling, as she was known then, dreamed up the story of the bespectacled boy wizard on a train trip between London and Manchester. She finished the manuscript in 1995, writing much of it in cafes in Edinburgh while her baby from her first marriage slept in a pram. After many rejections, the manuscript was eventually picked up by Bloomsbury. The first hardback print run, which came out on 26 June 1997, was just 500 copies. Then something magic happened. That first book - and the six that followed - went on to sell more than 450 million copies around the world. How to unlock Harry Potter Easter eggs on social media Fans mark 20 years of Harry Potter on social media Here's a look at the many ways the Harry Potter phenomenon has cast a spell on the cultural landscape over two decades. The Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies Okay, so books were around for a long time before Harry Potter. But JK Rowling turned book consumption, especially for children, into something close to addiction. You want proof? The UK release of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in 1999 was timed at 3.45pm to prevent children in England and Wales from skipping school to get their copy. The later books got HUGE but it didn't stop kids devouring them. Grown-ups got hooked too, with the books being released in adult-friendly covers. The book releases themselves became headline news: when the fourth book Goblet of Fire came out in 2000, booksellers around the world got together to coordinate the first ever global midnight launch. When Rowling received an honorary degree at St Andrews University that same year, the Scottish institution said she had proved that children's books ""are still capable of capturing and enchanting an immense audience, irrespective of the competing attractions of television, Nintendo, Gameboy and Pokemon"". Harry Potter fans at the premiere of the final film, the Deathly Hallows Part 2 The Harry Potter books are credited with opening the way to a whole swathe load of young adult fantasy fiction. Lots of books were released in the hope they would be ""the next Harry Potter"", such as Artemis Fowl, The Spiderwick Chronicles and A Series of Unfortunate Events. Would we have had blockbuster series like Twilight and The Hunger Games novels had not Potter paved the way? And let's not forget fan fiction. The internet is thrumming with tens of thousands of unofficial spin-off stories about life at Hogwarts, The Dursleys and what the Weasley twins get up to at parties. A warning to the curious: some are NSFW. For a generation of kids brought up on Thomas the Tank Engine and The Polar Express, there was suddenly a shiny new steam train in the engine shed. Yes, the Hogwarts Express. No trip to King's Cross Station in London is complete without a selfie onPlatform Nine and Three-Quarters,external. The Royal Mail produced special stamps based on the book covers Most words have to be around for 10 years before they will be considered for the Oxford English Dictionary, but JK Rowling's word ""muggle"" - which made its debut in Philosopher's Stone - was an exception. It was added to the OED in less than half the usual time, appearing in 2002 as ""a person who lacks a particular skill or skills, or who is regarded as inferior in some way"". In the world of Harry Potter, a muggle is a person without magical powers. We suspect that Crumple-Horned Snorkack - an elusive magical creature in Sweden - may take longer to make it into the muggle lexicon. This video can not be played Watch Quidditch being played at the world cup In the books, Quidditch is a magical sport played on flying broomsticks, and involves bludgers, quaffles and a golden snitch - a small ball with wings. In the real world, Quidditch is a non-magical sport played on broomsticks, and involves bludgers, quaffles and a golden snitch - a person in a yellow t-shirt with a Velcro tail attached to their shorts. It started in the US around 2005 and has become a global sport with its own governing body. The Quidditch World Cup takes place annually and waswon last year by Australia. Young stars: Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint Until recently, the eight Harry Potter films were the largest-grossing film franchise in history, having brought in a whopping $7.7bn (Â£6.1bn) worldwide. The first Harry Potter film - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (it was known as the Sorcerer's Stone in North America) - was released in November 2001. As well as breaking box office records faster than a trip on the Knight Bus, it also introduced the young Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint to the world. The final film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011) is the highest grossing of all the Potter films at $1.34bn. It's theeighth-highest grossing film of all time,external. The franchise - now known as JK Rowling's Wizarding World - has continued with the spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016). And there's plenty more to come. Rowling has said she has planned scripts for a total offive Fantastic Beasts films. Noma Dumezweni (Hermione Granger), Jamie Parker (Harry) and Paul Thornley (Ron Weasley) in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opened in London in 2016 to the same kind of Pottermania that surrounded the release of the books and films. Some 1,500 fansat the very first performance, many dressed as witches and wizards, gasped at the various plot revelations and stage illusions. The two-part play begins with Harry, Ron and Hermione in their mid-30s as their own children head off to Hogwarts school. It even had critics reaching for superlatives. One wrote: ""British theatre hasn't known anything like it for decades and I haven't seen anything directly comparable in all my reviewing days."" The play won arecord-breaking nine prizesat this year's Olivier Awards. Cursed Child will be opening on Broadway in New York in 2018 and JK Rowling has said she would like it to be seen widely around the world. Is anyone worse than Voldemort? Millions of people reaching young adulthood have never known a world without Harry Potter. Many who've grown up with the books can now get regular doses of JK Rowling via social media - she's got an army of almost 11m followers. When Donald Trump was compared with Lord Voldemort last year, Rowlingtweeted,external: ""How horrible.  Voldemort was nowhere near as bad."" She later mocked Twitter users who threatened to burn her books. One response read: ""Guess it's true what they say: you can lead a girl to books about the rise and fall of an autocrat, but you still can't make her think."" Twenty years on from that first book, it looks like no-one's going to be saying ""Avada Kedavra"" to Harry Potter anytime soon.

Recap: DUP deal and EU citizens,"DUP agree deal to back Conservative government Theresa May sets out more detail on EU citizens' rights Labour's McDonnell: Grenfell victims 'murdered by political decisions' MPs to continue debate on Queen's Speech Aiden James and Alex Hunt Northern Ireland's devolved government will get access to an extra Â£1bn as part of the agreement. The PM outlines plans designed to address the ""anxiety"" of EU citizens about their status after Brexit. The deal will see the DUP support Theresa May in Parliament and Â£1bn extra cash for Northern Ireland. Here's a recap of the day's major events:  Analysis:  There was also movement on the UK's plans for EU citizens:  You can catch-up with, and watch live, proceedings in Parliament including the statement currently under way in the House of Commons on the Grenfell Tower tragedy withour BBC Parliament colleagues' live coverage.  EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament Lords leader Baroness Evans tells peers the government has ""come out early"" with its proposal on EU citizens' rights, which indicates its ""seriousness"" about finding a solution. She says the cut-off date will be ""a matter for negotiation"" and emphasises it is an ""early priority for negotiations"". Theresa May has set out the government's ""offer"" to EU citizens in the UK, telling Parliament that the government wants them to stay. The prime minister said no EU citizen would have to leave when the UK exits the EU. The government has proposed giving those with five years' continuous residence, at a cut-off date to be determined by negotiations, a ""settled status"". This video can not be played EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament The leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, Lord Newby, says it's to be ""regretted"" that it has taken so long to set out the government's intentions for EU citizens and ""many questions are still unanswered"". He presses for details of a cut-off point after which citizens will not be automatically entitled to apply for residency, and asks about the possibility of ID cards. House of CommonsParliament Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts says that whilst the prime minister is bribing the DUP to ""stitch up the seams of this threadbare administration"", the government continues to neglect the people of Wales and treat them like third class citizens ""in this so-called family of equals"". If the government can hand out Â£1bn to Northern Ireland in a time of austerity, she says, then ""where is the Â£1.7bn that is now so evidently our right?"" Mr Green replies that under the new funding formula, public spending in Wales is now Â£120 per head for every Â£100 per head in England. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Ed Davey has suggested the plans for EU citizens almost amounts to an ID card scheme. âI have written to the Home Secretary to establish whether this indeed is ID
cards by the backdoor and whether EU nationals will now be required to carry
them on their person at all times. If so have ministers worked out the
practicalities of such a scheme, as well as the cost? The government also needs
to explain how an ID card system works when only a small proportion of the
population will be required to carry them.â EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament Responding to the statement on the proposed deal for EU citizens, Labour's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon tells peers she found David Davis' assurances on how borders would be enforced ""unconvincing"". She tells peers other EU leaders ""don't share"" the prime minister's impression of ""a positive response"" to her proposals on EU citizens' rights. She calls it ""grossly inefficient and disrespectful"" that those who have already applied for residency will now have to apply under the new system. She refers to a ""twilight zone"" of uncertainty for EU citizens over their rights to work and travel. ""It
has taken a full year for the Prime Minister to come up with a half-baked
plan that still leaves in limbo millions of European nationals who have made
their home here. This uncertainty is the result of a dysfunctional Government
that is not acting in the nationâs best interests.  âThe
Government should confirm immediately that all EU citizens in the UK by the
time we leave can stay indefinitely - this needs to be as simple and
comprehensive a process as possible. This will enable UK nationals living in
the EU to also have their futures made certain.""   House of CommonsParliament The DUP's chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is ""a remarkable day"" when the Labour Party criticise investment in schools, roads, housing, jobs as dangerous to the peace process - adding ""it is bonkers to suggest so"". He also adds that Labour frontbenchers should rethink their past comments in support of the IRA and the effect it could have on young people who may be thinking to take up arms in the future. Mr Green replies that it is clear that anything that aids investment for disadvantaged communities will provide a more positive political atmosphere in Northern Ireland. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Tracy Brabin thanks the Speaker for hosting family day in the House of Commons at the weekend, and points MPs towards the new plaque for her predecessor Jo Coxwhich was put up in the Commons chamber by her children.

House of CommonsParliament The DUP's Westminster Leader Nigel Dodds rises to praise a ""good agreement for the UK and a good agreement for all the people of Northern Ireland"" - particularly in mental health and hard to reach areas. He says that his party commits to transparency and that he hopes to one day see published the correspondence from 2010 with the Labour frontbench, and from 2015 with both Labour and the SNP - causing much delight on the Tory benches. The ""faux outrage"", he says that has been heard, ""is hypocrisy of the highest order"". The DUP looks forward to working with government for the next five years, he says - to deliver Brexit, to strengthen the Union and to deliver security. Mr Green responds that it has been ""a life enhancing experience"" and that the government welcome the party's support to strengthen the union and the economy. Stephen Martin, Director General of the Institute of
Directors, said:  âEmployers will welcome the constructive clarity of intent
offered today and businesses look forward to the UK and EU finally getting down
to concrete discussions. âAn aim is obviously not the same thing as a guarantee. Even
today, many of the important details are absent, including information on the
registration process for EU citizens and when the cut-off date will be. More
fundamentally, employers still donât know what will happen to their EU staff if
no deal is reached, questions remain as regards whether or what salary
thresholds will apply for workers and their families wanting to remain in the
UK. Many EU citizens work part of the year in the UK and part overseas, so will
not easily be able to prove their right to remain due to interrupted periods of
residence.  âThe offer of a two year grace period after we leave for
these workers to acquire their right to settled status is welcome, but two
years may not be enough and five years would be better. The obligation on
individuals who have previously received permanent residency to re-apply must
be made as bureaucracy-free as possible, for employers and the individuals
concerned alike."" House of CommonsParliament Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Stella Creasy have asked about the situation of women in Northern Ireland who are currently not entitled to free abortions on the NHS in England. Mr Green has said that this is a devolved matter and therefore an issue for Northern Ireland to decide. Ms Creasy responds that women in Northern Ireland feel as thought they are ""forced to pay the price of a forced marriage"".

"Two brothers, same murder, but one goes free. Why?","The difference between life in prison and freedom: 15 months Sammy Maldonado is 15 months older than his brother, David. The age difference is the reason that Sammy may spend the rest of his life in prison for a murder he did not commit, while his brother - the actual perpetrator - is going free. On 13 August, 1980 - the day that blew the Maldonados' lives apart - Ted Kennedy had just conceded to Jimmy Carter in the Democratic primary for president. Stanley Kubrick's The Shining was terrifying American movie audiences, and the Iranian hostage crisis was sliding into its 10th month. It was the end of a long, hot summer day, and teenagers David and Sammy decided to escape from their bleak urban surroundings in northern Philadelphia to an idyllic spot called Devil's Pool. The brothers piled into a friend's 1970 Mustang, stopped off for a gallon of cheap wine, and drove into the park. They hiked down the footpath from the car park until the trees parted around a rocky outcropping that looked down on a deep, creek-fed basin of water. Swimmers launched themselves from the rocks and into the cold, dark water, drank beers and smoked pot. David (left) and Sammy before prison Before long the Maldonados had befriended another group of teenagers who traded their beer for the brothers' joints. They drank and listened to a kid strumming a guitar, until both boys were drunk, high and feeling bold. According to court documents, at some point, one of the boys decided ""to steal the white kids' box"" - a cardboard box they hoped was full of valuables. As the light was fading, Sammy snatched it and took off running. David followed, grabbing a steak knife from the other teenagers' picnic supplies. The other group gave chase, and Sammy and David got separated from the rest of the group with 19-year-old Steven Monahan hot on their tail. According to the testimony at trial, Sammy almost immediately abandoned the box - which among its treasures held a $10 bill, a report card, and a comb - and Monahan tackled him. David jumped on to Monahan's back and stabbed him twice with the steak knife. Monahan fell, and the brothers took off into the woods. Back in the parking lot, they flagged down their friends and climbed into the Mustang heading back into the city. ""I think I killed him,"" David said from the back seat, and started to cry. Thirty-seven years later, the Maldonado brothers sit beside each other in the visiting room of the Pennsylvania State Correctional Institution at Graterford in identical faded crimson jumpsuits. They've aged from scrawny teens into middle-aged men. Sammy is the quieter one, with a smooth bald head and professorial glasses. David is taller, lanky with thinning dark hair and a moustache that has turned more salt than pepper. The family resemblance is in the eyes - the same slate grey colour. After Steven Monahan died - his aorta punctured by one of the stab wounds - both boys were convicted of second-degree felony murder and sentenced to mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole. Because of the laws on the books in Pennsylvania, the judge in the case had no say on the sentences, even remarking at the time: ""I think it's harsh, because I never would have sentenced you to a life term in prison under these facts."" They've spent nearly their entire time in prison in the same facility; Sammy's cell at Graterford is just 15 cells away from David's. Because they're housed on the ""honour block"", they can visit each other several times a day. Like all brothers they argue and get on each other's nerves, but today there is reason for some levity: in just a few weeks' time, David is going free. ""I'm elated for him,"" says Sammy. David's emotions are more complicated. ""It's bittersweet,"" says David. ""I hate to leave Sam."" They were both supposed to die in prison. But a series of recent US Supreme Court decisions has changed everything for David, who was 17 at the time of the murder, and classified as a juvenile. In the 2012 case of Miller v Alabama, the high court decided mandatory life sentences for juveniles constitute a violation of the US constitution's eighth amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment. Four years later, the justices ruled that the Miller decision should be retroactive, meaning the roughly 2,300 men and women across the US who'd been sentenced to life in prison as children had a right to be resentenced, and therefore eligible for parole and release. ""Because juveniles have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reformâ¦ they are less deserving of the most severe punishments,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote in the Miller decision. ""Our decisions rested not only on common sense - on what 'any parent knows' - but on science and social science as well."" A series of recent Supreme Court cases led to David's freedom - but not Sammy's The state of Pennsylvania holds the most ""juvenile lifers"" in the country - more than 500 inmates. The state's county judges have been slowly making their way through them in the resentencing process, starting with the greyest lifers - the longest serving inmate was a 79-year-old man who had been in prison for 63 years. As of May 2017, 40 juvenile lifers have been released in Pennsylvania. On 13 December 2016, it was David Maldonado's turn. He went before a judge who heard how he went from being a drug addict to earning a master's degree, and about his work counselling other inmates. Although the family of the victim was opposed, the judge resentenced him to 30 years and not long after that, the Pennsylvania parole board approved his release. (The Monahan family did not respond to requests for an interview.) Crowdfunding to witness son's execution Banned: An Iraqi family's immigration story Man who won freedom 88 years early set for deportation But the Supreme Court decisions that freed David have no effect on his brother's case. On the day that the murder took place, Sammy Maldonado was 18 years, four months and 10 days old - legally speaking, an adult. Even though it was David who stabbed Steven Monahan, in the eyes of the law, Sammy's age of 18 automatically classified him as a fully mature adult, capable of making the same decisions as a 40-year-old, while his brother was a juvenile with a still-developing brain who required special consideration. ""Sammy didn't do the stabbing, he got beat up - but he was 18 years,"" says Michael Wiseman, a lawyer for both men. ""He is far less culpable than David."" Asked if he would consider himself an adult when the crime occurred, Sammy answers: ""No, no, I can answer that empathically. No. I was immature, I was impetuous. When you're young like that you're easily influenced."" David Maldonado walks out of a Pennsylvania prison after 37 years A few months later, on a bright, sunny day in May, David Maldonado emerges from the front doors of Graterford prison carrying a cardboard box of his belongings. He wears a brand new shirt and slacks that a friend who came to pick him up brought - he nearly walked out with the price tags still attached. The prison lobby broke into a tiny celebration as he left, with strangers, inmates and correctional officers alike clapping him on the back and wishing him the best. Before heading back to Philadelphia, David and his friend stop at a nearby diner for some coffee, where he confronts his first free-world challenge. The tables are pushed too closely together for his comfort, and his back is nearly touching a woman seated behind him. It makes him nervous, he keeps glancing over his shoulder before asking if he can switch seats. ""What is your problem?"" the woman's husband suddenly barks. ""Nothing,"" David says. ""It's the third thing you've said about her,"" the man shouts. ""I didn't say nothing,"" David says. ""I didn't say nothing."" After a few tense moments, the man returns to his meal. ""I gotta learn to tolerate certain stuff that in prison I wouldn't tolerate,"" David says. ""I gotta remember I'm not in prison no more."" That's the kind of impulse control David and Sammy would argue they did not have as teenagers when they committed the crime. A growing body of scientific research would agree with them, and some advocates say the same research that gave David a second chance should apply to Sammy, too. Prefrontal circuitry (in green) continues to change into adulthood In 1993, a 17-year-old Missouri boy named Christopher Simmons was sentenced to death for the robbery and murder of a 46-year-old woman. Simmons' lawyers argued all the way to the Supreme Court that it was cruel and unusual punishment to execute a ""developmentally immature"" person. The case gained some unexpected allies - the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association, among others. For the first time, a cadre of psychologists and neuroscientists submitted the argument that it was inappropriate to execute juveniles because their brains haven't finished developing. They said that MRI scans of the brains of juveniles and adolescents show that well into a person's early 20s the brain is continuing to add grey matter and the prefrontal cortex - which is believed to regulate self-control - is developing. ""The brain continues to change throughout our entire lifetime, but there are massive changes still happening into the 20s,"" says BJ Casey, a professor of psychology and director of the Fundamentals of the Adolescent Brain lab at Yale University. In 2005, the justices decided in the Simmons case that due to ""evolving standards of decency"" those 18 years and younger could not be executed by the state - it was the first time the court factored in developmental science. The court cited several neurological and psychological studies in the Miller and Montgomery decisions as well. Since then, the evidence has only grown showing that the brain is far from finished changing by 18, and major development continues up until the age of 24 or 25. Neuroimaging shows that the brains of young adults aged 18 to 24 respond differently than the brains of older adults when making decisions, assessing risk, controlling impulses and resisting peer pressure. ""It's quite clear that, at least in the United States, we choose our legal boundaries for reasons other than scientific ones,"" says Laurence Steinberg, a psychology professor at Temple University and an expert in the field of adolescent brain development. ""If you're looking for a boundary that's an answer to the question, 'When do people stop maturing?', 18 is clearly too young."" Some neuroscientists and psychologists like Casey argue that young adulthood should be treated as its own distinct phase of life, separate from childhood and adulthood. She says that young adult brains simply do not function the same way that adult brains do when under stress or threat. ""They're far more impulsive in threatening situations, they're significantly different from adults over 21,"" she says. The Supreme Court rulings also have implications for Lee Malvo, who was 17 when he took part in the Washington sniper attacks Both Sammy and David say that in their first few years in prison, they were terrors - drugs were easy to obtain and they graduated from smoking weed to shooting heroin. They fought other inmates, and coped with their fates by spending as much time as possible in an intoxicated stupor. But by their early 20s, they'd both lost interest in drugs. Sammy took up boxing, as evidenced by a few missing teeth, and eventually became a born-again Christian. David started going to classes and earned his GED (a certificate equivalent to a high school diploma). ""I had to start doing the time instead of letting it do me,"" he says. By the time of his release, David had earned a masters of theology and was working as a drug and alcohol counsellor for Spanish-speaking inmates. Sammy - who says he spends most of his time alone in his cell studying the law and the Bible -  has a job as a teacher's aid for inmates working towards their GEDs. ""I'll be 54 next month, he just turned 55,"" says David. ""We're not the kids we were. We don't have the problems we had back then."" There's at least one court case making its way through the system that could result in a similar game-changing decision for people like Sammy. Ted Koch is a lawyer representing Luis Noel Cruz, an inmate in Connecticut who committed a murder on the orders of the Latin Kings gang when he was 18 and a half years old. A federal judge has agreed to hear arguments later this year that the Miller decision should apply to someone who was just past his 18th birthday. ""It's arbitrary - the science doesn't draw bright lines, so the law shouldn't either,"" says Koch. If Trump obstructed justice, what next? Uber 'obtained rape victim's records' Why I failed to catch Canada's worst serial killer The idea that young adults are simply different from both juveniles and adults is gaining some traction - states like Connecticut have opened special wings of their prisons to house inmates 18 to 25, with an eye on rehabilitation and even a path towards criminal record expungement. Just this spring, San Francisco opened a young adult court - citing the latest developments in neuroscience as the reason for its existence - specifically for offenders ages 18 to 25. There are similar courts in New York and Idaho. Nevertheless, the movement to change national and state laws to include special considerations for 18- to 25-year-old lifers is still in its infancy. Though there is no national estimate of how many inmates would fall in this group, in the state of Pennsylvania alone it's 2,203 men and women. ""[Nationwide], it's certainly going to be a very big number,"" says Ashley Nellis, a senior research analyst with The Sentencing Project. Koch believes there are likely to be similar challenges coming from inmates like his client, those just over 18 when their crimes were committed, who will argue that the Miller decision should apply to them. ""I think there's a wave coming behind me,"" says Koch. David, on the outside, Sammy, on the inside A month after David's release, Sammy sits alone in the visiting room. His arms are dotted with faded, blueish tattoos, including a chain wrapped around his right wrist - another relic of his impulsive youth. Once he gets released, ""I'm gonna have them removed,"" he says. Sammy has complete confidence that he'll walk out of Graterford some day, although his legal avenues are limited. He will either need to earn a commutation from the Governor of Pennsylvania - which is rare - or there will need to be a change in law. One of his greatest regrets is that his release could not happen before the deaths of their parents. Although the Maldonados' childhood was marred by physical abuse, alcoholism, and general tumult - in his 17 years outside, David Maldonado lived at 20 different addresses and attended 13 different schools - the family reconciled after the boys went to prison. According to their aunt, their father worked three different jobs trying to afford better lawyers. He died in 2010, 28 years after he started coming to see his sons on a consistent basis. ""I wish I could have had those 28 years back, but it's gone,"" says Sammy. For now, he sits in his cell, studying or working at his typewriter with his television on and the sound turned off, waiting for his chance to join David in the free world. Even though it was David's actions that landed them both in prison, Sammy says he bears no ill will towards his little brother. ""Guilt is a very, very strong emotion. I know it's tearing at him,"" says Sammy. ""Tell David not to worry about me. Stress to him I'm OK and I'm going to get out of here."" The following day, David Maldonado is hoofing it down a hot, sunny street in West Philadelphia, poking his head into various cheque-cashing places and bodegas to see if they can wire money to Sammy's prison commissary account. ""I want to send him $50 as soon as I get to the right place,"" he says. His face is fuller - he's gained seven pounds since his release - and his cheeks are tan from his work clearing litter from a park in North Philadelphia. He's been hired as an alcohol and drugs counsellor, he's looking for an apartment, and slowly reconnecting with family and friends. He even tried lobster for the first time (he was not a fan). David is hopeful that the simple fact that he is out, and doing well, will help Sammy's case once he applies for commutation. ""I take responsibility for what I did. I shouldn't have did what I did. [The victim] didn't deserve what I did,"" says David. ""If you let me out and I'm the one who did it and you trust me to be out here, I don't see why you can't trust [Sammy]. He didn't do nothing.""

Trump travel ban injunction lifted in part,"The original ban in January provoked mass protests at American airports US President Donald Trump has welcomed a Supreme Court ruling allowing his travel ban to be partly reinstated as a ""victory for our national security"". America's highest court also granted a White House request allowing part of its refugee ban to go into effect. The justices said they would consider in October whether the president's policy should be upheld or struck down. Mr Trump seeks to place a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120-day ban on refugees. The president welcomed the ruling's qualified authorisation to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, which he described as ""terror-prone countries"". ""As president, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm,"" he added. Mr Trump has already said the ban would take effect within 72 hours of court approval. The Supreme Court saidin Monday's decision,external: ""In practical terms, this means that [the executive order] may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States. ""All other foreign nationals are subject to the provisions of [the executive order]."" The ruling also said it would permit a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the US to go into effect, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who do not have any ""bona fide relationship"" with an American individual or entity. Mark this down as a win for Donald Trump. The path to entry into the US for immigrants and refugees from the affected nations, if they don't have existing ties to the US - either through family, schools or employment - just became considerably harder. The decision marks a reaffirmation of the sweeping powers the president has traditionally been granted by the courts in areas of national security. There was fear in some quarters that the administration's ham-fisted implementation of its immigration policy could do lasting damage to the president's prerogatives. That appears not to be the case. The government, the justices write, has a ""compelling need to provide for the nation's security"". That includes being able to close the borders based on an evaluation of the potential of foreign threats - at least for now. The Supreme Court justices will fully consider the arguments on both sides next autumn. Of course, by that time it may not matter. The administration has three months to conduct its ""executive review"" of immigration policy and devise new guidelines. In the meantime, the gates to America just got a bit smaller. Big win for Trump and his travel ban The ruling clarifies that those who would be deemed to have such a relationship would include a foreign national who wishes to enter the US to live with or visit a family member, a student at an American university, an employee of a US company, or a lecturer invited to address an American audience. This would not apply, it said, to ""someone who enters into a relationship simply to avoid [the executive order]. ""For example, a non-profit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion."" Five questions on the revised travel ban This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' Yes. Three of the court's conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - wrote that they would have allowed the travel ban to go into full effect. Justice Thomas said the government's interest in preserving national security outweighs any hardship to people denied entry into the country. Mr Trump restored a 5-4 conservative majority to the Supreme Court when his nominee, Justice Gorsuch, joined its bench in April. There are five Republican appointees on the court and four Democratic appointees. Attorney General Jeff Sessions says ""the threat to our national security is real and becoming increasingly dangerous"". He has welcomed the decision, saying it is ""an important step towards restoring the separation of powers between the branches of the federal government."" Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project, says that it remains to be decided if the ban is constitutional, but that the courts which have looked at the measure have been against it: ""[But] in practical terms most of the people who stood to be affected by the ban will still be allowed to come in."" David Miliband, president of theInternational Rescue Committee (IRC),,externalhas urged the government to start a review of its vetting process. ""The court's decision threatens damage to vulnerable people waiting to come to the US: people with urgent medical conditions blocked, innocent people left adrift, all of whom have been extensively vetted."" The US president insisted his ban was necessary for national security amid a slew of terrorist attacks in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin and other cities. However, critics called the policy un-American and Islamophobic, and the lower courts broadly seemed to agree. The president's policy was left in limbo after it was struck down by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland days following its issuance on 6 March. The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said in May the ban was ""rooted in religious animus"" toward Muslims. The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in June: ""National security is not a 'talismanic incantation' that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power."" A Yemeni woman hugs her mother at a Virginia airport in February after courts granted a temporary stay on President Trump's order The original ban, released on 27 January, provoked mass protests at American airports. It included Iraq among nations whose travellers would be barred from the US, and imposed a full ban on refugees from Syria. The president issued a revised version with a narrower scope on 6 March to overcome some of the legal problems. But Mr Trump was unhappy about having to do so, calling it a ""watered down, politically correct"" version of the first one. Muslims on Trump ban: I don't belong here.

DUP deal and EU citizens - reaction,"DUP agree deal to back Conservative government Theresa May sets out more detail on EU citizens' rights Labour's McDonnell: Grenfell victims 'murdered by political decisions' MPs to continue debate on Queen's Speech Aiden James and Alex Hunt Northern Ireland's devolved government will get access to an extra Â£1bn as part of the agreement. The PM outlines plans designed to address the ""anxiety"" of EU citizens about their status after Brexit. The deal will see the DUP support Theresa May in Parliament and Â£1bn extra cash for Northern Ireland. Here's a recap of the day's major events:  Analysis:  There was also movement on the UK's plans for EU citizens:  You can catch-up with, and watch live, proceedings in Parliament including the statement currently under way in the House of Commons on the Grenfell Tower tragedy withour BBC Parliament colleagues' live coverage.  EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament Lords leader Baroness Evans tells peers the government has ""come out early"" with its proposal on EU citizens' rights, which indicates its ""seriousness"" about finding a solution. She says the cut-off date will be ""a matter for negotiation"" and emphasises it is an ""early priority for negotiations"". Theresa May has set out the government's ""offer"" to EU citizens in the UK, telling Parliament that the government wants them to stay. The prime minister said no EU citizen would have to leave when the UK exits the EU. The government has proposed giving those with five years' continuous residence, at a cut-off date to be determined by negotiations, a ""settled status"". This video can not be played EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament The leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, Lord Newby, says it's to be ""regretted"" that it has taken so long to set out the government's intentions for EU citizens and ""many questions are still unanswered"". He presses for details of a cut-off point after which citizens will not be automatically entitled to apply for residency, and asks about the possibility of ID cards. House of CommonsParliament Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts says that whilst the prime minister is bribing the DUP to ""stitch up the seams of this threadbare administration"", the government continues to neglect the people of Wales and treat them like third class citizens ""in this so-called family of equals"". If the government can hand out Â£1bn to Northern Ireland in a time of austerity, she says, then ""where is the Â£1.7bn that is now so evidently our right?"" Mr Green replies that under the new funding formula, public spending in Wales is now Â£120 per head for every Â£100 per head in England. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Ed Davey has suggested the plans for EU citizens almost amounts to an ID card scheme. âI have written to the Home Secretary to establish whether this indeed is ID
cards by the backdoor and whether EU nationals will now be required to carry
them on their person at all times. If so have ministers worked out the
practicalities of such a scheme, as well as the cost? The government also needs
to explain how an ID card system works when only a small proportion of the
population will be required to carry them.â EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament Responding to the statement on the proposed deal for EU citizens, Labour's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon tells peers she found David Davis' assurances on how borders would be enforced ""unconvincing"". She tells peers other EU leaders ""don't share"" the prime minister's impression of ""a positive response"" to her proposals on EU citizens' rights. She calls it ""grossly inefficient and disrespectful"" that those who have already applied for residency will now have to apply under the new system. She refers to a ""twilight zone"" of uncertainty for EU citizens over their rights to work and travel. ""It
has taken a full year for the Prime Minister to come up with a half-baked
plan that still leaves in limbo millions of European nationals who have made
their home here. This uncertainty is the result of a dysfunctional Government
that is not acting in the nationâs best interests.  âThe
Government should confirm immediately that all EU citizens in the UK by the
time we leave can stay indefinitely - this needs to be as simple and
comprehensive a process as possible. This will enable UK nationals living in
the EU to also have their futures made certain.""   House of CommonsParliament The DUP's chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is ""a remarkable day"" when the Labour Party criticise investment in schools, roads, housing, jobs as dangerous to the peace process - adding ""it is bonkers to suggest so"". He also adds that Labour frontbenchers should rethink their past comments in support of the IRA and the effect it could have on young people who may be thinking to take up arms in the future. Mr Green replies that it is clear that anything that aids investment for disadvantaged communities will provide a more positive political atmosphere in Northern Ireland. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Tracy Brabin thanks the Speaker for hosting family day in the House of Commons at the weekend, and points MPs towards the new plaque for her predecessor Jo Coxwhich was put up in the Commons chamber by her children.

House of CommonsParliament The DUP's Westminster Leader Nigel Dodds rises to praise a ""good agreement for the UK and a good agreement for all the people of Northern Ireland"" - particularly in mental health and hard to reach areas. He says that his party commits to transparency and that he hopes to one day see published the correspondence from 2010 with the Labour frontbench, and from 2015 with both Labour and the SNP - causing much delight on the Tory benches. The ""faux outrage"", he says that has been heard, ""is hypocrisy of the highest order"". The DUP looks forward to working with government for the next five years, he says - to deliver Brexit, to strengthen the Union and to deliver security. Mr Green responds that it has been ""a life enhancing experience"" and that the government welcome the party's support to strengthen the union and the economy. Stephen Martin, Director General of the Institute of
Directors, said:  âEmployers will welcome the constructive clarity of intent
offered today and businesses look forward to the UK and EU finally getting down
to concrete discussions. âAn aim is obviously not the same thing as a guarantee. Even
today, many of the important details are absent, including information on the
registration process for EU citizens and when the cut-off date will be. More
fundamentally, employers still donât know what will happen to their EU staff if
no deal is reached, questions remain as regards whether or what salary
thresholds will apply for workers and their families wanting to remain in the
UK. Many EU citizens work part of the year in the UK and part overseas, so will
not easily be able to prove their right to remain due to interrupted periods of
residence.  âThe offer of a two year grace period after we leave for
these workers to acquire their right to settled status is welcome, but two
years may not be enough and five years would be better. The obligation on
individuals who have previously received permanent residency to re-apply must
be made as bureaucracy-free as possible, for employers and the individuals
concerned alike."" House of CommonsParliament Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Stella Creasy have asked about the situation of women in Northern Ireland who are currently not entitled to free abortions on the NHS in England. Mr Green has said that this is a devolved matter and therefore an issue for Northern Ireland to decide. Ms Creasy responds that women in Northern Ireland feel as thought they are ""forced to pay the price of a forced marriage"".

Death beach 'has hidden dangers',"Two brothers died with three of their friends at Camber last year An inquest into the deaths of five young men at Camber Sands has heard they were all able swimmers and keen on sport. Two brothers, Ken, 18, and Kobi Saththiyanathan, 22, died at the Sussex beach last August along with three of their friends. A pathologist told the hearing in Hastings that all five drowned. Earlier, a lawyer said the beach, which can attract 30,000 people a day at peak times, had ""hidden dangers"". Two other people died in July 2016, after one got into difficulty at Camber and the other tried to reach him - the circumstances of their deaths will be considered as part of the inquest into the five friends' deaths. This video can not be played Ajirthan Ravi, brother of Nitharsan Ravi, called for increased safety at Camber before inquest proceedings began In his opening remarks, the family's barrister Patrick Roche said relatives were keen that ""no-one else suffers the same appalling tragedy"". The men who died all lived in the London area and were of Sri Lankan origin. The inquest heard the two brothers had grown up in a Sri Lankan village surrounded by three rivers and had ""good swimming ability"". A statement by the brothers' father Arumukam Saththiyanathan said his sons regularly played cricket and football and swam in Sri Lanka almost every weekend before they came to the UK in 2008 when they were aged 10 and 14. He added: ""As a family we went to the beaches in the UK nearly every summer and the boys went without us sometimes."" He said Kobi, a business studies student at Brighton University, loved Camber and had visited the beach three times in 2016 before his death. Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Brett Lockyer, said toxicology tests on both brothers were negative for drugs and alcohol. Ken, an A Level student, was described as healthy with no natural disease, and a GP report on Kobi said he had no serious conditions and was not on repeat medication. Their mother, Jegaleela Saththiyanathan, said both her sons were physically fit and played sport at a district level in Sri Lanka. 'Competent swimmer' Nitharsan Ravi was studying aeronautical engineering at Brighton Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, died alongside his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, known as Kobi, both from Erith, south east London. Their three friends, who also died on 24 August were Nitharsan Ravi, 22, from Plumstead, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, from Grays, Essex and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, from Welling. On 24 July, Mohit Dupar, 36, from Hayes, west London, attempted to reach Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, after he got into difficulty. Mr Silva Da Cruz died at the scene. Mr Dupar died in hospital four days later. The inquest heard Mr Ravi had been admitted to hospital with a head injury the day before he died, after an alleged assault four days earlier, but Dr Lockyer said: ""I don't believe the head injury has played a significant part in this man's demise."" Mr Ravi's father, Nagaratnam, said his ""fit and healthy"" son, who had driven the group to Camber, was a competent swimmer. The Brighton University aeronautical engineering student was ""caring, polite and humble and was active with a high work rate,"" Mr Ravi added. He said his family visited beaches every year and his son was ""accustomed to swimming"". Inthushan Sriskantharasa, a Tesco shift manager, was on a day off from work when he died. His uncle, Sivapragasan Thavarasa, said he had seen him swimming in the sea and described him as a ""very able"". Gurushanth Srithavarajah, a student and part-time shop assistant, spent the first 12 years of his life living near the sea in Sri Lanka and was described by his sister, Kabinuja as a competent swimmer.

If the government can hand out Â£1bn to Northern Ireland in a time of austerity, she says, then ""where is the Â£1.7bn that is now so evidently our right?"" Mr Green replies that under the new funding formula, public spending in Wales is now Â£120 per head for every Â£100 per head in England. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Ed Davey has suggested the plans for EU citizens almost amounts to an ID card scheme. âI have written to the Home Secretary to establish whether this indeed is ID
cards by the backdoor and whether EU nationals will now be required to carry
them on their person at all times. If so have ministers worked out the
practicalities of such a scheme, as well as the cost? The government also needs
to explain how an ID card system works when only a small proportion of the
population will be required to carry them.â EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament Responding to the statement on the proposed deal for EU citizens, Labour's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon tells peers she found David Davis' assurances on how borders would be enforced ""unconvincing"". She tells peers other EU leaders ""don't share"" the prime minister's impression of ""a positive response"" to her proposals on EU citizens' rights. She calls it ""grossly inefficient and disrespectful"" that those who have already applied for residency will now have to apply under the new system. She refers to a ""twilight zone"" of uncertainty for EU citizens over their rights to work and travel. ""It
has taken a full year for the Prime Minister to come up with a half-baked
plan that still leaves in limbo millions of European nationals who have made
their home here. This uncertainty is the result of a dysfunctional Government
that is not acting in the nationâs best interests.  âThe
Government should confirm immediately that all EU citizens in the UK by the
time we leave can stay indefinitely - this needs to be as simple and
comprehensive a process as possible. This will enable UK nationals living in
the EU to also have their futures made certain.""   House of CommonsParliament The DUP's chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is ""a remarkable day"" when the Labour Party criticise investment in schools, roads, housing, jobs as dangerous to the peace process - adding ""it is bonkers to suggest so"". He also adds that Labour frontbenchers should rethink their past comments in support of the IRA and the effect it could have on young people who may be thinking to take up arms in the future. Mr Green replies that it is clear that anything that aids investment for disadvantaged communities will provide a more positive political atmosphere in Northern Ireland. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Tracy Brabin thanks the Speaker for hosting family day in the House of Commons at the weekend, and points MPs towards the new plaque for her predecessor Jo Coxwhich was put up in the Commons chamber by her children.

House of CommonsParliament The DUP's Westminster Leader Nigel Dodds rises to praise a ""good agreement for the UK and a good agreement for all the people of Northern Ireland"" - particularly in mental health and hard to reach areas. He says that his party commits to transparency and that he hopes to one day see published the correspondence from 2010 with the Labour frontbench, and from 2015 with both Labour and the SNP - causing much delight on the Tory benches. The ""faux outrage"", he says that has been heard, ""is hypocrisy of the highest order"". The DUP looks forward to working with government for the next five years, he says - to deliver Brexit, to strengthen the Union and to deliver security. Mr Green responds that it has been ""a life enhancing experience"" and that the government welcome the party's support to strengthen the union and the economy. Stephen Martin, Director General of the Institute of
Directors, said:  âEmployers will welcome the constructive clarity of intent
offered today and businesses look forward to the UK and EU finally getting down
to concrete discussions. âAn aim is obviously not the same thing as a guarantee. Even
today, many of the important details are absent, including information on the
registration process for EU citizens and when the cut-off date will be. More
fundamentally, employers still donât know what will happen to their EU staff if
no deal is reached, questions remain as regards whether or what salary
thresholds will apply for workers and their families wanting to remain in the
UK. Many EU citizens work part of the year in the UK and part overseas, so will
not easily be able to prove their right to remain due to interrupted periods of
residence.  âThe offer of a two year grace period after we leave for
these workers to acquire their right to settled status is welcome, but two
years may not be enough and five years would be better. The obligation on
individuals who have previously received permanent residency to re-apply must
be made as bureaucracy-free as possible, for employers and the individuals
concerned alike."" House of CommonsParliament Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Stella Creasy have asked about the situation of women in Northern Ireland who are currently not entitled to free abortions on the NHS in England. Mr Green has said that this is a devolved matter and therefore an issue for Northern Ireland to decide. Ms Creasy responds that women in Northern Ireland feel as thought they are ""forced to pay the price of a forced marriage"".

Jailed surgeon's patients in financial limbo,"Ian Paterson was described as a ""monster"" by one of his victims Patients taking out private health insurance expect to get the best treatment, but what happens if things go wrong? While the NHS has paid out millions to the patients of disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson, his private patients are still seeking compensation. Why? Paterson wasjailed for 15 years last monthafter being convicted of intentionally wounding his patients. His trial heard he exaggerated or invented the risk of cancer in order to persuade people to go under the knife. While the case centred on nine women and one man, there were in fact hundreds of other victims, many of whom were treated privately by Paterson at Spire Healthcare, in the West Midlands. One such patient is Patricia Welch, who underwent a mastectomy and reconstruction after Paterson told her, wrongly, he had found a ""ticking bomb"" of cancerous cells in her breast. ""I don't think you can ever get over it, because you've got it looking back at you in the mirror every morning,"" she said. ""What he did - it will never go away. When you go private, you think you've got the best."" Patricia Welch, centre, was one of 10 patients who gave evidence in Paterson's trial at Nottingham Crown Court It is a view shared by many - and one of the main reasons people are prepared to pay hundreds of pounds in health insurance each year. While the vast majority of private operations are carried out correctly - and private patients are typically treated sooner than their NHS counterparts - the service they receive if things go wrong is not necessarily better. The key difference between the NHS and private healthcare experience is insurance. In the public sector, the NHS is liable for compensation as doctors are employees. In the private sector, the insurance burden falls on surgeons because they are operating as contractors. ""The hospitals are insured for their legal liabilities - the technology, the nurses, the building and the infrastructure,"" said Neil Huband, of the Private Patients' Forum, which supports patients in the sector. ""The doctor, however, is in charge of the case and assumes authority for the welfare of the patient. No doctor is allowed to operate in a private hospital unless he is insured."" As a result, hundreds of Paterson's victims are having to pursue compensation through the courts while their NHS counterparts have already received payouts. However, if a surgeon's conduct is held to be criminal, there is no guarantee his or her insurance will be valid. Ian Paterson: Surgeon was 'psychopathic like Shipman' Breast surgeon 'played God' with women's bodies Ian Paterson: 'He took a pound of flesh for money' Linda Millband, national lead lawyer for clinical negligence at legal firm Thompsons, is acting for more than 500 of Paterson's former private patients. She said private policies have very stringent restrictions, which can be revoked in cases of criminal activity, meaning the patient is not necessarily covered. ""So people are not as safe in the private sector as they are in the NHS because policies are subject to review, so even if you sue somebody, if the insurers say it is criminal conduct it falls outside the policy,"" she said. ""It's really bad and before this case I don't think anyone realised it could happen."" Solicitor Linda Millband said private healthcare was ""a bit of a Wild West"" Her firm has set up a campaign called Patients before Profit, which is calling for the same governance and accountability in the private sector as the NHS. ""Private healthcare is a bit of a Wild West,"" she said. ""There's not really the same level of accountability. The system relies on consultants complying with the rulebook and making admissions when things go wrong - which doesn't always happen. ""The hospitals take the profits from the operations but they are not paying back to the client when things go wrong."" Victims outside Nottingham Crown Court after the disgraced surgeon was jailed for 15 years The High Court is expected to rule later this year on whether Paterson's private patients will receive compensation. Paterson's own insurance of Â£10m has not yet been revoked, but is understood to feature a clause excluding cases of criminal negligence. Spire Healthcare and the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which lawyers claim did not pass on information to Spire about Paterson's activities, are also being pursued for compensation. Between 1998 and 2011 Paterson was employed by the Heart of England trust in Solihull, despite the fact he had previously been suspended by Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield. At about the same time as his arrival at the trust, he began taking on private work for Spire Healthcare at its Little Aston and Parkway hospitals. Mark Sibbering, president of the Association of Breast Surgery, said the huge volume of operations Paterson carried out while at Spire was ""off the scale"". Mark Sibbering says there is a need to investigate the private sector in the wake of the Paterson case ""The number of patients he was seeing was astronomical and there was no input from anybody else,"" he said. ""That was clearly a governance issue."" He said recent scandals in the NHS, such as theStafford Hospital scandaland now the Paterson case, had led to a determination across the service never to let such things happen again. However, the private sector still has questions to answer, he believes. ""What happened in the private sector has not been investigated fully yet,"" he said. ""There were a lot of issues, in that they allowed this to go on for such a long time and to such a degree. There's a need to look into that more."" Both Spire and the Heart of England trust say they have taken steps to ensure such a case could never happen again. Spire said it was looking at ways of improving data collection and had commissioned a report which made a number of recommendations, including breast cancer patients being required to undergo scans and biopsies before having surgery. Paterson was found guilty of wounding patients at Spire private hospitals A spokesman said: ""As an independent hospital, Spire Healthcare operates in an environment which is highly regulated, and subject to strict governance requirements. ""Spire is regulated in exactly the same way as any NHS hospital, by the Care Quality Commission. As well as making notifications (where necessary) we are subject to regular inspections. ""We understand that Thompsons' campaign was prompted by the case of Ian Paterson. Issues of liability and compensation arising from Mr Paterson's activity will be addressed later in the year through a trial of lead cases. ""This approach was proposed by Spire as the fairest and quickest way to determine where responsibility for his actions lies; and all the lawyers representing Mr Paterson's patients, including Thompsons, agreed to the process. ""The Verita Report that we commissioned in light of the concerns about Mr Paterson made several recommendations, all of which have been implemented. ""Patient safety is at the heart of everything we do, and it is something to which we remain deeply committed."" Mr Hubard said regulation in the private sector had improved ""out of sight"" since the Paterson case. ""We have a wonderful private sector in this country - some of the best private hospitals that exist anywhere in the world and we are getting more and more patients from abroad coming to use them,"" he said. ""We are quite sure that the appalling circumstances of the Paterson case are most unlikely to be repeated because of the robustness of the regulations now in place but everybody needs to be vigilant."" Christine Comerford said she no longer trusted private healthcare Christine Comerford, from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, underwent two operations and several biopsies at the hands of Paterson, although she later learned she had in fact never had cancer. She said she no longer trusted private healthcare and had cancelled her insurance scheme. ""I was paying Â£140 a month,"" she said. ""The big difference is that if you are part of a private scheme, you get seen quicker. ""But if a mistake is made, people in the private sector don't hold their hands up. ""It's too much of a closed environment where people can do their own thing with nobody looking at them."" She added: ""Spire made a lot of money from Paterson's work. Although you're not paying for the treatment, you get sent the invoices and it's phenomenal the amount insurance pays out. ""To say you've learned from your mistakes has become like a standard answer. ""It's true you will get rogues in every sector but they have to ensure people like Paterson can't get away with it for so long.""

Mr Gustafsson, 42, is being flown back to Sweden from Africa, Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot WallstrÃ¶msaid in a statement,externalon Monday. He was seized by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) along with two other men, one of whom was freed in a dawn raid in 2015. Ms WallstrÃ¶m said Mr Gustafsson was ""in good spirits"",local media report,external. ""It is with great pleasure that I can announce that Johan Gustafsson has been released,"" Ms WallstrÃ¶m added. She said that the Swede's release was thanks to ""extensive efforts"" and co-operation between the Swedish foreign ministry, police and ""foreign authorities"". Ms WallstrÃ¶m said she had spoken with Mr Gustafsson, who she described as being ""happy"" and ""overwhelmed"" by Monday's events. ""I cannot say more at the current time,"" she added. Sweden's former Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said that Mr Gustafsson's kidnapping weighed heavily on his mind during his time in the role, which ended in 2014.

Man dies after taking 'potent' MDMA,"Police say the type of MDMA, known as ""magic"" or ""pink champagne"", is highly potent A man has died and four others are in a critical condition after taking a ""particularly potent"" form of the drug MDMA, Greater Manchester Police said. Ten people were admitted to hospital after taking the drug over the weekend, with four remaining in intensive care. Police said the drugs were known locally as ""magic"" or ""pink champagne"" and come in crystal form. A 26-year-old man, held on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs, has been released while inquiries continue. What happens if you take too much MDMA? Four men were taken to hospital on Saturday, with another five men and one woman taken to hospital on Sunday after taking what is believed to be the same MDMA-based drug. One of those admitted, a 26-year-old man from Rochdale, has since died. Four men are currently in a critical condition and receiving treatment in intensive care. Three people received treatment and have been discharged from hospital. Det Insp Jim Faulkner said the situation was ""incredibly worrying"". He said: ""We are doing all that we can to warn people against taking the drug and help those who may have taken it. ""So please, if you believe that you or somebody you know has taken the drug and begins showing symptoms then get yourselves to the hospital immediately."" He said symptoms to watch for include rigid muscles, shallow breathing, a fast-racing pulse, hyper-aggression, seizure, foaming at the mouth and unconsciousness.

12 things we learned at Glastonbury,"Mud-free and musically diverse, this year's Glastonbury was one of the best in recent memory. Here are some of the things we spotted along the way. When 100,000 people sang ""boink"", Craig David was all over it. The star celebrated his improbable, but amazing, career resurgence by throwing a huge party on the Pyramid Stage, full of his greatest hits (and quite a few other people's too). Afterwards, fans said Craig should have been given Glastonbury's coveted Sunday afternoon ""legend's slot"". But sadly that will never happen... He chills on Sunday. There might have been extra security at Glastonbury this year, but the police weren't about to let that dampen the spirits. If anything, the boys and girls in blue were determined to keep the Glastonbury spirit alive and kicking. There was also this business with the mounted police and a false horse's head. The stuff of nightmares. BBC Glastonbury - watch full performances Ed Sheeran closes Glastonbury 2017 Hollywood invades Glastonbury Barry Gibb brings the festival to its feet Katy Perry crowdsurfs and Craig David triumphs The cheapest pint at Glastonbury On Wednesday, as temperatures reached 34C, we sat on the hill opposite the Park Stage when, all of a sudden, everyone broke into a spontaneous round of applause. Five minutes later, it happened again. And again. It took us about half an hour to work out that, every time, they were celebrating the sun disappearing behind a cloud. ""I've done myself an injury,"" said Dua Lipa, as she limped into the BBC compound after a performance at the John Peel stage that was as packed with hits as it was people. ""I've mashed my tailbone,"" she grimaced. ""It was already bruised after I fell off a jet ski. Then I went on stage and danced like I'd never danced before. All sorts of crazy stuff. Now I can barely walk."" Get well soon, Dua! This video can not be played Dreadlock holiday One reveller had a very creative solution to their bad hair day. In 1998, when the Foo Fighters played their first ever Glastonbury, half of the audience walked away to watch England v Colombia in the World Cup - a match where David Beckham scored one of England's two goals. Fast forward 19 years, and the band headline the Pyramid Stage with Beckham watching from the sidelines. That makes the score 1-1. But what happens next? It wasn't just Beckham watching from the sidelines. We spotted Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt and Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hanging out at the festival. We also spotted Margot Robbie, Cara Delevingne and off-duty musicians Chris Martin and Rita Ora who, judging by her Instagram, arrived in a helicopter. Most surprising of all was Bradley Cooper - who turned up on the Pyramid Stage and played guitar (albeit silently) while filming a sequence for the upcoming remake of  A Star Is Born. He then introduced a set by country singer Kris Kristoffersen, who starred in the 1976 version of the film alongside Barbra Streisand. The star last visited Glastonbury as a guest of Metallica in 2014 This video can not be played Sigrid shares her vocal warm-up secrets We had the privilege of watching up-and-coming pop star Sigrid soundcheck for a live session on BBC Radio 1. As you can see above, her acoustic rendition of Don't Kill My Vibe was nothing short of stunning. Unfortunately, when it came to the broadcast, the Norwegian was interrupted by Jools Holland and his Big Band, who launched into a thunderous set on the nearby Pyramid Stage. Sigrid persevered; eyes screwed tight, delivering a delicate and heartfelt performance against the boogie woogie barrage. ""That was weird,"" she told us afterwards. ""I could hear the whole show behind me. I really had to concentrate. Thank goodness I had headphones!"" This video can not be played The Labour leader was introduced on stage by Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis Everywhere you went, the chant broke out: ""Ohhhh, Jeremy Corbyn."" We heard it between bands, we heard it in the healing field, we even heard it at the silent disco. But most of all, we heard it during his appearance on the Pyramid Stage. The Labour leader delivered a well-received speech -  but he forgot the one thing he was supposed to do: Introduce US hip-hop band Run The Jewels onto the stage. Speaking to the BBC afterwards, they didn't seem to mind. ""He said a lot of things that resonated with the common man,"" said Killer Mike. ""I was very impressed. Old G can talk."" ""I can see all of you!"" shouted Katy Perry to the hordes who came to see her at the Pyramid Stage. ""Even that security guard in the neon, way in the back by that blue flag with the X."" That would be the Saltire, Katy. The flag of Scotland. Mind you, how many of you know the flag of Katy's home state, California? (It's got a grizzly bear on it, FYI).

""Hey, mumzy, look at your boy now,"" beamed Stormzy, as he surveyed the massive crowd who turned up for his set on The Other Stage. They included one Katherine Perry, who told the rapper she had ""delayed the helicopter"" to catch his set. ""[I'm] just a massive fan,"" she added on Snapchat. After posing for photographs with the star backstage, Stormzy took to Twitter to express his disbelief at how the whole night went down. ""So happy right now, thank you to every single person that came and saw me,"" he wrote. ""Chris Martin came to speak to me after. What an inspiration. And Katy Perry came as well! What a dream. We thank God."" Then, apropos of nothing, he added, ""Before I forget, Dynamo is the greatest magician on the planet."" Whatever you say, Stormzy.

What comes after 'O-o-oh Jeremy Corbyn!'?,"These days it's not that weird seeing a man born in 1949 rocking the crowds at the Glastonbury Festival. Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits and Richard Hell were all born that year and I am sure they could still get the campers roaring. The novelty value was that it was a politician, Jeremy Corbyn, who was lapping up the love this year. However, the age gap and the ""well, fancy that"" factor have obscured the very real importance of the Labour leader's appearance at the annual music festival. His first big gig since his election triumph (no, I know he didn't win, and yes it was) highlights the reason he's done so well, and flags up the pitfalls ahead. It could mark the point of peak Corbyn. But a big deal? Certainly. It won't get the column inches or hours of airtime and earnest analysis devoted every year to the leaders' speeches at conference time, but it was far more important. They rarely amount to much - trust me I've covered quite a few of them in my time - and they're nearly always forgotten within the week. Mr Corbyn's offering was, to say the least, unusual. And that is the point. He doesn't play the game - and people who can't bear political game-playing love this conscious vibe. Of course, part of its importance was the venue. He wasn't speaking to party press officers and political hacks in a cavernous hall, but live and direct to thousands of people in a muddy field in Somerset. That the rebellious and radical leader of the Labour Party, scorned by the establishment and most of his own MPs, was asked to make a speech, is part of the meaning. The Glastonbury crowd differed greatly from a traditional party conference audience The organisers knew he would be popular. It is obvious that Jezza has become, if not an idol, an object of affection for some younger people. That isn't particularly strange. Strands coexist, neo-liberalism may still rule the world and Glastonbury is an intensely commercial gathering, but Che Guevara is still on people's T-shirts and Margaret Thatcher isn't. Conservatism has rarely been cool, even under Dave Cameron. Corbynmania isn't just retro chic with a dash of post-modern irony. The counter-culture moulded the modern. And - just as Glasto isn't really only for or about the young - this is only the symbolic tip of the Corbyn iceberg. Festivals are largely made up of the unbuttoned middle class, pretty well-heeled, but no less fed up about the future and the society they in which they live, particularly after the Brexit vote. The part of the old Labour coalition who drifted away after Tony Blair's Iraq war. Jeremy Corbyn appears at Glastonbury Populism: Pantomime politics or the public fighting back? All about general election 2017 Profile of Labour's leader But the tone of Mr Corbyn's speech was also really important. He didn't pull that trick of daring but arrogant bands and hit them with new material. He stuck to some of the very old favourites, but there was a freshness for those who've heard thousands of political speeches. There were none of the policy announcements which are catnip to the commentariat and only a couple of disparaging comments about President Trump, but no direct attacks on the Conservatives. There was not much mention of current politics at all in fact - one reference to the Grenfell Tower fire and one about rights of EU citizens and that was about it. Instead, Mr Corbyn might have taken another piece of clichÃ©d advice for bands: it was all full of soul and feeling - from the heart. Appropriately for a festival, there was a lot about love and peace and a better world. A burning sense of injustice, sure, but a steady rhythm optimism running through it - riffs on poetry, art and the wisdom of learning lessons from each other. Warm and fuzzy or pie in the sky? Lying on your back on the grass, that sounds OK. In one sense, it is a very old politics but it is the product of the new politics. Back in 2008, I frequently mused aloud that I knew the financial crisis would produce new political movements - I just couldn't tell what they would be - and 11 years later I have had my answer in spades. Populist politicians like French President Emmanuel Macron have enjoyed recent success Talk of populism has its place but the common thread which ties together Trump and Macron and links Italy's Five Star Movement to Corbyn, is a rejection of the existing political order and what's been tried before. A restless quest for something new, a hope for change. That might sound weird when we have just seen a return to two party politics. But, while the label on the Labour bottle is the same, the contents are very different. It is one of the many ironies of Brexit that Theresa May's analysis was probably spot on. That the vote which turned the British political world upside down wasn't only about the European Union but about people left behind, missing out, ignored by an elite and frustrated. Her mistake - and ours - was to believe that she could capture that spirit. Still, ""Oooh Jeremy Corbyn"" might be as good as it gets for Jezza. This could be peak Corbyn. What lies ahead is tougher - to convince people not only that he's a nice old geezer who's not the horned demon painted by the tabloids, but that he is a potential prime minister. The Labour right's grudging acceptance that he had a good war has yet to translate into anything like helpful support. Many on his team want vengeance. His reshuffle buried no hatchets. Neither right nor left of Labour seem to have heededPaul Mason's acute analysis,external- which suggests giving the right the control of defence and security so the left can own the economy. Theresa May has said she wants to reach out to the ""just about managings"" The critical task is still holding together the fraying coalition at the heart of the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn may be able to combine an appeal to partygoers in luxury yachts and people suffering in tower blocks, but it is much harder for him to reach those who bought their own council houses. Those white working class men on the doorstep shaking their heads and saying ""not while he's leader"" were not a myth. Whenever the next election arrives, there will be more scrutiny of what he would be like as prime minister. It is true the press have thrown everything they have to throw and the more over the top abuse has failed. But expectations were so low that it helped Mr Corbyn. If, this year, people felt they could vote Labour as a protest, to dent Mrs May's predicted immense majority, they won't think that next time. Then again, the Conservatives can hardly warn of the dangers of a weak government with a besieged leader with no authority trying to manage a party pulling in different directions on Brexit. But Labour MPs will be the very last to breezily sing ""Oooh Jeremy Corbyn"". Capturing a sunny mood of righteous rebellion is very far from grasping the keys to No 10.

Brexit offer to EU citizens being outlined,"This video can not be played Theresa May sets out 'offer' on EU citizens' rights Theresa May has said she wants EU citizens living in the UK to stay after Brexit as she announced plans designed to put their ""anxiety to rest"". All EU nationals lawfully resident for at least five years will be able to apply for ""settled status"" and be able to bring over spouses and children. Those who come after an as-yet-unagreed date will have two years to ""regularise their status"" but with no guarantees. Jeremy Corbyn said the offer was ""not generous"" and ""too little, too late"". Labour said the UK should have made a unilateral guarantee of security to EU citizens in the aftermath of last year's Brexit vote. The EU's chief negotiator said the proposals did not go far enough. A 15-page document,externaloutlining the detail of the UK's offer to EU citizens was published as Theresa May briefed MPs on the outcome of Friday's EU summit - at which she first set out her plans. What is UK offering EU citizens? Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? She told the Commons that she wanted to give reassurance and certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland - who she said were an ""integral part of the economic and cultural fabric"" of the UK. But she said any deal on their future legal status and rights must be reciprocal and also give certainty to the 1.2 million British expats living on the continent after the UK leaves the EU - expected to be on 29 March 2019. The key points of the UK's proposals are: Those granted settled status will be able to live, work, study and claim benefits just as they can now The cut-off date for eligibility is undecided but will be between 29 March 2017 and 29 March 2019 Family members of EU citizens living abroad will be able to return and apply for settled status EU nationals in the UK for less than five years at the specified date will be able to continue living and working in the UK Once resident for five years, they can apply for settled status Those arriving after the cut-off point will be able to stay temporarily But there should be ""no expectation"" they will be granted permanent residence A period of ""blanket residence permission"" may apply to give officials time to process applications to stay in the UK The Home Office will no longer require evidence that EU citizens who weren't working held ""comprehensive sickness insurance"" The prime minister told MPs that those granted settled status, equivalent to having indefinite leave to remain, would be ""treated as if they were UK citizens for healthcare, benefits and pensions"". Mrs May said the process of application would be simplified and a ""light touch"" approach adopted. The existing application process for permanent residency, which involves filling out a 85-page form, has been widely criticised. ""Under these plans, no EU citizen currently in the UK lawfully will be asked to leave at the point the UK leaves the EU,"" Mrs May said. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Officials anticipate that the process of administering ""settled status"" will be a huge challenge, with some 3.2 million potential applications. Those EU nationals who've been assigned residency cards already will have to apply again under the new system, though the process for them is expected to be ""streamlined"". It's thought applications for settled status will start to be processed from mid-2018. Officials say they intend to put in place a new, online, simplified system - but say they are used to dealing with large volumes of applications - 2.5 million visas each year and seven million passports.  Read Danny's blog Mrs May said spouses, children and other family members currently living overseas would be able to come to the UK and apply for settled status on the same basis as their partners and relatives. Pressed by several Labour MPs, she suggested there would be no income barriers for anyone whose relatives have been in the UK for more than five years while, for others, existing rules applying to the foreign dependents of British citizens would be in force in future. ""There will be no extra requirements,"" she said. ""We are not talking about splitting up families."" She also insisted the UK should police the new rules rather than the European Court of Justice. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn attacks government 'offer' to EU citizens But Mr Corbyn said the question of citizens' rights should have been dealt with in isolation rather than being dragged into the ""delicate and complex"" matrix of trade and other Brexit-related issues now being discussed. ""The truth is it is too little, too late. That could have been done and should have been done a year ago when Labour put that very proposal to the House of Commons. This isn't a generous offer. This is confirmation the government is prepared to use people as bargaining chips."" The SNP's Ian Blackford said there were still ""more questions than answers"" about how EU citizens living in Scotland would be affected. And the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said it could not understand why those who already had permanent residence were being asked to re-apply to obtain the new status. ""These are people who have already proven their right to be here to the government's satisfaction under a very stringent process,"" said its chief executive Saira Grant. ""It is astonishing that the government wants to take on the expense and administrative hassle of reprocessing all of those applications under a new scheme."" Reacting on Twitter, Michel Barnier, who is leading the Brexit negotiations for the EU, said his goal was the same level of protection that citizens currently have under EU law. He added: ""More ambition, clarity and guarantees needed than in today's UK position."" Another key EU figure, Guy Verhofstadt, who is negotiating on behalf of the European Parliament, warned that any changes to free movement laws before the UK has left would break EU law.

Rugby fan crashes on All Blacks' couch,"The Ioane brothers: national stars and surprise hosts to one British rugby fan When a British rugby fan supporting his side in New Zealand was offered a place to stay over with some friendly locals, he had no clue he would end up in the home of two All Blacks stars. Alex Edwards is following the British and Irish Lions team's tour of New Zealand in a camper van. One night, a woman at a local Auckland rugby club suggested he stay with them instead of camping in the car park. Later the woman's two sons walked in - rugby icons Rieko and Akira Ioane. ""I didn't actually recognize them at first - I was sitting with a cup of tea with the dad when the lads came in and their mum introduced the boys,"" Mr Edwards told the BBC. Sipping on his tea, he joked that they looked like they would make decent rugby players, to which the father replied that he would see them ""run out the next night"". Mr Edwards assumed they would be playing for a local club, but was quickly corrected. This video can not be played Meet the Lions fan who had a chance meeting with two All Blacks stars ""They're playing for the Blues, mate,"" he was told - the Auckland team the British-Irish team was to face the next day. The Ioane brothers also star for the New Zealand national team. ""I thought they'd looked familiar, but it didn't click until the dad told me,"" Mr Edwards said. ""People here worship the ground these guys walk on - and I didn't have a clue. ""They were great, really great. Everyone talks about Kiwi hospitality and that's really true in this case.""

Lord Carey resigns after abuse criticism,"Lord Carey has apologised to the victims of Peter Ball The former Archbishop of Canterbury has resigned from his last formal role in the church after a review into historical child sex abuse. Lord Carey was criticised in an independent review of the church's handling of abuse carried out by Bishop Peter Ball, 85, who was jailed in 2015. Dame Moira Gibb's review revealed he had failed to pass information on Ball to the police back in 1992. Justin Welby, current Archbishop of Canterbury, asked for his resignation. Lord Carey had been given a role as an honorary assistant bishop in the diocese of Oxford, a position given to many retired bishops. Ball, former bishop of Lewes and Gloucester, was jailed for two years and eight months in October 2015, after admitting sex offences against 18 teenagers and young men between the 1970s and 1990s. The Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend Dr Steven Croft, said: ""I have met with Lord Carey following the Archbishop's letter to him. ""In light of Dame Moira Gibb's review into the Peter Ball case, Lord Carey has resigned from his role as honorary Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Oxford. ""Lord Carey has accepted the criticisms made of him in the Gibb review and has apologised to the victims of Peter Ball."" Ball was jailed for sex offences against teenagers and young men between the 1970s and 1990s Dame Moira Gibb's review revealed Lord Carey received various letters from families and individuals following the arrest and cautioning of Ball in 1992 for gross indecency, but failed to pass six of them to the police. He also chose not to put Ball on the Church of England's ""Lambeth List"", which names clergymen about whom questions of suitability for ministry have been raised. Ball was released from jail in February after serving 16 months. Dame Moira, a former senior social worker, said there was a failure of the Church to respond appropriately to misconduct over a period of many years. Rt Rev Steven Croft added: ""Along with many others, I have been deeply distressed to read Dame Moira Gibb's report with its narrative of the abuse perpetrated by Peter Ball which remained hidden for so long. ""I hope that the focus of attention will continue to be on the survivors of abuse and offering to them the care and support they need. ""As the Diocese of Oxford we are committed to improving continually the quality of safeguarding and care."" He said the diocese would learn lessons from the review and put its ""recommendations into practice"".

The great intellectual property trade-off,"In January 1842, Charles Dickens arrived on American shores for the first time. He was greeted like a rock star in Boston, Massachusetts, but the great novelist was a man with a cause: he wanted to put an end to cheap, sloppy pirated copies of his work in the US. They circulated with impunity because the United States granted no copyright protection to non-citizens. In a bitter letter to a friend, Dickens compared the situation to being mugged and then paraded through the streets in ridiculous clothes. ""Is it tolerable that besides being robbed and rifled,"" he wrote, ""an author should be forced to appear in any form - in any vulgar dress - in any atrocious company?"" It was a powerful and melodramatic metaphor. But the truth is the case for what Dickens was demanding - legal protection for ideas that otherwise could be freely copied and adapted - has never been quite so clear cut. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Patents and copyright grant a monopoly. Dickens's British publishers will have charged as much as they could get away with for copies of Bleak House. Cash-strapped literature lovers simply had to go without. But these potential fat profits encourage new ideas. Many US editions of Dickens's work - including Bleak House - were pirated copies It took Dickens a long time to write Bleak House. If other British publishers could have ripped it off like the Americans, perhaps he wouldn't have bothered. So, intellectual property reflects an economic trade-off, a balancing act. If it's too generous to the creators, then good ideas will take too long to copy, adapt and spread. If it's too stingy, then maybe we won't see the good ideas at all. This trade-off has always been coloured by politics. The British legal system strongly protected the rights of British authors and British inventors in the 1800s because the UK was then - as now - a powerful force in world culture and innovation. But in Dickens's day, American literature and innovation were in their infancy. The US economy was in full-blown copying mode: they wanted the cheapest possible access to the best ideas that Europe could offer. US newspapers filled their pages with brazen copying - alongside attacks on the interfering Mr Dickens. A few decades later, when American authors and inventors spoke with a more powerful voice, America's lawmakers began to take an increasingly fond view of the idea of intellectual property. Newspapers, once opposed to copyright, now rely upon it. And we can expect to see a similar transition in developing countries today: the less they copy other ideas and the more they create their own, the more they protect ideas. There's been a lot of recent movement: China didn't have a copyright system at all until 1991. The modern form of intellectual property originated, like so many things, in 15th Century Venice. Venetian patents were explicitly designed to encourage innovation. Francesco Foscari was Doge of Venice in 1474 when the Venetian patent statute was introduced The inventor would automatically receive a patent if their invention was useful. The patent was temporary, but could be sold, transferred or even inherited during its lifetime. It would be forfeited if it wasn't used, and invalidated if the invention proved to be closely based on a previous idea. These are all very modern ideas. And they soon created very modern problems. During the British industrial revolution, the great engineer James Watt worked out a superior way to design a steam engine. He spent months developing a prototype, but then put even more effort into securing a patent. His influential business partner, Matthew Boulton, even got the patent extended by lobbying Parliament. Boulton and Watt used it to extract licensing fees and crush rivals - for example, Jonathan Hornblower, who made an even better steam engine yet found himself ruined and imprisoned. Boulton and Watt put a huge amount of effort into protecting their invention The details may have been grubby, but surely Watt's famous invention was worth it? Well, maybe not. The economists Michele Boldrin and David Levine argue that what truly unleashed steam-powered industry was the expiry of the patent, in 1800, as rival inventors revealed the ideas they had been sitting on for years. And what happened to Boulton and Watt, once they could no longer sue those rivals? They flourished anyway. They redirected their attention from litigation towards the challenge of producing the best steam engines in the world. They kept their prices as high as ever, and their order books swelled. Far from incentivising improvements in the steam engine, the patent actually delayed them. Yet since the days of Boulton and Watt, intellectual property protection has grown more expansive, not less so. Copyright terms are growing ever longer. In the US, they were originally 14 years, renewable once. They now last 70 years after the death of the author - typically more than a century. Patents have become broader and are being granted on vague ideas - for example, Amazon's ""one-click"" US patent protects the not-entirely-radical idea of buying a product on the internet by clicking only one button. Amazon's ""one-click"" buying process is now protected The US intellectual property system now has a global reach, thanks to the inclusion of intellectual property rules in what tend to be described as ""trade agreements"". And more and more things fall under the scope of intellectual property - for example plants, buildings and software have all been brought into its domain. What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? TV Dinner: The hidden cost of the processed food revolution Geeks v government: The battle over public key cryptography How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform These expansions are hard to justify, but easy to explain: intellectual property is very valuable to its owners, which justifies the cost of employing expensive lawyers and lobbyists. Meanwhile, the cost of the restrictions are spread widely among people who barely notice it. The likes of Matthew Boulton and Charles Dickens have a strong incentive to lobby aggressively for more draconian intellectual property laws - while the many buyers of steam engines and Bleak House are unlikely to get politically organised to object. The economists Boldrin and Levine havea radical response to this problem: scrap intellectual property altogether,external. There are, after all, other rewards for inventing things - getting a ""first mover"" advantage over your competitors, establishing a strong brand, or enjoying a deeper understanding of what makes a product work. In 2014, the electric car company Tesla opened up access to its patent archive in an effort to expand the industry as a whole, calculating the company would benefit overall. Tesla's Model S was the world's best-selling plug-in electric car for two years in a row, 2015 and 2016 For most economists, scrapping intellectual property entirely is going too far. They point to important cases - such as new medicines - where the costs of invention are enormous and the costs of copying are trivial. But those who defend intellectual property protections still tend to argue that - right now - those protections offer more than enough incentive to create new ideas. Dickens himself eventually discovered a financial upside to weak copyright protection. Twenty five years after his initial visit to the US, Dickens returned, keen to make some money. He reckoned that so many people had read cheap knock-offs of his stories that he could cash in on his fame with a lecture tour. He was absolutely right: off the back of pirated copies of his work, Charles Dickens made a fortune as a public speaker, many millions of dollars in today's terms. Perhaps the intellectual property was worth more when given away.

What comes after 'Oooh Jeremy Corbyn'?,"These days it's not that weird seeing a man born in 1949 rocking the crowds at the Glastonbury Festival. Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits and Richard Hell were all born that year and I am sure they could still get the campers roaring. The novelty value was that it was a politician, Jeremy Corbyn, who was lapping up the love this year. However, the age gap and the ""well, fancy that"" factor have obscured the very real importance of the Labour leader's appearance at the annual music festival. His first big gig since his election triumph (no, I know he didn't win, and yes it was) highlights the reason he's done so well, and flags up the pitfalls ahead. It could mark the point of peak Corbyn. But a big deal? Certainly. It won't get the column inches or hours of airtime and earnest analysis devoted every year to the leaders' speeches at conference time, but it was far more important. They rarely amount to much - trust me I've covered quite a few of them in my time - and they're nearly always forgotten within the week. Mr Corbyn's offering was, to say the least, unusual. And that is the point. He doesn't play the game - and people who can't bear political game-playing love this conscious vibe. Of course, part of its importance was the venue. He wasn't speaking to party press officers and political hacks in a cavernous hall, but live and direct to thousands of people in a muddy field in Somerset. That the rebellious and radical leader of the Labour Party, scorned by the establishment and most of his own MPs, was asked to make a speech, is part of the meaning. The Glastonbury crowd differed greatly from a traditional party conference audience The organisers knew he would be popular. It is obvious that Jezza has become, if not an idol, an object of affection for some younger people. That isn't particularly strange. Strands coexist, neo-liberalism may still rule the world and Glastonbury is an intensely commercial gathering, but Che Guevara is still on people's T-shirts and Margaret Thatcher isn't. Conservatism has rarely been cool, even under Dave Cameron. Corbynmania isn't just retro chic with a dash of post-modern irony. The counter-culture moulded the modern. And - just as Glasto isn't really only for or about the young - this is only the symbolic tip of the Corbyn iceberg. Festivals are largely made up of the unbuttoned middle class, pretty well-heeled, but no less fed up about the future and the society they in which they live, particularly after the Brexit vote. The part of the old Labour coalition who drifted away after Tony Blair's Iraq war. Jeremy Corbyn appears at Glastonbury Populism: Pantomime politics or the public fighting back? All about general election 2017 Profile of Labour's leader But the tone of Mr Corbyn's speech was also really important. He didn't pull that trick of daring but arrogant bands and hit them with new material. He stuck to some of the very old favourites, but there was a freshness for those who've heard thousands of political speeches. There were none of the policy announcements which are catnip to the commentariat and only a couple of disparaging comments about President Trump, but no direct attacks on the Conservatives. There was not much mention of current politics at all in fact - one reference to the Grenfell Tower fire and one about rights of EU citizens and that was about it. Instead, Mr Corbyn might have taken another piece of clichÃ©d advice for bands: it was all full of soul and feeling - from the heart. Appropriately for a festival, there was a lot about love and peace and a better world. A burning sense of injustice, sure, but a steady rhythm optimism running through it - riffs on poetry, art and the wisdom of learning lessons from each other. Warm and fuzzy or pie in the sky? Lying on your back on the grass, that sounds OK. In one sense, it is a very old politics but it is the product of the new politics. Back in 2008, I frequently mused aloud that I knew the financial crisis would produce new political movements - I just couldn't tell what they would be - and 11 years later I have had my answer in spades. Populist politicians like French President Emmanuel Macron have enjoyed recent success Talk of populism has its place but the common thread which ties together Trump and Macron and links Italy's Five Star Movement to Corbyn, is a rejection of the existing political order and what's been tried before. A restless quest for something new, a hope for change. That might sound weird when we have just seen a return to two party politics. But, while the label on the Labour bottle is the same, the contents are very different. It is one of the many ironies of Brexit that Theresa May's analysis was probably spot on. That the vote which turned the British political world upside down wasn't only about the European Union but about people left behind, missing out, ignored by an elite and frustrated. Her mistake - and ours - was to believe that she could capture that spirit. Still, ""Oooh Jeremy Corbyn"" might be as good as it gets for Jezza. This could be peak Corbyn. What lies ahead is tougher - to convince people not only that he's a nice old geezer who's not the horned demon painted by the tabloids, but that he is a potential prime minister. The Labour right's grudging acceptance that he had a good war has yet to translate into anything like helpful support. Many on his team want vengeance. His reshuffle buried no hatchets. Neither right nor left of Labour seem to have heededPaul Mason's acute analysis,external- which suggests giving the right the control of defence and security so the left can own the economy. Theresa May has said she wants to reach out to the ""just about managings"" The critical task is still holding together the fraying coalition at the heart of the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn may be able to combine an appeal to partygoers in luxury yachts and people suffering in tower blocks, but it is much harder for him to reach those who bought their own council houses. Those white working class men on the doorstep shaking their heads and saying ""not while he's leader"" were not a myth. Whenever the next election arrives, there will be more scrutiny of what he would be like as prime minister. It is true the press have thrown everything they have to throw and the more over the top abuse has failed. But expectations were so low that it helped Mr Corbyn. If, this year, people felt they could vote Labour as a protest, to dent Mrs May's predicted immense majority, they won't think that next time. Then again, the Conservatives can hardly warn of the dangers of a weak government with a besieged leader with no authority trying to manage a party pulling in different directions on Brexit. But Labour MPs will be the very last to breezily sing ""Oooh Jeremy Corbyn"". Capturing a sunny mood of righteous rebellion is very far from grasping the keys to No 10.

Trump abandons White House Eid dinner,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L) reportedly rejected a request to hold the annual dinner US President Donald Trump has broken a nearly 20-year-old tradition by failing to host a dinner marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The White House event had been held every year since President Clinton's tenure. The Eid al-Fitr feast ends Ramadan, a period when Muslims fast and focus on charitable giving. But US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly rejected a request to hold a reception. In May, Reuters said Mr Tillerson had refused a recommendation from the State Department's office of religion and global affairs to organise a celebration. Mr Trump has previously been criticised for his use of anti-Muslim rhetoric, including on the campaign trail when he called for surveillance of US mosques. What Trump's team has said about Islam How is the start of Eid determined? In pictures: Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr festival He said in a statement: ""On behalf of the American people, Melania and I send our warm greetings to Muslims as they celebrate Eid al-Fitr. ""Muslims in the United States joined those around the world during the holy month of Ramadan to focus on acts of faith and charity. Now, as they commemorate Eid with family and friends, they carry on the tradition of helping neighbours and breaking bread with people from all walks of life. ""During this holiday, we are reminded of the importance of mercy, compassion, and goodwill. With Muslims around the world, the United States renews our commitment to honour these values. Eid Mubarak."" Mr Tillerson also released a brief statement, sending ""best wishes to all Muslims celebrating Eid al-Fitr"". The dinner has been hosted by three successive presidents, including Barack Obama here in 2015 The first presidential Iftar dinner (the name for a meal held after sunset, when Muslims break their fast), is said to have been hosted by Thomas Jefferson in 1805 for a Tunisian envoy. The subject was covered in a blog post on a US Department of State website,IIP Digital,external. The post, titled ""Thomas Jefferson's Iftar"", appears to have been removed, but is available in archived formhere,external. The idea of hosting a dinner was revived by Hillary Clinton in 1996, when she was First Lady. It became an annual tradition from 1999 and was attended by prominent US Muslim leaders, diplomats and legislators. What Trump team has said about Islam How is the start of Eid determined?

Largest aircraft carrier due to set sail,"Just before midnight, the ship was able to pass under the Forth Bridge The Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier has left its home port for the first time. HMS Queen Elizabeth - one of two new carriers being built at Rosyth dockyard in Fife at a cost of more than Â£6bn - is to begin sea trials. The ship passed under the Forth Bridge just before midnight. It is the largest warship ever built for the Royal Navy. The flight deck alone is the size of three football pitches. Once in service the ship can operate with a crew of 1,000 and 40 aircraft. The 65,000 tonne warship is the Royal Navy's first aircraft carrier since HMS Illustrious was scrapped in 2014. HMS Queen Elizabeth had to wait for low tide to go under the Forth bridges The flightdeck is the size of three football pitches Eleven tugs manoeuvered it out of the dock at Rosyth. It then squeezed through the narrow entrance into the Forth estuary. Once low tide is reached at about 23:00, the warship will have to lower a mast to make it under the Forth bridges - with just a few metres to spare. The project to build HMS Queen Elizabeth and sister ship HMS Prince of Wales cost more than Â£6bn The aircraft carrier weighs 65,000 tonnes and has a top speed of 25 knots Its flight deck is 280m long and 70m wide - enough space for three football pitches The ship is the second in the Royal Navy to be named Queen Elizabeth It will have a crew of about 700, increasing to 1,600 when a full complement of F-35B jets and Crowsnest helicopters are embarked There are 364,000m of pipes inside the ship Both HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales will keep 45 days worth of food in its stores The entire ship's company of 700 can be served a meal within 90 minutes - or 45 minutes when at action station Leaving the Rosyth dock will be among the most difficult manoeuvres in the sea trials with just 50cm between the bottom of the ship and the seabed in the port Commanding officer Captain Jerry Kydd said the ship was important for Britain's reputation as a naval power. ""I think there are very few capabilities, by any country, that are as symbolic as a carrier strike capability,"" he added. ""Submarines you can't see, but these are very visible symbols of power and power projection."" Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: ""This is a historic moment for the UK as our new aircraft carrier takes to sea for the very first time. ""This floating fortress is by far the most powerful ship ever built in Britain that will enable us to tackle multiple and changing threats across the globe. ""HMS Queen Elizabeth is an enduring example of British imagination, ingenuity, invention that will help keep us safe for decades to come. She is built by the best, crewed by the best and will deliver for Britain. ""For the next 50 years she will deploy around the world, demonstrating British power and our commitment to confronting the emerging challenges from a dangerous world. The whole country can be proud of this national achievement. "" This video can not be played The largest and most powerful ship to be built for the Royal Navy is leaving the Rosyth dock for the first time The start of sea trials follows warnings that technical issues and personnel shortagescould delay the deployment of the aircraft carrier. The National Audit Office said in March the project was entering a ""critical phase"", with many risks to manage. The Ministry of Defence acknowledged ""challenges"" but said it was committed to being fully operational by 2026. The technical issues mean the forthcoming sea trials are three months behind schedule. The NAO predicted it would not be operational by 2020, as had been promised by the MoD. The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said that if all went according to plan with the latest developments, HMS Queen Elizabeth would be sailing toward open waters on Monday evening. He said the Royal Navy expected Russia's military to take an interest while the warship was being tested in the North Sea. It will be several years before HMS Queen Elizabeth is fully operational with jets on board.

Politics latest: DUP deal agreed,"DUP agree deal to back Conservative government Theresa May sets out more detail on EU citizens' rights Labour's McDonnell: Grenfell victims 'murdered by political decisions' MPs to continue debate on Queen's Speech Aiden James and Alex Hunt Northern Ireland's devolved government will get access to an extra Â£1bn as part of the agreement. The PM outlines plans designed to address the ""anxiety"" of EU citizens about their status after Brexit. The deal will see the DUP support Theresa May in Parliament and Â£1bn extra cash for Northern Ireland. Here's a recap of the day's major events:  Analysis:  There was also movement on the UK's plans for EU citizens:  You can catch-up with, and watch live, proceedings in Parliament including the statement currently under way in the House of Commons on the Grenfell Tower tragedy withour BBC Parliament colleagues' live coverage.  EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament Lords leader Baroness Evans tells peers the government has ""come out early"" with its proposal on EU citizens' rights, which indicates its ""seriousness"" about finding a solution. She says the cut-off date will be ""a matter for negotiation"" and emphasises it is an ""early priority for negotiations"". Theresa May has set out the government's ""offer"" to EU citizens in the UK, telling Parliament that the government wants them to stay. The prime minister said no EU citizen would have to leave when the UK exits the EU. The government has proposed giving those with five years' continuous residence, at a cut-off date to be determined by negotiations, a ""settled status"". This video can not be played EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament The leader of the Lib Dems in the Lords, Lord Newby, says it's to be ""regretted"" that it has taken so long to set out the government's intentions for EU citizens and ""many questions are still unanswered"". He presses for details of a cut-off point after which citizens will not be automatically entitled to apply for residency, and asks about the possibility of ID cards. House of CommonsParliament Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts says that whilst the prime minister is bribing the DUP to ""stitch up the seams of this threadbare administration"", the government continues to neglect the people of Wales and treat them like third class citizens ""in this so-called family of equals"". If the government can hand out Â£1bn to Northern Ireland in a time of austerity, she says, then ""where is the Â£1.7bn that is now so evidently our right?"" Mr Green replies that under the new funding formula, public spending in Wales is now Â£120 per head for every Â£100 per head in England. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Ed Davey has suggested the plans for EU citizens almost amounts to an ID card scheme. âI have written to the Home Secretary to establish whether this indeed is ID
cards by the backdoor and whether EU nationals will now be required to carry
them on their person at all times. If so have ministers worked out the
practicalities of such a scheme, as well as the cost? The government also needs
to explain how an ID card system works when only a small proportion of the
population will be required to carry them.â EU citizens statement House of LordsParliament Responding to the statement on the proposed deal for EU citizens, Labour's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon tells peers she found David Davis' assurances on how borders would be enforced ""unconvincing"". She tells peers other EU leaders ""don't share"" the prime minister's impression of ""a positive response"" to her proposals on EU citizens' rights. She calls it ""grossly inefficient and disrespectful"" that those who have already applied for residency will now have to apply under the new system. She refers to a ""twilight zone"" of uncertainty for EU citizens over their rights to work and travel. ""It
has taken a full year for the Prime Minister to come up with a half-baked
plan that still leaves in limbo millions of European nationals who have made
their home here. This uncertainty is the result of a dysfunctional Government
that is not acting in the nationâs best interests.  âThe
Government should confirm immediately that all EU citizens in the UK by the
time we leave can stay indefinitely - this needs to be as simple and
comprehensive a process as possible. This will enable UK nationals living in
the EU to also have their futures made certain.""   House of CommonsParliament The DUP's chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is ""a remarkable day"" when the Labour Party criticise investment in schools, roads, housing, jobs as dangerous to the peace process - adding ""it is bonkers to suggest so"". He also adds that Labour frontbenchers should rethink their past comments in support of the IRA and the effect it could have on young people who may be thinking to take up arms in the future. Mr Green replies that it is clear that anything that aids investment for disadvantaged communities will provide a more positive political atmosphere in Northern Ireland. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Tracy Brabin thanks the Speaker for hosting family day in the House of Commons at the weekend, and points MPs towards the new plaque for her predecessor Jo Coxwhich was put up in the Commons chamber by her children.

House of CommonsParliament The DUP's Westminster Leader Nigel Dodds rises to praise a ""good agreement for the UK and a good agreement for all the people of Northern Ireland"" - particularly in mental health and hard to reach areas. He says that his party commits to transparency and that he hopes to one day see published the correspondence from 2010 with the Labour frontbench, and from 2015 with both Labour and the SNP - causing much delight on the Tory benches. The ""faux outrage"", he says that has been heard, ""is hypocrisy of the highest order"". The DUP looks forward to working with government for the next five years, he says - to deliver Brexit, to strengthen the Union and to deliver security. Mr Green responds that it has been ""a life enhancing experience"" and that the government welcome the party's support to strengthen the union and the economy. Stephen Martin, Director General of the Institute of
Directors, said:  âEmployers will welcome the constructive clarity of intent
offered today and businesses look forward to the UK and EU finally getting down
to concrete discussions. âAn aim is obviously not the same thing as a guarantee. Even
today, many of the important details are absent, including information on the
registration process for EU citizens and when the cut-off date will be. More
fundamentally, employers still donât know what will happen to their EU staff if
no deal is reached, questions remain as regards whether or what salary
thresholds will apply for workers and their families wanting to remain in the
UK. Many EU citizens work part of the year in the UK and part overseas, so will
not easily be able to prove their right to remain due to interrupted periods of
residence.  âThe offer of a two year grace period after we leave for
these workers to acquire their right to settled status is welcome, but two
years may not be enough and five years would be better. The obligation on
individuals who have previously received permanent residency to re-apply must
be made as bureaucracy-free as possible, for employers and the individuals
concerned alike."" House of CommonsParliament Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Stella Creasy have asked about the situation of women in Northern Ireland who are currently not entitled to free abortions on the NHS in England. Mr Green has said that this is a devolved matter and therefore an issue for Northern Ireland to decide. Ms Creasy responds that women in Northern Ireland feel as thought they are ""forced to pay the price of a forced marriage"".

Angry demo over death left officers hurt,"People were protesting over the death of Edir Frederico Da Costa, aged 25 Fourteen police officers have been injured and four people arrested in a protest over the death of a young father following a traffic stop. Bricks were thrown and fires were lit outside Stratford bus station and Forest Gate police station in London. Protesters allege Edir Frederico Da Costa, 25, was ""brutally beaten"" by Met Police officers earlier this month. The police watchdog is investigating the treatment of Mr Da Costa, who died six days after he was stopped. Campaigners claim Mr Da Costa suffered serious injuries after being stopped by Met officers in a car containing three people. But the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) last week saida preliminary post-mortem examination ruled out a number of those injuries,external. ""Rigorous investigations"" into the cause of his death were continuing, it said. The police watchdog said it was releasing the information because it was concerned about the ""rapid spread of false and potentially inflammatory information"". The Met Police had earlier said six of its officers had been injured in the protest but released an update on Monday afternoon. It said four officers were taken to hospital for medical treatment. They include a male police sergeant who was knocked unconscious after an object struck his helmet, as well as officers with neck, leg and wrist injuries. All four officers have since been discharged from hospital. Edir Frederico Da Costa died on 21 June Earlier on Sunday evening, Borough Commander Supt Ian Larnder addressed of a group of protesters in an attempt to answer their questions and calm tensions. One protester rode his motorbike up to the police line and revved his engine in front of officers. Another motorcyclist turned his bike towards the officers and span his wheels so that smoke blew towards them. Inquiry into police stop death Protesters, some carrying Black Lives Matter posters, stood in front of a line of riot police Family campaigners said the violence was not coming from them Firefighters, protected by police, put out a fire which had been started in a bin in Richmond Road. Bins were also set alight near a McDonald's in Romford Road. One person was arrested on suspicion of disorder offences, while three other people were held on suspicion of arson and criminal damage. Family campaigners distanced themselves from the violence and insisted the march had been intended as a peaceful demonstration. Campaigners shouted ""we want justice"" as they faced off with police The force said the number of protesters started to dwindle just before 23:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Da Costa, known by friends as Edson, died on 21 June, six days after being stopped in a car in Woodcocks, Beckton, in Newham, east London. In a statement posted on an online GoFundMe page, his family said: ""This is a call for justice, not just for Edson but for all young men that are forgotten and unprotected in this reckless system."" They have called for any witnesses to come forward to the IPCC, in particular anyone with video footage. Nearly Â£5,000 has been raised on the fundraising site. Grime musician Stormzy tweeted#justiceforEdson,externallast Friday. Last week, Mr Larnder said in a statement: ""All police officers are fully aware that they will be asked to account for their actions - officers are not exempt from the law and we would not wish to be. ""I know that Edir's family, friends and the wider community want answers, but it is important that the [IPCC] investigation is allowed to take place to establish the full facts of what happened before any conclusions are made.""

Laura Kuenssberg: The price of holding power,"It wasn't quite five days in May, but at last Theresa May can say she can confidently form a government. The sober faced DUP trio came out of the famous black door just before noon. They have plenty, however, to be happy about. Their negotiations have secured an extra Â£1bn for Northern Ireland over two years - roughly Â£800 for every voter in the province. They have forced the Tories to give up some of their more controversial manifesto commitments. They'll have a ""coordination committee"" - a frequent direct line to the top of the Tory party, all with the chance of going back for more in two years - who knows what will have happened by then. The Tories now face a bumpy day of criticism, about how the DUP have been bought off - Â£100m for each of their ten votes in Parliament. The other devolved nations will cry foul. Some Tories too are deeply uncomfortable about the association with the DUP brand of unionism. And if the cuts are to be eased in Northern Ireland, what about other parts of the country? But the money that's been found down the back of the Number 10 sofa for Northern Ireland may be worth it for Theresa May as the price of holding power, for now. She now has her majority, whatever the cost, and a dividend could be the conclusion of a deal to get power sharing at Stormont up and running too.

Can Modi and Trump recreate Obama magic?,"When Narendra Modi visited the US in 2014 he was greeted in Madison Square Gardens On 26 June, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold official talks with US President Donald Trump in Washington DC in what will be the first meeting between the two leaders. This is not the same country that witnessed roaring chants of ""Modi! Modi!"" at the iconic Madison Square Gardens in New York during the Indian prime minister's first visit to the United States in September 2014. He was then a rock star to India's two million strong diaspora. He is still a star to many Indians in the US and other parts of the world. But times have changed. There is little space for global political stardom in a country led by a president whose tolerance for foreign glamour shows is about as limited as his penchant for anything international. President Barack Obama, who met Mr Modi several times and visited India twice during his presidency, was all about the international. Mr Modi's engagement with the Indian diaspora was not only encouraged but also cheered by officials in the White House. US-India relations flourished under former president Barack Obama The Obama years witnessed the buttressing of trade opportunities between India and the US, partly transformed the defence relationship between the two countries, and paved the way for the operationalisation of what is known as the US-India Nuclear Deal. Further, Mr Obama made clear his unyielding aim to curb carbon emissions. On 2 October 2016, Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary, India handed over an instrument of ratification to join the Paris climate change agreement. Mr Obama's praise was quick to come. He tweeted, ""Gandhiji believed in a world worthy of our children. Modi and the Indian people,"" he argued, ""carry on that legacy."" India's commitment to the agreement was not only about climate change. It was about a pledge to an international system that relies on collective responsibility. Narendra Modi praises India-US relationship Madison Square Garden gig for India's Modi Modi wows Madison Square Garden Since at least the election of President Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, the US has nudged India to work with and within this system. This was impossible for a variety of reasons, not the least because of the need to remain ""free of entanglements,"" as India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru put it. Yet, differences, when they emerged, were managed because of a common sense for each other's vantage points. In the 21st Century, and ever since George W Bush was elected in 2001, the key consideration in the US-India book of relations has been future potential. For Washington's insiders, India was the long game. The promise of Indian economic and military growth, it was surmised, would ultimately serve American interests. A stronger India was expected to partially balance the scales with regards to China's ever-expanding footprint. In return, India was expected to give little in the immediate term. This was about reaping dividends in the future on investments made by America in the present. For the first time in 60-odd years, Mr Trump's election has potentially punctured (if not ended) the underlying contours of this storyline. Visible and quick returns are the new game in Washington. This video can not be played Donald Trump has openly criticised India since becoming president No national leader, Mr Modi included, is likely to be spared. Take for instance Mr Trump's scathing attack on India following the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement. Trump argued that India made its ""participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries"". The White House has also made clear its desire  to reform the H-1B visa that in the past allowed thousands of Indian technology workers to make their way to Silicon Valley. Indian firms in the United States have been quick to announce their desire to hire US workers in a bid to dodge Trump's ire. Meanwhile, corporate America is less-than-optimistic about India's economic progress. The Indian government's recent decision to place price caps on certain pharmaceutical products, hence hurting profit margins for foreign firms that produce these specialised goods, is likely to be one of the many issues raised by CEO's during a round table on 25 June. The Modi government has done more to tie India's coattails to the US political apparel than almost any other in India's past Since taking office, Mr Modi's government has done more to tie India's coattails to the US political apparel than almost any other in India's past. This includes signing a defence logistics agreement and entering international conventions to help allow US firms the possibility of investing in India's nuclear market. Striking a personal bond with Mr Trump may allow Mr Modi the opportunity to explain India's position on contentious subjects like climate change and make a case for H-1B visas. In turn, asking for US assistance on issues seemingly close to the prime minister's heart (such as membership to the Nuclear Suppliers Group) will require ""deals"" that India has been less accustomed to making in the age of promise before Mr Trump. How Mr Modi deals with Mr Trump will partially shape the future of the US-India relationship. Equally, it will say as much about the values he represents as a statesman who, much like Mr Obama, has promoted an international image of himself since his electoral victory in 2014.

Salvador Dali's body âto be exhumedâ,"DalÃ­ died in Spain in 1989 and had no children with his wife A judge in Madrid has ordered the exhumation of the body of Spanish artist Salvador DalÃ­ to get samples for a paternity suit. A Spanish woman, born in 1956, said her mother, a maid, had a clandestine affair with the painter in 1955. The judge said there were no biological remains or personal objects of the artist to be used in the test. He died in Spain in 1989 at the age of 85. The DalÃ­ Foundation, which manages the artist's estate, says it will appeal. The surrealist painter was buried in the theatre and museum he designed himself, in his home town of Figueres in the north-eastern Catalonia region. Maria Pilar Abel MartÃ­nez, a tarot card reader who was born in Girona, made the paternity claim for the first time in 2015. BBC Arts:What is surrealism? Ms MartÃ­nez claims that her mother had an affair with the world-famous painter She said her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in CadaquÃ©s, next to where the painter had a home. Antonia left her job in 1955, moved to a different city and married another man. Ms MartÃ­nez claimed that her mother told her several times that DalÃ­ was her father, on many occasions in front of others. ""The only thing I'm missing is a moustache,"" she once said, according tonewspaper El Mundo (in Spanish).,external At the time of the alleged affair, DalÃ­ was married to his muse Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. The couple had no children. Salvador DalÃ­ is best known for his surrealist works The decision also cites that Ms MartÃ­nez underwent two paternity tests, both in 2007, but never received the results. Her legal action is against the Spanish state, to which DalÃ­ left his estate. If she is confirmed to be the artist's daughter, she could use his surname and be entitled to part of his estate - but Spanish media say she would have to legally request it. Ms MartÃ­nez's lawyer said there was no date for the exhumation, but that it could happen as soon as July. The DalÃ­ Foundationsaid in a statement,externalthat an appeal would ""be lodged in the coming days.""

McDonnell: Grenfell victims were 'murdered',"Labour's John McDonnell has claimed victims of the Grenfell Tower fire were ""murdered"" by ""political decisions"". Speaking at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, the shadow chancellor blamed the decision to ""view housing as only for financial speculation"". At least 79 people are feared to have died in the fire in west London, which began in the early hours of 14 June. Housing minister Alok Sharma said it was ""disappointing"" that people wanted to make it ""a party political issue"". It is thought the building's recently-installed cladding may have helped the fire to spread. The type of insulation material used on the tower is also being investigated, along with suggestions that the way the insulation and cladding was installed could have created a chimney effect. Cladding from as many as 600 tower blocks across England is now being tested for safety. So far,cladding on 60 high-rise buildingsin 25 areas has failed, and none has passed. One of the blocks which failed was Elizabeth House in Wembley - to the ""surprise"" of the building's management company. Noel Brosnan, a company director at Octavia Housing, said: ""This building was constructed in 2013 and at that time we got the assurances that it met and complied with building regulations and it has been signed off by the local authority. ""So of course we were quite surprised and dismayed to hear that this building did not meet building regulations."" More high-rises fail fire safety tests Where have cladding fire tests failed? Holyrood to review tower block safety Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire The prime ministerordered a public inquiryon 15 June and is due to chair a meeting of the Grenfell Tower Recovery Taskforce on Monday. Insulation and cladding taken from Grenfell Towerfailed preliminary safety testslast week. Mr McDonnell with economist Faiza Shaheen and journalist John Harris at the Left Field debate Mr McDonnell, the MP for Hayes and Harlington, was speaking in a panel debate at Glastonbury's Left Field event, chaired by Guardian journalist John Harris. He said: ""Is democracy working? It didn't work if you were a family living on the 20th floor of Grenfell Tower. ""Those families, those individuals - 79 so far and there will be more - were murdered by political decisions that were taken over recent decades. ""The decision not to build homes and to view housing as only for financial speculation rather than for meeting a basic human need made by politicians over decades murdered those families. ""The decision to close fire stations and to cut 10,000 fire fighters and then to freeze their pay for over a decade contributed to those deaths inevitably, and they were political decisions."" A source close to Mr McDonnell confirmed the quotes were accurate. Jim Fitzpatrick, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety, said his Labour colleague's comments were inappropriate. ""Jumping to conclusions and pointing a finger of blame at this point, I think, is somewhat premature,"" he added. Mr Sharma, who replaced Gavin Barwell as the housing minister following the general election, said the cladding in question had been installed over a wide time period and under councils controlled by different political parties. Pressed on a timescale to complete the testing, he said the government was working ""round the clock"" to get the work done. There is the capacity carry out 100 tests a day, he said, but samples need to be sent in as quickly as possible. He said: ""Some councils are acting very quickly and we want all of them to be acting urgently on this."" Mr Sharma also said the government would ""offer support"" to councils, although he wouldn't put an exact figure on financial aid. Over the weekend,Camden Council evacuated 650 people from four tower blocksin Swiss Cottage area, after London Fire Brigade raised concerns about cladding, gas pipe insulation, and fire doors. The four blocks were renovated byRydon between 2006 and 2009- the same company which oversaw the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower from 2015 to 2016. Five high-rise buildings in Sunderlandhad cladding removed as a precautionary measure to ""reassure residents"". Buildings have been also declared unsafe in Doncaster, Norwich, Stockton-on-Tees, Manchester, Plymouth and Portsmouth. In Scotland, Holyrood is going to hold its own investigation into the safety of tower blocks, expanding an ongoing inquiry into housing and building regulations. The Scottish Government has already said that no council or housing association high-rise block has cladding of the type believed to have been used in Grenfell Tower.

Transgender train workers: 'Don't pity us',"A still from the video featuring the Indian transgender train workers A video featuring transgender employees recently hired by a train company has been watched more than a million times. ""Are you surprised to see me?"" one of the workers asks. ""Dressed like this? In this uniform?"" ""When you look at me today, I don't want you to see someone who needs pity,"" says another. The statements by some of the 16 transgender people hired by a local public transport company were featured ina short video that has been viewed more than 1.5 million times,external. The video was posted on the official Facebook page of Kerala state in southern India after the employees were hired to work on a new metro system in the coastal city of Kochi. The metro plans to hire up to 60 transgender people as the rail service expands. Transgender people in India say they face widespread discrimination and violence and that it's not easy for them to find jobs - even though in 2014, the country's Supreme Courtruledthey have equal rights under the law. According to one estimate, there are up to two million transgender people in India. ""My life has changed. I have gone mainstream,"" one of the workers, Jasmine, tells BBC Trending. ""My parents are happy. I feel like a normal human being."" Jasmine, one of the transgender train workers, told BBC Trending: 'My life has changed' Kochi Metro spokeswoman Reshmi CR says the hiring spree was prompted by reports last year of violence against transgender people. The victims complained that a lack of job was pushing them into begging. ""The city commissioner came to us and explained that if not hired, they would drift into trouble,"" Kochi Metro managing director Elias George told the BBC. ""It's been a success. They are doing great work. We are now getting a lot of queries from other employers about hiring transgender people."" BBC Trending onFacebook,external Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Kochi metro rail service. ""They realise they are the flag bearers of the whole community and are aware of the weight of the responsibility,"" George said. Although a few critical comments about transgender beggars were posted on the Kerala Information page, the overwhelming reaction was one of support and encouragement. ""Every Indian state must look into how Kerala is working... great initiative,"" wrote one Facebook user. Another commented: ""Very bold move. They are citizens of our country and government needs to support them to lead a life with dignity."" And one of the recently hired employees said they already have aspirations to go higher. ""I am enjoying the work, but I am not completely happy,"" Neena said. ""I have done a course in hotel management and I expected a higher management position in Kochi Metro."" Despite the outpouring of support, some of the workers have found it difficult to find places to live. ""The government is trying to look for hostels for them,"" said Reshmi CR, the transport spokeswoman. One of the workers told the BBC: ""A landlord asked me to dress up like a man because I look like one... I am continuing with my job because I want to prove myself but some of my friends could not join as they have no place to live.""

DUP-Tory deal signed in Downing Street,"DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Tory Chief Whip Gavin Williamson signed the deal in front of their party leaders A deal between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes an extra Â£1bn in public spending for Northern Ireland. DUP leader Arlene Foster said she was ""delighted"" with the package, which is part of an agreement to prop up Theresa May's minority government. The PM sought the DUP's support after losing her majority in the election. Sinn FÃ©in said the deal was a ""blank cheque for a Tory Brexit"" but any money coming to NI was a ""good thing"". Under the""supply and confidence"" arrangement,external, the DUP guarantees that its 10 MPs will vote with the government on the Queen's Speech, the Budget, and legislation relating to Brexit and national security. Mark Devenport on a 'curate's egg' of a deal The DUP deal: What you need to know Q&A: What you need to know Tory-DUP deal 'major for NI talks' Once the deal was signed in Downing Street, Mrs Foster returned to Northern Ireland, where talks to restore the power-sharing executive continue. The DUP's Nigel Dodds said on Monday evening that the financial package negotiated by his party with the Conservatives is not contingent on the restoration of the Stormont executive. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since March andparties have until Thursdayto find agreement on a range of issues, including the Irish language and how to deal with legacy cases from the Troubles. At the Westminster level, talks between the Conservatives and the DUP began shortly after the general election on 8 June but it took longer than expected to finalise a deal. As well as the financial commitments, the two parties have agreed: No change to the pensions triple-lock or the universal winter fuel payment A Nato commitment of spending 2% of GDP on the armed forces Implementation of theArmed Forces Covenant in Northern Ireland Following the deal, Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams pledged to ""resolutely oppose"" any preferential treatment for British soldiers ""either in terms of legacy or the provision of public services"". Arlene Foster and her DUP team arriving at Downing Street to meet Theresa May In a letter outlining the deal to Conservative MPs, Mrs May said both the DUP and the Tories ""agree the need for additional financial support for Northern Ireland and jointly desire that this will play a positive role in the efforts to re-establish devolved government"". Speaking outside No 10, Mrs Foster said the details of the agreement would ""boost the economy and invest in new infrastructure as well as investing in the future of our health and education sectors"". Health:A minimum of Â£250m, with Â£200m directed to health service transformation and Â£50m towards mental health provision. It will also receive Â£50m to ""address immediate pressures"" Education:Â£50m to ""address immediate pressures"" Infrastructure:Â£400m for projects including delivery theYork Street Interchange, plus Â£150m to provide ultra-fast broadband across Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland's capital budget is currently about Â£1bn per year. Deprivation:Â£100m over five years targeted to deprived communities VAT and Air Passenger Duty tax:Agreed to further consultation Corporation tax:Agreed to work towards devolving the tax to Stormont City deals and Enterprise Zones:Agreed to ""comprehensive and ambitious set"" of city deals and ""limited number"" of Enterprise Zones Read more analysis from BBC News NI business editor John Campbell SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was critical the money was ""targeted at areas of need, not the parochial priorities of one political party"". Stephen Farry, from the Alliance Party, described the agreement as ""significant"", provided any new money was spent ""wisely and strategically"". This video can not be played The chief whips from both parties sign the document Mr Adams said the price of the deal was ""DUP support for continued Tory austerity and cuts to public services"". ""The allocation of additional funds could help to ease the enormous pressure on our public services,"" he added. ""The devil is in the detail."" The agreement has been criticised by politicians in England, Scotland and Wales, who argue spending in Northern Ireland should be matched in other parts of the UK. Money distributed to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is controlled bythe Barnett Formula, which dictates the allocation of funding from Westminster according to population size and what powers are devolved to each nation. Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the deal was ""clearly not in the national interest"" but was designed to help the prime minister ""cling to power"". ""The government must immediately answer two questions,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""Where is the money for the Tory-DUP deal coming from? And, will all parts of the UK receive the much needed additional funding that Northern Ireland will get as part of the deal?"" This video can not be played Damian Green: Cash is to help devolved government Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, suggested the agreement could help Stormont - Northern Ireland's government - negotiate a better deal when the UK leaves the EU. ""An enhanced Northern Ireland voice, articulating an agreed devolved government position, could see more effective and inclusive representation of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland at Westminster,"" Mr Coveney said. Northern Ireland's health service is a big winner from the DUP-Conservatives deal - it will receive about Â£300m that will allow the service some breathing space. Many will argue that it is just a sticking plaster that will not go far enough to see the transformation that is required. The UK government is to allocate Â£50m per year for two years to enable the executive to address immediate pressures in health and education. While Â£50m may sound a lot, in practice that amount of money could be spent very quickly trying to tackle the thousands of people on hospital waiting lists. On top of that, Â£100m per year will be allocated for two years towards transforming the local health service - this will go someway in helping to deliver the recommendations set out in theBengoa health reviewand the Department of Health's subsequent 10-year plan. The big surprise is the money allocated to tackling mental health: Â£10m per year for five years. Concerns have been raised that the DUP-Tory deal could undermine the peace process and devolution negotiations, as a government dependent on the support of the DUP could not be impartial in its Northern Ireland policies. However, Conservative MP and First Secretary of State Damian Green said the deal made it ""more likely"" that devolved government would be restored in Northern Ireland, with the funding going to all communities. Stormont parties have been warned that if they cannot reach agreement on restoring the government, direct rule from Westminster could follow. Northern Ireland's institutions collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©inabout a botched green energy scheme. The late deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, stood down in protest over the DUP's handling of an investigation into the energy scandal,in a move that triggered a snap election in March.

Holland & Barrett sold for Â£1.8bn,"Holland & Barrett, the UK's biggest health food retailer, is being bought by a Russian billionaire for Â£1.8bn. L1 Retail, a fund controlled by Mikhail Fridman, is buying the chain from US private equity firm Carlyle. Carlyle acquired Nuneaton-based Holland & Barrett as part of its $3.8bn (Â£3bn) purchase in 2010 of US firm Nature's Bounty, now NBTY. The chain, which has more than 1,300 stores worldwide, is expected to change hands in September. Holland & Barrett was founded by William Holland and Alfred Barrett in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, in 1870. They initially sold groceries and clothing, but later split the two into separate businesses. The grocery business was sold to Alfred Button & Sons in the 1920s, but the original name was retained. The company eventually started focusing on health foods and changed hands several times. It now employs more than 4,000 people. Is Holland & Barrett a future star? ""Holland & Barrett is a clear market leader in the UK health and wellness retail market, with attractive growth positions in other European and international markets,"" said L1 Retail managing partner Stephan DuCharme. ""We believe that the company is well positioned to benefit from structural growth in the growing Â£10bn health and wellness market and has multiple levers for long-term growth and value creation."" The purchase is the first by L1 Retail, which was set up in late 2016. It aims to invest $3bn in a small number of retail businesses that it believes can be market leaders by ""moving with and leading long-term trends"".

DUP-Tory deal announcement 'in hours',"DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Tory Chief Whip Gavin Williamson signed the deal in front of their party leaders A deal between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes an extra Â£1bn in public spending for Northern Ireland. DUP leader Arlene Foster said she was ""delighted"" with the package, which is part of an agreement to prop up Theresa May's minority government. The PM sought the DUP's support after losing her majority in the election. Sinn FÃ©in said the deal was a ""blank cheque for a Tory Brexit"" but any money coming to NI was a ""good thing"". Under the""supply and confidence"" arrangement,external, the DUP guarantees that its 10 MPs will vote with the government on the Queen's Speech, the Budget, and legislation relating to Brexit and national security. Mark Devenport on a 'curate's egg' of a deal The DUP deal: What you need to know Q&A: What you need to know Tory-DUP deal 'major for NI talks' Once the deal was signed in Downing Street, Mrs Foster returned to Northern Ireland, where talks to restore the power-sharing executive continue. The DUP's Nigel Dodds said on Monday evening that the financial package negotiated by his party with the Conservatives is not contingent on the restoration of the Stormont executive. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since March andparties have until Thursdayto find agreement on a range of issues, including the Irish language and how to deal with legacy cases from the Troubles. At the Westminster level, talks between the Conservatives and the DUP began shortly after the general election on 8 June but it took longer than expected to finalise a deal. As well as the financial commitments, the two parties have agreed: No change to the pensions triple-lock or the universal winter fuel payment A Nato commitment of spending 2% of GDP on the armed forces Implementation of theArmed Forces Covenant in Northern Ireland Following the deal, Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams pledged to ""resolutely oppose"" any preferential treatment for British soldiers ""either in terms of legacy or the provision of public services"". Arlene Foster and her DUP team arriving at Downing Street to meet Theresa May In a letter outlining the deal to Conservative MPs, Mrs May said both the DUP and the Tories ""agree the need for additional financial support for Northern Ireland and jointly desire that this will play a positive role in the efforts to re-establish devolved government"". Speaking outside No 10, Mrs Foster said the details of the agreement would ""boost the economy and invest in new infrastructure as well as investing in the future of our health and education sectors"". Health:A minimum of Â£250m, with Â£200m directed to health service transformation and Â£50m towards mental health provision. It will also receive Â£50m to ""address immediate pressures"" Education:Â£50m to ""address immediate pressures"" Infrastructure:Â£400m for projects including delivery theYork Street Interchange, plus Â£150m to provide ultra-fast broadband across Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland's capital budget is currently about Â£1bn per year. Deprivation:Â£100m over five years targeted to deprived communities VAT and Air Passenger Duty tax:Agreed to further consultation Corporation tax:Agreed to work towards devolving the tax to Stormont City deals and Enterprise Zones:Agreed to ""comprehensive and ambitious set"" of city deals and ""limited number"" of Enterprise Zones Read more analysis from BBC News NI business editor John Campbell SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was critical the money was ""targeted at areas of need, not the parochial priorities of one political party"". Stephen Farry, from the Alliance Party, described the agreement as ""significant"", provided any new money was spent ""wisely and strategically"". This video can not be played The chief whips from both parties sign the document Mr Adams said the price of the deal was ""DUP support for continued Tory austerity and cuts to public services"". ""The allocation of additional funds could help to ease the enormous pressure on our public services,"" he added. ""The devil is in the detail."" The agreement has been criticised by politicians in England, Scotland and Wales, who argue spending in Northern Ireland should be matched in other parts of the UK. Money distributed to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is controlled bythe Barnett Formula, which dictates the allocation of funding from Westminster according to population size and what powers are devolved to each nation. Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the deal was ""clearly not in the national interest"" but was designed to help the prime minister ""cling to power"". ""The government must immediately answer two questions,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""Where is the money for the Tory-DUP deal coming from? And, will all parts of the UK receive the much needed additional funding that Northern Ireland will get as part of the deal?"" This video can not be played Damian Green: Cash is to help devolved government Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, suggested the agreement could help Stormont - Northern Ireland's government - negotiate a better deal when the UK leaves the EU. ""An enhanced Northern Ireland voice, articulating an agreed devolved government position, could see more effective and inclusive representation of the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland at Westminster,"" Mr Coveney said. Northern Ireland's health service is a big winner from the DUP-Conservatives deal - it will receive about Â£300m that will allow the service some breathing space. Many will argue that it is just a sticking plaster that will not go far enough to see the transformation that is required. The UK government is to allocate Â£50m per year for two years to enable the executive to address immediate pressures in health and education. While Â£50m may sound a lot, in practice that amount of money could be spent very quickly trying to tackle the thousands of people on hospital waiting lists. On top of that, Â£100m per year will be allocated for two years towards transforming the local health service - this will go someway in helping to deliver the recommendations set out in theBengoa health reviewand the Department of Health's subsequent 10-year plan. The big surprise is the money allocated to tackling mental health: Â£10m per year for five years. Concerns have been raised that the DUP-Tory deal could undermine the peace process and devolution negotiations, as a government dependent on the support of the DUP could not be impartial in its Northern Ireland policies. However, Conservative MP and First Secretary of State Damian Green said the deal made it ""more likely"" that devolved government would be restored in Northern Ireland, with the funding going to all communities. Stormont parties have been warned that if they cannot reach agreement on restoring the government, direct rule from Westminster could follow. Northern Ireland's institutions collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©inabout a botched green energy scheme. The late deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, stood down in protest over the DUP's handling of an investigation into the energy scandal,in a move that triggered a snap election in March.

Police officers hurt in demo over death,"People were protesting over the death of Edir Frederico Da Costa, aged 25 Fourteen police officers have been injured and four people arrested in a protest over the death of a young father following a traffic stop. Bricks were thrown and fires were lit outside Stratford bus station and Forest Gate police station in London. Protesters allege Edir Frederico Da Costa, 25, was ""brutally beaten"" by Met Police officers earlier this month. The police watchdog is investigating the treatment of Mr Da Costa, who died six days after he was stopped. Campaigners claim Mr Da Costa suffered serious injuries after being stopped by Met officers in a car containing three people. But the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) last week saida preliminary post-mortem examination ruled out a number of those injuries,external. ""Rigorous investigations"" into the cause of his death were continuing, it said. The police watchdog said it was releasing the information because it was concerned about the ""rapid spread of false and potentially inflammatory information"". The Met Police had earlier said six of its officers had been injured in the protest but released an update on Monday afternoon. It said four officers were taken to hospital for medical treatment. They include a male police sergeant who was knocked unconscious after an object struck his helmet, as well as officers with neck, leg and wrist injuries. All four officers have since been discharged from hospital. Edir Frederico Da Costa died on 21 June Earlier on Sunday evening, Borough Commander Supt Ian Larnder addressed of a group of protesters in an attempt to answer their questions and calm tensions. One protester rode his motorbike up to the police line and revved his engine in front of officers. Another motorcyclist turned his bike towards the officers and span his wheels so that smoke blew towards them. Inquiry into police stop death Protesters, some carrying Black Lives Matter posters, stood in front of a line of riot police Family campaigners said the violence was not coming from them Firefighters, protected by police, put out a fire which had been started in a bin in Richmond Road. Bins were also set alight near a McDonald's in Romford Road. One person was arrested on suspicion of disorder offences, while three other people were held on suspicion of arson and criminal damage. Family campaigners distanced themselves from the violence and insisted the march had been intended as a peaceful demonstration. Campaigners shouted ""we want justice"" as they faced off with police The force said the number of protesters started to dwindle just before 23:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Da Costa, known by friends as Edson, died on 21 June, six days after being stopped in a car in Woodcocks, Beckton, in Newham, east London. In a statement posted on an online GoFundMe page, his family said: ""This is a call for justice, not just for Edson but for all young men that are forgotten and unprotected in this reckless system."" They have called for any witnesses to come forward to the IPCC, in particular anyone with video footage. Nearly Â£5,000 has been raised on the fundraising site. Grime musician Stormzy tweeted#justiceforEdson,externallast Friday. Last week, Mr Larnder said in a statement: ""All police officers are fully aware that they will be asked to account for their actions - officers are not exempt from the law and we would not wish to be. ""I know that Edir's family, friends and the wider community want answers, but it is important that the [IPCC] investigation is allowed to take place to establish the full facts of what happened before any conclusions are made.""

Trump snubs annual White House Eid dinner,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L) reportedly rejected a request to hold the annual dinner US President Donald Trump has broken a nearly 20-year-old tradition by failing to host a dinner marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The White House event had been held every year since President Clinton's tenure. The Eid al-Fitr feast ends Ramadan, a period when Muslims fast and focus on charitable giving. But US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly rejected a request to hold a reception. In May, Reuters said Mr Tillerson had refused a recommendation from the State Department's office of religion and global affairs to organise a celebration. Mr Trump has previously been criticised for his use of anti-Muslim rhetoric, including on the campaign trail when he called for surveillance of US mosques. What Trump's team has said about Islam How is the start of Eid determined? In pictures: Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr festival He said in a statement: ""On behalf of the American people, Melania and I send our warm greetings to Muslims as they celebrate Eid al-Fitr. ""Muslims in the United States joined those around the world during the holy month of Ramadan to focus on acts of faith and charity. Now, as they commemorate Eid with family and friends, they carry on the tradition of helping neighbours and breaking bread with people from all walks of life. ""During this holiday, we are reminded of the importance of mercy, compassion, and goodwill. With Muslims around the world, the United States renews our commitment to honour these values. Eid Mubarak."" Mr Tillerson also released a brief statement, sending ""best wishes to all Muslims celebrating Eid al-Fitr"". The dinner has been hosted by three successive presidents, including Barack Obama here in 2015 The first presidential Iftar dinner (the name for a meal held after sunset, when Muslims break their fast), is said to have been hosted by Thomas Jefferson in 1805 for a Tunisian envoy. The subject was covered in a blog post on a US Department of State website,IIP Digital,external. The post, titled ""Thomas Jefferson's Iftar"", appears to have been removed, but is available in archived formhere,external. The idea of hosting a dinner was revived by Hillary Clinton in 1996, when she was First Lady. It became an annual tradition from 1999 and was attended by prominent US Muslim leaders, diplomats and legislators. What Trump team has said about Islam How is the start of Eid determined?

Woman bailed after Newcastle Eid crash,"This video can not be played ""Everybody was in a panic"" A woman has been bailed after six people, including three children, were injured when a car mounted a kerb and ploughed into a crowd of people. The crash happened outside Newcastle's Westgate Sports Centre where an Eid event was taking place. Northumbria Police said four people remained in hospital on Monday being treated for ""various injuries"". The force added that a 42-year-old woman has been released on conditional bail pending further investigation. The incident was not believed to be terrorism-related. Emergency services included six ambulances, two paramedic rapid response vehicles and the air ambulance Of the three children hospitalised, two were in intensive care. The woman who was arrested had been celebrating the end of Ramadan with her family and hundreds of others when the collision happened at 09:14 BST on Sunday. One eyewitness said: ""From what I understand [a woman who had been at prayer] was about to leave in her car and I believe she lost control. ""I ran up straight away because everyone was moving in on all the injured, trying to put water in their mouths. ""The parents of the kids were there. I had to sort of try and calm them down just to tell them the ambulance is there and they will take care of it; they know what they're doing."" Emergency services included six ambulances, two paramedic rapid response vehicles and the air ambulance. In a statement, the nearby Newcastle Central Mosque said: ""We pray and hope that all those affected recover soon fully. ""We thank the emergency medical services, the police and over 100 volunteers from the mosque for their quick response to the incident. ""We urge everyone to please pray for all those affected."" Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central,tweeted,external: ""So sad, I was at the prayers earlier & there were so much joy & unity. Thinking of those affected by what I am told was terrible accident."" People at the scene created a human chain so emergency services could help the injured We were here for Eid. Everyone had just finished praying. The imam had finished his speech and everyone was talking to their families and getting some food. Then we heard a commotion and screaming. I ran up to the hill. A man got out of the passenger side. He seemed distraught. Someone was trapped under the car and then everyone just pushed the car so they were free. They were two children there, one of them - he was a boy about eight - was really badly injured, There were about five doctors there so he had a lot of medical attention. We checked to see he had a pulse. Everyone locked arms so there was a ring of locked arms around the injured people so they had space and the ambulances could get to them. Everyone was distraught. I am very grateful it's not an attack. It's very shocking to see a child injured like that. We are all hoping that he is fine, I just want to hear that. Abdul Mahdoul, who was at the event, said: ""We were wishing everyone happy Eid and suddenly we heard a lot of shouting and screaming. We didn't know what it was. ""People were panicking. The police did a great job to calm the situation down. ""It was a very happy atmosphere beforehand, but afterwards just chaos. I just wish for the people to recover very quickly."" Abdul Mahdoul said a ""very happy atmosphere"" turned into ""chaos"" Councillor Dipu Ahad said: ""We saw people crying and sobbing, it was like what you see in a horror movie, people were crying on the street, in corners. ""It was a real sad situation to see this and I think people were in confusion about what really happened. ""I had tears in my own eyes - it was a day of celebration for Muslims and others as well and it's a very sad situation and I hope this never happens again.""

El Hadji Diouf: 'I am not a bad guy',"El Hadji Diouf now lives and works in his native Senegal El Hadji Diouf is a hero in Senegal. Everywhere he goes, he is mobbed by fans both young and old. His countrymen are still grateful for the stellar role he played during the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. But in England, he is remembered more for his controversial antics than for his football talent. It is a trait that followed him in the English league clubs he played for - from Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers to Bolton Wanderers, with a spell for Rangers in Scotland as well. Diouf was aggressive, spat at opponents and confronted match officials as well as opponents. But now in his retirement, he is telling his story. ""I am a lion, I am a bad loser and it's not wrong to be a bad loser,"" said Diouf of his often combative mood during his playing days. This video can not be played El Hadji Diouf: I'm fit, sexy and helping Senegal ""I have got character and I want people to respect me."" Diouf, who has moved back to the Senegalese capital Dakar, says he was often misunderstood during his playing days in England. He said: ""I am an easy target. It's easy to talk about El Hadji Diouf and I let them talk but I know in my heart I am a good guy. My family know, my population knows, my continent knows I am a good guy and that's the best thing. The rest is not my problem."" Despite this defence, Diouf admits he has done some bad things. When asked why, for example, he used to spit at opponents, he said: ""Maybe they used to tell me something I didn't want to hear. I did that, I paid and now it's finished."" The Senegalese legend had a drawn-out row with former Liverpool team-mates such as Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard. Steven Gerrard and Diouf were Liverpool team-mates from 2002 to 2004 Even today, Diouf and Gerrard continue their feudthrough the media.,externalSo what exactly is the problem? ""I have no problem with him,"" Diouf said. ""He [Gerrard] is a strong character and I am a strong character. ""'Stevie G' was a very good player. People like him in Liverpool but he never did anything for his country. I am Mr El Hadji Diouf, Mr Senegal but he is Mr Liverpool and Senegal is bigger than Liverpool and he has to know that."" Diouf is working in Senegal as a government goodwill ambassador. He is President Macky Sall's adviser on sport as well as running his own sports newspaper business in Dakar - and is often mobbed by young people when he visits his gym in the city. ""My life is about sport but the government cannot do everything alone, they need help from people like me,"" Diouf said. ""The president believes in me and that's why when I finished playing football, he called me and told me he wants me to help because the young generation believe in me. I am an example to them."" President Macky Sall employs Diouf as a sports adviser Asked if he would consider a role in politics, Diouf said he was concentrating on helping to develop his country - but could not rule out entering politics in future. He said: ""I am interested because we have to make things change. People like me can make things change. ""We have a country to build, a continent to build and why not be involved in politics tomorrow?"" The 2002 World Cup gave El Hadj Diouf (centre) his greatest sense of achievement Twice presented with the African Footballer of the Year award by the Confederation of African football (Caf), Diouf was part of the Senegal side which reached the last eight at the 2002 World Cup, beating defending champions France along the way. He describes that period as the greatest achievement of his career - putting it on a par with Diego Maradona's World Cup-winning achievements with Argentina. ""We put Senegal on the world map,"" he said. ""Before the World Cup nobody knew Senegal, but after the World Cup everybody wanted to know where Senegal was. ""What Maradona did for his country is what I did for Senegal. I was one of the biggest men at the 2002 World Cup. ""We were colonised by France. Most of the businesses are run by French people here and to beat them was a big thing for us. ""Before the game, they used to say, 'The reserve team is going to play against the first team' - because most of the players used to play in the French league. ""I used to be at Lens, Salif Diao [was at Sedan], Khalilou Fadiga [was at Auxerre], most of the players played in the French league but we used to say: 'Be careful before you kill the lion.'"" Diouf says he would like to do more to help develop football on the African continent, but feels structural changes need to take place. ""Fifa has changed and now it's time for African football federations to change too,"" he said. This is the first in this week's Where Are They Now? series by Stanley Kwenda, looking at what some of Africa's ex-football stars are doing after hanging up their boots. He will also speak to Salif Diao, Peter Ndlovu, Benni McCarthy and Nwankwo Kanu.

Co-op Bank no longer up for sale,"The Co-operative Bank says it is no longer up for sale, pending an announcement on fund-raising proposals aimed at safeguarding its future. Co-op Bank was forced to put itself on the market in February after it was unable to reach a strong enough footing to satisfy Bank of England regulations. But in June, it said it was in ""advanced discussions"" with a group of existing investors on recapitalisation. Now the bank says the plan has been ""substantially agreed"". The Co-op Bank, in which the Co-operative Group still has a 20% stake, was rescued from the brink of collapse by a group of hedge funds in 2013. In a statement, the bank also said talks were continuing over the separation of its pension fund from the Co-operative Group's scheme. Under the current arrangement, the bank must carry a share of the Co-op Group's Â£8bn pension liabilities, something which is proving unattractive to potential investors. Earlier this year, it reported its fifth annual loss in a row, although the Â£477m deficit for 2016 was an improvement on the Â£610m loss recorded in 2015. When it offered itself for sale, the Co-op Bank blamed low interest rates and the higher-than-expected cost of its turnaround plan for its failure to meet the Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority rules. The Co-op Bank has four million customers and is well known for its ethical standpoint, which its board had said made it ""a strong franchise with significant potential"" to prospective buyers.

NHS hernia mesh 'leaving patients in pain',"This video can not be played NHS hernia mesh felt like 'scratching from inside' NHS England is using mesh to repair hernias which leaves many patients in chronic pain, surgeons have told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. The concerns come afterit emerged that more than 800 womenare taking legal action against the NHS over the use of vaginal mesh implants. One woman said she was left ""screaming on all fours from the agonising pain"". NHS England said mesh implants had been successfully used to treat hernias for several decades. The material is its ""recommended method"" for treating the condition. It is used on tens of thousands of patients every year. A hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue pokes through a gap where muscle has weakened. It most commonly takes place in the groin. The use of mesh involves pushing bulging tissue back into the abdomen and covering it with the material, and can be delivered via open or keyhole surgery. Leila Hackett had an umbilical hernia mesh repair in 2013. ""Straightaway I could feel the mesh,"" she said. ""It was like somebody scratching you from inside your body, it's so unpleasant and constant. ""It started off like fiery burning agony but it never stopped hurting or itching."" Mesh is the NHS's ""recommended method"" for treating groin hernias The mother-of-two spoke to her GP about her pain many times, but was told the mesh was not the problem. Two years later, she was taken to hospital after the material had become stuck to her internal organs, causing her bowel to twist. ""The pain got so agonising I was just screaming on all fours,"" Mrs Hackett explained. During her operation, the surgeon spent four hours picking the material out. ""As soon as I came round, I knew the mesh had been removed because I felt normal again,"" she said. Rapper Professor Green has documented his hernia mesh surgery on social media One in 10 people will develop a hernia, and some experts are concerned about the ""thousands of hernia mesh patients who are living with chronic pain"". Former general surgeon, Peter Jones, from Kent, spent much of his career removing mesh from British groin hernia patients. ""Severe pain is a common problem and patients aren't being warned about it,"" Mr Jones said. ""At least half of patients who have a mesh repair will have a smooth recovery, but in my opinion the risks of a poor outcome are so bad, I wouldn't want to take that risk. ""I think litigation will come into this. If enough people got together and said, 'We are suffering and we weren't warned about it', that could put a dent into the mesh repair for hernias."" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel. Martin Kincey, 39, started experiencing pain in 2011, 12 years after he had a mesh repair for his inguinal hernia. ""I used to play all sorts of sports,"" he explained. ""But now the simplest of movements can be seriously painful. It feels like I have been stabbed with something hot."" Martin has had multiple scans, blood tests and colonoscopies, which have all come back clear. Martin Kincey had a hernia mesh repair in 1999 ""They've ruled out everything this could be, other than pursuing the mesh complications,"" he said. ""There must be thousands of people who are experiencing pain who don't realise it could be the mesh. ""It might not be to blame, but until it's investigated, how can we know?"" While studies show 10% to 15% of groin hernias patients will experience chronic pain following a repair, surgeons say more research is needed for less common hernias. There is a mesh-free alternative for patients with groin hernias, which some surgeons have called for the NHS to teach its staff, so patients can have a choice. The Shouldice hernia repair involves a surgeon overlapping and securing layers of the abdominal wall, once a bulge has been placed back inside a patient's body. The technique was created at the Shouldice Hernia Centre in Toronto, which has a 99.5% lifetime success rate for treating first-time groin hernias. According to NHS Choices, 10% of hernias come back at some point after surgery. However, NHS England said the Shouldice repair was hard to replicate in its hospitals. It said mesh repairs had been undertaken extensively and successfully in the UK for several decades. The Royal College of Surgeons said while ""any poor outcomes are regrettable"", mesh implants were the ""most effective"" way to deal with a hernia.

Police officers injured in London protest,"People were protesting over the death of Edir Frederico Da Costa, aged 25 Fourteen police officers have been injured and four people arrested in a protest over the death of a young father following a traffic stop. Bricks were thrown and fires were lit outside Stratford bus station and Forest Gate police station in London. Protesters allege Edir Frederico Da Costa, 25, was ""brutally beaten"" by Met Police officers earlier this month. The police watchdog is investigating the treatment of Mr Da Costa, who died six days after he was stopped. Campaigners claim Mr Da Costa suffered serious injuries after being stopped by Met officers in a car containing three people. But the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) last week saida preliminary post-mortem examination ruled out a number of those injuries,external. ""Rigorous investigations"" into the cause of his death were continuing, it said. The police watchdog said it was releasing the information because it was concerned about the ""rapid spread of false and potentially inflammatory information"". The Met Police had earlier said six of its officers had been injured in the protest but released an update on Monday afternoon. It said four officers were taken to hospital for medical treatment. They include a male police sergeant who was knocked unconscious after an object struck his helmet, as well as officers with neck, leg and wrist injuries. All four officers have since been discharged from hospital. Edir Frederico Da Costa died on 21 June Earlier on Sunday evening, Borough Commander Supt Ian Larnder addressed of a group of protesters in an attempt to answer their questions and calm tensions. One protester rode his motorbike up to the police line and revved his engine in front of officers. Another motorcyclist turned his bike towards the officers and span his wheels so that smoke blew towards them. Inquiry into police stop death Protesters, some carrying Black Lives Matter posters, stood in front of a line of riot police Family campaigners said the violence was not coming from them Firefighters, protected by police, put out a fire which had been started in a bin in Richmond Road. Bins were also set alight near a McDonald's in Romford Road. One person was arrested on suspicion of disorder offences, while three other people were held on suspicion of arson and criminal damage. Family campaigners distanced themselves from the violence and insisted the march had been intended as a peaceful demonstration. Campaigners shouted ""we want justice"" as they faced off with police The force said the number of protesters started to dwindle just before 23:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Da Costa, known by friends as Edson, died on 21 June, six days after being stopped in a car in Woodcocks, Beckton, in Newham, east London. In a statement posted on an online GoFundMe page, his family said: ""This is a call for justice, not just for Edson but for all young men that are forgotten and unprotected in this reckless system."" They have called for any witnesses to come forward to the IPCC, in particular anyone with video footage. Nearly Â£5,000 has been raised on the fundraising site. Grime musician Stormzy tweeted#justiceforEdson,externallast Friday. Last week, Mr Larnder said in a statement: ""All police officers are fully aware that they will be asked to account for their actions - officers are not exempt from the law and we would not wish to be. ""I know that Edir's family, friends and the wider community want answers, but it is important that the [IPCC] investigation is allowed to take place to establish the full facts of what happened before any conclusions are made.""

Two badly burnt in birthday acid attack,"Resham Khan was left with burns on her arms, legs, face, shoulder by the attack Two people have been left with ""life-changing"" injuries after a corrosive substance was thrown on to them through their car windows. Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar were attacked on 21 June at traffic lights in Beckton, east London. The cousins had been celebrating Ms Khan's 21st birthday before the attack. Both suffered severe burns to the face and body and Mr Muhktar, 37, was placed in an induced coma. No arrests have been made, police said. Both continue to be treated in hospital. Ms Khan has damage to her left eye and required two skin grafts. Mr Muhktar, who has since been brought out of his coma, has burns across his body arms, legs, back, neck and the right side of his face as well as damage to his right eye. Resham Khan has been left with damage to her left eye Resham Khan had just returned from a year abroad as part of her business management degree at Manchester Metropolitan Univesrity Onsocial media,external, Ms Khan said: ""I'm devastated. I keep wondering if my life will ever be the same. Acid attacks in the UK are unheard of for me. ""The pain was excruciating. I was struggling to close the window. My cousin struggled to get us away. I saw my clothes burn away in front of me."" According to police the two had stopped at traffic lights during their drive when the man approached them and threw the toxic substance at Ms Khan through the window. The attacker then circled around the car and threw more of the acid at Mr Muhktar, before eventually fleeing the scene. In 2016-17, there were 398 victims of crimes involving ""noxious or corrosive"" substances, such as acid. This compares with 146 in 2012-13. Violence with injury is the main offence to have seen a rise. In each of 2015-16 and 2016-17, there were 191 victims, compared with 67 in 2014-15. Noxious or corrosive substances have also been used in five rapes between April 2012 and March 2017. Not all these incidents will involve acid. Because of the way the Metropolitan Police recorded the data, the figures show all victims of crimes where any ""noxious or corrosive"" substances were used. The force released the figures under the Freedom of Information Act.
