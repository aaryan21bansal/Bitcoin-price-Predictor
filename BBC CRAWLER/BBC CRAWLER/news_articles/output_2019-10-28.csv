Five royal secrets revealed by the Queenâs dresser,"The Queen's dresser Angela Kelly (far right) and the monarch have a shared interest in fashion Secrets of serving the Queen have been revealed in a new book by one of Her Majesty's closest aides. Angela Kelly has written a behind-the-scenes account of her years as the Queen's official dressmaker and friend. Unusually, The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, The Dresser and the Wardrobe is authorised by the monarch. Its blurb says: ""The Queen has personally given Angela her blessing to share their unparalleled bond with the world"". Interesting titbits from the book are serialised this week in celebrity magazine Hello. So what have we learnt? 'An irreparably changed relationship' for princes Celebrities who misbehaved in Buckingham Palace Why is Prince Harry comparing Meghan to his mum? In her book, Ms Kelly, who has dressed the Queen since 2002, confirms reports the Queen employs a royal assistant to wear in her new shoes are accurate - and that she is the ""flunky"" that does it. Ms Kelly writes: ""The Queen has very little time to herself and not time to wear in her own shoes, and as we share the same shoe size it makes the most sense this way."" The James Bond skit for London 2012 saw an actor playing the Queen skydive into the Olympic Stadium Ms Kelly says that the offer for Her Majesty to appear in a skit alongside Daniel Craig's James Bond was considered by the Queen for just ""five minutes"" before she accepted. ""She was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately. I asked then if she would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: 'Of course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me',"" Ms Kelly recalls. ""I asked whether she would like to say: 'Good evening, James,' or: 'Good evening, Mr Bond,' and she chose the latter, knowing the Bond films. Within minutes, I wasâ¦ delivering the good news to [director Danny Boyle] - I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queen's only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line: 'Good evening, Mr Bond.'""

The colour of the Queen's hat at Royal Ascot inspires a flurry of bets The Queen's annual appearance at Royal Ascot is a much-watched affair. And it is not just the horses that the crowds keep an eye on - people place bets on the colour of the monarch's hat. After learning such a bet had been placed one year, Ms Kelly says she agreed with the boss of a bookmaker on a closing time for wagers, and even laid out decoy hats in the palace to avoid the real colour being identified early. Ms Kelly wrote: ""I had a meeting with the owner of Paddy Power at which we agreed that betting on the colour of the Queen's hat would be closed at a certain time to avoid any cheating, but allowed people to carry on guessing the colour of the Queen's hat and perhaps even win a bit of money."" This video can not be played When Michelle Obama hugged the Queen Reports that the Queen ""abandoned"" royal protocol when she returned former First Lady Michelle Obama's hug in 2009 were far from accurate, Ms Kelly says. ""In reality, it was a natural instinct for the Queen to show affection and respect for another great woman, and really there is no protocol that must be adhered to,"" she wrote. ""When fondness is felt or the host of a State Visit goes to guide Her Majesty up some steps, it truly is about human kindness, and this is something the Queen will always welcome warmly. Anyone who is close to Her Majesty is not a threat and is certainly trusted."" Mrs Obama wrote in her memoir, Becoming, that the moment came as the pair agreed a long day wearing heels had left them with sore feet. We were just ""two tired ladies oppressed by our shoes"",she added. Prince Louis wears the christening gown replica last year Ms Kelly reveals how ""strong"" Yorkshire tea helped to recreate a replica of the royal christening gown which was first used for the christening of James, Viscount Severn, in 2008. ""To make sure it looked authentic we dyed it in Yorkshire tea (the strongest, as we all know),"" Ms Kelly wrote of the piece. ""We placed each piece of lace in a small bowl, from the Dressers' kitchen, filled with cool water and a tea bag and left it for about five minutes, checking regularly until the colour was perfect.""

Labour's Keith Vaz faces six-month suspension,"Labour MP Keith Vaz ""disregarded"" the law by ""expressing a willingness"" to help buy cocaine for male prostitutes, the Commons standards body has found. It said there was ""compelling evidence"" he offered to pay for a class A drug and had paid-for sex in August 2016. It is recommending he be suspended for six months after he was ""evasive and unhelpful"" during the investigation. Mr Vaz would not comment on his future but said he was receiving treatment for a serious mental health condition. A statement later issued by his office said Mr Vaz had cooperated at all stages of the inquiry and he had been admitted to hospital on Monday. If MPs vote to approve the committee's recommendation, Mr Vaz would be subject to a recall petition which could trigger a by-election if supported by 10% of his constituents. Keith Vaz police investigation closed Keith Vaz - the 'Teflon politician' MP Keith Vaz 'bullied Commons clerks' Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, whose complaint triggered the investigation, told BBC East Midlands Today: ""The wheels of justice have moved slowly but inexorably to the right conclusion. ""The report is damning regarding Keith Vaz's conduct and only needs rubber stamp from parliament now. ""Hopefully, this is the end of the line for Keith Vaz, I don't think he's fit to be representing anywhere in this place, I think he's been a malign influence on local and national politics for too long."" A spokesman for Mr Vaz said the Leicester East MP had been treated for a serious mental health condition ""for the last three years as a result of the events of 27th August 2016"". ""He has shared all the medical reports in confidence with the committee. He has nothing further to say on this matter other than what was said in his oral and written statements to the committee and to the commissioner."" The police declined to take action against the MP following an investigation in 2016. In a scathing report,external, the committee said there was ""convincing evidence"" that Mr Vaz was ""evasive or unhelpful"" during an investigation into his conduct by Commons standards commissioners Kathryn Hudson and Kathryn Stone. A statement on Mr Vaz's website ""vigorously"" rejected this allegation and said he cooperated at ""all stages of this process"". ""He holds the standards system in the highest regard and with the highest respect,"" it said. The revelations, first reported by the Sunday Mirror, led to Mr Vaz standing down as chairman of the Home Affairs Select committee - which at the time was conducting an inquiry into drug policy. It was alleged the MP had met two men at his London flat to engage in paid-for sex, and that during this encounter - which was covertly recorded by one of the men - he offered to buy illegal drugs for a third person to use. In her report, the commissioner said the recording ""contains evidence of Mr Vaz's apparent willingness to purchase controlled drugs for others to use"". ""While his comments regarding this may not amount to a criminal offence, he shows disregard for the law and that, in turn, is disrespectful to the House and fellow members, who collectively are responsible for making those laws."" At the time, Mr Vaz said he had met the men to discuss the redecoration of his flat. But the cross-party committee said Mr Vaz's characterisation of the meeting - in which he reportedly posed as a washing machine salesman - was ""not believable and ludicrous"". The MP's claim during the inquiry that his drink may have been spiked and that he had since suffered memory loss about the incident were ""not relevant"", the report found. The MP's conduct in relation to illegal drugs and his behaviour during the investigation caused ""significant damage"" to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons, it said. He had ""failed repeatedly to answer direct questions, gave incomplete answers and an account that was, in parts, incredible"" - actions which constituted a ""very serious"" breach of the MPs' code of conduct. Keith Vaz used to chair the influential Home Affairs Select Committee ""Mr Vaz has done his best to complicate, obfuscate and confuse the inquiry through arguments of little merit and documentation of dubious relevance,"" it said. The committee said its aim throughout was ""to establish whether the rules of the House have been complied with, not to investigate Mr Vaz's private life or to pass judgement on issues of sexual morality"". Mr Vaz, a former Europe minister under Tony Blair, was suspended from the Commons for one month in 2002 after being found to have obstructed a standards watchdog's investigation into his financial affairs. The committee said it had taken this into account in recommending the longer suspension, as well as the fact that as chair of the Home Affairs committee there was an extra onus on Mr Vaz to set a ""good example"" to other MPs.

In a candid Twitter thread,,externalhe said the platform could be an ""unforgiving place for people with unseen challenges"". The MP for Hove and Portslade, who was elected in 2015, said he gets picked up on his tweets every day. ""Mostly it's kindly or humorous which is appreciated.

France's richest man makes $14.5bn bid for Tiffany,"Audrey Hepburn's aspiring socialite Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's made the jeweller a household name US-based Tiffany says it is ""reviewing"" a takeover offer worth about $14.5bn (Â£11.3bn) from the world's biggest luxury goods company, LVMH. The companies confirmed the offer in separate statements on Monday, with the 182-year-old Tiffany saying there are currently no talks. LVMH, owned by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, has brands including Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Bulgari. Jewellery has been one of the fastest growth spots in the luxury sector. In a two-sentence statement,externalearly on Monday, LVMH said it ""confirms that it has held preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany,"" adding that there is no certainty of a deal. A few hours later Tiffany, listed on the New York Stock Exchange,said it ""has received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from LMVH"" of $120 per share in cash,external. Reports at the weekend said cash-rich LVMH, which also owns Kenzo, Tag Heuer, Dom PÃ©rignon, Moet & Chandon, as well as Louis Vuitton handbags, made a preliminary offer for Tiffany earlier this month. A takeover would be LVMH's biggest deal since buying the Bulgari brand in 2011 for $5.2bn. Bernard Arnault and Donald Trump at the official opening this month of an LVMH factory in Texas ""LVMH's attempt to put a $14.5bn ring on Tiffany, having already added Bulgari a couple of years ago is likely to take the fight in this sector to its closest rival Richemont, who owns Cartier, and would help LVMH in gaining better access to US markets,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. As part of its push for a bigger share of the US market, LVMH has opened a factory in south Texas, which was officially inaugurated this month in ceremony attended by Mr Arnault and US President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka. Tiffany's flagship New York store is next to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue. Founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany, the company's fame was sealed after the release of the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's, staring Audrey Hepburn and loosely based on Truman Capote's novella of the same name. Global demand for LVMH's products has held up well in recent years, but the same cannot be said for Tiffany, whichhas seen worldwide sales fall. Like several luxury firms, analysts say Tiffany may have been caught out by the US-China trade dispute and rise in tariffs. It has also been hit by lower spending in its retail outlets by Chinese tourists. The Louis Vuitton brand is known for its signature handbags LVMH has 75 brands, 156,000 employees and a network of more than 4,590 stores. Tiffany employs more than 14,000 people and operates about 300 stores. News of LVMH's offer sent Tiffany's share price surging more than 31% to nearly $130. A $14.5bn offer is worth about $120 a share, but analysts said LVMH could afford to go higher, and Credit Suisse estimated that Tiffany was worth about $140 a share. LVMH rival Kering has been looking to expand in the jewellery sector too, and has launched high-end jewellery lines for its fashion brand Gucci. Switzerland's Richemont, meanwhile, a sector leader with labels such as Cartier, has also been adding to its portfolio, and recently acquired Italy's Buccellati. But, said analysts at Jefferies, ""Tiffany is potentially the biggest prey and the only US global luxury brand"".

Driver in court over 39 lorry deaths,"Maurice Robinson appeared via video-link charged with 39 counts of manslaughter A driver accused of the manslaughter of 39 people found dead in a lorry was part of a ""global ring"" of people smugglers, prosecutors have alleged. Maurice Robinson, from Craigavon, was remanded in custody at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. The 39 bodies were found in the lorry trailer on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, on Wednesday. Writing in a book of condolence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the world had been ""shocked by this tragedy"". Mr Robinson, of Laurel Drive, appeared via video-link and is charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. Prosecutor Ogheneruona Iguyovwe described the conspiracy charges as ""a global ring"" involving ""the movement of a large number of illegal immigrants into the UK"". Mr Robinson was not asked to indicate pleas and will next appear at the Old Bailey on 25 November. DNA tests are being carried out in Vietnam to help to identify the victims. Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed a book of condolence The prime minister was joined at Thurrock Council's offices by Home Secretary Priti Patel and members of the emergency services. Writing in the book of condolence, Mr Johnson said: ""The whole nation, and indeed the world had been shocked by this tragedy and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country. ""In condemning the callousness of those responsible for this crime, we in the government of the United Kingdom resolve to do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators to justice."" Richard Galpin, BBC News Home Secretary Priti Patel and Boris Johnson laid flowers in tribute to the people who died Inside the modern Thurrock Council chamber, surrounded by aides and officials from the emergency services, Boris Johnson bent down to write his message of condolence to the families of the 39 men and women who died inside the sealed container last week. He hesitated briefly before starting to write a long message expressing the shock in this country and beyond of what had happened. Other officials followed in what was a solemn occasion carried out in silence. The prime minister and home secretary then laid flowers in a small garden outside the council offices before heading back to central London. Ms Patel later told the House of Commons there would be an ""increased presence"" of Border Force officers at Purfleet, the Essex port where the container arrived. She also said an agreement had been reached with Belgian authorities to send additional immigration officers to Zeebrugge. The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Three other people arrested in connection with the deaths were released on bail on Sunday. Another driver, who is suspected of bringing the container to Zeebrugge before it crossed the Channel, was arrested at the port of Dublin on Saturday on unrelated charges. But Irish police, who are liaising with their Essex counterparts, said the man was the driver of a blue truck seized at Dublin port as part of the ongoing investigations into the 39 deaths. The blue truck cab was seized by police in Dublin The families of Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong are concerned they may be among the victims Detectives in Essex are now working on the largest mass fatality victim identification process in the force's history. Initially, police said the 31 men and eight women were Chinese but a number of Vietnamese families have described how they fear their loved ones are among the dead. Some of the victims are said to have paid thousands of pounds to guarantee their safe passage to the UK, from where they would be able to carry out work that would give them money to send home. Reuters reports that the UK government has sent documents to Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security in a bid to identify four of the 39 victims. Essex lorry deaths: What we know Lorry death agony builds for Vietnamese families Families in the country have shared their fears their loved ones could have been among those who died. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on Tuesday night, saying her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". Meanwhile, Nguyen Dinh Gia said he had not heard from his son Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, since he told him last week he was trying to join a group to get from Paris to the UK. Detectives are also investigating claims the lorry could have been part of a convoy of three carrying about 100 people.

Blowing the whistle on dirty money 'wrecked my life',"Lawyer Anna Waterhouse Anna Waterhouse was a high-flying lawyer at Deutsche Bank in Dubai. Now she's unemployed. Amjad Rihan was a partner at the accountancy giant EY's Dubai office. He also lost his job and hasn't worked for more than five years. They both say their lives were destroyed after they flagged up suspicious activity at a major gold refiner in Dubai - Kaloti. A joint investigation between BBC Panorama and French media company Premieres Lignes shows they were right to be suspicious. Anna and Amjad didn't know it at the time but had stumbled upon evidence of an organised crime group using gold sales to Kaloti to launder British drug cash. EY, Deutsche Bank and Kaloti have all denied any wrongdoing. In 2013, Amjad was leading an audit into Kaloti's supply chain for EY. Former EY partner Amjad Rihan His team found Kaloti had weak checks on its suppliers - and was handing out extraordinary amounts of physical cash for gold. ""My team started conducting these audits and it's really shocking what they were finding,"" he said, ""Kaloti has done more than $5.2bn (Â£4bn) in cash in one year. Money-laundering 101 tells you not to use cash. Cash increases the risk of money-laundering."" A few miles away, Anna, Deutsche Bank's general counsel and head of compliance in Dubai, was getting suspicious about Kaloti's cash too. Panorama has seen a transcript of a Dubai court case in which she says ""never before had I seen such a catalogue of suspicious circumstances"". She told Panorama: ""A colleague came into my office and described a call from a local bank in Dubai. Apparently they had called to ask, 'Are these guys, Kaloti, are they good guys? Are we safe doing business with them?' I was surprised. That's very unusual. ""The guys at the bank had noticed that Kaloti had been withdrawing very large amounts of money, so large that they had to remove this physical cash in wheelbarrows. The case involved the withdrawal of large amounts of cash ""They said: 'We can see that quite a lot of this money is being funded by a Deutsche Bank account.'"" BBC Panorama's joint investigation with Premieres Lignes shows that cash from Kaloti was a crucial part of a $250m money-laundering operation which used gold sales to launder cash from British and European drug deals. In all, 27 members of the money-laundering gang were jailed in France in 2017. The crime boss behind it, Nour Eddine Ech-Chaouti, remains on the run in Morocco. Documents seen by Panorama show Kaloti bought 3.6 tonnes of gold from a company owned by a member of the gang in 2012 alone. The gold refiner paid the company $146m in cash. The money-laundering could have been stopped years earlier if concerns raised by the two whistleblowers had been investigated properly. Anna Waterhouse reported her suspicions about Kaloti's cash withdrawals to the local money-laundering authorities. It was a decision that would wreck her life. First, she told the Anti-Money-Laundering Suspicious Cases Unit at the Central Bank of the UAE. She says they didn't investigate Kaloti - but turned on her and the bank instead. ""When I explained these very serious concerns, I was straight away met with the accusation that you must have done this. How else would you know? And of course it's ridiculous,"" she said. ""Why on earth would anybody run into the head of the Anti-Money-Laundering Suspicious Cases Unit to tell them that they'd laundered [money]? It's absurd."" Anna also reported the suspicions to another regulator, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). It polices anti-money laundering regulations in the Dubai International Finance Centre. ""Neither regulator that I had reported it to actually seemed to investigate the suspicions about Kaloti, but each regulator started investigating the bank,"" she said. ""That was the start of what became a very, very wide-ranging investigation which to me seemed like a giant fishing expedition, intended to find a problem of any sort within the bank. What I didn't realise at the time was that I was also the focus individually of their investigation."" The DFSA investigation found bankers in Deutsche Bank's Dubai office had broken regulations in a separate case involving its private wealth division. No clients lost money, but the breach of the rules meant the bank, and its senior managers, faced serious sanctions. The transcript of the Dubai court case suggests Deutsche Bank bosses sacrificed Anna and saved themselves. It shows the managers discussed a plan to ""offer up Ms Waterhouse"" to ""express settle everything for the bank"". The leader of the money-laundering gang is still on the run The bank escaped with a reduced fine and Anna was the only manager sanctioned by the DFSA. She's now appealing through the courts. ""I've been a victim in all of this. It's cost me my career. It's cost me the last six years of my life. It has caused myself and my family untold suffering and nobody seems to care. They don't even seem to have a conscience about what happened,"" she said. The DFSA said it had no part in any plan to offer up Anna Waterhouse. It said there was ample reason to take action against her and the decision was made in good faith. It said it was not motivated by her decision to report suspicious activity. Deutsche Bank told Panorama it disagrees with the depiction of its treatment of Anna Waterhouse. It said this matter was thoroughly investigated more than five years ago by the bank, external advisors and the DFSA but it would be inappropriate to comment further because of the legal action. The bank said: ""We take our anti-money-laundering responsibilities very seriously and have taken extensive steps to further strengthen our controls."" Amjad Rihan wanted to blow the whistle on Kaloti too - but says his EY bosses wouldn't do it. He said: ""If you identify a suspicious transaction, you should report it to the authorities. What we identified was way beyond suspicion. Instead of reporting the crimes that I told them about, my bosses just covered them up."" EY contests Amjad Rihan's allegations Amjad fled Dubai because he was worried that his attempts to blow the whistle on Kaloti could get him in trouble with the Dubai government. He is suing EY, claiming he was ostracised and labelled a trouble-maker, then forced from his job by being pressured to return to Dubai. He said: ""Since I lost my career and I was pushed out from EY, I haven't been able to earn much money. And it's been really, really tough on us as a family financially. It's been years in court, really in order for me to carry on with life, I try not to think about how tough it is."" EY says Amjad has raised certain unfounded allegations in the court claim, which is being vigorously defended. EY also says it is confident that all legal and reporting obligations have been complied with, and that it had delivered its findings to the relevant regulator in Dubai:  ""It was the work of EY Dubai that brought to light Kaloti's non-compliance with the applicable regulations and ultimately resulted in the remediation of the issues."" Kaloti says it conducted all appropriate anti-money-laundering checks. And it would ""never knowingly enter into a trading relationship with any partyâ¦ engaged in financial impropriety or criminal activity of any kind"". It said cash payments were common in Dubai but it no longer buys gold for cash. The financial system is supposed to keep dirty money out. But the two people who tried to blow the whistle about the suspicious activity in Dubai both feel they have been punished. Anna's dispute with the DFSA has now been going on for six years. If her appeal isn't successful, she won't be able to work in financial services or the legal profession again. ""Frankly, it's changed me as a person because I find it extremely difficult to trust in authority or to trust in people,"" she said ""I've been let down by so, so many people that I find it extremely difficult to trust anybody anymore.""

Adler: Is this the final Brexit delay?,"The EU has told Boris Johnson to select a UK candidate for the new European Commission Boris Johnson has now written to the EU accepting a new Brexit extension until 31 January. But do EU leaders believe this will be the last delay before Brexit? In his letter to Brussels, the UK prime minister urges the EU to make clear that a further extension beyond January is simply not on offer. EU leaders, though, are highly unlikely to do as the PM asks. Why? Well, in this very long Brexit process, there have been so many false dawns. More than three years on since the UK voted to leave the EU, the issue of ""Brexit: yes or no and if yes, then what kind of Brexit?"" has yet to be resolved in the UK. Can anyone guarantee that it will definitely have been resolved in three months' time? Or that the newly negotiated Brexit deal will have been ratified by the UK Parliament and the EU Parliament by then? They can't. And what has been the main focus of the EU in these many months of negotiations? To avoid a politically and economically damaging no-deal Brexit, while safeguarding the bloc's core interests. Which is why the EU will want to keep the possibility of another extension up its sleeve come January. Not because EU leaders relish the idea. Quite the opposite, actually. In the EU's ideal world, if the UK is definitely leaving (which EU leaders assume it is), then MPs would now be forced to focus on the new Brexit deal. They would then ratify the deal along with the European Parliament, meaning that the UK's exit process was finished and phase two of Brexit could begin: negotiations for a comprehensive EU-UK trade deal. What's going on with Brexit? What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? But if that doesn't happen and a UK general election proves inconclusive when it comes to Brexit, EU leaders want the option of another Brexit delay in their back pocket to avoid a no-deal scenario. Even if EU leaders were to acquiesce, do what Mr Johnson has asked and solemnly declare that this was ""the last extension, honest!"", then you'd know they had their fingers crossed behind their backs. It would be a promise easily broken under pressure. Rather like the EU's insistence that it would ""never reopen the withdrawal agreement"" negotiated with Theresa May. Essentially the EU makes compromises when it believes it has little choice and when those compromises are not really harmful to the bloc. Reopening the Brexit withdrawal agreement for renegotiations? ""A pain but do-able,"" thought the EU, if, as Mr Johnson initially threatened, the alternative was no deal at all. Another Brexit extension? ""A bore and more costly uncertainty,"" thinks the EU, ""but less costly than a no-deal Brexit"". Note though, that in the recent renegotiations, the EU was not willing to compromise on single market exposure on the island of Ireland. Despite the no-deal threat. That is why deal-hungry Prime Minister Johnson backed down over the customs issue and accepted the EU proposal of a customs border in the Irish Sea. His red line was broken there, not theirs. Brexit dance goes on as EU approves new extension Now, as they prepare to sign off individually on the new Brexit extension (a mere formality at this stage) EU leaders have a sinking sense that not only is another Brexit extension beyond this one a possibility, but so is the risk of having to re-re-open the Brexit withdrawal agreement again following a general election in the UK. This video can not be played EU negotiator ""happy"" Brexit extension has been granted Brussels would never openly admit to this now. But the possibility cannot be ruled out completely. For now, the EU must stand again at the sidelines and watch to see where the unfolding drama in Westminster takes them. One outstanding EU prod for the prime minister: he's been told to select a UK candidate for the new European Commission, expected to take over in a month or so. It seems an almost perverse request, considering the UK has at least one-and-a-half feet out the door by now. But just as it appeared questionable for the UK to take part in European elections back in April, the incoming European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen insists she needs a UK commissioner in her team to avoid compromising the EU in legal terms as long as the UK remains a member.

What happens next with Brexit?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

This page is no longer being updated.You can see the latest poll tracker for the UK general election due to be called in 2024 by clicking here. Over the course of the campaign almost every single poll has had the Conservatives ahead by at least 6%. So if they don't end up with the most votes it would be a serious failure. Labour have consistently been in a clear second place, a long way ahead of the Liberal Democrats in third. The Brexit Party started the campaign at around 10% of the vote but have fallen back dramatically - in part as a result of their decision not to contest Conservative-held seats. In Scotland the picture is very different. In the few polls there have been, the SNP has always had a commanding lead with the Conservatives in second place. Again, if that's not the result then the polls will have been badly flawed. For most of the campaign there have been marked differences between the polling companies. But all of them have suggested that the race has narrowed in the final two weeks. Out of 100 people who are likely to vote, about... Please upgrade your browser or enable JavaScript to see the full interactive experience There's about a 90% chance that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown above, which means there's a one in 10 chance that it lies outside these ranges. * Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margins of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be less than +/- 1% What most polls don't tell us is how votes will be converted into seats in the House of Commons. There have been several attempts to do this, though, using large polling samples which allow complex analyses of the levels of support for each party among different demographic groups. The central forecast of the final YouGov projection is a Conservative majority of 28. But it's important to look at the range of possible outcomes their analysis implies. For the Conservatives that range is 311-367 seats. So, on this basis, another hung parliament cannot be ruled out - and neither can a large majority. The BBC won't report on any polls that come out on polling day so this will be the final update to the poll tracker. The exit poll, commissioned by the BBC, ITV News and Sky News will be published when voting ends at 22.00 GMT on Thursday night. Compare where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election manifesto guide Going into the last few days of the election campaign the Conservative lead over Labour remains solid. The latest polls all put the Conservatives in the low to mid-40s and Labour in the low 30s in percentage terms across Britain as a whole. The Lib Dems are in a narrow 11-14% range and the Brexit Party are in low single digits - a long way down compared to where they started. Over the course of the campaign, both of the main parties have seen their poll ratings go up but the gap between the two is more or less where it was five weeks ago. As Sir John Curtice has pointed out, if the result on Thursday is in line with these numbers then the Conservatives are probably on course for a decent majority in the House of Commons. There should be a few more polls to come over the next three days - as well as another YouGov seat projection - so that could still change. But there would have to be a pretty big shift to point to a different overall result. Of course, they could all be systematically wrong - it wouldn't be the first time if that turned out to be true. But if you're using the polls as a guide to what could happen then their message is clear. The latest batch of polls lends more weight to the suggestion that the Conservative rise, which has been a consistent feature of the election campaign, has levelled off. That doesn't mean they can't go up any further, but for the time being it seems as though support for them is fairly static. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is still moving upwards - apparently mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. If this trend continues, then we could be on course for another election where the two biggest parties capture a very large share of the overall vote. It would still need another big move, though, to reach the 84% that the Conservatives and Labour achieved between them in 2017. And there are only ten days to go. Our poll tracker smoothes out the bumps in polling by including old polls. Their influence decays, halving every week, but that still means our rolling average can look a little behind the latest figures. The differences are all smaller than the margin of error, but if parties are picking up or losing share, we might be a point or two off what a simple average of the latest polls would tell you. That's not so apparent when the parties are all moving in parallel - so we're lagging a little for everyone and the differences between parties will look similar. But, with the Conservatives plateauing, it might take a little while before our tracker starts to show Labour catching up as the most recent polls suggest they might be. YouGov's seat projection has raised a lot of interest. A lot of that is down to the fact that when they did the same exercise in 2017 they were pretty successful at forecasting the overall election result as well as the outcome in most individual constituencies. Their new projection puts the Conservatives on 359 seats, Labour on 211, the SNP on 43, Lib Dems on 13 and other parties on 24. That suggests a Conservative majority of 68. However, this still needs to be treated with caution for several reasons. It's still based on polling which, as we know, is always subject to error. The margin of error for this model ranges from a Conservative landslide to a very slim majority. Whilst the model uses a sophisticated technique to see how national polling trends play out in individual constituencies, it is always going to be very difficult to account for truly local factors - such as a prominent local independent candidate. Also, some other recent polls have suggested that Labour have moved a bit closer to the Conservatives than they are in the YouGov poll. That would clearly have an impact on the size of any overall majority, and the polls will continue to move between now and 12 December. So, whilst the projection is certainly very interesting, it shouldn't be treated as providing a reliable forecast of what the result of the election will be. One other feature of the most recent polls is that, with one clear exception, there seems to be more consistency between the different polling companies. If you look back to the beginning of October, there were very large differences between them. Now, each of the parties seems to be performing in a fairly narrow range across the polls: the low 40s for the Conservatives; close to 30% for Labour, and the mid-teens for the Lib Dems. The outlier is Opinium's latest poll which has the Conservatives on 47% and the Lib Dems down on 12%. Of course, convergence doesn't mean the polls can tell us what the final result will be. There's still more than two weeks to go and the lesson from 2015 is that there can be a consistent error across nearly all polls. Overall, the polls from the last week have shown the same pattern of movement as they have throughout the campaign. In particular, the Conservatives have gone up again in the BBC poll tracker and the Brexit Party continues to fall. There may be the first signs in the raw polling figures, though, that the Conservative shift is beginning to level off. Several of the pollsters have them one or two points below their peak in the latest figures. Even if their rise does stall, though, the Tories are now fairly close to the 43% they actually achieved at the 2017 election. A new Panelbase poll in Scotland also puts them only marginally below the result from last time. However, a result along those lines wouldn't mean their vote share was approximately flat across the country. The national figures can mask big shifts at a local level. There could still be dramatic swings in individual constituencies. Writing updates on the election campaign polls is beginning to get a bit repetitive. Once again, the changes since last week are basically following the same pattern as we've seen before. The Conservatives are up and Labour is also up a bit. The Brexit Party is down, and the Lib Dems are also a bit lower than before. In fact, the Conservatives are now pushing towards the 43% they actually achieved across Britain at the general election in 2017. As we noted last week, pollsters are adjusting their methodologies to take account of the fact that the Brexit Party has withdrawn in Conservative-held seats. That ought to help them hold on to seats they're defending. Perhaps slightly counterintuitively, though, it might mean Boris Johnson needs a bigger lead in the polls to be sure of winning an overall majority of MPs. Piling on extra votes in safe Conservative constituencies, thanks to the absence of a Brexit Party candidate, probably won't translate into extra seats in the House of Commons. A poll by LucidTalk covering the election in Northern Ireland was also published last week. These are few and far between, and the poll was conducted before the official election campaign got underway, so it's very hard to get a good sense of any trends. But compared to the 2017 election, the poll suggested the DUP and Sinn Fein losing vote share with the Alliance and SDLP going up. If the actual election result goes a similar way it could mean the smaller parties making gains in terms of seats at the expense of the big two. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties. YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down. The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party. Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing. Other pollsters have said they will follow suit. We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency. So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks. Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape. But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties.

But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. The trends that were noticeable in the polls a week ago have carried on over the last seven days. The Conservatives have continued their steady upward progress. But the tentative signs of a Labour recovery have also become firmer. Both parties' average scores are up, although they're still below the vote shares they recorded at the 2017 election - more than 10% below in Labour's case. Going in the other direction, the Brexit Party are down to 9% in the BBC poll tracker - their lowest score since the party was launched in April. And it's now clear that the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from where they were a month ago. YouGov has also published polls for Wales and Scotland. In Wales, they have Labour up four points with the Lib Dems losing the same amount since the last poll. Labour, on 29%, are now roughly on a par with the Conservatives on 28%. Since there are so few Welsh polls probably the best we can say with any confidence is that it looks close between the two main parties - with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party also in a close battle for third place. The Scotland poll gave the SNP a very large lead on 42%, with the Conservatives in a clear second place, and Labour falling to its lowest score since before the last election - just below the Lib Dems. However, that poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the election was even confirmed so it's rather likely that these figures are out of date. There can be little doubt, however, that the SNP are currently on course for a strong result. It's nearly a week now since it became clear that there would be a general election on 12 December. There have already been eight polls conducted since then - we can expect that from now on they will be coming thick and fast. Over the last seven days the Conservatives have continued their upward trend in the BBC poll tracker whilst the Brexit Party are still drifting downwards. There are also some early signs of a recovery for Labour. They've hit an average of 26% - their highest figure since the first half of September. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have fallen to 17% - their lowest since the start of June. These movements are pretty small so far, though, so we will need to see if they continue in the coming days. There's no doubt that Brexit will be a major issue at this election. But as the campaign gets underway, will other policy areas come to the fore? Opinium has found that Brexit is a more dominant subject as the campaign gets under way than it was at the last general election. Forty per cent of people in their latest poll said it was the single issue that was most likely to influence their vote. That compares with 18% at the start of the 2017 campaign. However, when people were asked to name the three most important issues facing the country, 59% of respondents identified health/NHS compared to only 52% for the EU/Brexit. That's a shift compared to their recent polls where Brexit has come out on top or in equal first place. It's possible that by campaigning on non-Brexit issues the parties will be able to influence how much weight voters give to different subjects. Panelbase's latest poll also puts the NHS/health as the top issue. On the other hand, Deltapoll have Britain leaving the EU clearly ahead of health. The difference here could be explained by the fact they don't namecheck the NHS in their range of options. The last few weeks have seen a gradual, further strengthening of the Conservatives' position in the polls. In the latest poll by Opinium they hit 40% - the highest figure in a single poll since the middle of August. They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker. In the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards. Labour's average rating has essentially stayed flat. Because voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate. Comparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes. The SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years. In our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population. That's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain. Polls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year. The Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls. The Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say. Our poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date. Each dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party. There are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls. So we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results. It bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?). We use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council. As of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland. We use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference. We include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available. The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points. This means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties. And there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on aBritish Polling Council analysis,externalof the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017. The approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales or are standing in only a few seats, like UKIP or The Independent Group for Change. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK. This also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%. We have more coverage of politics inScotlandandWaleson their national politics pages. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures. We also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source. In a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people. On the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people. Because a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day. Polling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like. In the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking. But it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people. This margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise. There are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently. We list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent. For example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female). So the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%. That's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population. One problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting. That variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results. Finally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of ""don't knows"" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of ""shy Tories"" or the ""spiral of silence"" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote. Our approach, excluding ""don't knows"" from our polltracker, is slightly different. It is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference. Many polling companies changed their methodology when the candidates lists were released to account for those parties that are standing only in a few seats. If a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for? Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another party Prior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered ""another party"". Following a randomised controlled trial, BMG decided to move those two parties into the main prompt list. The Independent Group for Change and UKIP remain in the secondary prompt list. If there were a (UK) general election tomorrow to elect MPs to Westminster, would you vote Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, Brexit Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru, or for another party? If there were a general election held tomorrow, which party would you vote for? SELECT ONE: Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, UK Independence Party (UKIP), Scottish National Party (SNP), Plaid Cymru (PC), Brexit Party, Green, Some other party If a general election is held in October before the Brexit deadline of 31 October, which party would you vote for? If there were a general election tomorrow, which party would you vote for? How would you vote if there were a general election tomorrow? Voting intention for next general election - online pre-coded list:  Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, Green, SNP, Plaid Cymru Note: Brexit Party and The Independent Group for Change were not included in the pre-coded list but respondents had opportunity to select subsequently If there were a general election tomorrow, for which party would you vote? If there were an election tomorrow, which party would you vote for? Labour Party, Conservative Party, Brexit Party, Liberal Democrat, The Independent Group, UKIP, Green Party, SNP, DUP, Plaid Cymru, Sinn Fein, Ulster Unionist Party, Women's Equality Party.

Conservatives, Labour, Independent Group, Liberal Democrats, Other, UKIP, Green Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru Respondents were asked who they would be most likely to vote for if that election were tomorrow, with the responses ""Labour"", ""Conservative"", ""Liberal Democrat"" prompted in a randomising order, and other parties displayed if respondents selected ""Another Party"".

"Labour's Keith Vaz faces six-month suspensionThe MP ""disregarded"" the law by offering to obtain cocaine for male prostitutes, a watchdog finds.UK Politics","Labour MP Keith Vaz ""disregarded"" the law by ""expressing a willingness"" to help buy cocaine for male prostitutes, the Commons standards body has found. It said there was ""compelling evidence"" he offered to pay for a class A drug and had paid-for sex in August 2016. It is recommending he be suspended for six months after he was ""evasive and unhelpful"" during the investigation. Mr Vaz would not comment on his future but said he was receiving treatment for a serious mental health condition. A statement later issued by his office said Mr Vaz had cooperated at all stages of the inquiry and he had been admitted to hospital on Monday. If MPs vote to approve the committee's recommendation, Mr Vaz would be subject to a recall petition which could trigger a by-election if supported by 10% of his constituents. Keith Vaz police investigation closed Keith Vaz - the 'Teflon politician' MP Keith Vaz 'bullied Commons clerks' Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, whose complaint triggered the investigation, told BBC East Midlands Today: ""The wheels of justice have moved slowly but inexorably to the right conclusion. ""The report is damning regarding Keith Vaz's conduct and only needs rubber stamp from parliament now. ""Hopefully, this is the end of the line for Keith Vaz, I don't think he's fit to be representing anywhere in this place, I think he's been a malign influence on local and national politics for too long."" A spokesman for Mr Vaz said the Leicester East MP had been treated for a serious mental health condition ""for the last three years as a result of the events of 27th August 2016"". ""He has shared all the medical reports in confidence with the committee. He has nothing further to say on this matter other than what was said in his oral and written statements to the committee and to the commissioner."" The police declined to take action against the MP following an investigation in 2016. In a scathing report,external, the committee said there was ""convincing evidence"" that Mr Vaz was ""evasive or unhelpful"" during an investigation into his conduct by Commons standards commissioners Kathryn Hudson and Kathryn Stone. A statement on Mr Vaz's website ""vigorously"" rejected this allegation and said he cooperated at ""all stages of this process"". ""He holds the standards system in the highest regard and with the highest respect,"" it said. The revelations, first reported by the Sunday Mirror, led to Mr Vaz standing down as chairman of the Home Affairs Select committee - which at the time was conducting an inquiry into drug policy. It was alleged the MP had met two men at his London flat to engage in paid-for sex, and that during this encounter - which was covertly recorded by one of the men - he offered to buy illegal drugs for a third person to use. In her report, the commissioner said the recording ""contains evidence of Mr Vaz's apparent willingness to purchase controlled drugs for others to use"". ""While his comments regarding this may not amount to a criminal offence, he shows disregard for the law and that, in turn, is disrespectful to the House and fellow members, who collectively are responsible for making those laws."" At the time, Mr Vaz said he had met the men to discuss the redecoration of his flat. But the cross-party committee said Mr Vaz's characterisation of the meeting - in which he reportedly posed as a washing machine salesman - was ""not believable and ludicrous"". The MP's claim during the inquiry that his drink may have been spiked and that he had since suffered memory loss about the incident were ""not relevant"", the report found. The MP's conduct in relation to illegal drugs and his behaviour during the investigation caused ""significant damage"" to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons, it said. He had ""failed repeatedly to answer direct questions, gave incomplete answers and an account that was, in parts, incredible"" - actions which constituted a ""very serious"" breach of the MPs' code of conduct. Keith Vaz used to chair the influential Home Affairs Select Committee ""Mr Vaz has done his best to complicate, obfuscate and confuse the inquiry through arguments of little merit and documentation of dubious relevance,"" it said. The committee said its aim throughout was ""to establish whether the rules of the House have been complied with, not to investigate Mr Vaz's private life or to pass judgement on issues of sexual morality"". Mr Vaz, a former Europe minister under Tony Blair, was suspended from the Commons for one month in 2002 after being found to have obstructed a standards watchdog's investigation into his financial affairs. The committee said it had taken this into account in recommending the longer suspension, as well as the fact that as chair of the Home Affairs committee there was an extra onus on Mr Vaz to set a ""good example"" to other MPs.

"Gold, drug money and a major auditor's 'cover-up'","Auditor Amjad Rihan says EY covered up transactions that were ""way beyond suspicion"" A major accountancy firm covered up evidence of smuggling by an organised crime gang that was laundering British drug money, an investigation has revealed. EY failed to report suspicious activity at one of the world's largest gold refineries and then altered a compliance report to hide the crime. BBC Panorama found the gang laundered money by selling 3.6 tonnes of gold to the Kaloti refinery in Dubai. Both EY and Kaloti deny any wrongdoing. Twenty-seven members of the money laundering gang were jailed in France in 2017. The gang had collected cash from drug dealers in the UK and other European countries. They then laundered the dirty money by buying and selling black market gold. Travel money firms focus in gangs crackdown Number of middle-aged 'money mules' rising Dirty money 'targeting UK prestige services' Documents seen by Panorama and French news agency Premieres Lignes show that Renade International - a company owned by a member of the money laundering gang - sold $146m (Â£114m) of gold to Kaloti in 2012 alone. The following year the accountancy firm EY, formerly known as Ernst and Young, had been asked to conduct a review of Kaloti's compliance with rules designed to keep gold from illegitimate sources out of the global supply chain. The auditors discovered that Kaloti had paid out a total of $5.2bn (Â£4bn) in cash in 2012, but EY didn't report suspicious activity to the money laundering authorities. EY also helped to cover up a crime - the export to Dubai of gold bars that had been disguised as silver to avoid export limits on gold. The audit team had been shown what appeared to be bars of silver from Morocco, but scratching the surface revealed they were really gold bars coated silver. This video can not be played How a drug gang laundered money The BBC and Premieres Lignes have now discovered the smuggled gold was owned by the money laundering gang's company, Renade International. Amjad Rihan was the lead auditor for EY in Dubai in 2013 and he says he wanted to report the suspicious activity at the time. But he says his bosses watered down reports and told him not to tell the authorities. ""If you identify a suspicious transaction you should report it to the authorities and what we identified was way beyond suspicion. Instead of reporting the crimes that I told them about, my bosses just covered them up,"" he said. EY did not just fail to report the crime - it helped to cover it up too. Panorama has seen a number of drafts of a compliance report to a Dubai regulator. In the initial report, Kaloti seems to admit buying gold coated with silver. It says: ""We acknowledge an incidentâ¦ with the bars coated with silver."" But EY rewrote the report so that it said: ""We acknowledge transactions... in which there were certain documentary irregularities."" The accountancy firm turned the crime into a ""documentary irregularity"". EY declined to comment about the rewriting of the report but said it was confident that all legal and reporting obligations had been complied with. The company said it had delivered its findings to the relevant regulator in Dubai. The gang bought and sold black market gold to launder profits from the drug trade The company said: ""It was the work of EY Dubai that brought to light Kaloti's non-compliance with the applicable regulations and ultimately resulted in the remediation of the issues. ""More recently, and many years after these events, Mr Rihan has raised certain unfounded allegations in a legal claim which is being vigorously defended."" Under the Proceeds of Crime Act, accountants have a legal duty to report any suspicious activity to the police. In its legal dispute with Mr Rihan, EY admits that the disguised gold ""provided reasonable grounds for knowing or suspectingâ¦ money laundering."" But the accountancy firm claims it did not have to report this to the police because its auditors were not doing accountancy work at Kaloti. Kaloti said that it had conducted all appropriate anti-money laundering checks. ""Kaloti would not knowingly enter into a trading relationship with any party in the knowledge that such party had been engaged in financial impropriety or criminal activity of any kind. ""It is categorically denied that Kaloti purchased gold coated in silver from Renade, or anyone else for that matter."" The company said that cash payments were common in Dubai, but it no longer buys gold for cash. Panorama:Following the Drug Moneyis on BBC1 at 20:30 GMT on 28 October.

Ahead of her tribunal, Ahmed said she loved her role on Newswatch, in which audiences critique the BBC's reporting of news and current affairs, ""despite it being difficult and challenging"". ""I know that it is an important part of demonstrating the BBC service to all its audiences and the licence fee payers. ""I have a sense of pride working for a public service broadcaster which seeks to represent the diversity of Britain and its licence fee payers."" Allow Twitter content?

She added: ""On the back of my BBC ID card are written the BBC values which include 'we respect each other and celebrate our diversity' and 'we take pride in delivering quality and value for money'. ""I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job."" In response to her claims, the BBC insisted it ""is committed to equal pay"", explaining the pay difference occurred due to the fact Vine's show is ""entertainment"" and Ahmed's programme was ""news"". ""Points of View is an entertainment programme with a long history and is a household name with the public. Newswatch - while an important programme - isn't. ""Samira was paid the same as her male predecessor when she began presenting Newswatch. Gender has not been a factor in levels of pay for Points of View. News and entertainment are very different markets and pay across the media industry reflects this."" The NUJ said it was backing Ahmed's case because ""the scourge of unequal pay has no place in our public service broadcaster"". ""Unfortunately, despite Samira going through a lengthy and frustrating internal process in the hope that a sensible solution could be achieved, the BBC has not resolved this case and it will now be for the tribunal to determine whether this monumental pay gap is appropriate and defensible,"" said NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet. ""Samira is to be congratulated for her persistence and determination to secure fair and equal treatment by her employer."" Other broadcasting colleagues including Naga Munchetty, Sandi Toksvig, Alan Rusbridger, Andrew Copson, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi and the Right Reverend Nicholas Baines have offered Ahmed their support.

"France's richest man makes $14.5bn bid for TiffanyThe US-based firm says it is ""reviewing"" a takeover offer from Bernard Arnault's luxury giant LVMH.Business","Audrey Hepburn's aspiring socialite Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's made the jeweller a household name US-based Tiffany says it is ""reviewing"" a takeover offer worth about $14.5bn (Â£11.3bn) from the world's biggest luxury goods company, LVMH. The companies confirmed the offer in separate statements on Monday, with the 182-year-old Tiffany saying there are currently no talks. LVMH, owned by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, has brands including Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Bulgari. Jewellery has been one of the fastest growth spots in the luxury sector. In a two-sentence statement,externalearly on Monday, LVMH said it ""confirms that it has held preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany,"" adding that there is no certainty of a deal. A few hours later Tiffany, listed on the New York Stock Exchange,said it ""has received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from LMVH"" of $120 per share in cash,external. Reports at the weekend said cash-rich LVMH, which also owns Kenzo, Tag Heuer, Dom PÃ©rignon, Moet & Chandon, as well as Louis Vuitton handbags, made a preliminary offer for Tiffany earlier this month. A takeover would be LVMH's biggest deal since buying the Bulgari brand in 2011 for $5.2bn. Bernard Arnault and Donald Trump at the official opening this month of an LVMH factory in Texas ""LVMH's attempt to put a $14.5bn ring on Tiffany, having already added Bulgari a couple of years ago is likely to take the fight in this sector to its closest rival Richemont, who owns Cartier, and would help LVMH in gaining better access to US markets,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. As part of its push for a bigger share of the US market, LVMH has opened a factory in south Texas, which was officially inaugurated this month in ceremony attended by Mr Arnault and US President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka. Tiffany's flagship New York store is next to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue. Founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany, the company's fame was sealed after the release of the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's, staring Audrey Hepburn and loosely based on Truman Capote's novella of the same name. Global demand for LVMH's products has held up well in recent years, but the same cannot be said for Tiffany, whichhas seen worldwide sales fall. Like several luxury firms, analysts say Tiffany may have been caught out by the US-China trade dispute and rise in tariffs. It has also been hit by lower spending in its retail outlets by Chinese tourists. The Louis Vuitton brand is known for its signature handbags LVMH has 75 brands, 156,000 employees and a network of more than 4,590 stores. Tiffany employs more than 14,000 people and operates about 300 stores. News of LVMH's offer sent Tiffany's share price surging more than 31% to nearly $130. A $14.5bn offer is worth about $120 a share, but analysts said LVMH could afford to go higher, and Credit Suisse estimated that Tiffany was worth about $140 a share. LVMH rival Kering has been looking to expand in the jewellery sector too, and has launched high-end jewellery lines for its fashion brand Gucci. Switzerland's Richemont, meanwhile, a sector leader with labels such as Cartier, has also been adding to its portfolio, and recently acquired Italy's Buccellati. But, said analysts at Jefferies, ""Tiffany is potentially the biggest prey and the only US global luxury brand"".

Rising Democratic star resigns amid affair claimsCongresswoman Katie Hill denies allegations she had an affair with a Capitol Hill aide.US & Canada,"Katie Hill acknowledges a relationship with a female campaign staff member, but not a congressional aide. US lawmaker Katie Hill has announced her resignation from Congress, following allegations that she had an affair with a Capitol Hill aide. The California Democrat, who has denied the claim, said she was stepping down with a ""broken heart"". ""I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country,"" she wrote on Twitter. The resignation came days after she was placed under investigation by the House of Representatives Ethics Committee. The ethics committee launched an inquiry after conservative blog RedState reported allegations that Ms Hill had an affair with one of her congressional aides, a man. The same blog separately reported claims that Ms Hill, who is bisexual, had also engaged in a three-way consensual romance with a female campaign staff member and her husband. It published naked images of the politician. She has asked police to investigate the nude photos being published online. House lawmaker's alleged relationship investigated Breaking down the US mid-terms Ms Hill, 32, has denied having an affair with her aide, which would be a possible violation of House rules. In a statement announcing the investigation, the ethics committee noted thatthe opening of an inquiry did not mean ""that any violation has occurred"",external. Mrs Hill, far right, was elected as part of a Democratic wave in 2018 Hours before the congressional inquiry was launched on Wednesday, Ms Hill sent a letter to supporters acknowledging a ""relationship"" with a female 2018 campaign staff member. She described that affair as ""inappropriate"". The relationship that Ms Hill acknowledged took place before she was elected, so it fell outside congressional rules on personal relationships. In her resignation letter on Sunday, Ms Hill said stepping down from Congress was the ""hardest thing"" she had ever had to do. ""Having private photos of personal moments weaponised against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. It's also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options,"" she wrote. ""However, I know that as long as I am in Congress, we'll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt."" Ms Hill has accused her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, of trying to humiliate her. She says the campaign relationship began in the final ""tumultuous"" years of her marriage. ""I know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment,"" she said in the letter to supporters. ""For that I apologise."" Two years ago during her congressional campaign, she described Kenny Heslep, whom she wed in 2010, in a social media post as ""my best friend and the love of my life"".

Five royal secrets revealed by the Queenâs dresserAn authorised book by one of the Queen's closest aides provides a glimpse behind-the-scenes.UK,"The Queen's dresser Angela Kelly (far right) and the monarch have a shared interest in fashion Secrets of serving the Queen have been revealed in a new book by one of Her Majesty's closest aides. Angela Kelly has written a behind-the-scenes account of her years as the Queen's official dressmaker and friend. Unusually, The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, The Dresser and the Wardrobe is authorised by the monarch. Its blurb says: ""The Queen has personally given Angela her blessing to share their unparalleled bond with the world"". Interesting titbits from the book are serialised this week in celebrity magazine Hello. So what have we learnt? 'An irreparably changed relationship' for princes Celebrities who misbehaved in Buckingham Palace Why is Prince Harry comparing Meghan to his mum? In her book, Ms Kelly, who has dressed the Queen since 2002, confirms reports the Queen employs a royal assistant to wear in her new shoes are accurate - and that she is the ""flunky"" that does it. Ms Kelly writes: ""The Queen has very little time to herself and not time to wear in her own shoes, and as we share the same shoe size it makes the most sense this way."" The James Bond skit for London 2012 saw an actor playing the Queen skydive into the Olympic Stadium Ms Kelly says that the offer for Her Majesty to appear in a skit alongside Daniel Craig's James Bond was considered by the Queen for just ""five minutes"" before she accepted. ""She was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately. I asked then if she would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: 'Of course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me',"" Ms Kelly recalls. ""I asked whether she would like to say: 'Good evening, James,' or: 'Good evening, Mr Bond,' and she chose the latter, knowing the Bond films. Within minutes, I wasâ¦ delivering the good news to [director Danny Boyle] - I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queen's only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line: 'Good evening, Mr Bond.'""

The colour of the Queen's hat at Royal Ascot inspires a flurry of bets The Queen's annual appearance at Royal Ascot is a much-watched affair. And it is not just the horses that the crowds keep an eye on - people place bets on the colour of the monarch's hat. After learning such a bet had been placed one year, Ms Kelly says she agreed with the boss of a bookmaker on a closing time for wagers, and even laid out decoy hats in the palace to avoid the real colour being identified early. Ms Kelly wrote: ""I had a meeting with the owner of Paddy Power at which we agreed that betting on the colour of the Queen's hat would be closed at a certain time to avoid any cheating, but allowed people to carry on guessing the colour of the Queen's hat and perhaps even win a bit of money."" This video can not be played When Michelle Obama hugged the Queen Reports that the Queen ""abandoned"" royal protocol when she returned former First Lady Michelle Obama's hug in 2009 were far from accurate, Ms Kelly says. ""In reality, it was a natural instinct for the Queen to show affection and respect for another great woman, and really there is no protocol that must be adhered to,"" she wrote. ""When fondness is felt or the host of a State Visit goes to guide Her Majesty up some steps, it truly is about human kindness, and this is something the Queen will always welcome warmly. Anyone who is close to Her Majesty is not a threat and is certainly trusted."" Mrs Obama wrote in her memoir, Becoming, that the moment came as the pair agreed a long day wearing heels had left them with sore feet. We were just ""two tired ladies oppressed by our shoes"",she added. Prince Louis wears the christening gown replica last year Ms Kelly reveals how ""strong"" Yorkshire tea helped to recreate a replica of the royal christening gown which was first used for the christening of James, Viscount Severn, in 2008. ""To make sure it looked authentic we dyed it in Yorkshire tea (the strongest, as we all know),"" Ms Kelly wrote of the piece. ""We placed each piece of lace in a small bowl, from the Dressers' kitchen, filled with cool water and a tea bag and left it for about five minutes, checking regularly until the colour was perfect.""

Row breaks out in People's Vote campaign,"This video can not be played Tom Baldwin vs Roland Rudd on Today programme A public row has broken out at the top of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum. Media chief Tom Baldwin has accused chairman Roland Rudd of putting ""a wrecking ball"" through the campaign. Mr Baldwin said he had been fired by Mr Rudd - but would be going in to work as normal. Mr Rudd denied firing Mr Baldwin, saying ""he has an opportunity for a different type of role"". He also denied reports of strategic differences within the organisation over his desire to openly campaign for Remain. What are People's Vote bosses rowing about? On Sunday, theObserver reported,externalothers within the group want to concentrate on winning support for another vote among Leave voters and wavering Labour and Tory MPs. But Mr Rudd told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There's no row about the Remain side and PV [People's Vote]. Everyone knows where we stand on this"". ""This is an absurd argument. Everybody knows perfectly well that we're made up of people who want to vote to Remain. There isn't a problem"". Jubilant scenes at 'final say' Brexit protest EU agrees Brexit extension to 31 January How could another Brexit referendum work? The campaign is supported by five groups - the European Movement UK, the Joint Media Unit, Our Future Our Choice, For our Future's Sake and Wales for Europe and Open Britain - of which Mr Rudd is chair. Over the weekend,the Financial Times reported,externalthat two senior figures of the campaign  - Mr Baldwin, the former top adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader, and James McGrory, ex-deputy PM Nick Clegg's former top adviser - had been asked to leave by Mr Rudd. Mr Baldwin told the Today programme that although Mr Rudd ""technically controls my contract, he didn't appoint me, he doesn't pay me"" and added he was still planning to go into work. He added it was ""extraordinary that Roland Rudd is acting like this is his campaign"". ""He is making the mistake a lot of businessmen do when they dabble in politics, which is to think, because they have a certain title and board they own the campaign,"" he said. He also accused the Liberal Democrats of ""playing some strange games"" with the campaign,referring to their bid to have an election on 9 December. Roland Rudd runs a PR company and was heavily involved in the Remain campaign Mr Rudd, who made his fortune as the founder of a financial PR firm, said ""there is a problem when someone comes on this show and says the Lib Dems are no longer part of the People's Vote"". ""The key thing now is that we have to keep our eyes set on the prize. ""We have every chance of getting that prize which is to get it back to the people - the more people see this deal the more they see its flaws."" Asked if he had fired Mr Baldwin, Mr Rudd responded that ""he has an opportunity for a different type of role"". The BBC has been told that both Mr Baldwin and Mr McGrory were at the People's Vote offices on Monday morning, as their 40 staff gathered for a meeting. Tweeting in support of Mr Baldwin,external, People's Vote campaigner and ex-adviser to Tony Blair Alastair Campbell said ""after his [Mr Rudd's] rare visit to the building today it is to be hoped those actually working for a second referendum rather than talking about it to their business pals (none of whom have made donations for months) can get on with their jobs and put this silly episode behind us"".

Why do gay apps struggle to stop fakes and frauds?,"In a bid to tackle fake profiles and fraudsters, a popular gay dating app plans to offer a sort of ""verified"" badge to identify authentic members. Hornet will be the first of the major gay social networks to let people earn a badge of authenticity. The aim is to give users more confidence that they are talking to a genuine person. But rather than moderators checking ID, the app will use algorithms to decide who gets a badge. So can machine learning solve the problems that persist on dating apps? Anyone who has used a gay dating app will be familiar with fakes. Messages arrive from improbably handsome strangers, often angling for intimate photos or sexy chat. These so-called catfish profiles use pictures stolen from popular social media stars or adult-film actors. They lure people into conversation, sometimes trying to arrange dates they will never show up for. In more serious cases they try to defraud, blackmail or harm their victims. So why do gay dating apps not offer a ""verified"" profile badge, like on Instagram or Twitter? It is not that simple. ""Not everyone wants to or even should be identified,"" said Eric Silverberg, chief executive of dating app Scruff, which competes with Hornet on the app stores. Hornet plans to give ""authentic"" profiles a badge ""People often create new, repeated or anonymous profiles, for many valid reasons,"" he told the BBC. ""Once you start verifying some, you create a kind of hierarchy on your platform that could lead to unintended consequences for people who are not out of the closet."" More than 70 countries around the world have laws against LGBT people. ID checks would create a list of ""verified LGBT people"" that could be used by those wanting to do harm, including governments. They would also raise barriers for those exploring their sexuality. If most users chose to verify their profiles, newcomers may find fewer people speak to them if they have not gone through the verification process. Hornet says its system will not involve checking ID. Instead, algorithms will evaluate how people behave on the app over time. Profiles that are judged to be genuine will display a ""Hornet badge"" as an indicator of trustworthiness. The company said it would not disclose exactly how the algorithm works because that might help catfish work out how to trick the system. But Hornet chief executive Christof Wittig told the BBC: ""We look at people and how they earn trust while they interact with the community. It requires people to be authentic and interact."" Hornet combines the social elements of apps such as Instagram with the meet-up aspect of apps such as Grindr. The ""verification"" system will analyse how people use those features, to weigh up whether the activity is consistent with genuine users. Mr Wittig stressed that the algorithm would not look at the contents of private messages. And because many people in countries with anti-LGBT laws do not use a selfie as their profile picture, the system will not involve any image analysis of profile photos either. The app will provide tips for people who have not gained their badge Of course, fake profiles can be very convincing - they are carefully crafted to be deceiving. Could a catfish profile earn a ""Hornet badge"" and add a mark of authenticity to their fake profile? ""In theory, yes,"" said Mr Wittig. ""There will always be that one person who will put this super extra effort in, and there will always be some that fall for it. ""But with this system, the amount of work versus the probability of reward changes. We are making being a fake profile very costly. They can no longer do it at scale. ""And even then once you know somebody is a catfish, their pattern is better understood. The machine learning has much more data to really understand how catfish behave."" What about members who do not want a ""Hornet badge"" because they are worried about being exposed for using an LGBT app? Mr Wittig said it would not be possible to opt out of the system but he said members would still be able to be discreet about their identity. ""People in some countries don't put a face picture up because it's so dangerous, but they can still be verified by the system,"" Mr Wittig told the BBC. The BBC invited rival dating apps Grindr and Scruff to share their views on user verification methods. Scruff told the BBC: ""The bigger question is why bad actors continue to proliferate on some platforms, and the answer always comes down to one thing - leadership."" ""We have always prioritised moderation and community support, because we are building an app that we ourselves use and share with our friends and loved ones. When people misuse our platform, we react swiftly and decisively. ""We have spent years building advanced technologies to stop spammers, catfishers, and other bad actors."" Grindr has yet to respond.

The NUJ said Vine's fee for Points Of View was reduced to Â£1,300 in January 2018. He left the programme in July of the same year. Samira Ahmed (r) and fellow BBC presenter Naga Munchetty arrive at the employment tribunal at Victory House, London on Monday morning BBC News presenter Carrie Gracie, who foughther own battle with the corporationover equal pay, said she knew of around 12 more people with employment tribunals ""in the pipeline"". She said the BBC's management was ""defensive and resistant to admitting mistakes"", and that Ahmed's case was ""emblematic and extremely important to all the other women still fighting"".

France's richest man eyes Tiffany takeover,"Audrey Hepburn's aspiring socialite Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany's made the jeweller a household name US-based Tiffany says it is ""reviewing"" a takeover offer worth about $14.5bn (Â£11.3bn) from the world's biggest luxury goods company, LVMH. The companies confirmed the offer in separate statements on Monday, with the 182-year-old Tiffany saying there are currently no talks. LVMH, owned by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, has brands including Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Bulgari. Jewellery has been one of the fastest growth spots in the luxury sector. In a two-sentence statement,externalearly on Monday, LVMH said it ""confirms that it has held preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany,"" adding that there is no certainty of a deal. A few hours later Tiffany, listed on the New York Stock Exchange,said it ""has received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from LMVH"" of $120 per share in cash,external. Reports at the weekend said cash-rich LVMH, which also owns Kenzo, Tag Heuer, Dom PÃ©rignon, Moet & Chandon, as well as Louis Vuitton handbags, made a preliminary offer for Tiffany earlier this month. A takeover would be LVMH's biggest deal since buying the Bulgari brand in 2011 for $5.2bn. Bernard Arnault and Donald Trump at the official opening this month of an LVMH factory in Texas ""LVMH's attempt to put a $14.5bn ring on Tiffany, having already added Bulgari a couple of years ago is likely to take the fight in this sector to its closest rival Richemont, who owns Cartier, and would help LVMH in gaining better access to US markets,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. As part of its push for a bigger share of the US market, LVMH has opened a factory in south Texas, which was officially inaugurated this month in ceremony attended by Mr Arnault and US President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka. Tiffany's flagship New York store is next to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue. Founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany, the company's fame was sealed after the release of the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's, staring Audrey Hepburn and loosely based on Truman Capote's novella of the same name. Global demand for LVMH's products has held up well in recent years, but the same cannot be said for Tiffany, whichhas seen worldwide sales fall. Like several luxury firms, analysts say Tiffany may have been caught out by the US-China trade dispute and rise in tariffs. It has also been hit by lower spending in its retail outlets by Chinese tourists. The Louis Vuitton brand is known for its signature handbags LVMH has 75 brands, 156,000 employees and a network of more than 4,590 stores. Tiffany employs more than 14,000 people and operates about 300 stores. News of LVMH's offer sent Tiffany's share price surging more than 31% to nearly $130. A $14.5bn offer is worth about $120 a share, but analysts said LVMH could afford to go higher, and Credit Suisse estimated that Tiffany was worth about $140 a share. LVMH rival Kering has been looking to expand in the jewellery sector too, and has launched high-end jewellery lines for its fashion brand Gucci. Switzerland's Richemont, meanwhile, a sector leader with labels such as Cartier, has also been adding to its portfolio, and recently acquired Italy's Buccellati.

"IS leader dead after US raid in Syria, Trump says","Baghdadi announced the creation of a ""caliphate"" from Mosul in 2014 The fugitive leader of the Islamic State (IS) group killed himself during a US military operation in north-west Syria, President Donald Trump has said. Speaking from the White House, Mr Trump said Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest after fleeing into a tunnel, chased by US military dogs. Baghdadi came to prominence in 2014, when he announced the creation of a ""caliphate"" in areas of Iraq and Syria. IS carried out multiple atrocities that resulted in thousands of deaths. The jihadist group imposed a brutal rule in the areas under its control and was behind many attacks around the world. Although the US declared the ""caliphate"" defeated earlier this year, IS militants remain active in the region and elsewhere. Baghdadi's death is a major victory for Mr Trump as he faces heavy criticism for his decision to pull US troops out of northern Syria and fights an impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats. Who was Baghdadi? What we know about US raid The meaning of Baghdadi's death for IS in Syria Backlash for US newspaper over Baghdadi headline In an unusual Sunday morning statement, Mr Trump described the night-time operation in extraordinary detail, saying Baghdadi ran into a dead-end tunnel, ""whimpering and crying and screaming"", while being chased by military dogs. Baghdadi killed himself and three of his children by igniting his suicide vest, Mr Trump said, causing the tunnel to collapse. No US personnel were killed but one of the dogs was seriously injured in the explosion. This video can not be played Mr Trump called Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi a 'brutal killer' The blast mutilated Baghdadi's body but, according to the president, an on-site DNA test confirmed his identity. The special forces spent two hours in the area and gathered ""highly sensitive material"". ""The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,"" Mr Trump said. Also on Sunday, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said IS spokesman Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, described as Baghdadi's right-hand man, had been killed in a separate joint operation with the US military near the northern Syrian town of Jarablus. The location - the village of Barisha in Idlib province near the Turkish border - was far from where Baghdadi had been thought to be hiding along the Syria-Iraq border. Many parts of Idlib are under the control of jihadists opposed to IS but rival groups are suspected of sheltering IS members. Baghdadi had been under surveillance for ""a couple of weeks"" and ""two or three"" raids had been cancelled because of his movements, Mr Trump said, describing the IS leader's move to Idlib as part of a plan to rebuild the group. This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos An undisclosed number of forces targeted the compound using eight helicopters, which were met with gunfire, Mr Trump said. The commandos managed to land safely and entered the building by blowing holes in the wall, avoiding the main door which was believed to be booby-trapped. ""He was a sick and depraved man,"" Mr Trump said. ""He died like a dog, he died like a coward."" US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said Baghdadi's remains should be given the same treatment applied to those of former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, whose body was buried at sea after he was killed in a raid in 2011. 'Caliphate' defeated but IS remains a threat Where IS is still active around the world IS: The long and short story A ""large number"" of Baghdadi's followers also died while others were captured, the president said. The dead included two of Baghdadi's wives who were both found wearing explosive vests that were not detonated. Eleven children were removed, uninjured, from the compound. The SDF - one of the main US allies in northern Syria until Mr Trump withdrew US troops from the area this month - said they had shared details about the location of high-level IS members, including Baghdadi. Iraqi officials also said they had provided ""accurate information"". Mr Trump praised them all, as well as Russia - which opened up the airspace it controls for the operation - Turkey and Syria for giving ""certain support"" to the operation. He said Russia had not been told about the nature of the US mission. After the president's address, the White House released pictures said to be of Mr Trump watching the operation from the Situation Room surrounded by Vice-President Mike Pence and top security officials.

While IS lost its territory in Syria and Iraq after a years-long deadly campaign, experts say the group remains a threat, with affiliates active in various countries. The strategic significance of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death is clear. Removing a skilled and brutal leader from the battlefield will undoubtedly make allied efforts to eradicate IS forces easier. The lasting political benefits for Donald Trump remain to be seen. Baghdadi was far from a household name in the US, although IS has been a well-known adversary ever since its brutal executions and advance grabbed headlines in 2014. His death will give Mr Trump a signature moment to cite when making the case that his leadership has led to the methodical defeat of IS forces. It also will help deflect from weeks of sharp bipartisan criticism following the president's decision to remove US forces from northern Syria and tacitly permit a Turkish invasion to drive out US-allied Kurds. While it is true most Americans only pay attention to foreign policy during times of war, most of Mr Trump's current political headaches have come from actions directed abroad - whether it's the Syrian move or the rapidly unfolding impeachment inquiry into his Ukraine conduct. Now the president has a clear foreign policy success to tout. It will not solve all his political problems, but it is a start. Leaders around the world reacted to the news of Baghdadi's death, with many stressing that the fight against the group continues. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Baghdadi's death was ""an important moment in our fight against terror but the battle against the evil of [IS] is not over yet"". French President Emmanuel Macron described the development as a ""hard blow"" against IS, but said ""the fight continues to finally defeat this terrorist organisation"". In a statement, the Iraqi government highlighted its role in finding Baghdadi's hideout, and said it would continue to ""relentlessly pursue"" the militant group. Baghdadi, whose real name was Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri, had a reputation as a highly organised and ruthless battlefield tactician. He was described as the world's most wanted man. He was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, in 1971, and reports suggest he was a cleric in a mosque in the city around the time of the US-led invasion in 2003. Some believe he was already a jihadist during the rule of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Others suggest he was radicalised during the time he was held at Camp Bucca, a US facility in southern Iraq where many al-Qaeda commanders were detained. This video can not be played A video appearing to show the IS group leader was released earlier this year Baghdadi emerged in 2010 as the leader of an umbrella group that included al-Qaeda in Iraq, and rose to prominence when IS militants captured the Iraqi city of Mosul in 2014, when he declared the creation of a ""caliphate"". That was the only time Baghdadi was seen in public. At its peak, IS had eight million people in territories under its control. Baghdadi only reappeared in a video released by IS earlier this year. In October 2011, the US officially designated him a ""terrorist"" and offered a reward of $10m (Â£5.8m at the time) for information leading to his capture or death. This was increased to $25m in 2017. What Baghdadi's death means for IS in Syria Where is IS still active around the world? Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?

Man in court over Essex lorry deaths,"Maurice Robinson appeared via video-link charged with 39 counts of manslaughter A driver accused of the manslaughter of 39 people found dead in a lorry was part of a ""global ring"" of people smugglers, prosecutors have alleged. Maurice Robinson, from Craigavon, was remanded in custody at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. The 39 bodies were found in the lorry trailer on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, on Wednesday. Writing in a book of condolence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the world had been ""shocked by this tragedy"". Mr Robinson, of Laurel Drive, appeared via video-link and is charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. Prosecutor Ogheneruona Iguyovwe described the conspiracy charges as ""a global ring"" involving ""the movement of a large number of illegal immigrants into the UK"". Mr Robinson was not asked to indicate pleas and will next appear at the Old Bailey on 25 November. DNA tests are being carried out in Vietnam to help to identify the victims. Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed a book of condolence The prime minister was joined at Thurrock Council's offices by Home Secretary Priti Patel and members of the emergency services. Writing in the book of condolence, Mr Johnson said: ""The whole nation, and indeed the world had been shocked by this tragedy and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country. ""In condemning the callousness of those responsible for this crime, we in the government of the United Kingdom resolve to do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators to justice."" Richard Galpin, BBC News Home Secretary Priti Patel and Boris Johnson laid flowers in tribute to the people who died Inside the modern Thurrock Council chamber, surrounded by aides and officials from the emergency services, Boris Johnson bent down to write his message of condolence to the families of the 39 men and women who died inside the sealed container last week. He hesitated briefly before starting to write a long message expressing the shock in this country and beyond of what had happened. Other officials followed in what was a solemn occasion carried out in silence. The prime minister and home secretary then laid flowers in a small garden outside the council offices before heading back to central London. Ms Patel later told the House of Commons there would be an ""increased presence"" of Border Force officers at Purfleet, the Essex port where the container arrived. She also said an agreement had been reached with Belgian authorities to send additional immigration officers to Zeebrugge. The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Three other people arrested in connection with the deaths were released on bail on Sunday. Another driver, who is suspected of bringing the container to Zeebrugge before it crossed the Channel, was arrested at the port of Dublin on Saturday on unrelated charges. But Irish police, who are liaising with their Essex counterparts, said the man was the driver of a blue truck seized at Dublin port as part of the ongoing investigations into the 39 deaths. The blue truck cab was seized by police in Dublin The families of Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong are concerned they may be among the victims Detectives in Essex are now working on the largest mass fatality victim identification process in the force's history. Initially, police said the 31 men and eight women were Chinese but a number of Vietnamese families have described how they fear their loved ones are among the dead. Some of the victims are said to have paid thousands of pounds to guarantee their safe passage to the UK, from where they would be able to carry out work that would give them money to send home. Reuters reports that the UK government has sent documents to Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security in a bid to identify four of the 39 victims. Essex lorry deaths: What we know Lorry death agony builds for Vietnamese families Families in the country have shared their fears their loved ones could have been among those who died. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on Tuesday night, saying her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". Meanwhile, Nguyen Dinh Gia said he had not heard from his son Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, since he told him last week he was trying to join a group to get from Paris to the UK. Detectives are also investigating claims the lorry could have been part of a convoy of three carrying about 100 people.

Week ahead in Parliament,"It's going to be a rather strange week in Westminster - with the tone of what follows dictated by the result of the government's latest attempt to trigger a general election. Remember that under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, this requires a two-thirds majority, which is looking difficult to attain. If it succeeds, both Houses will go into ""washup"" mode, speeding through any essential business, before Parliament is dissolved (dissolution would have to take place on 6 November at the latest, if the election was to be held on 12 December). If, as seems more likely, the vote is not won, the government says it will cease to put Brexit legislation before MPs, even though its Withdrawal Agreement Bill actually achieved a majority of 30 votes. How this will play out is anybody's guess - but in the absence of legislation to enact a Brexit deal, the UK would leave the EU without a deal, when any extended period of membership comes to an end. Which suggests that there will be behind the scenes efforts to find some way out; either an agreement on the timetable for passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, with a deadline acceptable to the government and Labour, or some cunning fix to move to that early election. The Withdrawal Amendment Bill is a major piece of legislation which deals with all manner of vital issues - security cooperation with the EU, the rights of Brits in Europe, the mechanics of the proposed checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and the arrangements for the transition to the as yet un-negotiated long term relationship with the EU, to name but a few. And that's before we get on to possible hostile amendments on a customs union or a referendum, or whatever. And while, for many MPs, scrutiny of the detail of legislation is an empty ritual, during which they sign Christmas cards or answer letters, rather than engaging with the process, others will detect problems which might be critical to their constituents and local interests. Ram the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the Commons in 36 hours, runs the argument, and there would be little chance to address them, while a more leisurely process could head off any number of problems once the Bill becomes law. But don't ignore the raw electoral strategy that lurks millimetres below the surface of this argument. The Conservatives are seeking to frame the Brexit battle as ""the people versus Parliament"". But plenty of Labour MPs say they're simply not prepared to vote for an election at a time and on the ground of the prime minister's choosing. They want the Conservatives to go into an election with their Brexit Party flank unsecured, and with their internal divisions over Brexit festering visibly. For the SNP and the Lib Dems the considerations are a little different - both want to stop Brexit, but now calculate that there are not enough votes in this Parliament to get a second referendum, and both believe they would win more seats, so increasingly feel they have nothing to lose - although again they are wary of letting the PM control the timing and context of any election. Meanwhile, for all the talk of the government going ""on strike"" there is a fair wodge of (mostly rather humdrum) legislation landing in the Lords and the Commons this week, and the select committees are beavering away at their inquiries, conscious that the music might stop and an election might be called at any moment. And there's an election for Speaker rumbling in the background, with MPs due to vote a week on Monday. John Mann is standing down as an MP to head a government inquiry into anti-Semitism Incidentally, one amusing sub-plot will be the departure from the Commons (probably on Tuesday, I hear), and immediate arrival in the Lords, of the Labour MP, John Mann. He is leaving the Commons to lead the government's campaign against anti-Semitism, and plans to allow himself to be disqualified as an MP by the act of becoming a peer, rather than taking the more usual route of applying for an office of profit under the Crown, like the Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Manor of Northstead (MPs can't simply resign, under rules dating back before the Civil War; they have to self-disqualify). A writ for a by-election has to be moved as a motion, usually without notice in the House at the very beginning of proceedings before Question Time and there's a very strong tradition that the moving is done only by the chief whip of the party which held the seat at the point the vacancy occurred. Mr Mann's Bassetlaw seat is precisely the kind of pro-Brexit blue collar seat the Conservatives will be targeting at the next election, so a by-election there (if not overtaken by an early general election) would be quite an event. Here is my regular look at the week ahead in Parliament: The Commons opens (14:30) with Home Office questions - look out for Labour MP Sarah Champion, who is campaigning to change the law so that it is a criminal offence to marry children under age 18. At the moment  16-17-year-olds may marry with parental consent, but she is concerned that, often, the children (mainly girls) getting married at this age are pressured into marrying older men -   it requires the child to recognise the marriage is coerced for it to count as a forced marriage. MPs are concerned about pressure on young women to marry older men After Question Time (and assuming no post-weekend statements or Urgent Questions intrude), the prime minister will make his third attempt to trigger an early general election. Under the Cameron-Clegg Fixed Term Parliaments Act, two thirds of MPs (and we're talking about the total number, 650, not the number present at a particular vote, and including the non-attending Sinn Fein MPs and the Speaker and deputies) which means 434 MPs have to vote for the election. In practice, this means that even were the SNP and the Lib Dems to support the motion, around 80 Labour MPs would also have to join the Conservatives in the Aye Lobby. And it is clear that even if Labour were to whip in favour of an election, many Labour MPs are still minded to vote against - essentially on the turkeys-early Christmas principle. The government knows these numbers, and so they may be staging this vote as a piece of parliamentary theatre, to demonstrate that it is the Commons that is preventing the on-schedule delivery of Brexit. Look out for some combative exchanges on points of order, after the result is announced. There had been talk of the government ""going on strike"" and refusing to put legislation before Parliament if the vote is lost - but the Prime Minister's Official Spokesman now says that only Brexit legislation will be held back, and efforts to pursue a ""dynamic and ambitious"" domestic agenda ""with full vigour"" will continue. The day's main debate will be on the Second Reading of the Environment Bill - a major 130-clause piece of legislation, setting up an Office for Environmental Protection, with scrutiny, advice and enforcement functions and allowing the government to set long-term, legally binding environmental targets on air quality, water, biodiversity, resource efficiency and waste reduction. MPs are due to debate re-wilding and bioderversity In Westminster Hall (16:30) MPs debate e-petition 254607: ""Restore nature on a massive scale to help stop climate breakdown..... to avoid a climate emergency we need to act fast. Rewilding and other natural climate solutions can draw millions of tonnes of CO2 out of the air through restoring and protecting our living systems. We call on the UK government to make a bold financial and political commitment to nature's recovery."" The petition attracted 109,077 signatures. My committee corridor pick is a session of the high powered joint committee on the National Security Strategy (16:15) on Biosecurity and human health: preparing for emerging infectious diseases and bioweapons. The key witness is Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer for England. Elsewhere, look out for the Public Accounts session (16:00) on food safety and standards, with officials from the Food Standards Agency and the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, and Housing, Communities and Local Government has its first encounter with the new Secretary of State, Robert Jenrick. In the Lords (14:30), the day opens with the introduction of two new peers - Lord Hendy QC, a barrister specialising in employment law, who will sit as a Labour peer, and Baroness Hunt of Bethnal Green, the former Chief Executive of Stonewall, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans equality charity . She will sit as a Crossbench peer. Questions to ministers include the Conservative, Lady Gardner of Parkes, asking about regulating websites like AirBnb and assessing their impact on the availability of housing for rent. There will be a short debate on vocational education and training in secondary schools - and then peers move on to the Second Reading of the Historical Institutional Abuse (Northern Ireland) Bill, which establishes the Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Board and provides for compensation for children abused in certain institutions. It also creates a Commissioner for Survivors of Institutional Childhood Abuse. MPs open (11:30) with Health and Social Care Questions, The main debate is a re-run of the Second Reading of the Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Bill - this had a second reading in July, and had strong cross-party support, but fell when Parliament was prorogued. Its aim is to provide a greater deterrent to animal cruelty by extending the maximum sentence possible, from six months to five years in England and Wales. In Westminster Hall, subjects for debate include the proposed reinstatement of the Colne to Skipton railway link (09:30); the funding of Liverpool City Council (11:00); Endometriosis workplace support (14:30); bus services in Cumbria (16:00) and government support for economy and innovation in Northern Ireland (16:30). It's a busy day on the committee corridor, with Health and Social Care (14:30) quizzing a high powered panel of expert witnesses in their follow-up inquiry on Childhood obesity, and then three ministers, Nigel Adams, Minister for Sport, Jo Churchill, Health Minister for Prevention, and Luke Hall, Minister for Local Government and Homelessness. Foreign Affairs looks at the future of Britain's diplomatic relationship with Europe (14:45);Environmental Audit meets the new Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Theresa Villiers (14:15); International Development taking evidence from Africa Minister Andrew Stephenson on humanitarian crises in Africa (13:30) and Defence will be hearing from experts and the Police about the domestic threat of drones (14:00); In the Lords (14:30) the day opens with the introduction of Lord Ranger, Raminder Singh Ranger, a refugee from the 1947 partition of India, who became the chairman of the British Sikh Association and joint chairman of the Conservative Friends of India. The main business is the Second Reading debate on the Health Service Safety Investigations Bill which will establish a new independent Health Service Safety Investigations Body. Health minister Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford leads for the government. The Commons begins (11:30) with half an hour of Northern Ireland Questions, followed by Prime Minister's Question Time - the last to be presided over by John Bercow - will he stretch it over the one-hour mark? That will be followed by a general debate on Grenfell Tower. In Westminster Hall the debates include: building out extant planning permissions (09:30); integrated foreign policy after the UK leaves the EU (11:00); child poverty in Scotland (14:30); bus passes for 1950s women (16:00) and the contribution of the Gujarati community to the UK (16:30) Once again there's plenty of select committee activity. The Treasury committee, under new management with former Treasury Minister Mel Stride now in the chair, has a session on regional imbalances in the UK economy (14:15). Northern Ireland Affairs takes evidence on consultation on implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, (09:30); Work and Pensions focuses on the new Pension Schemes Bill (09:30). And Women and Equalities (09.50) has its first evidence session on its inquiry into prostitution, with Criminology Professor Teela Sanders, Lynette Woodrow, the deputy chief Crown prosecutor for London South, and Prof Marianne Hester, who holds the chair in gender, violence and international policy, at the University of Bristol. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (10:00) has a follow-up session on the rolling out of smart meters. In the Lords (15:00) the main business is the Second Reading of the Pension Schemes Bill, which has cross-party support and deals with protecting Collective Defined Contribution schemes. These schemes exist in other countries, notably the Netherlands, but are new to the UK. Major supporters have been the Royal Mail and the Communication Workers Union and there has been considerable cross party discussion, involving Labour's Jack Dromey.. The Bill also creates new criminal offences and financial penalties, gives the Pensions Regulator more powers, intended to prevent more BHS-type problems and will aim for closer supervision and larger penalties. It also sets up the proposed Pensions Dashboard system. John Bercow retires from the Speaker's chair on Thursday The Commons day opens (09:30) with 40 minutes of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Questions, followed by mini-question times to the MPs who speak on behalf of the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission, the Public Accounts Commission and the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission. And the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees Mogg. will make the weekly business statement, setting out the forthcoming agenda for the Commons. Because this will be Speaker Bercow's last day in the chair, there will probably be some tributes - maybe rather barbed ones in some cases, and there will then be an opportunity for tributes to the Speaker's Chaplain Rose Hudson Wilkin, who is leaving to become Bishop of Dover. The main debate will be a general debate on spending on children's services. In the Lords (11:00), questions to ministers includes Labour's Lord Dubs asking about the Demands of Extinction Rebellion. The main debates are on the Phase 1 report of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry and then on the government's international development work to promote the sustainable use of natural resources and prevent biodiversity loss. Neither House is scheduled to sit on Friday, 1 November.

Argentina gets new president amid economic crisis,"This video can not be played Argentina election: Alberto FernÃ¡ndez wins Presidency Centre-left opposition candidate Alberto FernÃ¡ndez has been elected president of Argentina in a vote dominated by economic concerns. Mr FernÃ¡ndez, 60, got more than the 45% of the vote needed to win, beating conservative incumbent Mauricio Macri. Raucous crowds gathered at Mr FernÃ¡ndez's election headquarters to celebrate the result of Sunday's poll. The vote was held amid an economic crisis that has left a third of Argentina's population in poverty. Former president Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, 66, will now become vice-president in Mr FernÃ¡ndez's administration. She is said to have played a key role in Mr FernÃ¡ndez's electoral triumph. Mr Macri, 60, had trailed behind his challenger in pre-election polls and was trounced by the opposition in primary elections in August. He conceded defeat on Sunday night, congratulating his political rival. Argentina dreams of breaking the cycle of crisis For Argentine voters, only one thing matters Argentine voters scarred by deep economic crisis On Monday, Mr FernÃ¡ndez was seen arriving at the presidential palace in Buenos Aires to discuss an orderly transition with Mr Macri. Mr FernÃ¡ndez, who belongs to the populist Peronist movement, said his team would collaborate with the outgoing president ""in every way we can"". With 97.13% of ballots counted, Mr FernÃ¡ndez had 48.10% of the vote, Argentina's electoral authority said. Mr Macri had 40.37%. To win in the first round, a candidate needs at least 45% of the vote, or 40% and a 10-point lead over the second-place contestant. Mr FernÃ¡ndez is expected to assume the presidency on 10 December. The vote was dominated by concerns over the economy. With about one in 10 people out of work, Argentine voters backed the candidate they thought was best-placed to lead the country out of the crisis. Mr Macri promised to achieve ""zero poverty"", but things actually worsened during his four-year rule. His supporters say he inherited a broken economy when he came to power and needed more time to fix it. Mr FernÃ¡ndez has vowed to play things safe financially, but some voters fear that under his administration Argentina could return to the populist policies that helped push the country to its current state. On Monday, the central bank restricted dollar purchases to $200 (Â£155) from $10,000 a month until December. The move is aimed at reducing dollar demand and stabilising the Argentine peso. At the Alberto FernÃ¡ndez campaign headquarters, people started gathering in celebration even before the result was out. Waving blue and white Argentine flags, many supporters also wore T-shirts with his face emblazoned on them. But more ubiquitous was the image of Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, his vice-president and former leader. For many, she is a modern-day Eva PerÃ³n - a woman who has supported the poor with social programmes. Her presence in this race clearly helped to propel Alberto FernÃ¡ndez to the top. So much so that many people, when asked who they were voting for, replied ""Cristina"" as if she was the one running for president rather than vice-president. But she is a divisive figure, also accused of being corrupt and economically irresponsible. Former President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner (C) will now return as vice-president The chants from the crowds of ""we will be back"" came true. Alberto and Cristina - and Peronism - are back. The challenge now will be to satisfy those who wanted a return to old politics, while convincing their critics they'll move the country forward. Career politician Mr FernÃ¡ndez has caused quite a stir since he first appeared in the limelight of Argentine politics some six months ago. The former campaign strategist began his bid for the presidency in May - something of a surprise as ex-president Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner had been widely tipped to be the centre-left opposition coalition's candidate for the top office. Argentina's political strategist turned candidate But Mr FernÃ¡ndez really came into his own in August when he defeated Mr Macri by nearly 15 percentage points in primary elections, a compulsory vote for all electors which is seen is a dry-run for the presidency. This victory, defying all predictions, set him up as the clear favourite.

Man due in court over Essex lorry deaths,"Maurice Robinson appeared via video-link charged with 39 counts of manslaughter A driver accused of the manslaughter of 39 people found dead in a lorry was part of a ""global ring"" of people smugglers, prosecutors have alleged. Maurice Robinson, from Craigavon, was remanded in custody at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. The 39 bodies were found in the lorry trailer on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, on Wednesday. Writing in a book of condolence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the world had been ""shocked by this tragedy"". Mr Robinson, of Laurel Drive, appeared via video-link and is charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. Prosecutor Ogheneruona Iguyovwe described the conspiracy charges as ""a global ring"" involving ""the movement of a large number of illegal immigrants into the UK"". Mr Robinson was not asked to indicate pleas and will next appear at the Old Bailey on 25 November. DNA tests are being carried out in Vietnam to help to identify the victims. Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed a book of condolence The prime minister was joined at Thurrock Council's offices by Home Secretary Priti Patel and members of the emergency services. Writing in the book of condolence, Mr Johnson said: ""The whole nation, and indeed the world had been shocked by this tragedy and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country. ""In condemning the callousness of those responsible for this crime, we in the government of the United Kingdom resolve to do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators to justice."" Richard Galpin, BBC News Home Secretary Priti Patel and Boris Johnson laid flowers in tribute to the people who died Inside the modern Thurrock Council chamber, surrounded by aides and officials from the emergency services, Boris Johnson bent down to write his message of condolence to the families of the 39 men and women who died inside the sealed container last week. He hesitated briefly before starting to write a long message expressing the shock in this country and beyond of what had happened. Other officials followed in what was a solemn occasion carried out in silence. The prime minister and home secretary then laid flowers in a small garden outside the council offices before heading back to central London. Ms Patel later told the House of Commons there would be an ""increased presence"" of Border Force officers at Purfleet, the Essex port where the container arrived. She also said an agreement had been reached with Belgian authorities to send additional immigration officers to Zeebrugge. The bodies were discovered in the early hours of Wednesday Three other people arrested in connection with the deaths were released on bail on Sunday. Another driver, who is suspected of bringing the container to Zeebrugge before it crossed the Channel, was arrested at the port of Dublin on Saturday on unrelated charges. But Irish police, who are liaising with their Essex counterparts, said the man was the driver of a blue truck seized at Dublin port as part of the ongoing investigations into the 39 deaths. The blue truck cab was seized by police in Dublin The families of Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong are concerned they may be among the victims Detectives in Essex are now working on the largest mass fatality victim identification process in the force's history. Initially, police said the 31 men and eight women were Chinese but a number of Vietnamese families have described how they fear their loved ones are among the dead. Some of the victims are said to have paid thousands of pounds to guarantee their safe passage to the UK, from where they would be able to carry out work that would give them money to send home. Reuters reports that the UK government has sent documents to Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security in a bid to identify four of the 39 victims. Essex lorry deaths: What we know Lorry death agony builds for Vietnamese families Families in the country have shared their fears their loved ones could have been among those who died. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on Tuesday night, saying her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". Meanwhile, Nguyen Dinh Gia said he had not heard from his son Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, since he told him last week he was trying to join a group to get from Paris to the UK. Detectives are also investigating claims the lorry could have been part of a convoy of three carrying about 100 people.

MPs demand action over rise in online bank crashes,"UP to 1.9 million customers were unable to access their money when TSB's system crashed. MPs have condemned the level of IT failures at banks, warning that financial levies on firms and more regulation may be needed. A Treasury Committee report said the frequency of online banking crashes and customer disruption was ""unacceptable"". The report, published on Monday, said with bank branches and cash machines closing, there was greater urgency to ensure online banking worked. Major banks typically suffer more than 10 online outages a month. Customers are being left ""cashless and cut off"", the report said. Firms could do much more to ensure their IT systems were resilient and to resolve complaints and compensation more quickly. The MPs suggest the three major regulators - Financial Conduct Authority, Prudential Regulation Authority, Bank of England - do not have the staff and experience to deal with the growing number of computer failures. An increase in the financial levies on banks may be needed to ensure that the regulators are adequately funded and resourced , the report says. Barclays tops list of banks with most IT shutdowns Banks hit by dozens of IT shutdowns TSB loses more than 16,000 customers MPs are also worried about the increase use of third-party providers of cloud services for computing power and data storage. ""The consequences of a major operational incident at a large cloud service provider, such as Microsoft, Google or Amazon, could be significant,"" the report said. ""There is, therefore, a considerable case for the regulation of these cloud service providers to ensure high standards of operational resilience."" Cloud services ""stood out as such a source of systemic risk"" for the financial system, the MPs said. Steve Baker, the Treasury Committee's lead member on the inquiry, said: ""The number of IT failures that have occurred in the financial services sector, including TSB, Visa and Barclays, and the harm caused to consumers is unacceptable. ""The committee, therefore, launched this inquiry to look 'under the bonnet' at what's causing the proliferation of such incidents, and what the regulators can do to prevent and mitigate their impacts."" Mr Baker added: ""For too long, financial institutions issue hollow words after their systems have failed, which is of no help to customers left cashless and cut off."" The MPs also said there is a ""concerning"" lack of consistent and accurate recording of data on IT incidents. If future incidents occur without sanction, Parliament should consider whether the regulators' enforcement powers are fit for purpose, the report said. TSB suffered a high-profile IT failure last year which left customers unable to access their accounts, following the introduction of a new system. Up to 1.9 million people lost access to online banking services. The MPs said regulators must provide them with the outcome of their investigation into the TSB IT failure as soon as possible. Mr Baker said: ""For too long, we have waited for a comprehensive account of what happened during the TSB IT failure. Our inquiry into service disruption at TSB remains open."" Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, the trade body for the financial services sector, said the industry was investing billions of pounds to ensure its systems are robust and secure. ""When incidents do occur, firms work around the clock to minimise disruption and get services back up and running as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""The industry conducts sector-wide exercises with regulators to ensure it is prepared to respond effectively to any major disruptions or events as part of its continued commitment to maintaining the resilience of the financial system."" He said UK Finance is working to improve co-ordination with regulators, but it was important to ""avoid overlapped or rushed mandatory change programmes that impact firms' ability to protect their customers"".

What will happen in the next few days?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Democrat rising star resigns amid affair claims,"Katie Hill acknowledges a relationship with a female campaign staff member, but not a congressional aide. US lawmaker Katie Hill has announced her resignation from Congress, following allegations that she had an affair with a Capitol Hill aide. The California Democrat, who has denied the claim, said she was stepping down with a ""broken heart"". ""I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country,"" she wrote on Twitter. The resignation came days after she was placed under investigation by the House of Representatives Ethics Committee. The ethics committee launched an inquiry after conservative blog RedState reported allegations that Ms Hill had an affair with one of her congressional aides, a man. The same blog separately reported claims that Ms Hill, who is bisexual, had also engaged in a three-way consensual romance with a female campaign staff member and her husband. It published naked images of the politician. She has asked police to investigate the nude photos being published online. House lawmaker's alleged relationship investigated Breaking down the US mid-terms Ms Hill, 32, has denied having an affair with her aide, which would be a possible violation of House rules. In a statement announcing the investigation, the ethics committee noted thatthe opening of an inquiry did not mean ""that any violation has occurred"",external. Mrs Hill, far right, was elected as part of a Democratic wave in 2018 Hours before the congressional inquiry was launched on Wednesday, Ms Hill sent a letter to supporters acknowledging a ""relationship"" with a female 2018 campaign staff member. She described that affair as ""inappropriate"". The relationship that Ms Hill acknowledged took place before she was elected, so it fell outside congressional rules on personal relationships. In her resignation letter on Sunday, Ms Hill said stepping down from Congress was the ""hardest thing"" she had ever had to do. ""Having private photos of personal moments weaponised against me has been an appalling invasion of my privacy. It's also illegal, and we are currently pursuing all of our available legal options,"" she wrote. ""However, I know that as long as I am in Congress, we'll live fearful of what might come next and how much it will hurt."" Ms Hill has accused her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, of trying to humiliate her. She says the campaign relationship began in the final ""tumultuous"" years of her marriage. ""I know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment,"" she said in the letter to supporters. ""For that I apologise."" Two years ago during her congressional campaign, she described Kenny Heslep, whom she wed in 2010, in a social media post as ""my best friend and the love of my life"".

Ms Hill has represented the 25th district in southern California since 2018, when she was elected as part of a Democratic wave. She is also vice-chairwoman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which has been investigating President Donald Trump's financial dealings.

BBC 100 Women 2019: Who is on the list?My pimp branded me with a 'Love is Loyalty' tattooVideoVideoUnsigned singer who became sound of a revolutionThe real (and fake) sex lives of Bella ThorneVideoVideo,"The BBC has revealed its list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world for 2019. This year 100 Women is asking: what would the future look like if it were driven by women? From climate change activist Greta Thunberg, to trans woman Nisha Ayub who was put into a male prison aged 21, many on the list are driving change on behalf of women everywhere. They give us their vision of what life could look like in 2030. Others, such as the ""ghost"" politician defying the mafia, and the footballer battling misogyny, are using their extraordinary personal experiences to blaze a path for those who follow. Precious Adams spent so much time dancing round the living room as a child, that her mum signed her up for dance lessons. She trained at several top ballet schools, including the National Ballet School of Canada, the Princess Grace Academy in Monaco and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow. She was promoted to first artist by the English National Ballet in 2017, and won the Emerging Artist Award at the Critics' Circle National Dance Awards the following year. She has been credited with opening up a conversation on ballet dancers being able to wear tights that match their skin tone. My hope for the future is that more and more people engage with the arts. I'd like as many people as possible to find the same joy, freedom, and fulfilment from the arts that I have. Parveena is known as the ""Iron lady of Kashmir"". Her teenage son disappeared in 1990, at the height of an uprising against Indian rule in Kashmir. He is one of thousands of ""disappeared"" there - leading Parveena to set up the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP). She says she has not given up hope of seeing her son again, with next year marking the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. The grief of losing my son to enforced disappearance inspires me to struggle for justice and accountability, and I aspire to work towards making the world a better place, especially for women. Known as Italy's ""ghost"" politician, Piera Aiello ran for office with her face covered by a veil due to threats from the mafia. In 2018, after winning her seat as an anti-mafia candidate, she finally revealed her face to the public. She has used her experience of being forced to marry the son of a mafia boss at 14 to advocate for the rights of police informants and their children. The truth lives on. Jasmin is Rohingya, described by the UN as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. She was born in a refugee camp in Bangladesh just after her father died. Since arriving in the UK as a refugee, she has excelled at cricket, and together with her friends started an all-Asian girls' cricket team in Bradford. This year she was selected to represent England in the first Street Child Cricket World Cup for charity. All I know is the feeling, the sheer pleasure of the motion feels greater when every breath blows with liberation. Contemporary artist Manal AlDowayan's work explores invisibility, archives, memory and the representation of women in her country. From black and white photographs of Saudi Arabia's female workforce, to a frozen flock of birds imprinted with the permission slip Saudi women require to travel. In 2018, the British Museum placed two of her artworks on long-term display in the Islamic Gallery. Every day I am confronted with the incredible brilliance and courage of women around me, and I can only see a better future when these women have their place in society and history. In 2016, Kimia became the first Iranian woman to win a medal at the Olympics since the country began competing in 1948. As a taekwondo athlete, Kimia is credited with ""emboldening Iranian girls and women to push the boundaries of personal freedom"" by the UK's Financial Times newspaper. The 21-year-old is now training three times a day to seek qualification for Tokyo 2020, where she hopes to inspire the next generation of Iranian women in martial arts. In Iran, female athletes face different challenges. But I hope in the face of all the hardships we will continue and never give up. Dr Alanoud Alsharekh is a founding member of the Abolish 153 campaign, calling for Kuwait's ""honour-killing"" law to be scrapped. She works with institutions to improve gender equality in the Middle East, and was the first Kuwaiti awarded France's National Order of Merit, for her defence of women's rights. Training and empowering future female leaders is a major issue that I am doing my part to see resolved in the immediate future, not only in Kuwait but across the region. When war broke out in architect Marwa Al-Sabouni's home city of Homs, Syria, she refused to leave. She has written a book documenting this time, and has drawn up plans to rebuild the destroyed Baba Amr district, in a way that would bring different classes and ethnic groups together. She runs the world's only website dedicated to architectural news in Arabic, and has received the Prince Claus award, which honours âoutstanding achievement of visionaries at the front-line of culture and developmentâ. Without home there is no future. My hope is that we can raise enough awareness to build places for people to which they can truly belong. It isn't an exaggeration to claim that much of the troubles of our time would be diminished through this act. Rida Al Tubuly is one of many women pushing for gender equality - but she's doing it from a warzone. Her organisation, Together We Build It, pushes for women's involvement in solving Libya's conflict. In 2018, she told the Human Rights Council in Geneva that high level UN meetings about Libya's future were failing to include women. The university professor holds a postgraduate degree in International Human Rights Law. Women's future is now, not tomorrow and not the day after. I promote peace at all levels, and I'm confident that women are able to very soon change the status quo in fields historically designated to men, such as peace building and conflict mediation. Tabata Amaral, one of Brazil's youngest congresswomen, came to national attention this year when a video of her grilling the country's education minister went viral. Dubbed ""Brazil's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"" by the press, the 25-year-old grew up on the outskirts of Sao Paulo where she lost her father to drug addiction. Dedicating herself to her education, she won a place at Harvard University with a full scholarship, and graduated in Political Science and Astrophysics. As a member of parliament, her main agendas are education, women's rights, political innovation and sustainable futures. My biggest hope for the future of women in Brazil is that our fight for equal rights, for equal opportunities, be so consolidated that the next generation of girls will be born knowing no limits to their dreams. Yalitza Aparicio trained as a primary school teacher, but ended up being cast as the lead in Alfonso CuarÃ³n's Oscar-winning film Roma after accompanying her sister to the audition. She became the first indigenous Mexican woman to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for the role. She now advocates for gender equality, rights for indigenous communities and constitutional protection for domestic workers. The ideal future for women is one in which we achieve gender equality; we have the same rights and the same opportunities men have. In the workplace, a future in which our pay is fair and we are compensated for the value we generate - that would be a good start. Born in Lebanon but raised in the US, poet Dayna Ash was shocked when she was advised to hide her sexuality on her return to Beirut at 16. So she founded Haven for Artists, an all-inclusive organisation for artists and activists, and the city's only cultural and creative safe space for women and the LGBTQI+ community. She and her team run the centre for free, allowing vulnerable people to live in the residence and encouraging them to exchange tools, skills, and experience. Freedom is not only ours to demand but to design. Dina is the fastest woman in British history and the first British woman to win a major global sprint title. She took gold in the final of the women's 200m at the World Athletics Championships in Doha, after she had already taken silver in the 100m. Sport allows you to view your body in a positive way as you see the amazing things it is able to do and how it can change. This helps to build self-esteem and leads to healthier lifestyles both in a physical and mental capacity. I want sport to be an area where young women can be unapologetically themselves. NASA's MiMi Aung is responsible for a team designing a helicopter to fly on Mars. After travelling alone from Myanmar to the US to further her education at 16, MiMi is now project manager at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology. She is challenged with building an aircraft light enough to fly in the very thin atmosphere of the Red Planet - it should reach the surface in February 2021. My view for the future is continued advancement and innovation of new capabilities. Personally for me, it has been about first-of-its-kind, increasingly capable autonomous systems for space exploration. I believe that critical thinking is key to making major advancements. At 21, trans woman Nisha Ayub was sentenced to three months in a male prison under a provision of Sharia law which prohibits ""a male person wearing women's attire or posing as a woman in a public space.â Since her release, she has been a tireless advocate for the rights of transgender people in Malaysia, co-founding SEED - the country's first ever trans-led organisation - and creating T-Home, which addresses the issue of homelessness for older trans women who are left without family support. She was awarded the US International Women of Courage award in 2016 for her work. Trans people are just as human as everyone. We cry in tears, we bleed red, we have dreams and hopes, we want to be loved and cared for, we have feelings and emotions as we are your own reflection... we are not asking for special rights but the same equal rights as others. Raised on a farm in Uganda, Judith Bakirya became the first of her peers to win a scholarship to a prestigious girls' boarding school, going on to obtain a masters in the UK and a job in the City. But unsatisfied in her work, she quit, using her savings to fly home and found an organic fruit farm, Busaino Fruits & Herbs. Since winning a national agriculture award, she has used the platform to draw attention to women's rights issues, including lack of land ownership, lack of access to education and domestic violence. Working with women smallholder garden owners in innovative ways, honouring indigenous knowledge and developing biodiverse agroecosystems, promotes sustainable food production and nutrition. Branded as 21st Century building blocks, Ayah Bdeir's littleBits company makes kits of electronic blocks that snap together with magnets, allowing anyone to ""build, prototype, and invent"". Already used in thousands of schools across the US, this year Ayah launched a $4m value initiative with Disney to try and close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, (STEM), supplying 15,000 10-year-old girls in California with free littleBits kits. I am on a mission to make sure every kid â regardless of gender, background, or ethnicity â has the skills to invent the world they want to live in. Buddhism is Thailand's most common religion, with some 300,000 Buddhist monks. But female monks - known as bhikkhunis - aren't recognised, and are banned from being ordained on Thai soil. So in 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni flew to Sri Lanka to be ordained, and returned as Thailand's first female monk. There are now 100 others like her. She is abbess of Songdhammakalyani - the country's first ever all-female Buddhist monastery. We still need to struggle to make the ordination of women in Thailand a reality. Feminist medical doctor Mabel Bianco has spent four decades putting women's health, reproductive rights, abortion, and HIV/AIDS on the public policy agenda in Argentina. She has introduced policies to save women's lives - from tackling breast cancer to violence against women - and has been a pioneer of sex education in the face of Roman Catholic conservatism. This year marks her 30th as president of the Foundation for Studies and Research on Women (FEIM) supporting the rights of women in Latin America and the world. I want a near future without women dying needlessly. I hope we will reach a point where women all over the world can decide freely about their lives, their bodies, and whether to be mothers or not without risking death, and are able to live without gender violence. Raya is founder and CEO of the award-winning Awecademy, an organisation with a mission to use education to improve the world. It aims to inspire teachers and students with online learning modules like 21st Century Skills and Cosmic Citizenship, to bring positive change to humanity for the future. I am intelligently optimistic about the future. This is because the future of humanity is not pre-defined or set in stone, but rather it's up to us to create it. We can choose to create a future that is brimming with prosperity, progress, and love. Katie was a key leader on the team that developed algorithms and techniques to recover the first-ever image of a black hole. She started the project as a graduate student, and is now an assistant professor of computing and mathematical sciences at the California Institute of Technology. Katie collaborated with a number of women on the Event Horizon Telescope team to pull off this feat, on everything from instrumentation to black hole theory. My ambition for the future is that we use artificial intelligence and machine-learning methods to design better scientists, who tell us how to go and discover the world around us. After recounting not being able to reach the locks on toilet doors in a candid speech in 2017, SinÃ©ad Burke quickly became one of the world's most influential disability activists. Calling for all design to be more accessible, she has challenged some of the biggest names in the fashion industry - including Anna Wintour - to make clothing more inclusive. This year she became the first little person to appear on the cover of Vogue, and is launching her first podcast, aimed at challenging us to confront our biases and feel empowered to impact the world. As women move into positions that can create systemic change, we must be explicit in our refusal to repeat the cycles of oppression and exclusion that have been indelibly etched into our consciousness and beings. Our approach to redesigning the future must be intersectional. Author of Contraceptive Justice: Why We Need a Male Pill, bioethicist Lisa Campo-Engelstein's work aims to improve women's lives through finding new methods of contraception. She also specialises in improving fertility for cancer survivors. A word after a word after a word is power. (Margaret Atwood) Scarlett is co-founder of The Pink Protest, an online community of activists who supported the successful #FreePeriods campaign to get free menstrual products in schools in England. They have also helped push a bill through Parliament to make FGM part of the Children's Act. Scarlett's book, It's Not OK to Feel Blue (and other lies), brings together high-profile figures to talk about their experiences of mental health and the stigma surrounding the issue. Because the future will not be drawn without them. Delivering post in rural Wales, Ella was shocked by the amount of discarded plastic on the streets. So she started a campaign for plastic-free period products, successfully lobbying manufacturers to make real changes and councils to spend their period poverty funding on eco-friendly products. My hopes for the future are that period products come without plastic, governments make sustainable choices and manufacturers put the planet before profit. British-Indian Sharan is founder and editor-in-chief of Burnt Roti magazine, focusing on mental and sexual health for young South Asians, and LGBTQ rights. Aided by crowdfunding, she published her first print issue in April 2016 and has since launched an online version. The platform hosted the Let's Talk About Sex workshop in London in 2018, to try to end stigma around being South Asian and sexually active. Our conversation around gender has become more visible and we're fighting for recognition of people who identify differently to how they were assigned at birth...It's hard to identify progress with hostile political climates governing our language and accessibility. Salwa Eid Naser stunned the field in the 400m final in Doha this year by running faster than any woman has done for more than three decades. The reigning 400m world champion was born in Anambra State, Nigeria, but moved to Bahrain at 14 seeking opportunities to further her running career. She now represents the Gulf State internationally. I don't fear nothing for the future because it is something I can handle when it comes. I really want to get it all - now I have the world gold medal, I want to keep going and get the Olympic gold medal. Rana el Kaliouby is a pioneer of artificial emotional intelligence, or Emotion AI. Her start-up Affectiva has developed software that can understand emotions by analysing facial expressions through a camera. The technology is being installed in vehicles to detect sleepy drivers. Also a passionate advocate for gender equity in tech and AI, Rana is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. She holds a PhD from the University of Cambridge and a post-doctorate from MIT. AI is at an inflection point: it's increasingly acting on our behalf, taking on roles traditionally held by people. As we plan for a future, we need to ensure that diversity of all kinds - gender, race, age, education and perspectives - are represented. When Maria Fernanda Espinosa became president of the UN General Assembly, she became only the fourth woman to hold the position in the body's history - and the first from Latin America and the Caribbean. She has called on governments to put forward billions of dollars to tackle climate change, and announced her determination to fight gender discrimination. I envisage a future where efforts by the multilateral systems have led to the equal participation of men and women in politics, and to the protection of the rights of women who fight daily for jobs with equal conditions, and of women and girls who are the victims of violence. As South Africa faces rising rates of murder and rape against women and girls, Lucinda has emerged as a voice for women. She leads nationwide marches, rallying thousands of women in the streets of Cape Town, challenging government to translate policy into action. Lucinda founded Philisa Abafazi Bethu (Heal our Women), a non-profit organisation offering services including counselling, search committees for kidnapped girls and safe houses for women escaping domestic abuse. My hopes, as a Khoisan woman, are that we will one day be freed from violence against our bodies, and the bodies of our daughters, sisters, mothers and aunties. I hope that one day we will have a female president. For this, I will continue to advocate and rise in pain to power. Sister Gerard is a Roman Catholic nun in Singapore, who worked for three decades as a death row counsellor. Now 81, she has ""walked with"" 18 inmates before their deaths, describing her calling as helping ""people who are broken"". A female future, like any other, would be one filled with kindness, dignity and equality; a world without discrimination or hate, one that's driven by compassion. Overcoming a fear of water after falling into an adult pool as a toddler, Bethany Firth burst onto the swimming scene at the London 2012 Paralympics. Bethany, who has learning disabilities, is now a four-time Paralympic gold medallist and multiple world record holder, and was Britain's most decorated athlete at the Rio 2016 Paralympics. This year she won two golds at the World Para-swimming Championships in London, and was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to swimming in 2017. In swimming I think we've already got good equality in the sport but I'm really pleased to see new innovations such as mixed relay events being included at major events like the World Championships and Paralympic Games and only increasing opportunities to compete on the same stage. Owl - aka Ugla StefanÃ­a KristjÃ¶nudÃ³ttir JÃ³nsdÃ³ttir - is a journalist, writer and trans campaigner. They are the co-director of My Genderation, a film project focusing on trans lives and trans experiences. They also work with All About Trans, a project creating positive representation of transgender people in the media. They co-wrote the Trans Teen Survival Guide, to help empower transgender and non-binary teens. The future must move beyond the oppressive binaries of sex and gender - otherwise we will never truly break free and deconstruct the systems that have kept us complacent for so long. After storming to victory in 10.71 seconds at the women's 100m final in Doha in September 2019, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce now boasts more 100m world championship titles than Usain Bolt. It makes the Jamaican track and field sprinter the oldest woman to ever win an Olympic or world 100m title - and the first mum to do so since 1995. She carried son Zyon, two, on her lap of honour, saying she wanted to ""inspire women thinking of starting a family"". Finding balance is never easy but we as women get to decide. I never limit myself as to what is possible as long as my body will cooperate. It's important for the future of athletics that women continue to challenge themselves. I am excited to see just how far I can go, even at this stage of my career. At 26, Zarifa Ghafari is one of Afghanistan's first female mayors. The country's president appointed her mayor of Maidan Wardag, where support for the Taliban is widespread. She took the job despite it being too dangerous for her to live there - her office was mobbed by angry men on her first day. In the face of this adversity, she has taken to the streets with free rubbish bags as part of her clean city initiative, and says her goal is to make people believe in women's power. I'm the first female mayor for this war-torn province but I don't want to be the only one forever. I wish there were more women working alongside me in local government and leading departments and I am trying to make this a reality for other Afghan women. Human rights lawyer Jalila specialises in defending women's rights in Pakistan, and provides free legal services to women in poverty. She is founder of We the Humans, a non-profit organisation working with local communities to provide opportunities for vulnerable women and children. She is the first female lawyer from the persecuted Hazara community, and in 2018 she went on hunger strike demanding protection for her people. Looking back into the past leads to the realisation that the entire politics of conflict, war and destruction is interconnected with Patriarchy. This is the time now that the world should accept the future as female; [women] are the symbol of peace, fertility, creation and coexistence. Let the women lead. Tayla Harris is an Australian rules footballer playing for Carlton Football Club in the AFL Women's league, and a professional boxer. Since a photo of her kicking a ball during a match attracted misogynistic comments in March, a bronze statue of her has been unveiled in Melbourne's Federation Square, immortalising the kick in Australian sporting history. She also holds an unbeaten professional boxing record. A tattoo on my right arm reads 'fortune favours the brave'. I got this when I had my first professional boxing fight and moved away from family and friends to live in Melbourne and since this milestone, I've been fortunate to experience things I never would have thought possible. Hollie is a survivor of sex trafficking from Columbus, Ohio, US. She was first sold by her mother at the age of 15 and was enslaved through drug-use for 17 years. With the help of an innovative court programme called CATCH Court - which spots criminals who are actually victims - she was able to escape in 2015. Most women who are sex trafficked in the US are branded with tattoos or scars and she has since transformed the tattoos on her own body. She is working as a legal advocate for victims of domestic violence at a local Columbus court and is at the helm of Reaching For the Shining Starz â a non-profit organisation that helps victims of sex trafficking. Sex trafficking survivors are the most powerful, motivated, and compassionate group of people I've met in my lifetime. The ability to learn to trust, love, and forgive after we've been betrayed and badly abused â often by the people we loved â astonishes me. We genuinely are a resilient group that come back stronger than before. Huang Wensi, 29, is one of a small but growing number of female boxers in China. Challenging traditional stereotypes of women's roles, she overcame postpartum depression to win the Asia Female Continental Super Flyweight Championship gold belt in 2018. She wants to continue to fight social stigma against women in sport. I want to prove that women have the power to move the world. I hope more women are not just defined by their family, but their dream, too. This year, artist Luchita Hurtado landed her first solo show in a public gallery - at the age of 98. Born in Venezuela, and wife of influential artist Lee Mullican, she spent years treating her art as a private diary, before some 1,200 of her works were unearthed while curators were clearing out her late husband's studio. Hurtado's environmental advocacy continues to inform the visual language of her work. We should think before we vote Tired of the pain she suffered wearing heels eight hours a day at work, Yumi decided to vent her frustration on Twitter. Within days, Japan's #kutoo movement was born, with thousands of women sharing stories about being forced to wear heels to work as part of their uniform. Yumi gathered a petition of 20,000 signatures which she presented to the government over the issue. We're still in the situation where lots of people don't even realise there's gender discrimination in Japan, and for the #KuToo campaign too, lots of people don't regard it as an issue of discrimination. I hope people notice this kind of discrimination in our daily lives, and realise men and women are equal. Through a career in journalism and community social work, Asmaa has become the voice of Sierra Leone's voiceless. After learning of the rape of a five-year-old girl, she used her media platform to launch the Black Tuesday campaign, which encouraged women to wear black on the last Tuesday of each month to protest over the increase in the rape and abuse of girls under 12. The movement prompted presidential action to reform sexual violence policies. To all the women out there - we will find ourselves in male-dominated professions. Take the opportunity to stay on and persist. This is how the future holds more of us as leaders. Aranya uses beat poetry to address issues like gender equality, mental health and body positivity. Her performance of A Brown Girl's Guide to Beauty has been viewed over three million times on YouTube. If women joined the workforce the global GDP could increase by $28 trillion. Why are we limiting half of the world's population and their potential? What could a gender equal world look like? And how far are we from it? Katrina Johnston-Zimmerman is an urban anthropologist, working to make cities better places to live in. She co-founded The Women Led Cities Initiative, which aims to bring women's voices to the forefront of urban planning and design. The future of our cities is female because it has to be. Without a greater level of diversity, through women's input and impact on our urban environments, we are at an impasse for the future of these, our manufactured habitats. Dr Gada Kadoda helps women in remote areas use solar power to bring electricity to their villages by training them as community engineers. She was named a Unicef innovator to watch as the driving force behind Sudan's first innovation lab, giving students a space for collaborative working and problem-solving. She is founder of the Sudanese Knowledge Society, which gives young researchers the opportunity to freely interact with scientists and scholars from inside and outside the country. Women's urgent futures depend on mastering liberation tools to enrich our options. Born with a rare condition which left her with missing skin, Amy Karle grew up fascinated by the possibility of what the human body could be capable of with the right technology. Now an award-winning bioartist, her work includes a human hand design made with 3D-printed scaffolds and stem cells. Biotechnology can lead us into a very promising future or irreversible demise. It is of vital importance that we thoroughly and thoughtfully contemplate the range of dangers and potentials and work together to establish strategies to utilise our technology for the best and highest good of humanity. Self-proclaimed 'mother of all Sudanese martyrs', Ahlam's 17-year-old son was killed in a peaceful protest in 2013. Since then, Ahlam has dedicated her life to seeking justice for him, and fighting for the rights of those killed or 'disappeared' in Sudan. She was part of underground forums and protests and was ""brutally beaten"" when caught by security forces. In the movement that started in December 2018 against then-President Omar al-Bashir, Ahlam became a prominent protester, leading rallies with strong ties to the youth on the ground. Sudan will become again an important and powerful country. The young Sudanese have learned about their rights. Once they have become aware of what rights they are entitled to, they will never accept to abandon them. In 2019, cancer researcher Fiona Kolbinger became the first woman ever to win the Transcontinental Race - one of the world's toughest cycling races. Covering 4,000 km in 10 days - from Bulgaria to France - she beat off 264 competitors, the majority of which were male. I hope that one day, nobody will be underestimated because of gender, age, ethnicity or educational background any more â creating a respectful society that promotes confidence and gives equal chances to everybody. Hiyori Kon, 21, is a sumo wrestling prodigy in a country where women are still barred from competing professionally. She was the subject of the 2018 award-winning documentary Little Miss Sumo, which charted her battle to change the rules of one of the world's oldest sports, and give a voice to women in sumo. I would like to give the opportunity for children all over the world to get involved with sumo, and make sumo an Olympic sport. AÃ¯ssata Lam set up the Youth Chamber of Commerce of Mauritania to support young women entrepreneurs struggling to access funding for their start-ups. She is a vocal advocate for women's rights, using her platform to honour exceptional Mauritanian women, and was appointed to the G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council by French President Emmanuel Macron. The time is coming when women's voices cannot be silenced, nor ignored. The time is coming when women's equal participation in today's most pressing issues is necessary. The time is coming when women's seat at the table is non-negotiable. This time is now. Forensic psychology professor Soo Jung Lee has worked on numerous high-profile murder cases in South Korea. Based at Kyonggi University in Seoul, she has challenged the legal system, helping introduce an anti-stalking bill. She believes stalking leads to more serious crimes in many cases, where the majority of the victims are vulnerable women. As a forensic psychologist, I want the future to be a safe place for my children. Fei-Fei Li arrived in the US from China at 16 with no English language skills, working part-time in her parents' dry-cleaning business. Now widely credited as a pioneer of artificial intelligence, the former Google vice president co-directs Stanford's institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), which is looking at how to develop ethical AI. Li is co-founder of AI4ALL, which is focused on recruiting more women and minorities to build AI. We are on the cusp of the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This new era has the potential to help us realise our shared dream of a better future for all of humanity, but it will bring with it challenges and opportunities we can't yet foresee. My hope is that we will bring more voices, more views, and more expertise to the discussion. An award-winning independent adult filmmaker exploring how women can help shape the future of porn. She has also written a guide for parents on how to talk to their children about porn. Pornography isn't going anywhere; if we take action now, we can decide what happens next. Nominated for BBC 100 Women list by Jameela Jamil and the I Weigh community, Lauren Mahon is one third of the powerhouse trio ""kicking cancer's arse"" on BBC 5 Live's podcast You, Me & The Big C. The campaigner has set up online community Girl vs Cancer to provide young women with information on cancer charities, news on the nuances of treatments and tips for what to buy a bestie with cancer. My hope for the future is that every single female-identifying or non-binary human on the planet stands in their power and purpose. This is how we're going to change the world. Julie is from Tanzania, one of five countries in the world with the highest estimated number Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) births annually. She has dedicated the past two decades to research on treatment for the disease and working to influence health policies so that individuals across Africa can access vital diagnostic tests and medicines. She is trying to establish life-changing interventions including blood transfusion and hydroxyurea, a medicine with strong effects on the bone marrowâ a step towards the treatment of Sickle Cell Disease. Now she is researching a cure using gene therapy. Sickle cell disease research in Tanzania will have a significant impact in raising awareness about a disease that affects many people in Africa and the achievements made to improve healthcare. Lisa Mandemaker is leading the team building a prototype artificial womb, in collaboration with the MÃ¡xima Medical Centre in Holland. It is hoped the wombs will replace incubators for babies within the next 10 years. Social designer Lisa sees design as a tool for debate, to challenge assumptions, question or excite. The beginning of life slowly becomes a domain that we can design, and everyone should be part of the discussion on how we design this. At 16, Jamie co-founded the Zero Hour movement, using social media to organise the first youth climate change marches in 25 cities, including Washington DC. She has since testified before the US Congress alongside Greta Thunberg. The future must be decolonised and re-connected to the ancient wisdom of the Earth we once cherished. Climate change is a man-made problem, which is why women should rule the world. A formidable leader of the Afro-Colombian community, Francia MÃ¡rquez spearheaded a 10-day, 350-mile women's march to the country's capital, to take back their ancestral land from illegal gold miners. After 22 days of protests on the streets, the Colombian government agreed to stem illegal mining in the mountainous region of La Toma. The human rights and environmental activist has faced death threats over her actions, which won her the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize. My hope is that human consciousness is being raised to understand that we are not masters of nature, we are part of it, and so we must take care of it, in the same way that it takes care of us. After being upskirted at a music festival, Gina Martin launched a campaign to make upskirting illegal in England and Wales. The law was changed this year after an 18-month legal fight. Four men have been convicted under the new legislation so far. Prosecutors say all of the victims were ""simply going about their business on public transport, shopping or attending events when they were targeted"". I spend my time wondering what society would look like if we cared about the things that don't directly affect us. My hope is that, in my lifetime, I get to see that. Sarah is one of Scotland's leading gynaecologists. As a senior lecturer in reproductive medicine at the University of Dundee, she has focused on solving male infertility, to try to stop women being subjected to unnecessary and invasive fertility treatments. I hope that we can harness science, technology, investment and innovation in male reproductive health to redress global inequalities and the current burden of fertility on women. Singer Raja Meziane's political music video Allo le SystÃ¨me! has been viewed more than 35 million times on YouTube. Her anti-government songs tackling social injustice, alleged corruption and inequality have seen her forced into exile from Algeria. Now based in Prague, she is a vocal supporter of Algeria's protests in 2019, which have seen tens of thousands of young people taking to the streets calling for change. To those who oppose us, we say, 'Strike the woman, and you strike the rock'. (Winnie Mandela) Hailed as 'India's space woman', spaceship designer Susmita founded India's first space start-up. A passionate climate action advocate, she uses her business to help monitor and understand climate change from space. I fear that in three to four generations our home planet will not be very habitable anymore. I hope that humanity will wake up to a Greta-esque urgency for climate action. When Benedicte looked around the Democratic Republic of Congo, she could see plenty of raw produce from potato to passionfruit, but still people were living in food poverty. She says supermarkets were full of products originally grown in DR Congo, but exported out, processed with preservatives, before being reimported at expensive prices. She founded Surprise Tropical, a food canteen serving healthy, takeaway food in the suburbs of the capital, Kinshasa. Five years on, the company's online business delivers fresh produce throughout the city. The future belongs to those who see the opportunities behind what others see as problems or frustrations. Based at the International Center for Research on Women, Subhalakshmi has spent over 15 years working to improve gender equality in Asia. Her focus is the rights of women farmers, ending violence against women and improving women's education. My hope for the future is that women will no longer be invisible and uncounted. Women themselves will be organised and will better articulate the work that they do to uphold the entire economy and society. Government data and policy will also respond to the reality of women's work, both paid and unpaid. Trang Nguyen grew up in Vietnam, confronted from a young age with monkeys chained up for sale on the streets and bears held to extract bile for traditional medicine. So she obtained a PhD in Biodiversity Management, and set up WildAct, a non-profit organisation which helps authorities monitor illegal wildlife trade markets. In 2018, it launched the country's first ever master's course in Combating Illegal Wildlife Trade, to help train the next generation of conservationists. People need to put aside their prejudices and work together to gain a better understanding of the issues of conservation and create solutions for the problems that will be effective and long lasting. For the future of nature conservation, it is important that women's voices are heard and their actions are recognised. Van is co-founder of the Will to Live Center, which provides training for disabled people in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. Her aim is to create an equal working environment for all. She also runs social enterprise Imagator, which employs 80 people, half of whom have a disability. I wish the environment in Vietnam enabled people with talent and devotion to develop, instead of people feeling like they need to move abroad to use their skills. Natasha is a yogini, a female master practitioner of yoga and wellness coach. The body positivity influencer often opens up about her traumatic childhood on social media, after losing her mother at the age of three and being the victim of child abuse. My hopes for the future are that we live in an empowered world for every human being. Equal opportunities and equal basic liberties...everyone working to improve their emotional intelligence and their intelligence quotient. So empathic and consciously aware humans are created. This year, aged 29, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress. She grew up in the Bronx and volunteered as a campaigner in the 2016 Presidential elections. Against all the odds, she defeated a veteran congressman in the June 2018 primaries, and has since been dubbed the future of the Democratic party. Her trademark look is no accident â she chose red lipstick and hoops for her swearing in ceremony so that ânext time someone tells Bronx girls to take off their hoops, they can just say they're dressing like a Congresswoman.â We are fighting for a future where no person is left behind. When people want to stop talking about the issues that black women face, trans women face, immigrant women face, we've got to ask them, âWhy does that make you so uncomfortable?' Because it's not just about identity, this is about justice. Everyone deserves justice. Nicknamed 'the golden fish', in 2017 Farida became the first woman in Egypt to win a medal when she claimed bronze in the 50m butterfly at the FINA World Aquatics Championships. She won another bronze this year. She gives lectures at universities to inspire the younger generation to pursue swimming, and is training to fulfill her ambition of winning a medal at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. My hope for the future is to have more female athletes excel at their sport in order to represent Egypt well internationally. I want them to believe in their dreams and do whatever it takes until it becomes a reality. Ashcharya Peiris was on her way home from work at a bank in Sri Lanka when a bomb blast left her blind in 2000. She lost her job to her disability, but ended up fulfilling her dream of becoming a fashion designer by describing her designs to a seamstress. She was a finalist in Sri Lanka's Up & Coming Fashion Designer competition, and is now a motivational speaker in garment factories, inspiring young women to follow their own dreams. Trials and tribulations in life are nothing but disguised blessings that empower you to achieve your goals. Fashion designer Danit once found herself at a conference with nothing to wear, so quickly designed a skirt on her laptop and 3D-printed it. She wants all women to have the same option. Her entirely 3D-printed collection has been showcased by Vogue and US supermodel Tyra Banks. In the future, I hope technology improves, and women will be able to choose sustainable but still fashionable garments when they get dressed in the morning. Autumn Peltier has been campaigning for clean drinking water for indigenous people in Canada since she was just eight years old. This year, at 14, she was named Chief Water Commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation, taking on the role from her great-aunt Josephine Mandamin. One day I will be an ancestor, and I want my great-grandchildren to know I advocated for them so they can have clean drinking water and have a future. Swietenia founded the Divers Clean Action Foundation to clear marine debris in Indonesia. They now have 1,500 volunteers working across the island nation and South East Asia. She also initiated the #nostrawmovement campaign in the country, which saw the reduction of single-use plastic straws in more than 700 restaurants. Youth are the agents of change, and create change faster, whilst women are the agents in each household, who will make eco-friendly decisions for future generations. Megan Rapinoe is a two-time World Cup winner and co-captain of the US Women's National Team. She led the team to victory in the 2019 Women's World Cup, scoring some of the biggest goals of the tournament. She was named Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. Megan is a vocal advocate for equality in soccer, taking legal action against the US Soccer Federation over equal pay, calling out racism by fans and has become the face of LGBTQ rights in the game. If everybody was as outraged about racism as those who suffer it, if everybody was as outraged about homophobia as LGBTQ players, if everybody was as outraged about the lack of equal pay as women, that would be the most inspiring thing for the future to me. Onjali Rauf was recovering from life-saving surgery when the idea for her first book came to her. Inspired by a real-life meeting between herself and a refugee mother in Calais, The Boy at the Back of the Class is a child's perspective on the refugee crisis and won the Waterstones Children's Book Prize 2019. She is also founder of Making Herstory, which seeks to end the abuse, enslavement and trafficking of women and girls in the UK and beyond. The future for us women seems both a beautiful and a precarious thing. Beautiful because in so many ways, untold stories of just how much women have been sacrificed at the altar of male progression are finally seeing the light of day. But the advancements are fragile too â with outright misogynists and abusers still in seats of power and women still battling wars that our great-grandmothers were battling too. As a graduate student, Charlene Ren created MyH2O, a solution to the lack of clean drinking water in rural China. Now her non-profit platform has created a nationwide water information mapping network, training locals and students to do their own testing so water organisations know where to take action and which communities are in need. The gender ratios are extremely biased in the NGO sector - significantly more women have chosen to serve in a sector that receives minimal funding, resources and acknowledgement yet [they] strive to create a better and inclusive future. Maria Ressa is an award-winning journalist from the Philippines who set up website Rappler to expose fake news. She has received rape and death threats online for being an outspoken critic of President Duterte's violent war on drugs, and has been arrested twice this year accused of 'cyber libel'. Ms Ressa is being represented by human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. For the next generation, the battle is going to be the battle for truth. What's happening to us in the Philippines isn't unique â we are just the canary in the coal mine. You have to shine the light, you have to speak, you have to say what is happening. Writer Djamila Ribeiro is one of the most influential figures in the Afro-Brazilian women's rights movement. Her work focuses on themes including black feminism, racism, and female empowerment. She is founder of the Sueli Carneiro's Seal initiative, which publishes black writers' works at affordable prices. To think about the future, first it's necessary to recognise past mistakes. Only by facing colonialism and its consequences, will it be possible to co-exist with dignity Jawahir Roble is the UK's first Muslim, black, female, hijab-wearing referee. Having come to the UK from Somalia at the age of ten, she discovered a passion for sports which led her to become a referee. She now studies football coaching and management, hoping to complete her degree in 2020. I have two dreams: one day to referee in the Women's World Cup Final and to get as many girls as possible playing football. I urge more women to participate and take up refereeing Professor Saliba is conducting world-leading research on polluted air. She grew up on her family's farm in rural Lebanon, but when civil war prompted a move to the city, she was awakened to the disturbing realities of air pollution. After watching relatives, friends and colleagues develop health complications as a result of exposure to toxic substances in the environment, she hopes her innovative work with a Beirut university will make it possible to address some of the most pressing environmental challenges. Like the positive and negative dipoles defining a chemical bond, and the yin and the yang staging the balance in nature, women and men must co-reign to solve our current and future environmental threats. Nanjira leads the World Wide Web Foundation in its bid to increase digital equality. She looks for solutions to ensure nobody is left behind when it comes to web access, whether disadvantaged by gender or geography. My hope is that we see it happen more and more, and not only when women are 'given' positions to fulfil diversity quotas or clean up messes. We have a ways to go for 'The Female Future' to unleash its true potential to heal the world. Biophysicist Zehra Sayers has been hailed as a beacon of hope for the Middle East (Nature journal) for her success in her contribution to bringing scientists from eight Middle Eastern countries together. During her 15-year tenure as chair of the Science Advisory Committee of SESAME project, she worked with a group of scientists including those from Israel, Palestine, Turkey and Cyprus, under the same roof to found a CERN-like laboratory. She shared the prestigious 2019 Award for Science Diplomacy for the feat. I am very happy to see young female scientists at SESAME today, either as staff members or as users. I believe that SESAME provides several opportunities for women from the Middle East to make their research more visible and their voice better heard. At 16, Hayfa founded not-for-profit Entrcrush, an online platform for future entrepreneurs where they could be matched with donors, and take e-courses in areas like management and accounting. She works with the UN in Tunisia on gender equality initiatives. One day, I want to wake up to find gender equality is real. I will stay out late that night; I will wear whatever I want to, without worrying about being harassed. I will be free to live by myself if I want to; I will earn as much as a man. Computer scientist Noor Shaker left Syria for Europe in 2008 to follow her passion for Artificial Intelligence. After a successful decade in academia, she turned her skills toward entrepreneurial innovation. Motivated by her mother's fight against cancer, Shaker was compelled to bring her knowledge of AI to the medical world. The result is a ground-breaking technique using AI to design new medicines faster than humans. Her work has attracted the attention of some of the top global pharmaceutical companies, and she has been named one of MIT's 'Innovators under 35'. Algorithms can now autonomously improve and provide augmented capabilities for innovation in ways never possible before. This will empower the next generations with tools for early detection and prevention of deadly diseases leading to longer and healthier lives. Inspired by her mum's determination to obtain a degree despite pressure to become a housewife, Bonita Sharma helps educate and empower women and girls in her native Nepal. In a bid to tackle child deaths to malnutrition, she designed Nutribeads, a bracelet for new mums with different coloured beads to remind them what to feed their babies. Her projects have been awarded funding from the UNESCO Malala Fund,  and she has founded her own organisation to empower women and girls: The Social Changemakers and Innovators. There are people in the world who are facing the devastating consequences of inequality in health, education and nutrition right now, and there are women and girls who are working relentlessly to change this status quo. I hope every woman and girl will have an opportunity to reach their full potential in life without any discrimination. In the 1970s, she was part of a movement of women who threw their arms around trees to prevent them being felled - the original 'tree-huggers'. Now a world-renowned environmental leader and winner of the Alternative Nobel Peace Prize, the 'ecofeminist' sees women as the custodians of nature. I hope that women will lead a transition away from catastrophe and collapse, and sow the seeds of our common future. When qualified doctor Pragati Singh started researching asexuality, she received messages from women who didn't want to have sex but were facing an arranged marriage. So she began organising meet-ups for people looking for non-sexual relationships. She now runs Indian Aces, an online community for asexual people. It's time we try increasingly inculcating *feminine* characteristics in our feminism - less 'strong', more 'empathetic'. Lawyer Lyubov Sobol investigates alleged corruption in Russia, documenting her work through social media and a YouTube channel with over a million subscribers. She and other opposition candidates were banned from standing in local elections in Moscow this summer, sparking demonstrations by tens of thousands of young people. To be honest, I don't really think about the future. We live in an unpredictable country. Anything can happen here. But in some long-term perspective I do believe that we will win. We will defend our country. Russia will be free and happy. Samah is a lawyer who has worked tirelessly in difficult circumstances since the war in Yemen started in 2015. She provides legal support to families whose children have 'disappeared'. This year her team at Mwatana for Human Rights managed to reunite some of these families, though she continues to advocate for the release and education of many more children still in detention. The time will come when people will be convinced in the pointlessness of wars. Then change will come, including legislative changes in terms of the rights of women specifically and Yemeni people in general. Self-taught screenwriter Kalista Sy's TV series Mistress of a Married Man sent shock waves through her home country when it was released earlier this year. Dubbed 'Senegal's Sex and the City', the viral sensation features sexually liberated, hard-working and successful female characters who address the struggles of women in West Africa, from polygamy to domestic abuse and mental health issues. Despite everything that women go through, despite all the mistakes they had to make, despite all the 'you can't do this', they know they can rise up, and be the best version of themselves - because the future will not be drawn without them. This summer, 22-year-old actress and director Bella Thorne released her own topless photos after a hacker threatened to leak them, saying, âIt's my decision now, you don't get to take another thing from me.â Bella, who has just directed her first porn film, says the abuse of women online can only change if more female content creators are involved in projects that celebrate sexuality. The female future for me is finally having equality. Women feel this pressure to say 'yes', like it's instinctual. I think that the female future is finally not having to do that anymore. Veronique Thouvenot leads the Zero Mothers Die initiative. It aims to save the lives of pregnant women and their babies through tech, providing women with mobile phones and health information by text. It is run by the Millennia2025 Foundation, of which Dr. Thouvenot is co-founder and scientific director. Help save women's lives with Zero Mothers Die! In August 2018, 15-year-old Greta Thunberg skipped school to protest outside the Swedish parliament. What started as a one-person strike has since spread to a worldwide protest over climate change. Her actions have mobilised activists across the world, with millions of young people taking part in Fridays for Future. This year, she travelled by solar-powered boat from Europe to the United States - an epic journey undertaken to encourage others to reduce their carbon footprint. She has also opened up about her diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome, saying ""given the right circumstances, being different can be a superpower"". We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people. And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Self-taught computer programmer Paola helped reverse 20,000 racially-biased drugs convictions by developing Data for Justice, a tool with an interactive map comparing police activity in white and minority neighborhoods. She won the MIT Innovators Under 35 Latam award for the project. There's still time to use data and technology to redistribute power among those that have been historically forgotten. If we don't do so now, data and tech will only automate the status quo and all the biases and inequalities that currently exist. At 95, poet Ida Vitale is winner of the Cervantes Prize, the most prestigious literary award in the Spanish-speaking world. Only the fifth woman to win the prize, she is the last surviving member of the important Uruguayan art movement known as the Generation of '45. She ends one of her most famous poems, Fortune, with the line ""To be human and a woman, no more, no less."" To have been able to speak and walk freely, and existed without mutilation, and entered churches, or not, and read, heard music that is dear to me, to have been at night a being, as in the light of day. (Fortune, 2005) Purity is a modern day 'senga'. The role traditionally sees aunt-figures training brides-to-be in how to sexually satisfy their husbands. But Purity wants to shake-up the role, helping Ugandan women feel empowered in their relationships. She is calling for all women to have legal rights in marriage. Freedom for women is the salvation of future generations. We cannot continue to live in the past. We need to be loud - there are few women who speak up because they fear the judgement of society. Let's teach these girls to love themselves and believe in themselves. Best-known for becoming New Zealand's youngest member of parliament in 1975 aged 23, Marilyn Waring is a pioneer of feminist economics, and author of the groundbreaking Counting for Nothing, which highlighted the value of womens' unpaid work. An environmental activist, she was also instrumental in the passing of New Zealand's nuclear-free policy. What we decide to measure now is what we will prioritise in the futureâ, âUnderneath the numbers, a philosophical judgement is always being made based on values, not facts."" (Still Counting, by Marilyn Waring) Amy Webb is a futurist who advises government leaders and the CEOs of some of the world's largest companies on how to prepare for complex futures. In 2015, she decided to make all of her research open source, freely available to the public. Our ideas about the future are shaped by our own upbringings, world views and cognitive biases. One reason for humanity's continued struggles is our conflicting visions of how the future should look. The solution to that struggle is inclusivity. Sara Wesslin is a Skolt Sami journalist. The Sami are the only indigenous people in the EU. Realising two of Finland's three Sami languages were on the brink of extinction, Sara successfully lobbied Finland's education minister to provide funds for Sami language teaching. She is one of only two journalists broadcasting in the Skolt Sami language in the world. I feel it that Skolt Samis are moving forward. We are very proud of our culture, we are very proud of every single language speaker. I think it's going to be a very powerful culture still, even though we are a minority. Having studied everything from megachurch social media use to whether women are more religious than men, Gina Zurlo is an expert in religion statistics.

My pimp branded me with a 'Love is Loyalty' tattooVideoVideoUnsigned singer who became sound of a revolutionThe real (and fake) sex lives of Bella ThorneVideoVideo," The former sex slavestransforming their tattoos By Elaine Jung    Warning: Some readers may find some of these details upsetting For 17 years, Hollie was forced to sleep with countless men by several pimps. Four years ago, she finally escaped from sex trafficking. One of her traffickers, she says, branded her with a tattoo which read  “Love is Loyalty”. It’s what he did to most of the women who worked for him - either that or  “Love is Royalty”. “He wants to put his name on you. Like a keepsake - like you’re his possession. Everybody knows you’re his bitch,” she says. Hollie, 36, was sold into sex slavery at 15 years old, after a childhood of deprivation and abuse. Despite this difficult start in life, Hollie says she initially excelled in school. “It was an escape from my reality. In first grade, there was a teacher with the same last name as me. I used to pretend she was my mother because I longed for a relationship with my [real] mother.” Unable to cope, Hollie’s mother gave her to her own parents to be looked after. “I remember being called ‘a hooker’, ‘a whore’, ‘a worthless piece of shit like my mother’, before I even knew what any of these things meant.” Hollie says that from the age of 12 she was smoking marijuana every day at home, before quickly moving on to harder drugs. “It was my ‘normal’ - that was just what my life was like.” She says she was in and out of juvenile detention centres for misdemeanours like truancy and underage drinking, before finally running away from one at 15 to go back to live with her mother. “It was one of the worst decisions of my life because within two weeks of being there, we were using drugs together. Within a month we were prostituting together.” Hollie says that at a point at which she was vulnerable and tired of being exploited by her mother, she was targeted by a man who asked her to join his team of sex workers. “It looked glamorous - he had fancy jewellery, nice shoes, nice clothes, lots of money and women all around him. It looked like he took care of them and got drugs whenever they wanted it. So, I did it. I joined his team and I entered into hell.” What followed, Hollie says, were years of violence, sexual abuse and death threats. “By the time I was 17 or 18 I had been raped more times than I can count. I’d been kidnapped. I’d been held hostage, stabbed and shot at.” The environment Hollie was working in was extremely violent, and rape is often used by gangs to exert control over their trafficking victims. So for Hollie, the tattoos forced upon her to show her loyalty to the gang became more than just undesirable adornments. They became symbols of years of trauma. Hollie’s finger tattoo - before and after After her escape, she heard about a charity called Survivor’s Ink - which covers  branding tattoos of sex trafficking survivors for free. She went along to choose a design to cover up the “Love is Loyalty” tattoo at the top of her back. “It’s a flower blossoming into a butterfly, soaring into freedom. Because I feel free now. I have the choice to make decisions on my life and where I move next. I never had that before. Somebody was always controlling me like a puppet. And today, nobody controls me.” Hollie’s new back tattoo   Warning: Some readers may find some of these details upsetting For 17 years, Hollie was forced to sleep with countless men by several pimps.

I have the choice to make decisions on my life and where I move next. I never had that before. Somebody was always controlling me like a puppet. And today, nobody controls me.” Hollie’s new back tattoo    Mike Prickett, the tattoo artist who transformed Hollie’s “branding”, says he has been shocked by the number of times he’s been called on to carry out this type of work. “Human trafficking was one of those things that was never really on my radar. It was something that you saw on the news that happened in other countries - not in your backyard.” He has also noticed a disturbing development. “Probably in the past year and a half to two years, [branding tattoos] have become a lot bigger. When I first started, the brandings were maybe a softball size. Now I get more stuff that takes up to five sessions [to cover] rather than just one.” Mike Prickett at work Survivor’s Ink estimates that almost 90% of sex trafficking victims in the US are branded in this way. The charity has overseen the de-branding of about 200 women from Columbus - Ohio’s state capital - and the surrounding area alone. While the most common are tattoos of crowns, dollar bags, gang signs or the words “property of” [followed by the gang name or gangmaster involved], many tattoos are unique to a trafficker-victim relationship. Mary Fischer, who manages Survivor’s Ink, says the tattoos are an abuse tactic. “It’s a demoralising mark to show ownership, a control mechanism to try to convince the victim that their body is not their own: ‘I own your body, I can do whatever I want to your body.’ “I couldn’t believe how many people actually tattooed a name and ‘property’ underneath it. That was very shocking to me.” She says in some cases the tattoos are forced on the women, but sometimes the women themselves want to get them done to prove their loyalty to their pimp, either to give them protection on the streets or as a means of retaining or regaining basic provisions from their gangmaster. “They [the pimps] start out by showing [the women in their gang] a bunch of love, and then they take it away and make them compete to be able to gain just a little bit of that attention back.” Mike says the most upsetting tattoo he has transformed was one of two devils having sex across the lower back of another sex trafficking survivor called Jen. Jen had it replaced shortly after she escaped trafficking in 2015, with a vivid bouquet of flowers - a process that took four long agonising sessions.  Jen's new lower back tattoo She says she assumes her trafficker thought the tattoo would help him make more money. “I guess he thought it would be funny, thought it would be cute.”   For Jeffrey Bagley, a convicted sex trafficker at the Noble Correctional Institution in Ohio, money certainly seems to have been a motivator. Bagley would sell women for at least $125 (£97) a time – with some women meeting up to 12 clients per day. At one point, he was pimping out as many as 50 women. Bagley was convicted in April with another man, Curtis Gossett, for trafficking women and using drugs to control them. Gossett was sentenced to 13 years in jail, Bagley was given 10 years. “Recruiting” women took place on the streets and in some cases directly from jail, Bagley says. He bought a publication at a local shop each week which listed new female prisoners and the offence they had been charged with. He says he would then visit those who had been convicted of soliciting for sex, offering to pay their bail if they agreed to work for him.  The women would then be taken to a hairstylist, given make-up, body products, designer clothes and meals, he says, to make them look good for the photos that were then used to sell them. “We’d get them clothes from [lingerie shop] Victoria’s Secret or wherever. We had a certain house where they could just go sit for a few weeks and get healthy again and eat. “And then after a few weeks, it was time to go to work,” says Bagley. He says that usually the women were advertised on Backpage.com - an online marketplace for selling and buying sex, which was shut down by the FBI in April 2018. Women were also moved across Ohio to be sold during major sporting events like the Kentucky Derby, Bagley says. Hotels near airports were also magnets, “because a lot of our clients were CEOs of big companies that would come in”. The only regret Bagley expresses is for getting caught. He claims the women who worked for him could have stopped whenever they wanted to but he provided them with “the best drugs”. Jeffrey Bagley  “I was pretty much in the same boat they were in. I was getting high just like they were. I did it for the drugs just like they did.” Some 83% of sex trafficking victims in the US are US citizens according to the country’s Department of Justice. The average age of a first-time victim in America is between 12 and 14 years old, according to ECPAT-USA, an NGO seeking to end the exploitation of children. In the US, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act defines sex trafficking as coercing or forcing people into offering commercial sex or recruiting any child under the age of 18 to do so. Polaris, a US project working to eradicate modern slavery, says its National Human Trafficking Hotline received reports of 34,700 sex trafficking cases within the country between 2007 and 2017.  And approximately 3,000 under-age girls are at risk of being trafficked at any given time across Ohio, according to Scott Arnold, executive director of Gracehaven, a Columbus safe house for child victims of sex trafficking. “The first stage happens in their home,” he says. “It can be a mom who is drug addicted and needs to pay for her addiction. It can also be moms who bring men into their home, whether it’s the father - or more often than not a boyfriend - who begin to molest the child and then things go from there. “Another typical path would be a young person who is in relational strain with their family. There could be violence or just an unhappy home life. And so that kid is at risk [of grooming by] an older man who shows up in her life and begins to act and behave like he’s romantically interested. “These kids desperately need help now. Nearly every prostitute that we see was a child once that was trafficked against her will and manipulated into a life. When you see it that way, suddenly you’re horrified on a whole new level.” He says that in countries like the US, because being a sex worker is mostly seen as a choice, there isn’t the sense of crisis about sex trafficking in the public sphere that there should be. “They [the public and the authorities] see the movie Pretty Woman and they think, ‘Wow that’s just a life choice of a person who could choose to get out of at any time.’ That’s just not the way it is.” Hollie says there is also a misguided notion that trafficking is a crime that only takes place across international borders, or as a result of abduction. Despite almost a lifetime of being abused, manipulated and traumatised, Hollie eventually managed to escape her final trafficker. Physically leaving, however, wasn’t the main challenge she says. “I never identified as a human trafficking victim.” She instead describes feeling a “trauma bond” to her traffickers. She says [of one of the men involved]: “I felt like he took care of me even though he would beat me and I’d wake up to him raping me.” She says she even felt love for him at times. “He was there for so long and probably one of the very few people in my life that had been consistent.” Charities tackling human trafficking say a number of trafficking victims display the symptoms of so-called Stockholm syndrome - apsychological conditionin which kidnap victims form an emotional attachment to their captors. Hollie was in and out of jail nearly 50 times on charges of soliciting for sex and drug possession, and during her final spell in prison she began attending a counselling group. She says it gave her a powerful insight into how she might be able to start her life again. “We were going through power, control and manipulation one day, and all these things that these abusers and traffickers are doing to their victims [and] I identified. It was like a light clicked on for me and the fog was removed from my eyes, and I was able to make a choice. I empowered myself.” She heard about a programme in Columbus called Catch [Changing Actions to Change Habits] Court that helps sex trafficking survivors. “While I was sitting in jail I wrote to Catch and asked them if they could save my life.”    Catch Court is a government-funded programme run by the Franklin County Court in Columbus. It redefines women jailed for prostitution or crimes committed for their trafficker as victims and offers them a voluntary path to healing and recovery. That involves two years of intensive probation, requiring a sober home, medically-supported addiction treatment and trauma therapy. Catch Court was set up in 2009 by Judge Paul Herbert, after he noticed a trend in defendants on prostitution charges showing visible signs of abuse. Of over 1,000 women arrested for prostitution in Columbus, Judge Herbert found 92% of them qualified as trafficking victims. He says that while prostitution is often referred to as the world’s oldest profession, for him it’s “the world's oldest oppression of women and girls and vulnerable populations”. Each week for Catch, the women on the programme must report to Courtroom 12C in Columbus to update Judge Herbert on their progress. It’s a day for affirmations, accountability, and celebrating breakthroughs - however small. Over lunch there is laughter and chatter – it’s clear new friendships are forged here. “We are going to love you until you love yourself,” is a phrase that is often passed between them. Women in Catch Court The proceedings are generally informal. Judge Herbert opts for pink shirts rather than his courtroom robe, motivational speakers attend, and he says he tends to “take a step back”. “By the time the handcuffs come off, we’re hoping that [the trafficking survivor] looks forward to coming to court and being part of that camaraderie,” he says. Catch Court says its recidivism rate is much lower than the national average. Judge Herbert attributes much of this to rigorous trauma therapy. “A woman is using drugs to medicate her trauma and then she winds up having to sell her body to get the drugs to medicate the trauma. We found that once you settle that trauma down, they don’t want to use drugs any more. The trauma is at the root of their drug addiction, rather than their drug addiction driving everything.” Sex workers receive care packages  Hollie left prison in 2015 on Christmas Day. “It was my birthday, and it was the first day of my brand-new life. I haven’t looked back since I did intense trauma therapy and intense drug treatment. I did that for a year and focused only on getting my life together.” Early on in her recovery, Hollie became involved in a non-profit organisation called Reaching for the Shining Starz, that hands out weekly care packages to possible victims of sex trafficking. She quickly became its executive director.  The first time she went out with the group to volunteer, she noticed a young woman asleep on a street corner in the freezing cold. Handing her a care package, she realised with horror that it was her younger sister Rosie. “Tears just started flowing,” she says. “It was the first time I had seen her in a year and a half and it was the most horrifying thing. The last time I’d seen her, she was about 100 pounds heavier and looked so vibrant and beautiful. The woman in front of me had pock marks all over her face, track marks all over her arm, was soaking wet and had a black eye. “I felt like I caused this because my mother brought me into the lifestyle, I was in the lifestyle, I probably made it look really glamorous and I brought her into the lifestyle. And I brought her into her own living hell.” Like Hollie, most of Rosie’s childhood had been one of abuse and being trafficked. Hollie visited Rosie each week to hand her a care package. It took more than a year of gentle persuasion before Rosie decided to leave her destructive life behind. “I felt trapped and I honestly thought that I wasn’t going to make it out. I thought that I was going to die out here on these streets and that’s really what I believed. Today I'm just amazed with how far I’ve come,” Rosie says, smiling. Rosie and Hollie  Rosie, now 27, graduated from Catch Court in September and is working at Freedom a la Cart, a catering company that only employs survivors of sex trafficking. The sisters have moved in together and spend time with each other most weekends. “She’s my best friend and my little sister, and I missed not having her in my life for so long,” says Hollie.   Hollie secured a scholarship to study communications at Ohio State University and is now considering a law degree. For now she is back in court – not as a criminal but as a legal advocate for victims of domestic violence at the prosecutor’s office. She describes it as her “greatest opportunity” and notes the irony. “Five years ago I was being prosecuted and sentenced to prison, and today I work for and with prosecutors,” she laughs. She also volunteers in Judge Herbert’s courtroom and continues to mingle with fellow survivors. And she is planning another tattoo - a starfish. She says it is a reference to a story, originally written by anthropologist and  natural science writer Loren Eiseley, about a little boy on a beach where hundreds of starfish have washed ashore. As he picks them up and throws them back into the sea, an adult comes over to remind him that he can’t save them all. “He picks up another and throws it back saying: ‘Well I just saved that one’. “If I’ve made a difference in one person’s world - that’s all that matters to me. I can’t save the world. I’ll probably never end human trafficking, but my intention is to get plenty of people to rally around me so that I can make a dent.” Watch the documentary:Surviving Sex Trafficking Broadcast times onBBC World News: Sat 7 Dec 2019 - 0910 GMT Sun 8 Dec 2019 - 1510 GMT  Hollie is one of the BBC’s 100 Women of 2019.

The real (and fake) sex lives of Bella ThorneVideoVideo,"Earlier this week, actress Bella Thorne announced that she would be working with the pornography-sharing site, Pornhub, to keep it free of ""revenge porn"". This is the story behind that announcement. Bella Thorne starts crying. One of her dogs, Ma, an Australian Shepherd, scampers around her ankles to show her concern. We've talked about slut-shaming, depression, bullying on social media, and how she has become one of the most deepfaked actresses, appearing now in thousands of faked pornographic videos. ""Just talking about the world in this way makes me so sad,"" she says, ""It makes me hate it."" But none of this is what triggers her tears. We're sitting on the deck of her rented waterfront home in Sudbury, Ontario. It's a quiet, maple-leaf-strewn town on the cusp of autumn, and Thorne has been here for three months filming Girl, with Mickey Rourke, in which she plays a young woman who has returned to her sleepy home town to kill her abusive father. It's been a year in which the 22-year-old has bared her soul to the world. She released her first book, The Life Of A Wannabe Mogul: Mental Disarray - a series of darkly personal poems that centre around despair, isolation and sexual assault. She touches on the raw grief of losing her father in a motorbike accident at the age of nine and her career as a child model, growing up under a dazzling spotlight, and then being propelled into a Disney Channel sitcom (Shake It Up, where Zendaya was her co-star). And she contemplates her need for romantic attention and her much-written-about pansexual lifestyle. ""Was it because I was molested my whole life? / exposed to sex at such a young age that feels the most natural to offer the world?"" The anthology, in which she consciously leaves words misspelt, stayed on the Amazon best-seller list for weeks after publication. Bella Thorne is among the BBC'smost inspiring and influential women of 2019- giving us their vision of a female-led future. It was during the emotionally draining press tour for the book, in June of this year, that Bella received a slew of text messages from a number she didn't recognise. ""I'm getting out of an interview and I'm already crying, talking about the book, and I look at my phone and then I just see a few nudes of me,"" she recalls. Staring at the intimate photos that she had once sent a former lover, Bella was stunned. She called her manager and agent seeking advice. Then her phone pinged again. More topless photos. This time of some of her famous friends. It was early in the morning and she was in bed. In her book Bella had detailed the sexual abuse she had endured as a child - omitting the identity of her perpetrator - and explained how her fear of not being believed stopped her from reporting the crime. Looking at the topless pictures, a familiar feeling of violation washed over her. ""Here it is again,"" she thought. ""Someone else that has my life right in their hands and is able to make these decisions for me. Here it is again. Someone again forcing my hand to do something I don't want to do when it involves sexual stuff."" So she made a decision. Using her social media platforms - seven million followers on Twitter, 22 million on Instagram and nine million on Facebook - she released the topless pictures herself, along with screenshots of the threatening text message from the hacker, and her own message. ""I'm putting this out because it's MY DECISION NOW U DON'T GET TO TAKE YET ANOTHER THING FROM ME."" It was a polarising choice. Whoopi Goldberg, who appears on American chat show The View, reprimanded Thorne, not for for releasing the pictures but taking them in the first place. ""If you're famous, I don't care how old you are. You don't take nude pictures of yourself,"" Goldberg said, during a panel discussion on her programme, ""Once you take that picture, it goes into the cloud and it's available to any hacker who wants it, and if you don't know that in 2019 that this is an issue, I'm sorry."" Thorne responded to Goldberg on Instagram, tearfully calling her comments, ""sick and honestly disgusting"". ""It hurt more coming from a woman I admire,"" says Thorne. ""People say, 'No no my kids never do that. Oh no.'"" Her message for these people is this: ""You never choose to really look inside your own homeâ¦ Every single person shares some kind of affection online."" She adds that publicly shaming young people for behaving in this way, when they are already feeling humiliated and vulnerable, could push them further towards a mental health crisis. ""If a photo had been released of a young girl or guy and it was going round their school, and they felt suicidal, they'd watch an interview like that and think, 'Oh, ok, I do deserve this,'"" she says. These photographs that she released herself were the first genuine topless pictures of Bella Thorne to appear online. However, there are many, many sexually explicit Bella Thorne videos - none of which are actually of her. They aredeepfakes, made by expertly superimposing her face on to the body of an actor engaging in sex, and manipulating the image to make Thorne appear to say whatever the creators want her to. One particular video disturbingly takes audio from a recording of Thorne crying about her dead father, whom she misses deeply, and edits her face on to a video of a woman masturbating. ""This video is going around and everyone really is thinking that it is actually me,"" she tells the BBC. ""And then they put the subtitles, 'Daddy, Daddy!'"" This video can not be played Actress Bella Thorne opens up about her experience of deepfake abuse Software developers have told the BBC that the technology to make deepfake videos from just a single photograph will be available to the general public in less than a year. This worries Bella. ""It's not going to just be used on your favourite celebrity,"" she says. ""That is a breeding ground for underage pornography."" She adds that such videos could be used as a form of revenge, blackmail or extortion against young women who, unlike her, do not have the digital platforms to expose them as fakes. It's at this point that we start talking about Thorne's debut as a director, the award-winning adult film Him and Her - and something unexpected happens. She says she decided to make the film because she thinks the industry needs more female directors, in order to change the type of stories told about female sexuality. Bella Thorne won an award for her directorial debut, an adult movie, at the 2019 Pornhub awards I then ask her to comment onthe recent BBC investigationwhich found that Pornhub, the site where she released the film, has been profiting from so-called revenge porn videos. It's evident that this is the first Thorne has heard of the BBC story and she is visibly shaken. ""I didn't know that,"" she says, tears suddenly falling. ""You attach yourself to things and you think you're making things better. I try and help and then somewhere along the line..."" Her voice breaks off. I ask her if she wants to add anything more about Pornhub later when she's had time to research. ""I don't want to be fake, so I'd rather you keep my first answer."" This interview is over. Mindgeek, the company that owns Pornhub, told the BBC: ""We seek to provide users with a safe space to share and consume content. The last thing we want is to undermine this by allowing revenge porn on our sites."" Back at the hotel a text comes through from Thorne's assistant inviting me to an event she is attending called Make Sure Your Friends are OK to destigmatise depression. It's a cause that is particularly important to her, and one she wants her fans - particularly the vulnerable ones - to know about. Three days later, I am at the event, a garden party in Beverly Hills. ""When I was first growing up there were only a few people you knew that were depressed, or like struggled with depression,"" she says. ""Now it's almost every single person you know. There has to be some reasoning behind it, and my reasoning is growing up in social media."" As I'm leaving the party, a friend of Thorne's tells us that she got straight on the phone to Pornhub after our interview, and says we should look out for an announcement. Allow Instagram content?

Later that week, Thorne picked up an award for her debut directorial adult film, Her & Him, at the Pornhub awards. She thanked the adult film industry for embracing her creative vision for more women directors in pornography, and then added a pointed message condemning revenge porn videos. ""I am working with Pornhub to implement a change in their flagging system algorithm, to ensure safety for everyone and everyone in our community.""

Masterpiece found in French kitchen fetches â¬24mThe painting was found hanging above a hotplate in an elderly woman's home in northern France.,"The painting had been hung above a hotplate in a kitchen in the French town of Compiegne A long-lost painting by a celebrated Italian artist that was found hanging in the kitchen of an elderly French woman has sold for â¬24m (Â£20m; $26.6m) at auction, setting a new record. Christ Mocked, by the pre-Renaissance artist Cimabue, was discovered last month in northern France. The painting was expected to fetch up to â¬6m at auction. But the winning bid far exceeded expectations, with the painting fetching four times the estimate. Long-lost artwork found in elderly woman's kitchen Painting stolen by Nazis found in museum by FBI Acteon Auction House said the sum, paid by an anonymous buyer from northern France, was a new world record for a medieval painting sold at auction. ""When a unique work of a painter as rare as Cimabue comes to market, you have to be ready for surprises,"" auctioneer Dominique Le Coent told Reuters news agency. For years, the painting hung above a hotplate in a kitchen in the city of CompiÃ¨gne. It was spotted by an auctioneer, who advised its owner to have it evaluated by experts. The owner believed it to be an old religious icon with little value. Tests were carried out on the artwork using infrared light to determine the similarities with works by the Italian painter Cimabue, also known as Cenni di Pepo. Born in the city of Florence, he was active in the late 13th and early 14th Centuries - a transitional figure between the stylised art of the medieval period and the more naturalistic works of the Renaissance.
